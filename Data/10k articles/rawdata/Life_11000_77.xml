== Biography ==
Abaan bin Uthman bin Affan was the son of [[Uthman ibn Affan]], the third Islamic [[caliph]]. His mother was Umm'Amr bint Jandab. He was the first historian to write the [[Prophetic biography|Maghazi]] of [[Muhammad]]. He was also a Scholar of Ahadith and Fiqh.

== Hadith Narration ==

Book 43, Number 5069: , 
Narrated Uthman ibn Affan:

Aban ibn Uthman said: I heard Uthman ibn Affan (his father) say: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: If anyone says three times: "In the name of Allah, when Whose name is mentioned nothing on Earth or in Heaven can cause harm, and He is the Hearer, the Knower" he will not suffer sudden affliction till the morning, and if anyone says this in the morning, he will not suffer sudden affliction till the evening.

Aban was afflicted by some paralysis and when a man who heard the tradition began to look at him, he said to him: Why are you looking at me? I swear by Allah, I did not tell a lie about Uthman, nor did Uthman tell a lie about the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), but that day when I was afflicted by it, I became angry and forgot to say them.

'''Acid–base imbalance''' is an abnormality of the human body's normal [[acid–base homeostasis|balance of acids and bases]] that causes the [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[pH]] to deviate out of the normal range (7.35 to 7.45). In the [[fetus]], the normal range differs based on which umbilical vessel is sampled ([[umbilical vein]] pH is normally 7.25 to 7.45; [[umbilical artery]] pH is normally 7.18 to 7.38).&lt;ref name="Yeomans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeomans|first=ER|author2=Hauth, JC|author3= Gilstrap, LC III|author4= Strickland DM|title=Umbilical cord pH, PCO2, and bicarbonate following uncomplicated term vaginal deliveries (146 infants)|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol|year=1985|volume=151|issue=6|pages=798–800|pmid=3919587|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(85)90523-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can exist in varying levels of severity, some life-threatening.

==Classification==
[[Image:Davenport fig 10.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Davenport diagram]] illustrates acid–base imbalance graphically.]]
An excess of acid is called [[acidosis]] or acidemia and an excess in bases is called [[alkalosis]] or alkalemia. The process that causes the imbalance is classified based on the cause of the disturbance (respiratory or metabolic) and the direction of change in pH (acidosis or alkalosis). This yields the following four basic processes:
{| class="wikitable"
! process || [[pH]] || {{CO2|link=yes}}  || compensation
 |- 
 | {{ts|ar}} | [[metabolic acidosis]] || {{ts|ac}} |{{down}} || {{ts|ac}} | {{down}} || respiratory
 |- 
 | {{ts|ar}} | [[respiratory acidosis]] || {{ts|ac}} |{{down}} || {{ts|ac}} |{{up}} || renal
 |- 
 | {{ts|ar}} | [[metabolic alkalosis]] || {{ts|ac}} |{{up}} || {{ts|ac}} |{{up}} || respiratory
 |- 
 | {{ts|ar}} | [[respiratory alkalosis]] || {{ts|ac}} |{{up}} || {{ts|ac}} |{{down}} || renal
|}

===Mixed disorders===
The presence of only one of the above derangements is called a ''simple'' acid–base disorder. In a ''mixed'' disorder more than one is occurring at the same time.&lt;ref name="urlMixed Acid Base Disorders: Acid Base Tutorial, University of Connecticut Health Center"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Mixed_Acid_Base_Disorders.html| title= Mixed Acid Base Disorders: Acid Base Tutorial, University of Connecticut Health Center| work= | accessdate= 2009-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426054258/http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Mixed_Acid_Base_Disorders.html| archivedate= 2009-04-26| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed disorders may feature an acidosis and alkosis at the same time that partially counteract each other, or there can be two different conditions affecting the pH in the same direction. The phrase "mixed acidosis", for example, refers to [[metabolic acidosis]] in conjunction with [[respiratory acidosis]]. Any combination is possible, as metabolic acidosis and alkalosis can co exist together.

===Calculation of imbalance===
The traditional approach to the study of acid–base physiology has been the [[empirical]] approach. The main variants are the [[base excess]] approach and the [[bicarbonate]] approach. The [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] approach introduced by [[Peter A Stewart]] in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stewart P |title=Independent and dependent variables of acid-base control |journal=Respir Physiol |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=9–26 |year=1978 |pmid=27857 |doi=10.1016/0034-5687(78)90079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is newer.

==Causes==
There are numerous reasons that each of the four processes can occur (detailed in each article). Generally speaking, sources of acid gain include:
# Retention of [[carbon dioxide]]
# Production of [[nonvolatile acid]]s from the metabolism of proteins and other [[organic molecule]]s
# Loss of [[bicarbonate]] in [[feces]] or [[urine]]
# Intake of acids or acid precursors

Sources of acid loss include:
# Use of hydrogen ions in the metabolism of various organic anions
# Loss of acid in the [[vomitus]] or [[urine]]
# [[Gastric aspiration]] in hospital
# Severe [[diarrhea]]
# Carbon dioxide loss through [[hyperventilation]]

==Compensation==
{{Acids and bases}}
The body's acid–base balance is tightly regulated. Several [[buffering agent]]s exist which reversibly bind hydrogen ions and impede any change in pH. [[Extracellular]] buffers include [[bicarbonate]] and [[ammonia]], while [[protein]]s and [[phosphate]] act as [[intracellular]] buffers. The [[bicarbonate buffering system]] is especially key, as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be shifted through [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to hydrogen ions and [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) as shown below.
:&lt;chem&gt;HCO_3^- + H+ &lt;=&gt; H2CO3 &lt;=&gt; CO2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Acid–base imbalances that overcome the buffer system can be compensated in the short term by changing the rate of [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. This alters the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood, shifting the above reaction according to [[Le Chatelier's principle]], which in turn alters the pH. For instance, if the blood pH drops too low (''acidemia''), the body will compensate by increasing breathing, expelling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and shifting the reaction above to the right such that fewer hydrogen ions are free – thus the pH will rise back to normal. For ''alkalemia'', the opposite occurs.

The [[kidneys]] are slower to compensate, but [[renal physiology]] has several powerful mechanisms to control pH by the excretion of excess acid or base. In responses to acidosis, [[renal tubule|tubular]] cells reabsorb more bicarbonate from the tubular fluid, [[collecting duct]] cells secrete more hydrogen and generate more bicarbonate, and [[ammoniagenesis]] leads to increased formation of the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; buffer. In responses to alkalosis, the kidney may excrete more bicarbonate by decreasing hydrogen ion secretion from the tubular epithelial cells, and lowering rates of [[glutamine]] metabolism and ammonia excretion.

===Motive===
Texas authorities stated that Nesreen's conversion and marrying a Christian man motivated the father to commit the murders.&lt;ref name=KTRKweb/&gt; In her court testimony, Alrawabdeh stated that Irsan planned to also kill Nesreen, Cory Beavers, and the Beavers twins' mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rogers, Brian|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Forensic-expert-testifies-GPS-devices-of-13090098.php|title=Forensic expert testifies GPS device of Jordanian immigrant tracked to scene of Houston ‘honor killing’|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date=2018-07-19|accessdate=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated "If a girl ran away from home, it would bring disgrace to the family."&lt;ref name=Rogerswifetest/&gt; Stating that the difference in religion and the element of [[premarital sex]] would reflect poorly on Irsan, Alrawabdeh stated, "I’m from an Arabic country and I’m aware of the culture.

==Prosecution==
===Investigation, arrest, and pre-trial detention===
Officers of the [[Harris County Sheriff's Office]] (HCSO) searched Irsan's residence nine days after Beavers's death. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) conducted surveillance on the suspects.&lt;ref name=Malisowgreedhonor/&gt; On the day Irsan was arrested for federal fraud charges, May 22, 2014, Harris County prosecutors announced that Irsan was also being charged for Bagherzadeh's murder.

Irsan's lawyers&lt;!--defense--&gt; stated that he had no connection to either murder and the circumstances of the murders were not known.&lt;ref name=RogersTwintest/&gt; They also stated that the murders of Bagherzadeh and Beavers were not connected.&lt;ref name=Rogersmother/&gt;

The federal government continued to hold Irsan, Alrawabdeh, and Nadia while Harris County prosecutors announced new criminal charges in 2015.&lt;ref name=Kriel&gt;{{cite web|author=Kriel, Lomi|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Capital-murder-charges-filed-in-case-involving-6217080.php|title=Capital murder charges filed in case involving death of Iranian activist|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|date=2015-04-22|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nadia Irsan received charges accusing her of stalking her sister, a felony to the third degree; the maximum possible sentence, if conviction occurs, is 10 years.

After state criminal charges were announced, an anonymous person stating to be one of the children of Irsan created a petition stating that "racial prejudice and discrimination" had victimized the family.&lt;ref name=Malisowgreedhonor/&gt; While Montgomery County authorities stated they were re-investigating the 1999 death of Alidam, they would only file charges on the matter if new evidence is presented.&lt;ref name=BarajasFile/&gt;

'''Ambrosios Pleiathidis''' ({{lang-el|Αμβρόσιος Πλειανθίδης}}, 1872–1922) also known as '''Ambrosios of Moschonisia''' was the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Moschonisia]], in modern [[Turkey]], from February to September 1922. He was executed by the Turkish Army at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]].&lt;ref name=Kiminas&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiminas|first=Demetrius|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|year=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458766|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&amp;pg=PA69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is commemorated by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] as [[Hieromartyr]] ({{lang-el|ιερομάρτυρας}}) and his feast day is celebrated on the Sunday before the [[Elevation of the Holy Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] each year (September 7–13).

==Life==
Ambrosios was born in [[Smyrna]] (modern [[Izmir]]), in the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], in 1872. He graduated from the [[Evangelical School of Smyrna|Evangelical School]] of his home town at 1893. After his graduation Ambrosios became an archdeacon in the nearby metropolis of Heliopolis and Thyateira, based in [[Aydin]]. He continued his studies and in 1895 he attended the [[Kiev Theological Academy|Theolodigal Academy of Kiev]] and then he became a priest in the Greek community of [[Feodosiya]] in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=Tsiris&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsiri|first=Theodorou|title=Η Προσφορά της Εκκλησίας και του Ιερού Κλήρου στη Μικρά Ασία 1912–1922|url=http://invenio.lib.auth.gr/record/114207/files/tisiris.pdf?version=1|publisher=[[University of Thessaloniki]], Department of Theology|accessdate=19 October 2012|location=Thessaloniki|language=Greek|year=2008|pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Ambrosios returned to Smyrna, where he preached in the local metropolis, under metropolitan [[Chrysostomos of Smyrna|Chrysostomos]].&lt;ref name=Tsiris/&gt;

From 1919 Ambrosios is found on [[Cunda Island]], part of a small island cluster off western [[Anatolia]]n coast, which at that time was part of the Greek controlled [[Occupation of Smyrna|Smyrna Occupation Zone]]. In February 19, 1922, he became metropolitan bishop of the newly created local metropolis of Moschonisia, based in Cunda. Following the developments of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and the subsequent Greek defeat, the region his metropolis came under the Turkish Nationalist Army. Most of the local population did not follow the retreating Greek Army. On the other hand, the Turkish troops arrested the remaining civilian population and sent them to labor battalions in the interior of Anatolia, the majority of them were executed, in September 15, 1922.&lt;ref name=Kiminas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Bruce|title=Twice a stranger: the mass expulsion that forged modern Greece and Turkey|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge (Massachusetts)|isbn=9780674023680|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=el&amp;id=kVZ3sLBEPEcC&amp;dq=bishop+ayvalik+turkish+1922&amp;q=cunda#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cunda%2C%20several%20hundred%20civilians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these people was Ambrosios, who was buried alive after being tortured.&lt;ref name=Kiminas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charitopoulos&gt;{{cite web|last=Charitopoulos |first=Evangelos |title=Diocese of Moschonisia |url=http://www.ehw.gr/l.aspx?id=8345 |publisher=Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Μείζονος Ελληνισμού, Μ.

'''BioMotiv''' is an accelerator company associated with [[The Harrington Project]], a $340 million initiative centered at [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]]. BioMotiv's mission is to accelerate breakthrough discoveries into medicines by advancing a portfolio of novel therapeutics in all disease areas and types of therapeutics. The BioMotiv model efficiently aligns capital and collaborations for the benefit of inventors, investors, and ultimately physicians and patients. Therapeutic opportunities are identified through relationships with [http://www.uhhospitals.org/services/harrington-discovery-institute The Harrington Discovery Institute], university and research institutions, disease foundations, and industry sources. Once opportunities are identified, BioMotiv oversees the development, funding, active management, and partnering of the therapeutic products.

==History==
The Harrington Project was launched as an effort to bridge varying aspects of the drug development sphere. In response to recent decline in the number of traditional, early-stage [[biotechnology]] [[venture capital]] firms,&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Where Is Everyone? Biotech's Dwindling Number of Venture Firms, 2012-07-23 https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2012/07/23/where-is-everyone-biotechs-dwindling-number-of-venture-firms/&lt;/ref&gt; BioMotiv utilizes an asset-centric model to in-license, fund, and manage technologies in-house.&lt;ref&gt;MedCity News, There's a new twist to early stage drug discovery financing: technology without the team, 2012-12-04 http://medcitynews.com/2012/12/theres-a-new-twist-to-early-stage-drug-discovery-financing-its-technology-sans-the-team-video/&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to address the "valley of death" &lt;ref&gt;Tech Transfer Central, Profit/non-profit partners to carry biotech innovations across valley of death, 2012-12-12 http://www.technologytransfertactics.com/content/2012/12/12/profitnon-profit-partners-to-carry-biotech-innovations-across-valley-of-death/&lt;/ref&gt; between research, discovery, and early clinical-stage [[drug development]]. Projects are advanced by the management team through clinical [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] and then out-licensed via strategic alliances with [[pharmaceutical companies]].&lt;ref&gt;MedCity News, The biotech valley of death has become the uncrossable canyon.

'''Brain-reading''' uses the responses of multiple [[voxel]]s in the [[brain]] evoked by [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] then detected by [[fMRI]] in order to decode the original stimulus. Brain reading studies differ in the type of decoding (i.e.&amp;nbsp;classification, identification and reconstruction) employed, the target (i.e.&amp;nbsp;decoding visual patterns, auditory patterns, [[cognitive state]]s), and the decoding algorithms ([[linear classification]], [[nonlinear classification]], [[direct reconstruction]], [[Bayesian reconstruction]],&amp;nbsp;etc.) employed.

In classification, a pattern of activity across multiple voxels is used to determine the particular class from which the stimulus was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Yukiyasu Kamitani|Kamitani]] |first1=[[Yukiyasu Kamitani|Yukiyasu]] |last2=Tong |first2=Frank |title=Decoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=679–85 |date=2005 |pmid=15852014 |pmc=1808230 |doi=10.1038/nn1444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have classified visual stimuli, but this approach has also been used to classify cognitive states.

==Reconstruction==

In reconstruction brain reading the aim is to create a literal picture of the image that was presented. Early studies used voxels from early [[visual cortex]] areas (V1, V2, and V3) to reconstruct geometric stimuli made up of flickering checkerboard patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miyawaki |first1=Y |last2=Uchida |first2=H |last3=Yamashita |first3=O |last4=Sato |first4=M |last5=Morito |first5=Y |last6=Tanabe |first6=H |last7=Sadato |first7=N |last8=Kamitani |first8=Y |title=Visual Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity using a Combination of Multiscale Local Image Decoders |journal=Neuron |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=915–29 |date=2008 |pmid=19081384 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thirion |first1=Bertrand |last2=Duchesnay |first2=Edouard |last3=Hubbard |first3=Edward |last4=Dubois |first4=Jessica |last5=Poline |first5=Jean-Baptiste |last6=Lebihan |first6=Denis |last7=Dehaene |first7=Stanislas |title=Inverse retinotopy: Inferring the visual content of images from brain activation patterns |journal=NeuroImage |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=1104–16 |date=2006 |pmid=17029988 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.06.062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural images==
More recent studies used voxels from early and [[Extrastriate cortex|anterior visual cortex area]]s forward of them (visual areas V3A, V3B, V4, and the lateral occipital) together with [[Bayesian inference]] techniques to reconstruct complex natural images. This brain reading approach uses three components:&lt;ref name="Naselaris"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Naselaris |first1=Thomas |last2=Prenger |first2=Ryan J. |last3=Kay |first3=Kendrick N. |last4=Oliver |first4=Michael |last5=Gallant |first5=Jack L. |title=Bayesian Reconstruction of Natural Images from Human Brain Activity |journal=Neuron |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=902–15 |date=2009 |pmid=19778517 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A structural encoding model that characterizes responses in early visual areas; a semantic encoding model that characterizes responses in anterior visual areas; and a Bayesian prior that describes the distribution of structural and semantic [[scene statistics]].&lt;ref name="Naselaris"/&gt;

Experimentally the procedure is for subjects to view 1750 [[black and white]] natural images that are correlated with voxel activation in their brains. Then  subjects viewed another 120 novel target images, and information from the earlier scans is used reconstruct them. Natural images used include pictures of a seaside cafe and harbor, performers on a stage, and dense foliage.&lt;ref name="Naselaris"/&gt;

==Other types==

It is possible to track which of two forms of rivalrous binocular illusions a person was subjectively experiencing from fMRI signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haynes |first1=J |last2=Rees |first2=G |title=Predicting the Stream of Consciousness from Activity in Human Visual Cortex |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=14 |pages=1301–7 |date=2005 |pmid=16051174 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The category of event which a person freely recalls can be identified from fMRI before they say what they remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polyn |first1=S. M. |last2=Natu |first2=VS |last3=Cohen |first3=JD |last4=Norman |first4=KA |title=Category-Specific Cortical Activity Precedes Retrieval During Memory Search |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5756 |pages=1963–6 |date=2005 |pmid=16373577 |doi=10.1126/science.1117645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis of [[EEG]] brainwaves has been claimed to allow the recognition of [[phoneme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppes |first1=Patrick |last2=Perreau-Guimaraes |first2=Marcos |last3=Wong |first3=Dik Kin |title=Partial Orders of Similarity Differences Invariant Between EEG-Recorded Brain and Perceptual Representations of Language |journal=Neural Computation |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=3228–69 |date=2009 |pmid=19686069 |doi=10.1162/neco.2009.04-08-764}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a 60% to 75% level color and visual shape words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.25.14658 |last1=Suppes |first1=Patrick |last2=Han |first2=Bing |last3=Epelboim |first3=Julie |last4=Lu |first4=Zhong-Lin |title=Invariance of brain-wave representations of simple visual images and their names |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=96 |issue=25 |pages=14658–63 |date=1999 |pmid=10588761 |pmc=24492}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been shown that brain-reading can be achieved in a complex [[virtual environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chu |first1=Carlton |last2=Ni |first2=Yizhao |last3=Tan |first3=Geoffrey |last4=Saunders |first4=Craig J. |last5=Ashburner |first5=John |title=Kernel regression for fMRI pattern prediction |journal=NeuroImage |date=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.058 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=662–673 |pmid=20348000 |pmc=3084459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
Brain-reading accuracy is increasing steadily as the quality of the data and the complexity of the decoding algorithms improve. In one recent experiment it was possible to identify which single image was being seen from a set of 120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kay |first1=Kendrick N. |last2=Naselaris |first2=Thomas |last3=Prenger |first3=Ryan J. |last4=Gallant |first4=Jack L. |title=Identifying natural images from human brain activity |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7185 |pages=352–5 |date=2008 |pmid=18322462 |doi=10.1038/nature06713 |pmc=3556484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another it was possible to correctly identify  90% of the time which of two categories the stimulus came and the specific semantic category (out of 23) of the target image 40% of the time.&lt;ref name="Naselaris"/&gt;

==Limitations==
It has been noted that so far brain-reading is limited. "In practice, exact reconstructions
are impossible to achieve by any reconstruction algorithm on the basis of brain activity signals acquired by fMRI. This is because all reconstructions will inevitably be limited by inaccuracies in the encoding models and noise in the measured signals. Our results {{who|date=June 2013}} demonstrate that the natural image prior is a powerful (if unconventional) tool for mitigating the effects of these fundamental limitations. A natural image prior with only six million images is sufficient to produce reconstructions that are structurally and semantically similar to a target image."&lt;ref name="Naselaris"/&gt;

==Applications==

Brain-reading has been suggested as an alternative to [[polygraph machine]]s as a form of [[lie detection]].&lt;ref name=Wolpe2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wolpe, P. R.|author2=Foster, K. R.|author3=Langleben, D. D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Emerging neurotechnologies for lie-detection: promises and perils|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics: AJOB|volume=5|issue=2|pages=39–49|pmid=16036700|doi=10.1080/15265160590923367|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.728.9280&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to polygraph machines is [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent|blood oxygenated level dependent]] functional MRI technology (BOLD fMRI). This technique involves the interpretation of the local change in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin in the brain, although the relationship between this blood flow and neural activity is not yet completely understood.&lt;ref name=Wolpe2005 /&gt; 

A number of concerns have been raised about the accuracy and ethical implications of brain-reading for this purpose. Laboratory studies have found rates of accuracy of up to 85%; however, there are concerns about what this means for false positive results among non-criminal populations: "If the prevalence of "prevaricators" in the group being examined is low, the test will yield far more false-positive than true-positive results; about one person in five will be incorrectly identified by the test."&lt;ref name=Wolpe2005 /&gt;  Ethical problems involved in the use of brain-reading as lie detection include misapplications due to adoption of the technology before its reliability and validity can be properly assessed and due to misunderstanding of the technology, and privacy concerns due to unprecedented access to individual's private thoughts.&lt;ref name=Wolpe2005 /&gt; However, it has been noted that the use of polygraph lie detection carries similar concerns about the reliability of the results&lt;ref name=Wolpe2005 /&gt;  and violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arstila, V.|author2=Scott, F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Brain Reading and Mental Privacy|journal=TRAMES: A Journal of the Humanities &amp; Social Sciences|volume=15|issue=2|pages=204–212|doi=10.3176/tr.2011.2.08|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/trames_pdf/2011/issue_2/Trames-2011-2-204-212.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brain-reading has also been proposed as a method of improving [[human-machine interface]]s, by the use of EEG to detect relevant brain states of a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kirchner, E. A.|author2=Kim, S. K.|author3=Straube, S.|author4=Seeland, A.|author5=Wöhrle, H.|author6=Krell, M.

[[File:Carnivore-lion.jpg|thumb|300px|Lions are [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] carnivores, requiring animal flesh for their nutritional requirements]]

A '''carnivore''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|n|ɪ|v|ɔər}}, meaning "meat eater" ([[Latin]], ''caro'', genitive ''carnis'', meaning "meat" or "flesh" and ''vorare'' meaning "to devour"), is an [[organism]] that derives its [[energy]] and [[nutrient]] requirements from a [[List of feeding behaviours|diet]] consisting mainly or exclusively of [[animal]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], whether through [[predation]] or [[scavenger|scavenging]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutrient Requirements: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] carnivores.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; [[Omnivore]]s also consume both animal and non-animal food, and, apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals"' Omnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt; A carnivore at the top of the [[food chain]], not preyed upon by other animals, is termed an [[apex predator]].

"Carnivore" also may refer to the [[mammal]]ian order [[Carnivora]], but this is somewhat misleading: many, but not all, Carnivora are meat eaters, and even fewer are true obligate carnivores (see below). For example, while the Arctic [[polar bear]] eats meat exclusively, most species of [[bear]]s are actually [[omnivore|omnivorous]], and the [[giant panda]] is exclusively [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. There are also many carnivorous species that are not members of Carnivora.

Outside the animal kingdom, there are several genera containing [[carnivorous plant]]s (predominantly insectivores) and several phyla containing [[carnivorous fungus|carnivorous fungi]] (preying mostly on microscopic [[invertebrate]]s such as [[nematode]]s, [[amoebae]] and [[springtail]]s).

[[File:Venus_Flytrap_showing_trigger_hairs.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the vegetable kingdom can live on meat too, such as the [[Venus flytrap]], a [[carnivorous plant]]]] 

Carnivores are sometimes characterized by their [[List of feeding behaviours#By food type|type of prey]]. For example, animals that eat mainly [[insect]]s and similar invertebrates are called [[insectivore]]s, while those that eat mainly [[fish]] are called [[piscivore]]s. The first [[tetrapod]]s, or land-dwelling [[vertebrate]]s, were piscivorous amphibians known as [[Labyrinthodontia|labyrinthodonts]]. They gave rise to insectivorous vertebrates and, later, to predators of other tetrapods.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnivores may alternatively be classified according to the percentage of meat in their diet. The diet of a [[hypercarnivore]] consists of more than 70% meat, that of a [[mesocarnivore]] 50–70%, and that of a [[hypocarnivore]] less than 30%, with the balance consisting of non-animal foods such as [[fruit]]s, other plant material, or [[fungi]].

==Obligate carnivores==
[[File:Tigre d'Asie à robe blanche.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bengal tiger]]'s large [[canine tooth|canines]] and strong jaws reveal its place as an [[apex predator]]]]

Obligate or "true" carnivores are those whose diet requires nutrients found only in animal flesh. While obligate carnivores might be able to [[ingestion|ingest]] small amounts of plant matter, they lack the necessary [[physiology]] required to [[digestion|digest]] it. In fact, some obligate carnivorous mammals will ingest vegetation only as an [[emetic]], to self-induce vomiting of food that has upset its stomach.

Obligate carnivores include the [[axolotl]], which consumes mainly worms and larvae in its environment, but if necessary will consume algae, as well as all [[Felidae|felids]] (including the [[domestic cat]]) which require a diet of primarily animal flesh and organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velegrand-Defretin|first=Veronique|title=Differences between cats and dogs: a nutritional view|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|year=1994|volume=53|pages=15–24|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS53_01%2FS0029665194000066a.pdf&amp;code=b428e668252a801500828a47df480146|doi=10.1079/pns19940004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cats have high protein requirements and their metabolisms appear unable to synthesize essential nutrients such as [[retinol]], [[arginine]], [[taurine]], and [[arachidonic acid]]; thus, in nature, they must consume flesh to supply these nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ullrey, D.

E.|editor1-last=Pond|editor1-first=Wilson|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Science|date=2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5496-9|page=670|chapter=Nutrient Requirements: Carnivores|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SQl7Ao3mHoC&amp;pg=PA670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics of carnivores ==
Characteristics commonly associated with carnivores include strength, speed, and keen senses for hunting, as well as teeth and claws for capturing and tearing prey. However, some carnivores do not hunt and are [[scavenger]]s, lacking the physical characteristics to bring down prey; in addition, most hunting carnivores will scavenge when the opportunity arises. Carnivores have comparatively short digestive systems, as they are not required to break down the tough cellulose found in plants.

Many hunting animals have evolved eyes facing forward, enabling depth perception. This is almost universal among mammalian predators, while most reptile and amphibian predators have eyes facing sideways.

==Prehistoric carnivores==
{{main|Predation#Evolutionary history|Evolutionary history of life}}
''[[Predation]]'' (the eating of one living creature by another for nutrition) predates the rise of commonly recognized carnivores by hundreds of millions (perhaps billions) of years. The earliest predators were microbial organisms, which engulfed or grazed on others. Because the fossil record is poor, these first predators could date back anywhere between 1 and over 2.7 Gya (billion years ago).&lt;ref name="bengtson"&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-paleontological-society-papers/article/origins-and-early-evolution-of-predation/54E8168EC25E08AFCAEF69C63A49C491 Origins and Early Evolution of Predation, 2002] ([http://www.nrm.se/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021552/Bengtson2002predation.pdf full paper])&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[eukaryotic]] cells at around 2.7 Gya, the rise of multicellular organisms at about 2 Gya, and the rise of mobile predators (around 600 Mya – 2 Gya, probably around 1 Gya) have all been attributed to early predatory behavior,&lt;ref name="bengtson"/&gt; and many very early remains show evidence of boreholes or other markings attributed to small predator species.&lt;ref name="bengtson"/&gt;

Among more familiar species, the first vertebrate carnivores were fish, and then amphibians that moved on to land. Early [[tetrapods]] were large amphibious [[piscivores]]. Some scientists assert that ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' "was the first terrestrial vertebrate to develop the curved, serrated teeth that enable a predator to eat prey much larger than itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5928/20140207/carnivorous-pre-dinosaur-predator-first-evolve-steak-knife-teeth.htm |author= Foley, James A. |date= February 7, 2014 |title= Carnivorous, Pre-Dinosaur Predator was First to Evolve Steak Knife-like Teeth |publisher= Nature World News |accessdate= May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While amphibians continued to feed on fish and later insects, reptiles began exploring two new food types: tetrapods (carnivory) and then plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation; in contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse" /&gt;

In the [[Mesozoic]], some [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' were probably obligate carnivores. Though the theropods were the larger carnivores, several carnivorous mammal groups were already present. Most notable are the [[Gobiconodontidae|gobiconodontids]], the [[Triconodontidae|triconodontid]] ''[[Jugulator (mammal)|Jugulator]]'', the [[Deltatheroida|deltatheroideans]] and ''[[Cimolestes]]''. Many of these, such as ''[[Repenomamus]]'', ''Jugulator'' and ''Cimolestes'', were among the largest mammals in their faunal assemblages, capable of attacking dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, Richard L. Cifelli, Zhe-Xi Luo (2004). "Chapter 12: Metatherians". Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs: origins, evolution, and structure. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 425–262. {{ISBN|0-231-11918-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Fox (2015) A revision of the Late Cretaceous–Paleocene eutherian mammal Cimolestes Marsh, 1889. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences (advance online publication)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cifelli, Richard L.; Madsen, Scott K. (1998). "Triconodont mammals from the medial Cretaceous of Utah". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18 (2): 403–411. doi:10.1080/02724634.1998.10011068.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early-to-mid-Cenozoic, the dominant predator forms were mammals: [[Hyaenodonta|hyaenodonts]], [[Oxyaenidae|oxyaenids]], [[entelodont]]s, [[ptolemaiida]]ns, [[Arctocyonidae|arctocyonids]] and [[mesonychia]]ns, representing a great diversity of [[eutheria]]n carnivores in the northern continents and [[Africa]]. In [[South America]], [[Sparassodonta|sparassodonts]] were dominant, while [[Australia]] saw the presence of several [[marsupial]] predators, such as the [[Dasyuromorphia|dasyuromorphs]] and [[Thylacoleonidae|thylacoleonids]]. From the [[Miocene]] to the present, the dominant carnivorous mammals have been [[Carnivoramorpha|carnivoramorphs]].

Most carnivorous mammals, from [[dog]]s to ''[[Deltatheridium]]'', share several dental adaptations, such as [[carnassial]]iforme teeth, long [[canine tooth|canine]]s and even similar tooth replacement patterns.&lt;ref&gt;CHRISTIAN DE MUIZON and BRIGITTE LANGE-BADRÉ, Carnivorous dental adaptations in tribosphenic mammals and phylogenetic reconstruction, Article first published online: 29 MAR 2007 DOI: 10.1111/j.1502-3931.1997.tb00481&lt;/ref&gt; Most aberrant are [[thylacoleonids]], with a diprodontan dentition completely unlike that of any other mammal; and [[eutriconodonts]] like gobioconodontids and ''Jugulator'', with a three-cusp anatomy which nevertheless functioned similarly to carnassials.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

The [[New York University]] Large Scale Emergency Readiness Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/ccpr/laser/planc.html Large Scale Emergency Readiness Project]&lt;/ref&gt; applies [[agent-based modelling]] to simulate the effects of a large-scale [[disaster]].  Their initial project focused on modelling a 1998 Brazilian food-poisoning incident involving 8,000 injuries and 16 deaths.

Blast casualty prediction is routinely performed in the planning of [[military operations]].  For example, a [[cruise missile]] attack was considered by the United States in 1998 for [[Tarnak Farms]] in order to kill [[Osama bin Laden]]. However, not enough was known about the [[collateral damage]] effects of cruise missiles on [[Hut (dwelling)|mud huts]].   At the time there were estimated to be 100 women and children in the area, and in order to spare these civilians, the attack was not approved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghost Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Localization===
Various molecular, genetic and imaging studies have been conducted as for the localization of the CPGs. The results have shown that the networks responsible for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] are distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(03)00091-1 |vauthors=Kiehn O, Butt SJ |title=Physiological, anatomical and genetic identification of CPG neurons in the developing mammalian spinal cord |journal=Prog.

===Anatomy===
Although anatomical details of CPGs are specifically known in only a few cases, they have been shown to originate from the spinal cords of various vertebrates and to depend on relatively small and autonomous neural networks (rather than the entire nervous system) to generate rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuo"/&gt; Many studies have been done to determine the [[Neural substrate of locomotor central pattern generators in mammals|neural substrate of locomotor CPGs in mammals]].  Neural rhythmicity can arise in two ways: "through interactions among neurons (network-based rhythmicity) or through interactions among currents in individual neurons (endogenous oscillator neurons)".&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; A key to understanding rhythm generation is the concept of a half-center oscillator (HCO). A half-center oscillator consists of two neurons that have no rhythmogenic ability individually, but produce rhythmic outputs when reciprocally coupled. Half-center oscillators can function in a variety of ways. First, the two neurons may not necessarily fire in antiphase and can fire in any relative phasing, even synchrony, depending on the synaptic release. Second, half-centers can also function in an "escape" mode or a "release" mode. Escape and release refer to the way the off-neuron turns on: by escape or release from inhibition. Half-center oscillators can also be altered by intrinsic and network properties and can have dramatically different functionality based on variations in synaptic properties.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

The classical view of CPGs, as specific networks of neurons dedicated to this function alone, has been challenged by numerous data obtained mostly on the central nervous system of invertebrates. In addition to be classical dedicated networks, most of the CPGs seem in fact to be either reorganizing or distributed circuits, and a single neural circuit can combine features typical of each of these architectures. The observation in invertebrates of pattern generators temporarily formed before the production of motor activity strengthens the assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jean A |title=Brain stem control of swallowing: neuronal network and cellular mechanisms |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=929–69 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11274347 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11274347|doi=10.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPG circuits appear thus to have a flexible character.

===Neuromodulation===
Organisms must adapt their behavior to meet the needs of their internal and external environments. Central pattern generators, as part of the neural circuitry of an organism, can be modulated to adapt to the organism's needs and surroundings. Three roles of [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] have been found for CPG circuits:&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;
#Modulation in CPG as part of normal activity
#Modulation changes the functional configuration of CPGs to produce different motor outputs
#Modulation alters CPG neuron complement by switching neurons between networks and fusing formerly separate networks into larger entities

*Modulation in CPG as part of normal activity
For example, the ''[[Tritonia diomedea]]'' swimming CPG can produce reflexive withdrawal in response to weak sensory input, escape swimming in response to strong sensory input and crawling after escape swimming has ceased. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the swim CPGs not only cause the rhythmic escape swimming, but also connect to cilia-activating efferent neurons. Experimental evidence confirms that both behaviors are mediated by the DSIs. "Given the extreme differences between these behaviors—-rhythmic versus tonic, muscular versus ciliary, and brief versus prolonged—these findings reveal a striking versatility for a small multifunctional network."&lt;ref name="Popescu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Popescu IR, Frost WN |title=Highly dissimilar behaviors mediated by a multifunctional network in the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=1985–93 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11880529 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11880529}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Part of this flexibility is caused by the release of [[serotonin]] from the DSIs, which causes cerebral cell 2 (C2) to release more transmitter and strengthen its network synapses. Application of serotonergic antagonists prevents the network from producing the swimming pattern, and hence this intranetwork modulation appears essential for network oscillation."&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

*Modulation changes the functional configuration of CPGs to produce different motor outputs
Data from experiments by Harris-Warrick in 1991 and Hooper and Marder in 1987 suggest that the functional target of modulation is the entire CPG network. These phenomena were first observed through experiments with the [[neuromodulator]] in the lobster cardiac ganglion (Sullivan and Miller 1984). The effect of [[proctolin]] could not be understood by looking only at the neurons it directly affected. "Instead, neurons that are not directly affected both alter the response of the directly affected neurons and help to transmit the changes in the activity of these neurons throughout the network," allowing the entire network to change in consistent and synchronized way.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Harris-Warrick and colleagues have conducted many studies over the years of the effects of neuromodulators on CPG neural networks. For example, a 1998 study showed the distributed nature of neuromodulation and that neuromodulators can reconfigure a motor network to allow a family of related movements. Specifically, dopamine was shown to affect both individual neurons, and synapses between neurons. Dopamine strengthens some synapses and weakens others by acting pre- and post-synaptically throughout the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. These responses, as well as other effects of dopamine, can be opposite in sign in different locations, showing that the sum of the effects is the overall network effect and can cause the CPG to produce related families of different motor outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09046.x |vauthors=Harris-Warrick RM, Johnson BR, Peck JH, Kloppenburg P, Ayali A, Skarbinski J |title=Distributed effects of dopamine modulation in the crustacean pyloric network |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=860 |issue=1 NeuronaL Mech |pages=155–67 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9928309 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=1998&amp;volume=860&amp;spage=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Modulation alters CPG neuron complement by switching neurons between networks and fusing formerly separate networks into larger entities.
A single neuronal network, such as a central pattern generator, can be modulated moment-to-moment to produce several different physical actions depending on the needs of the animal. These were first coined "polymorphic networks" by Getting and Dekin in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris-Warrick RM, Marder E |title=Modulation of neural networks for behavior |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=39–57 |year=1991 |pmid=2031576 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.14.030191.000351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one such polymorphic central pattern generator is a multifunctional network of the mollusk ''Tritonia diomedea''. As described by Hooper, weak sensory input to the swimming CPG produces reflexive withdrawal, while strong input produces swimming. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the circuit release serotonin to convert to "swim mode," while application of serotonergic antagonists prevents the swim pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Additionally, the same single interneuronal network has been found to produce not only "rhythmic, muscle-based escape swimming," but also "nonrhythmic, cilia-mediated crawling." Evidence also suggests that although the CPG controls related but separate functions, neuromodulation of one function can occur without affecting the other. For example, the swim mode can be sensitized by serotonin without affecting the crawl mode. Thus, the CPG circuit can control many separate functions with the appropriate neuromodulation.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt;

===Feedback mechanism===
Although the theory of central pattern generation calls for basic rhythmicity and patterning to be centrally generated, CPGs can respond to sensory feedback to alter the patterning in behaviorally appropriate ways. Alteration of the pattern is difficult because feedback received during only one phase may require changed movement in the other parts of the patterned cycle to preserve certain coordination relationships. For example, walking with a pebble in the right shoe alters the entire gait, even though the stimulus is only present while standing on the right foot. Even during the time when the left foot is down and the sensory feedback is inactive, action is taken to prolong the right leg swing and extend the time on the left foot, leading to limping. This effect could be due to widespread and long-lasting effects of the sensory feedback on the CPG or due to short-term effects on a few neurons that in turn modulate nearby neurons and spread the feedback through the entire CPG in that way. Some degree of [[#Neuromodulation|modulation]] is required to allow one CPG to assume multiple states in response to feedback.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Additionally, the effect of the sensory input varies depending on the phase of the pattern in which it occurs. For example, during walking, resistance to the top of the swinging foot (e.g., by a horizontal stick) causes the foot to be lifted higher to move over the stick. However, the same input to the standing foot cannot cause the foot to lift or the person would collapse. Thus, depending on the phase, the same sensory input can cause the foot to be lifted higher or held more firmly to the ground.  "This change in motor response as a function of motor pattern phase is called reflex reversal, and has been observed in invertebrates (DiCaprio and Clarac, 1981) and vertebrates (Forssberg et al., 1977). How this process occurs is poorly understood, but again two possibilities exist. One is that sensory input is appropriately routed to different CPG neurons as a function of motor pattern phase. The other is that the input reaches the same neurons at all phases, but that, as a consequence of the way in which the network transforms the input, network response varies appropriately as a function of motor pattern phase."&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

A recent study by Gottschall and Nichols studied the hindlimb of a decerebrate cat during walking (a CPG controlled function) in response to changes in head pitch. This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill, downhill and on level surfaces. Proprioceptive (Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles) and exteroreceptive (optic, vestibular and cutaneous) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback. The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors (giving information about the relative location of the head and body) and vestibular receptors (giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity). Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level, tilted up or tilted down. Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head tilted down. This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal. This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gottschall JS, Nichols TR |title=Head pitch affects muscle activity in the decerebrate cat hindlimb during walking |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=182 |issue=1 |pages=131–5 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17690872 |doi=10.1007/s00221-007-1084-z |pmc=3064865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Central pattern generators can serve many functions in vertebrate animals. CPGs can play roles in movement, breathing, rhythm generation and other [[neural oscillation|oscillatory]] functions. The sections below focus on specific examples of locomotion and rhythm generation, two key functions of CPGs.

===Locomotion===
As early as 1911, it was recognized, by the experiments of [[Thomas Graham Brown]], that the basic pattern of stepping can be produced by the spinal cord without the need of descending commands from the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0077 |author=Graham-Brown, T. |title=The intrinsic factors in the act of progression in the mammal |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B |volume=84 |issue=572 |pages=308–319 |year=1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whelan PJ |title=Developmental aspects of spinal locomotor function: insights from using the in vitro mouse spinal cord preparation |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=553 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=695–706 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14528025 |pmc=2343637 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2003.046219 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14528025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern evidence of the central pattern generator was produced by isolating the locust nervous system and showing that it could produce a rhythmic output in isolation resembling that of the locust in flight. This was discovered by Wilson in 1961.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Since that time, evidence has arisen for the presence of central pattern generators in vertebrate animals, starting with work on the cat in the 1960s by Elzbieta Jankowska in Gothenburg, who provided the first evidence for a spinal cord CPG. This section addresses the role of the central pattern generator in locomotion for the [[lamprey]] and humans.

The lamprey has been used as a model for vertebrate CPGs because, while its nervous system has a vertebrate organization, it shares many positive characteristics with invertebrates. When removed from the lamprey, the intact spinal cord can survive for days ''in vitro''. It also has very few neurons and can be easily stimulated to produce a fictive swimming motion indicative of a central pattern generator. As early as 1983, Ayers, Carpenter, Currie and Kinch proposed that there was a CPG responsible for most undulating movements in the lamprey including swimming forward and backward, burrowing in the mud and crawling on a solid surface, that although not surprisingly did not match the activity in the intact animal, nevertheless provided the basic locomotor output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayers, J., Carpenter, G.A, Currie, S. and Kinch, J. |title=Which behavior does the lamprey central motor program mediate? |journal=Science |volume=221 |pages=1312–1314 |date=Sep 1983 |pmid=6137060|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/221/4617/1312.long |doi=10.1126/science.6137060 |issue=4617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different movements have been found to be altered by neuromodulators, including serotonin in a study by Harris-Warrick and Cohen in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick R, Cohen A (1985) Serotonin modulates the central pattern generator for locomotion in the isolated lamprey spinal cord. J Exp Biol 116:27-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and tachykinin in a study by Parker et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D, Zhang W, Grillner S | year = 1998 | title = Substance P modulates NMDA responses and causes long-term protein synthesis-dependent modulation of the lamprey locomotor network | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 4800–4813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998. The lamprey model of CPG for locomotion has been important to the study of CPGs. Although Sten Grillner claims that the locomotor network is characterised, a claim that has seemingly been uncritically accepted by the spinal cord locomotor network field, there are in fact many missing details and Grillner cannot provide the evidence he uses to support his claims (Parker 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D | year = 2006 | title = Complexities and uncertainties of neuronal network function | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2005.1779 | pmid = 16553310 | journal =  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 361 | issue = 1465| pages = 81–99 | pmc = 1626546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D | year = 2010 | title = Neuronal network analyses: premises, promises and uncertainties | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 365 | issue = 1551| pages = 2315–2328 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0043| pmid = 20603354 | pmc = 2894952}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general scheme of the lamprey CPG is now being used in the creation of artificial CPGs.  For example, Ijspeert and Kodjabachian used Ekeberg's model for the lamprey to create artificial CPGs and simulate swimming movements in a lamprey-like substrate using controllers based on a SGOCE encoding.&lt;ref&gt;Ijspeert, Auke Jan and Jerome Kodjabachian "Evolution and development of a central pattern generator for the swimming of a lamprey." Research Paper No 926, Dept. of Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, these are the first steps toward the use of CPGs to code for locomotion in robots.

Connections between the CPGs controlling each limb influence the coordination between the limbs and hence the gaits in quadrupedal and possibly also bipedal animals.&lt;ref name=Danner2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danner|first1=Simon M.|last2=Wilshin|first2=Simon D.|last3=Shevtsova|first3=Natalia A.|last4=Rybak|first4=Ilya A.|title=Central control of interlimb coordination and speed-dependent gait expression in quadrupeds|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=1 December 2016|volume=594|issue=23|pages=6947–6967|doi=10.1113/JP272787|pmid=27633893|pmc=5134391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left right coordination is mediated by commissural and fore-hind by long-projecting propiospinal interneurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellardita|first1=Carmelo|last2=Kiehn|first2=Ole|title=Phenotypic Characterization of Speed-Associated Gait Changes in Mice Reveals Modular Organization of Locomotor Networks|journal=Current Biology|date=June 2015|volume=25|issue=11|pages=1426–1436|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.04.005|pmid=25959968|pmc=4469368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of the left-right alternation (mediated genetically identified V0d and V0v neuron classes) to left-synchronization promoting commissural interneurons (potentially mediated V3 neurons) determines whether walk and trot (alternating gaits) or gallop and bound (synchronous gaits) are expressed. This balance changes with increasing speed, potentially because of connection from the MLR to commissural interneurons, and causes speed dependent gait transitions characteristic for quadrupedal animals.&lt;ref name=Danner2016 /&gt; The walk to trot transition potentially occurs because of the stronger decrease of extension than flexion phase durations with increasing locomotor speed, which leads to progressively increasing overlap between the diagonal limbs up until diagonal synchronization (trot).&lt;ref name=Danner2016 /&gt;

Central pattern generators also contribute to locomotion in higher animals and humans. In 1994, Calancie, et al. claimed to have witnessed the "first well-defined example of a central rhythm generator for stepping in the adult human." The subject was a 37-year-old male who suffered an injury to the cervical spinal cord 17 years prior. After initial total paralysis below the neck, the subject eventually regained some movement of the arms and fingers and limited movement in the lower limbs. He had not recovered sufficiently to support his own weight. After 17 years, the subject found that when lying supine and extending his hips, his lower extremities underwent step-like movements for as long as he remained lying down. "The movements (i) involved alternating flexion and extension of his hips, knees, and ankles; (ii) were smooth and rhythmic; (iii) were forceful enough that the subject soon became uncomfortable due to excessive muscle 'tightness' and an elevated body temperature; and (iv) could not be stopped by voluntary effort." After extensive study of the subject, the experimenters concluded that "these data represent the clearest evidence to date that such a [CPG] network does exist in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calancie B, Needham-Shropshire B, Jacobs P, Willer K, Zych G, Green BA |title=Involuntary stepping after chronic spinal cord injury.

These measurements were performed in supine position, thus minimizing peripheral feedback. Subsequent studies showed that these lumbar locomotor centers can form a large variety of rhythmic movements by combining and distributing stereotypical patterns to the numerous lower limb muscles.&lt;ref name=Danner2105 /&gt;

====Neuromechanical control of locomotion in mammals====
If step cycle durations and muscle activations were fixed, it wouldn't be possible to change body velocity and adapt to varying terrain.   It has been suggested that the [[mammalian]] locomotor CPG comprises a “timer” (possibly in the form of coupled oscillators) which generates step cycles of varying durations, and a “[[pattern formation]] layer,” which selects and grades the activation of [[motor pools]].&lt;ref name="Rybak IA, Shevtsova NA, Lafreniere-Roula M, McCrea DA 2006 617–39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perret C, Cabelguen JM |title= Main characteristics of the hindlimb locomotor cycle in the decorticate cat with special reference to bifunctional muscles |journal= Brain Research |volume=187 |issue= 2 |pages=333–352|year=1980 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(80)90207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Increasing the neural drive from the midbrain locomotor region (MLR) to the spinal CPG increases the step cycle frequency (the cadence).&lt;ref name="Shik"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shik ML, Severin FV, Orlovsky GN |title= Control of walking and running by means of electrical stimulation of the mid-brain |journal= Biophysics |volume=11 |pages=756–765|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swing and stance phase durations co-vary in a fairly fixed relationship, with stance phases changing more than swing phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goslow GE Jr. |author2=Reinking RM |author3=Stuart DG |title= The cat step cycle: hind limb joint angles and muscle lengths during unrestrained locomotion. |journal= Journal of Morphology |volume=141 |issue=1 |pages=1–41|year=1973 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1051410102|pmid=4727469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory input from the limbs may truncate or extend individual phase durations in a process akin to finite state control (in which "if-then” rules determine when state transitions occur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cruse H |title= What mechanisms coordinate leg movement in walking arthropods? |journal= Trends in Neurosciences |volume=13 |issue= 1 |pages=15–21|year=1990 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(90)90057-h|pmid= 1688670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemami H, Tomovic R, Ceranowicz AZ |title= Finite state control of planar bipeds with application to walking and sitting.  |journal= Journal of Bioengineering |volume=2 |pages=477–494|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Prochazka A|title= Comparison of natural and artificial control of movement|journal= IEEE Trans Rehab Eng |volume=1 |pages=7–17|year=1993 |doi=10.1109/86.242403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a limb that is swinging forward reaches the end of swing in less time than the current CPG-generated flexor phase duration, sensory input would cause the CPG timer to terminate swing and start the stance phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiebert GW, Whelan PJ, Prochazka A, Pearson KG |title= Contribution of hind limb flexor muscle afferents to the timing of phase transitions in the cat step cycle |journal= Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=75 |pages=1126–1137|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as body velocity increases, the pattern formation layer would increase muscle activation nonlinearly to provide increased load-bearing and thrust forces. It has been posited that in well-predicted movements, CPG-generated phase durations and muscle forces closely match those required by the evolving biomechanical events, minimizing the sensory corrections required. The term ‘‘neuromechanical tuning’’ has been coined to describe this process &lt;ref name="P&amp;Y"/&gt;

[[File:Locomotor CPG schematic.jpg|thumb|right|750px| Fig. 1. Schematic of the locomotor central pattern generator in the mammalian nervous system. A command signal specifying increasing body velocity descends from deep brain nuclei via the MLR to the spinal cord and drives the timing element of the spinal locomotor CPG to generate cycles of increasing cadence. Extensor phase durations change more than flexor phase durations. The command signal also drives the pattern formation layer to generate cyclical activation of flexor and extensor motoneurons.  Loading of the activated muscles (e.g. supporting the moving body mass) is resisted by the muscles' intrinsic spring-like properties. This is equivalent to displacement feedback.  Force and displacement sensed by [[muscle spindle]] and [[Golgi tendon organ]] afferents reflexly activate motoneurons. A key role of these afferents is to adjust the timing of phase transitions, presumably by influencing or overriding the CPG timer. Modified from &lt;ref name="P&amp;E"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Prochazka A, Ellaway PH |chapter= Sensory systems in the control of movement  |title= Comprehensive Physiology, Supplement 29: Handbook of Physiology, Exercise: Regulation and Integration of Multiple Systems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons in conjunction with the American Physiological Society |location=NY |year=2012 |pages=2615‐2627}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fig. 1 provides a simplified schematic that summarizes these proposed mechanisms. A command specifying desired body velocity descends from higher centers to the MLR, which drives the spinal locomotor CPG. The CPG timer produces the appropriate cadence and phase durations and the pattern formation layer modulates the motoneuronal outputs.&lt;ref name="P&amp;E"/&gt;  The activated muscles resist stretch through their own intrinsic biomechanical properties, providing a rapid form of length and velocity feedback control. Reflexes mediated by [[Golgi tendon organ]] and other afferents provide additional load compensation, but the main role of sensory input may be to adjust or override the CPG at stance-swing-stance transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donelan JM, McVea DA, Pearson KG |title= Force regulation of ankle extensor muscle activity in freely walking cats |journal= J Neurophysiol |volume=101 |issue= 1 |pages=360–371|year=2009 |doi=10.1152/jn.90918.2008|pmid= 19019974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[#Neuromodulation|Neuromodulation]], the human locomotive CPG is very adaptable and can respond to sensory input. It receives input from the brainstem as well as from the environment to keep the network regulated. Newer studies have not only confirmed the presence of the CPG for human locomotion, but also confirmed its robustness and adaptability. For example, Choi and Bastian showed that the networks responsible for human walking are adaptable on short and long timescales. They showed adaptation to different gait patterns and different walking contexts. Also, they showed that different motor patterns can adapt independently. Adults could even walk on treadmills going in a different direction for each leg. This study showed that independent networks control forward and backward walking and that networks controlling each leg can adapt independently and be trained to walk independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi JT, Bastian AJ |title=Adaptation reveals independent control networks for human walking |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=1055–62 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17603479 |doi=10.1038/nn1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, humans also possess a central pattern generator for locomotion that is capable not only of rhythmic pattern generation but also remarkable adaptation and usefulness in a wide variety of situations.

===Respiration===
A three-phase model is the classical view of the respiratory CPG. The phases of the respiratory CPG are characterized by the rhythmic activity of: (1) the phrenic nerve during inspiration; (2) recurrent laryngeal nerve branches that innervate the thyroarytenoid muscle during the last stage of expiration; (3) the internal intercostal nerve branches that innervate the triangularis sterni muscle during the second stage of expiration. The rhythmicity of these nerves is classically viewed as originating from a single rhythm generator. In this model, phasing is produced by reciprocal synaptic inhibition between groups of sequentially active interneurons.

Nevertheless, an alternative model has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Janczewski WA, Feldman JL |title=Distinct rhythm generators for inspiration and expiration in the juvenile rat |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=570 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=407–20 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16293645 |pmc=1464316 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2005.098848 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16293645}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinforced by certain experimental data. According to this model, respiratory rhythm is generated by two coupled anatomically distinct rhythm generators, one in the [[pre-Boetzinger complex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1683005 |vauthors=Smith JC, Ellenberger HH, Ballanyi K, Richter DW, Feldman JL |title=Pre-Bötzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5032 |pages=726–9 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1683005 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1683005 |pmc=3209964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in the [[retrotrapezoid nucleus]] / parafacial [[respiratory group]]. Further survey provided evidence to the hypothesis that one of the networks is responsible for inspiration rhythm and the other for expiration rhythm. Therefore, inspiration and expiration are distinct functions and one does not induce the other, as is the common belief, but one of two dominates the behavior by generating a faster rhythm.

===Swallowing===
Swallowing involves the coordinated contraction of more than 25 pairs of muscles in the oropharynx, larynx and esophagus, which are active during an oropharyngeal phase, followed by the primary esophageal peristalsis. Swallowing depends on a CPG located in the medulla oblongata, which involves several brain stem motor nuclei and two main groups of interneurons: a dorsal swallowing group (DSG) in the [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] and a ventral swallowing group (VSG) located in the ventrolateral medulla above the nucleus ambiguus. Neurons in the DSG are responsible for the generation of the swallowing pattern, while those in the VSG distribute the commands to the various motoneuronal pools. As in other CPGs, the functioning of the central network can be modulated by peripheral and central inputs, so that the swallowing pattern is adapted to the size of the bolus.

Within this network, central inhibitory connections play a major role, producing a rostrocaudal inhibition that parallels the rostrocaudal anatomy of the swallowing tract. Thus, when the neurons controlling the proximal parts of the tract are active, those that command more distal parts are inhibited. Apart from the type of connection between the neurons, intrinsic properties of the neurons, especially those of NTS neurons, probably also contribute to the shaping and timing of the swallowing pattern.

The swallowing CPG is a flexible CPG. This means that at least some of the swallowing neurons may be multifunctional neurons and belong to pools of neurons that are common to several CPGs. One such CPG is the respiratory one, which has been observed interacting with the swallowing CPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dick TE, Oku Y, Romaniuk JR, Cherniack NS |title=Interaction between central pattern generators for breathing and swallowing in the cat |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=465 |pages=715–30 |date=June 1993 |pmid=8229859 |pmc=1175455 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8229859 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grélot L, Barillot JC, Bianchi AL |title=Pharyngeal motoneurones: respiratory-related activity and responses to laryngeal afferents in the decerebrate cat |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=336–44 |year=1989 |pmid=2599043 |doi=10.1007/bf00228905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhythm generators===
Central pattern generators can also play a role in rhythm generation for other functions in vertebrate animals. For example, the rat vibrissa system uses an unconventional CPG for whisking movements. "Like other CPGs, the whisking generator can operate without cortical input or sensory feedback. However, unlike other CPGs, vibrissa motoneurons actively participate in rhythmogenesis by converting tonic serotonergic inputs into the patterned motor output responsible for movement of the vibrissae."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cramer NP, Li Y, Keller A |title=The whisking rhythm generator: a novel mammalian network for the generation of movement |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=2148–58 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17202239 |pmc=1821005 |doi=10.1152/jn.01187.2006 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17202239|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.9770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breathing is another non-locomotive function of central pattern generators. For example, larval amphibians accomplish gas exchange largely through rhythmic ventilation of the gills. A study by Broch, et al. showed that lung ventilation in the tadpole brainstem may be driven by a pacemaker-like mechanism, whereas the respiratory CPG adapts in the adult bullfrog as it matures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broch L, Morales RD, Sandoval AV, Hedrick MS |title=Regulation of the respiratory central pattern generator by chloride-dependent inhibition during development in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=205 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1161–9 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11919275 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11919275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, CPGs hold a broad range of functions in the vertebrate animal and are widely adaptable and variable with age, environment and behavior.

===Mechanism of rhythmic generators: post-inhibitory rebound===

Rhythmicity in CPG's can also result from time-dependent cellular properties such as adaptation, delayed excitation, and post-inhibitory rebound (PIR). PIR is an intrinsic property that elicits rhythmic electrical activity by depolarizing the membrane once hyperpolarizing stimulus is gone. "It can be produced by several mechanisms including hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) or deinactivation of depolarization-activated inward currents" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Angstadt JD, Grassmann JL, Theriault KM, Levasseur SM |title=Mechanisms of postinhibitory rebound and its modulation by serotonin in excitatory swim motor neurons of the medicinal leech |journal=J. Comp. Physiol. A |volume=191 |issue=8 |pages=715–32 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15838650 |doi=10.1007/s00359-005-0628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once inhibition has ceased, this period of PIR can be explained as the time with increased neuronal excitability. It is the property of many CNS neurons that sometimes results in action potential "bursts" following immediately after inhibitory synaptic input."Because of this, it has been suggested that PIR may contribute to the maintenance of oscillatory activity in neural networks that are characterized by mutual inhibitory connections, like those involved in locomotor behaviors. In addition, PIR is often included as an element in computational models of neural networks that involve mutual inhibition" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.185.4146.181 |vauthors=Perkel DH, Mulloney B |title=Motor pattern production in reciprocally inhibitory neurons exhibiting postinhibitory rebound |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4146 |pages=181–3 |date=July 1974 |pmid=4834220 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4834220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the "PIR in crayfish stretch receptor neurons is caused by recovery from adaptation during the course of inhibitory hyperpolarization. One feature of that system is that PIR only occurs if the hyperpolarization is imposed on a background of excitation, caused in this case by stretch. They also found that PIR can be elicited in the stretch receptor by hyperpolarizing current pulses. This was an important finding because it showed that PIR is an intrinsic property of the postsynaptic neuron, related to the membrane potential change associated with inhibition but independent of transmitter receptors or presynaptic properties. The latter conclusion has stood the test of time, marking PIR as a robust property of CNS neurons in a wide variety of contexts." &lt;ref&gt;Gerasimov, V. D., P. G. Kostyuk, and V. A. Maiskii. 1966. "Reactions of giant neurons to break of hyperpolarizing current" Fed. Proc. Transl. Suppl, 25T438-T442&lt;/ref&gt;
This cellular property can most easily be seen in the Lamprey neural circuit. The swimming movement is produced by alternating neural activity between the left and right side of the body, causing it to bend back and forth while creating oscillating movements. While the Lamprey is bent to the left, there is reciprocal inhibition on the right side causing it to relax due to hyperpolarization. Immediately after this hyperopolarizing stimulus, the interneurons use post-inhibitory rebound to initiate activity in the right side. Depolarization of the membrane causes it to contract while reciprocal inhibition is now applied to the left side.

===Functions in invertebrates===
As described earlier, CPGs can also function in a variety of ways in invertebrate animals. In the mollusc ''Tritonia'', a CPG modulates reflexive withdrawal, escape swimming and crawling.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt; CPGs are also used in flight in locusts and for respiration systems in other insects.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Central pattern generators play a broad role in all animals and show amazing variability and adaptability in almost all cases.

===Other theories===
The classical view of movement control prior to works of Brown attributed the function of muscle pattern generation largely to sensory feedback mechanisms. In this light, the pattern generator can be considered as an intrinsic spinal processor that corrects imperfect sensory feedback and adapts central input to this optimized peripheral input.&lt;ref&gt;Kuo AD (2002) The relative roles of feedforward and feedback in the control of rhythmic movements. Motor Control 6:129-145&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] that uses computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena.

=== Background ===

In the past four decades, computational sociology has been introduced and gaining popularity {{According to whom|date=June 2017}}.  This has been used primarily for modeling or building explanations of social processes and are depending on the emergence of complex behavior from simple activities.&lt;ref name="EACICS"&gt;Salgado, Mauricio, and Nigel Gilbert. "Emergence and communication in computational sociology." Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 43.1 (2013): 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea behind emergence is that properties of any bigger system don't always have to be properties of the components that the system is made of.&lt;ref&gt;Macy, Michael W., and Robert Willer. "From factors to factors: computational sociology and agent-based modeling." Annual review of sociology 28.1 (2002): 143-166.&lt;/ref&gt;  The people responsible for the introduction of the idea of emergence are Alexander, Morgan, and Broad, who were classical emergentists.  The time at which these emergentists came up with this concept and method was during the time of the early twentieth century.  The aim of this method was to find a good enough accommodation between two different and extreme ontologies, which were reductionist materialism and dualism.&lt;ref name="EACICS"/&gt; 

While emergence has had a valuable and important role with the foundation of Computational Sociology, there are those who do not necessarily agree.  One major leader in the field, Epstein, doubted the use because there were aspects that are unexplainable.  Epstein put up a claim against emergentism, in which he says it "is precisely the generative sufficiency of the parts that constitutes the whole's explanation".&lt;ref name="EACICS"/&gt;

Agent-based models have had a historical influence on Computational Sociology.   These models first came around in the 1960s, and were used to simulate control and feedback processes in organizations, cities, etc.  During the 1970s, the application introduced the use of individuals as the main units for the analyses and used bottom-up strategies for modeling behaviors.  The last wave occurred in the 1980s.  At this time, the models were still bottom-up; the only difference is that the agents interact interdependently.&lt;ref name="EACICS"/&gt;

===Systems theory and structural functionalism===
{{main|Systems theory|Structural functionalism}}
In the post-war era, [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyser]], [[John von Neumann]]'s [[Von Neumann cellular automata|cellular automata]], [[Norbert Wiener]]'s [[cybernetics]], and [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]] became influential paradigms for modeling and understanding complexity in technical systems. In response, scientists in disciplines such as physics, biology, electronics, and economics began to articulate a [[systems theory|general theory of systems]] in which all natural and physical phenomena are manifestations of interrelated elements in a system that has common patterns and properties. Following [[Émile Durkheim]]'s call to analyze complex modern society ''[[sui generis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Émile |last=Durkheim |title=The Division of Labor in Society |location=New York, NY |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; post-war structural functionalist sociologists such as [[Talcott Parsons]] seized upon these theories of systematic and hierarchical interaction among constituent components to attempt to generate grand unified sociological theories, such as the [[AGIL paradigm]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kenneth D. |last1=Bailey |editor=Jonathan H. Turner |chapter=Systems Theory |title=Handbook of Sociological Theory |publisher=Springer Science |year=2006 |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-387-32458-5 |pages=379–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists such as [[George Homans]] argued that sociological theories should be formalized into hierarchical structures of propositions and precise terminology from which other propositions and hypotheses could be derived and operationalized into empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Computational Sociology |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |publisher=Blackwell Reference Online |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-85 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |editor=Ritzer, George|isbn=978-1-4051-2433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because computer algorithms and programs had been used as early as 1956 to test and validate mathematical theorems, such as the [[four color theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crevier |first=D. |year=1993 |title=AI: The Tumultuous History of the Search for Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars anticipated that similar computational approaches could "solve" and "prove" analogously formalized problems and theorems of social structures and dynamics.

===Macrosimulation and microsimulation===
{{main|System dynamics|Microsimulation}}
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists used increasingly available computing technology to perform macro-simulations of control and feedback processes in organizations, industries, cities, and global populations. These models used differential equations to predict population distributions as holistic functions of other systematic factors such as inventory control, urban traffic, migration, and disease transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jay |last=Forrester |year=1971 |title=World Dynamics |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/opre.26.2.237|title=Using Simulation to Develop and Validate Analytic Models: Some Case Studies |first1=Edward J. |last1=Ignall |first2=Peter |last2=Kolesar |first3=Warren E. |last3=Walker |journal=Operations Research |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=1978 |pages=237–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although simulations of social systems received substantial attention in the mid-1970s after the [[Club of Rome]] published reports predicting that policies promoting exponential economic growth would eventually bring global environmental catastrophe ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World |last1=Meadows |first1=DL |last2=Behrens |first2=WW |last3=Meadows |first3=DH |last4=Naill |first4=RF |last5= Randers |first5=J |last6=Zahn |first6=EK |year=1974 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inconvenient conclusions led many authors to seek to discredit the models, attempting to make the researchers themselves appear unscientific.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer View of Disaster Is Rebutted |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 18, 1974|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/18/archives/computer-view-of-disaster-is-rebutted.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to avoid the same fate, many social scientists turned their attention toward micro-simulation models to make forecasts and study policy effects by modeling aggregate changes in state of individual-level entities rather than the changes in distribution at the population level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0167-2681(90)90038-F|title=From engineering to microsimulation : An autobiographical reflection |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |year=1990 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=5–27 |first=Guy H. |last=Orcutt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these micro-simulation models did not permit individuals to interact or adapt and were not intended for basic theoretical research.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

===Cellular automata and agent-based modeling===
{{main|Cellular automata|agent-based modeling}}
The 1970s and 1980s were also a time when physicists and mathematicians were attempting to model and analyze how simple component units, such as atoms, give rise to global properties, such as complex material properties at low temperatures, in magnetic materials, and within turbulent flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cellular automata machines: a new environment for modeling |first1=Tommaso |last1=Toffoli |first2=Norman |last2=Margolus | author2-link = Norman Margolus |year=1987 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using cellular automata, scientists were able to specify systems consisting of a grid of cells in which each cell only occupied some finite states and changes between states were solely governed by the states of immediate neighbors. Along with advances in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[microcomputer]] power, these methods contributed to the development of "[[chaos theory]]" and "[[complex systems|complexity theory]]" which, in turn, renewed interest in understanding complex physical and social systems across disciplinary boundaries.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt; Research organizations explicitly dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of complexity were also founded in this era: the [[Santa Fe Institute]] was established in 1984 by scientists based at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and the BACH group at the [[University of Michigan]] likewise started in the mid-1980s.

This cellular automata paradigm gave rise to a third wave of social simulation emphasizing agent-based modeling. Like micro-simulations, these models emphasized bottom-up designs but adopted four key assumptions that diverged from microsimulation: autonomy, interdependency, simple rules, and adaptive behavior.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; Agent-based models are less concerned with predictive accuracy and instead emphasize theoretical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A simulation of the structure of academic science |journal=Sociological Research Online |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=1997 |first=Nigel |last=Gilbert |url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/socresonline/2/2/3.html |doi=10.5153/sro.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, mathematician and political scientist [[Robert Axelrod]] and evolutionary biologist [[W.D. Hamilton]] published a major paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' titled "The Evolution of Cooperation" which used an agent-based modeling approach to demonstrate how social cooperation based upon reciprocity can be established and stabilized in a [[prisoner's dilemma]] game when agents followed simple rules of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of Cooperation |first1=Robert |last1=Axelrod |first2=William D. |last2=Hamilton |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue=4489 |pages=1390–1396 |doi=10.1126/science.7466396|pmid=7466396 |date=March 27, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axelrod and Hamilton demonstrated that individual agents following a simple rule set of (1) cooperate on the first turn and (2) thereafter replicate the partner's previous action were able to develop "norms" of cooperation and sanctioning in the absence of canonical sociological constructs such as demographics, values, religion, and culture as preconditions or mediators of cooperation.&lt;ref name="Cooperation"/&gt; Throughout the 1990s, scholars like [[William Sims Bainbridge]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Michael Macy]],  and [[John Skvoretz]] developed multi-agent-based models of [[generalized reciprocity]], [[prejudice]], [[social influence]], and organizational [[information processing]]. In 1999, [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: ''Simulation for the social scientist'' and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

===Data mining and social network analysis===
{{main|Data mining|Social network analysis}}
Independent from developments in computational models of social systems, social network analysis emerged in the 1970s and 1980s from advances in graph theory, statistics, and studies of social structure as a distinct analytical method and was articulated and employed by sociologists like [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]], [[Harrison White]], [[Linton Freeman]], [[J. Clyde Mitchell]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[Ronald Burt]], and [[Barry Wellman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science |first=Linton C. |last=Freeman |publisher=Empirical Press |location=Vancouver, BC |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing pervasiveness of computing and telecommunication technologies throughout the 1980s and 1990s demanded analytical techniques, such as [[network theory|network analysis]] and [[multilevel modeling]], that could scale to increasingly complex and large data sets. The most recent wave of computational sociology, rather than employing simulations, uses network analysis and advanced statistical techniques to analyze large-scale computer databases of electronic proxies for behavioral data. Electronic records such as email and instant message records, hyperlinks on the [[World Wide Web]], mobile phone usage, and discussion on [[Usenet]] allow social scientists to directly observe and analyze social behavior at multiple points in time and multiple levels of analysis without the constraints of traditional empirical methods such as interviews, participant observation, or survey instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/323/5915/721 |title=Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science|first9=J|last10=Gutmann|first10=M.|last11=Jebara|first11=T.|last12=King|first12=G.|last13=Macy|first13=M.|last14=Roy|first14=D.|last15=Van Alstyne|first15=M.|last9=Fowler|first8=N|last8=Contractor|first7=N|last7=Christakis|first6=D|last6=Brewer|first5=AL|last5=Barabasi|first4=S |journal=Science|last4=Aral |date=February 6, 2009|first3=L |volume=323|pmid=19197046 |issue=5915|last3=Adamic |pages=721–723|pmc=2745217 |doi=10.1126/science.1167742 |first1=David |last1=Lazer |first2=Alex |last2=Pentland |display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued improvements in [[machine learning]] algorithms likewise have permitted social scientists and entrepreneurs to use novel techniques to identify latent and meaningful patterns of social interaction and evolution in large electronic datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jaideep |last1=Srivastava |first2=Robert |last2=Cooley |first3=Mukund |last3=Deshpande |first4=Pang-Ning |last4=Tan |journal=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining |title=Web usage mining: discovery and applications of usage patterns from Web data|volume=1 |year=2000 |pages=12–23 |doi=10.1145/846183.846188|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X|title=The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine |first1=Sergey |last1=Brin |first2=Lawrence |last2=Page |journal=Computer Networks and ISDN Systems |volume=30 |issue=1–7 |pages=107–117 |date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, 
turning textual data into network data.  The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Network analysis of narrative content in large corpora|author1=S Sudhahar|author2=G De Fazio|author3=R Franzosi|author4=N Cristianini|journal=Natural Language Engineering|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–32|year=2013|doi=10.1017/S1351324913000247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantitative Narrative Analysis|author=Roberto Franzosi|publisher=Emory University|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Computational content analysis===
[[Content analysis]] has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a "[[big data]]" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. [[Gender bias]], [[readability]], content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on [[text mining]] methods over millions of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=I.

The analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has been pioneered by Dzogang et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dzogang|first=Fabon|last2=Lansdall-Welfare|first2=Thomas|last3=Team|first3=FindMyPast Newspaper|last4=Cristianini|first4=Nello|date=2016-11-08|title=Discovering Periodic Patterns in Historical News|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165736|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=11|pages=e0165736|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165736|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5100883|pmid=27824911}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered in historical newspapers. A similar analysis was performed on social media, again revealing strongly periodic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Seasonal Fluctuations in Collective Mood Revealed by Wikipedia Searches and Twitter Posts F Dzogang, T Lansdall-Welfare, N Cristianini - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, Workshop on ''Data Mining'' in Human Activity Analysis
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Computational sociology, as with any field of study, faces a set of challenges.&lt;ref name="MCSS"&gt;Conte, Rosaria, et al. "Manifesto of computational social science." The European Physical Journal Special Topics 214.1 (2012): 325-346.&lt;/ref&gt; These challenges need to be handled meaningfully so as to make the maximum impact on society.

===Levels and their interactions===
Each society that is formed tends to be in one level or the other and there exists tendencies of interactions between and across these levels. Levels need not only be micro-level or macro-level in nature. There can be intermediate levels in which a society exists say - groups, networks, communities etc.&lt;ref name="MCSS" /&gt;

The question however arises as to how to identify these levels and how they come into existence? And once they are in existence how do they interact within themselves and with other levels?

If we view entities(agents) as nodes and the connections between them as the edges, we see the formation of networks. The connections in these networks do not come about based on just objective relationships between the entities, rather they are decided upon by factors chosen by the participating entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egu´ıluz|first1=V. M.|last2=Zimmermann|first2=M. G.|last3=Cela-Conde|first3=C. J.|last4=San Miguel|first4=M.|title=American Journal of Sociology|issue=2005|pages=110, 977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge with this process is that, it is difficult to identify when a set of entities will form a network. These networks may be of trust networks, co-operation networks, dependence networks etc. There have been cases where heterogeneous set of entities have shown to form strong and meaningful networks among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sichman|first1=J. S.|last2=Conte|first2=R.|title=Computational &amp; Mathematical Organization Theory|issue=2002|pages=8(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrhardt|first1=G.|last2=Marsili|first2=M.|last3=Vega-Redondo|first3=F.|title=Physical Review E|issue=2006|pages=74(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed previously, societies fall into levels and in one such level, the individual level, a micro-macro link&lt;ref&gt;Billari, Francesco C. Agent-based computational modelling: applications in demography, social, economic and environmental sciences. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the interactions which create higher-levels. There are a set of questions that needs to be answered regarding these Micro-Macro links. How they are formed? When do they converge? What is the feedback pushed to the lower levels and how are they pushed?

Another major challenge in this category concerns the validity of information and their sources. In recent years there has been a boom in information gathering and processing. However, little attention was paid to the spread of false information between the societies. Tracing back the sources and finding ownership of such information is difficult.

===Culture modeling===
The evolution of the networks and levels in the society brings about cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Centola|first1=D.|last2=Gonz´alez-Avella|first2=J. C.|last3=Egu´ıluz|first3=V. M.|last4=San Miguel|first4=M.|title=Journal of Conflict Resolution|issue=2007|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thought which arises however is that, when people tend to interact and become more accepting of other cultures and beliefs, how is it that diversity still persists? Why is there no convergence? A major challenge is how to model these diversities. Are there external factors like mass media, locality of societies etc. which influence the evolution or persistence of cultural diversities?{{Citation needed|reason=Sounds just like personal thoughts|date=May 2017}}

===Experimentation and evaluation===
Any study or modelling when combined with experimentation needs to be able to address the questions being asked. [[Computational social science]] deals with large scale data and the challenge becomes much more evident as the scale grows. How would one design informative simulations on a large scale? And even if a large scale simulation is brought up, how is the evaluation supposed to be performed?

===Model choice and model complexities===
Another challenge is identifying the models that would best fit the data and the complexities of these models. These models would help us predict how societies might evolve over time and provide possible explanations on how things work.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, Michael. When less is more: Tradeoffs and idealization in model building. Diss. stanford university, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Generative models====
Generative models helps us to perform extensive qualitative analysis in a controlled fashion. A model proposed by Epstein, is the agent-based simulation, which talks about identifying an initial set of heterogeneous entities(agents) and observe their evolution and growth based on simple local rules.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joshua M. Generative social science: Studies in agent-based computational modeling. Princeton University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

But what are these local rules? How does one identify them for a set of heterogeneous agents? Evaluation and impact of these rules state a whole new set of difficulties.

====Heterogeneous or ensemble models====
Integrating simple models which perform better on individual tasks to form a Hybrid model is an approach that can be looked into{{Citation needed|reason=unsupported claims|date=May 2017}}. These models can offer better performance and understanding of the data. However the trade-off of identifying and having a deep understanding of the interactions between these simple models arises when one needs to come up with one combined, well performing model. Also, coming up with tools and applications to help analyse and visualize the data based on these hybrid models is another added challenge.

==Impact==
Computational sociology can bring impacts to science, technology and society.&lt;ref name="MCSS" /&gt;

===Impact on science===
In order for the study of computational sociology to be effective, there has to be valuable innovations. These innovation can be of the form of new data analytics tools, better models and algorithms. The advent of such innovation will be a boon for the scientific community in large. {{Citation needed|reason=citation for claim on innovation and the type of innovation|date=May 2017}}

===Impact on society===
One of the major challenges of computational sociology is the modelling of social processes {{Citation needed|reason=to support the claim for need of modeling of social processes|date=May 2017}}. Various law and policy makers would be able to see efficient and effective paths to issue new guidelines and the mass in general would be able to evaluate and gain fair understanding of the options presented in front of them enabling an open and well balanced decision process. {{Citation needed|reason=unsupported claims|date=May 2017}}.

'''Cutter Bill''' (1955–1982) was a [[Quarter Horse]] stallion and the 1962 [[National Cutting Horse Association|National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA)]] Open World Champion [[cutting horse]] with record earnings for the year.  He also won the 1962 [[American Quarter Horse Association|American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA)]] Honor Roll cutting horse award which made him the first horse to have won both the NCHA and AQHA awards in the same year.&lt;ref name=AQHA-CB&gt;{{cite web |title= Cutter Bill |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/c/cutter-bill/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;Martindale ''Legends 7'' pp. 6–21&lt;/ref&gt; Cutter Bill was owned by the flamboyant Texas millionaire [[Rex Cauble]] who in 1962 decided to campaign Cutter Bill with Sonny Perry in the saddle showing him. In order for Cutter Bill to compete in as many shows as possible that year, Cauble flew Cutter Bill and three other horses on his private jet to various shows.&lt;ref name=Groves&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Golden Age Of Cutter Bill | author=Groves, Lesli | journal=America's Horse | date=June 1993 | volume=7 | issue=6 | pages=48-49 | ISSN=15228983 | publisher=American Quarter Horse Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
It was R. L. Underwood's [[linebreeding]] program to preserve the Copperbottom bloodlines&lt;ref name=Short&gt;Short ''Unregistered Foundation Sires'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; that produced Cutter Bill, a 1955 [[Palomino horse|palomino]] [[Quarter Horse]] [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]], [[AQHA]] registration #53703.&lt;ref name=StudBook&gt;American Quarter Horse Association ''Official Stud Book and Registry Combined 6–10'' p. 902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedigree&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/cutter+bill Cutter Bill Pedigree at All Breed Pedigree] retrieved on June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His sire, Buddy Dexter, was the [[inbred]] [[Progeny (genetic descendant)|progeny]] of a father to daughter cross along with some [[linebreeding]] throughout the pedigree.&lt;ref name=Pedigree/&gt;

In 1956, Cauble and his then-wife, Josephine, attended Underwood's dispersal sale with the intention of buying broodmares to breed to Cauble's foundation Quarter Horse sires, [[Wimpy P-1(horse)|Wimpy P-1]], Silver King P-183 and Hard Twist P-555.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; Josephine was attracted to a yearling palomino colt that was tied to a fence at the sale. She persuaded Cauble to bid on him, which he agreed to do up to a set price of US$1,000.00 but by the time the bidding was over, Cauble had paid US$2500 for the colt. He wasn't as impressed by the colt's conformation as he was by his demeanor.  Little did he know that colt would grow up to be Cutter Bill, a legend in the Quarter Horse world.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; Cauble broke Cutter Bill himself, and for the first couple of years used him to [[Horse breeding#Covering the mare|tease]] mares in preparation for breeding them to his foundation stallions.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;

==Cutting competition==
Cutter Bill was started on cattle in June 1958.&lt;ref name=AQHA-CB/&gt; "Cauble said the first good trainer Cutter Bill met was Willis Bennett of Gail, Texas",&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; a trainer Cauble hired to work at his ranch in Crockett, Texas. Bennett showed Cutter Bill to earn 1959 AQHA High Point Junior Cutting Horse. He was later trained by Willis Bennett's older brother Milt, who owned and rode Snooky to win the 1955 NCHA World Championship.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; Other trainers who rode Cutter Bill include Connie Wills, Roy Huffaker, John Carter and Tommy Arhopulous.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;

In 1962, Sonny Perry, who won the 1961 NCHA World Championship riding Senor George, asked Cauble if he could haul Cutter Bill for the world title.  The pair set the 1962 NCHA earnings record capturing the NCHA World Championship and also earned the AQHA Honor Roll award. He was the 1963 NCHA Reserve World Champion, earning a total of $35,964.05 in NCHA sponsored cuttings. In 1964, Rex Cauble showed Cutter Bill in the non-professional division, and won the 1964 NCHA Non-Pro World Championship title.&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; His AQHA awards in 1962 included High Point Cutting Horse, as well as AQHA Champion and Performance Register of Merit awards. He was also an AQHA Superior Cutting Horse.&lt;ref name=QHR&gt; Wagoner ''Quarter Horse Reference 1974 Edition'' pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second horse to win both the NCHA World Champion title and the AQHA High Point Cutting title, Poco Stampede was the first, but he was the first to do it in the same year.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;

==Progeny==
Among his famous offspring were Cutters Indian who was the 1972 AQHA High Point Jr. Western Pleasure Stallion, the 1972 AQHA High Point 3-year-old Halter Stallion, and the 1972 AQHA High Point Jr. Trail Stallion, Bill's Highness, Cutter's First, Bill's Jazabell, Cutter's Lad, Pecos Billie, Blaze Face Bill, Cutter's Streak and Bill's Loceta.&lt;ref name=Pitzer&gt;Pitzer ''The Most Influential Quarter Horse Sires'' pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Bill's Lady Day won the 1987 AQHA Senior [[Calf Roping]] World Champion title and Cutter's Rocket won two youth World Championships in [[working cow horse|working cowhorse]] in 1983 and 1985. Royal Cutter won the 1971 National Reined Cow Horse Association's Snaffle Bit Futurity and then later won the [[hackamore]] and bridle sweepstakes held by the same organization.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;
==Recognition==
Cutter Bill gained further fame when Rex Cauble opened two upscale western apparel stores and named them Cutter Bill's Western World.  Cutter Bill placed his hoofs in wet cement outside the Houston store at its opening in 1967.&lt;ref name=AQHA-CB /&gt; However, Cauble lost the stores after being convicted in the [[Cowboy Mafia]] drug smuggling trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government nears settlement with Cauble Enterprises |author=Associated Press |newspaper=The Paris News |date=June 5, 1985 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/13942299/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutter Bill died in the fall of 1982 and was buried on the Cauble Ranch in Denton, TX.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; He was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]] in 2003, the same year Rex Cauble died.&lt;ref name=AQHA-CB /&gt;

"'''Dead Celebrities'''" is the eighth episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 189th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 7, 2009. In the episode, [[List of South Park families#Ike Broflovski|Ike]] is haunted by the [[ghosts]] of dead celebrities until [[Michael Jackson]], who refuses to accept death, possesses him.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States (specifically for adults, with coarse language). "Dead Celebrities" included references to several actors, singers and famous people who died before or during the summer of 2009, when ''South Park'' was on a mid-season hiatus. Among the celebrities featured in the episode were [[Billy Mays]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Natasha Richardson]], [[Bea Arthur]], [[David Carradine]], [[DJ AM]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Ricardo Montalbán]], and [[Steve McNair]]. "Dead Celebrities" also parodied the films ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]].''

The reality series ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'' and its stars, [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], were mocked in the episode. Hawes and Wilson said they loved the parody and encouraged fans to watch the show on their [[Twitter]] accounts. A subplot claimed food at the [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]] resulted in customers defecating blood, a claim which was disputed by the restaurant chain within days of the episode's broadcast. "Dead Celebrities" received generally mixed reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], "Dead Celebrities" was seen by 2.67 million overall households.

==Plot==
[[List of South Park families#Ike Broflovski|Ike]] is terrified by frequent encounters with the ghosts of recently deceased celebrities. He is haunted by people such as [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[David Carradine]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[DJ AM]], and especially [[Billy Mays]], who repeatedly tries selling Ike products from the afterlife. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is terrified when he finds out about the ghost his brother is encountering and tells [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] about the encounters. Cartman, who does not initially care, decides to help when Kyle mentions that one of the ghosts haunting Ike is Billy Mays. Cartman then shows commercials that feature Mays on television, implying that he is an enthusiastic supporter of a product which Mays promoted, called "ChipotlAway", which cleans bloodstains from people's underwear caused by eating food from [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]]. The boys call the team from the reality television series ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'' in to help, but they quickly, fearfully start ascribing supernatural meaning to random, ambient, environmental noises, before urinating and defecating on themselves, and finally running from the house. Eventually, Ike goes into a [[coma]] because of his multiple experiences with the ghosts.

The boys seek help from a [[mediumship|medium]] (a parody of [[Zelda Rubinstein]]'s character in ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''), who explains the celebrities are trapped in [[purgatory]], which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. The medium manages to contact the spirits and tell them that they have passed on. Much to her surprise, the celebrities say that they all accept the fact. Two deceased celebrities, [[CBS News]] anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Patrick Swayze]], tell her that [[Michael Jackson]]'s refusal to acknowledge [[Death of Michael Jackson|his death]] is the main cause of them being trapped. Some of the celebrities help the medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive, but also a little [[White race|white]] [[girl]]. His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which flings the medium out the window of Ike's hospital room, where she falls to her death. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory, which resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, [[flight attendant]]s and pilot voice-over announcements.

After the energy disturbance, Jackson's [[Spirit possession|spirit takes over Ike's body]], causing Ike to speak, sing and dance like Jackson himself. The boys find from online research that the only way to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a [[child beauty pageant]] for young girls. Dressed like a little girl, Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's "[[You Are Not Alone]]," but they are promptly [[arrest]]ed for [[masturbation|masturbating]] [[Pedophilia|while watching the children]], leaving a single, unimpressed female judge (much to the shock of the boys, who were unaware of the men's lewd acts and considered them the best judges). When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. One of the other contestants is [[Child abuse|physically beaten]] by her mother for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed like a little girl.

Later on, Jackson and the other celebrities in purgatory are reunited and they are finally able to lift off. Initially happy, they are soon taken to [[Hell]]. To their annoyance, however, the flight attendant tells them that they must again wait as Hell is a [[gate (airport)|tow gate]].

==Cultural references==
"Dead Celebrities" makes frequent mention of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a [[Twitter]] message that the claim was false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Walters |first=Chris |title=Chipotle Says Their Food Does Not Cause Underwear Blood |work=[[The Consumerist]] |date=October 9, 2009 |url=http://consumerist.com/2009/10/chipotle-says-their-food-does-not-cause-underwear-blood.html |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like [[McDonald's]] or [[Taco Bell]].{{Citation needed|reason=description where this episode commentary can be found is necessary|date=October 2010}} Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', which stars [[Haley Joel Osment]] as a young boy who can see ghosts. Ike's line, "I see dead celebrities", is a reference to that film's most famous line, "I see dead people."&lt;ref name="DiNunno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="E!" /&gt; The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by [[Zelda Rubinstein]] in the 1982 horror film, ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''.&lt;ref name="DiNunno" /&gt; Another film reference is made to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when the medium is flung from the window.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hale |first=Mike |title=Consigning Reality to Ghosts |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/arts/television/13paranormal.html |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dead Celebrities" also mocks the [[Syfy]] reality television series ''Ghost Hunters'' by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only to be frightened and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of [[stage mother]]s to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;

==Reception==
{{Quote box
 | quote  = "When I first learned of the premise of this episode, I was expecting some biting social commentary on our culture's obsession with celebrities and the hypocrisy of treating them like dirt when they're alive and practically worshiping them when they die. But the writers kept it simple, and just went for the laughs, and enough time had passed for the jokes to not seem ''too'' tasteless."

In its original American broadcast on October 7, 2009, "Dead Celebrities" was watched by 2.67 million overall households, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. It received a 1.8 rating/3 share, and a 1.5 rating/4 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Seidman |first=Robert |title=Wednesday October 7 cable ratings: ''Mythbusters'', ''South Park'', ''Real World / Road Rules: The Ruins'' and more |work=TV by the Numbers |date=October 8, 2009 |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/10/08/wednesday-october-7-cable-ratings-mythbusters-south-park-real-world-road-rules-the-ruins-and-more/30018 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u1hwoejZ?url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/10/08/wednesday-october-7-cable-ratings-mythbusters-south-park-real-world-road-rules-the-ruins-and-more/30018 |archivedate=November 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received generally mixed reviews. Ramsley Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' called "Dead Celebrities" one of the best episodes of the season, adding the jokes at the expense of the deceased were not too tasteless. He praised the parodies of ''The Sixth Sense'', ''Poltergeist'' and ''Ghost Hunters'', but said some jokes, like the masturbating judges at the children's beauty contest, were offensive and unfunny.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], stars of ''[[Ghosthunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', declared that "far from being offended or incensed [...] they loved being made fun of alongside Michael Jackson and Billy Mays.&lt;ref name=Popmatters&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sagers |first=Aaron |title=Syfy 'Ghost Hunters': Living Normally Within Paranormal Pop Culture |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=October 29, 2009 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/115513-syfy-ghost-hunters-living-normally-within-paranormal-pop-culture/ |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Delgado of ''iF Magazine'' said "Dead Celebrities" was an especially funny episode that also featured a "crapload of story" that was well-timed for the [[Halloween]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=TV Review: South Park: Season 13 – "Dead Celebrities" – Fall Season Premiere |work=iF Magazine |date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Modell of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called it "a decent episode", but felt the dead celebrities were too obvious targets for ''South Park'' satire, adding, "It's easy to make the same jokes that the rest of the world already has." Modell said the ''Sixth Sense'' and ''Poltergeist'' references "fell a little flat", but he praised the Chipotle subplot, which he called "beautifully random [and] totally ridiculous".&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the episode was in bad taste, but added, "I laughed until I choked". Tucker described the Michael Jackson impersonation as "first-rate" and felt the solution to freeing Jackson's spirit served as "a ruthless parody of child beauty pageants".&lt;ref name="EW" /&gt;

Ingela Ratledge of ''[[TV Guide]]'' favorably described the episode as the exact opposite of [[award show]] segments that reverentially pay homage to the year's departed celebrities, calling it "a wonderfully tasteless farewell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ratledge |first=Ingela |title=Watercooler: R.I.P. ...And LOL! |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=October 19, 2009 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue Bergerstein, an arts and celebrity writer with ''[[Examiner.com]]'', called "Dead Celebrities" a "new low" for ''South Park'', adding "It's not only tasteless but this episode just adds to the sadness currently experienced by all the mourning relatives."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Joshua Alston said few of the jokes in "Dead Celebrities" were funny, and so the mocking of celebrities "in the absence of laughs, felt tasteless and unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Alston |first=Joshua |title=The 'South Park' Death Knell? |date=March 24, 2010 |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/235376 |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', said many of the episodes seemed rehashed and predictable, especially those targeting Michael Jackson and children's beauty pageants. Sepinwall added he liked the Chipotle subplot, but commented, "Overall, 'Dead Celebrities' was a misfire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title=South Park, "Dead Celebrities": Ignorance, not bliss |work=What's Alan Watching? |date=October 8, 2010 |url=http://sepinwall.blogspot.com/2009/10/south-park-dead-celebrities-ignorance.html |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mitch Norton of the SLC Cartoon Analysis found the episode to be extremely funny. "Genius is not only found in the reference to the deaths of celebrities, but creates a new way to view death as a way to live on. We can view death as the end, or a new beginning to something else."

==Home release==
"Dead Celebrities", along with the thirteen other episodes from ''South Park'''s thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set and two-disc [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster |first=Dave |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=71969 |title=South Park Season 13 (R1/US BD) in March |publisher=DVD Times |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature ''Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios'', which discussed the process behind animating the show with ''Inside Xbox'' host [[Larry Hryb|Major Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Thirteenth Season Blu-ray Review |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date=March 5, 2010 |last=Liebman |first=Martin |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/South-Park-The-Complete-Thirteenth-Season-Blu-ray-Review/8807/ |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deleted scene from this episode is included on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Glendale location]] of [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries]] to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.&lt;ref name="Deleted Scene"&gt;{{cite video | people=Stone, Matt; Parker, Trey |date=2010|title=Deleted scene from the South Park episode "Dead Celebrities"| medium=DVD and Blu-ray Disc|publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Drift seeds''' (also '''sea beans''') and '''drift fruits''' are seeds and fruits adapted for long distance [[seed dispersal|dispersal]] by water.  Most are produced by tropical trees, and they can be found on distant beaches after drifting thousands of miles through [[ocean current]]s.  This method of propagation has helped many species of plant such as the [[Coconut]] colonize and establish themselves on previously barren islands. Consequently, drift seeds and fruits are of interest to scientists who study these currents.

In botanical terminology, a drift fruit is a kind of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], and drift seeds and fruits are [[wikt:disseminule|disseminules]].

Founded in July 1985, the '''Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' (ERIRAS) was originally an outgrowth of the general energy department at [[Institute for High Temperatures RAS]] (IVTAN).  The staff at the newly formed organization comprised professionals gathered from other scientific organizations.  At the time of its creation, ERIRAS’ challenge was to develop the basic content and quantitative substantiation for the Energy Program of the USSR.  The first director of ERIRAS was [[Lev Aleksandrovich Milentyev]], an Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  At present, Academician [[Aleksei Aleksandrovich Makarov]] is the director of the Institute. 

== Organization ==
The Institute employs approximately 80 staff members, of whom 65% are highly skilled specialists.  It comprises eight scientific departments: 

*the Laboratory for the study of the interconnections between economics and energy
*the Laboratory for the study of the improvement of energy consumption and energy savings
*the Laboratory for the modeling of [[energy market]]s
*the Laboratory for research on the methodology of energy policy development 
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of oil and gas systems
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of electricity and heat systems
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of the coal industry
*the Centre for the study of international energy markets

The Institute deploys a matrix organizational structure in order to maximize flexibility.  Thus, different departments can work together jointly and each can be modified according to the circumstances.

== Activities ==
The Institute’s mission is to find solutions to a wide range of contemporary challenges including: 
efficient energy production and consumption techniques to promote energy savings; appropriate pricing mechanisms for energy markets; and legislation, tax policy and other general issues related to domestic energy policy.

ERIRAS work is divided into the following research areas:

*the study of the regularities of energy development 
*the modeling of energy development
*the theory and methods of energy system studies 
*the creation of a scientific basis for energy policy and the mechanisms for its implementation 
*the identification of the rational spheres and magnitudes of energy savings, and the mechanisms for energy saving policy implementation which take into consideration environmental concerns
*the study of the priorities in energy technical policy
*the identification of rational mechanisms for the regulation of energy development within a market framework, including primary legislation, pricing techniques, and tax and investment policy
*the forecasting of energy markets
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the oil &amp; gas industry
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the energy sectors (electricity &amp; heat)
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the coal industry

The Institute’s work is based on complex mathematical modeling, a unique database, and advanced computer technologies.

Today, ERIRAS is a major scientific center that is at the forefront of fundamental and applied research.  The knowledge produced by ERIRAS provides the basis for energy development forecasting and policy in Russia, the CIS, and for international energy markets.

'''Esteban de Luca''' (August 2, 1786 — May 17, 1824) was an Argentine military officer, poet, and government official during the nation's early years.

== Life ==
Esteban de Luca y Patrón was born in [[Buenos Aires]]. His mother belonged to a wealthy [[Creole peoples|creole]] family, and his [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] father was a colonial administrator during the [[Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata]]. Educated at the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires|Royal College of San Carlos]], de Luca enlisted in the newly formed [[Patricios Regiment]] during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]] of 1806 and 1807, and attained the rank of Officer.

Shortly after these incidents, in which the invasions were thwarted, de Luca enrolled in the School of Mathematics established by [[Manuel Belgrano]], and became a skilled weapons engineer. He adapted designs for [[cannon]]s, [[munition]]s, and [[rifle]]s, copying these latter from weapons captured during the earlier conflict.

The [[May Revolution]] of 1810 prompted the [[Argentine War of Independence|wars for independence]]. The [[United Provinces of South America]] struggled to supply their troops, however, and in 1813, the Buenos Aires Munitions Works were established by the [[Primera Junta]] regime; de Luca was appointed director of the facility in 1814. One of only two such facilities (the other being in [[Tucumán]]), the munitions works forged [[gun]]s, [[carbine]]s, [[saber]]s, [[cannon]], [[artillery|ordnance]], and [[horseshoe]]s mainly with salvaged [[scrap iron]] and de Luca's adaptations.

De Luca was also an accomplished [[poet]]. He wrote, among other works, odes to General [[José de San Martín]], as well to his victories in the battles of [[Battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]], [[Battle of Maipú|Maipú]], San Martín's [[Peruvian War of Independence|Liberation of Peru]], and in eulogy to General [[Manuel Belgrano]]; his ''Marcha Patriótica'' was, from 1812 to 1813, the unofficial [[Argentine National Anthem]].

With the dissolution of the United Province, he put the munitions works at the service of the [[Province of Buenos Aires]], and although these were destroyed shortly afterward in the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)]], de Luca salvaged the facility and maintained it, albeit at minimal levels. A charge brought against him several months later of complicity in a plot by General [[Carlos María de Alvear]] against Governor [[Martín Rodríguez (politician)|Martín Rodríguez]] resulted in de Luca's acquittal; the factory, however, closed.
 
He was among the founders of the Buenos Aires Literary Society in 1822, and wrote for the two leading Buenos Aires periodicals of the time, ''La Abeja'' and ''El Argos''. De Luca's [[newspaper column|columns]] advocated at length for the westward expansion into the [[pampas]], and he became known also for his translations of works by [[Italian literature|Italian dramatist]] [[Vittorio Alfieri]] (numerous of whose plays were then produced in Buenos Aires).

De Luca was appointed secretary to diplomatic envoy Valentín Gómez, who in 1823 was entrusted to negotiate for the return of the ''[[Banda Oriental]]'' ([[Uruguay]]) by the [[Empire of Brazil]]. As they returned from a May 1824 round of talks in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[brigantine]] carrying them sank, and although Gómez survived, Esteban de Luca drowned in the [[Río de la Plata]] at age 37.

His home in Buenos Aires' [[San Telmo]] ward, the ''[[Casa de Esteban de Luca]]'', was declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]] in 1941.

'''"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon"''' was a  [[song]] written by [[Will A. Heelan]], and [[J. Fred Helf]] that was popular in the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The song followed the previous success of "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]", written in 1896 by [[Ernest Hogan]]. [[H. L. Mencken]] cites it as being one of the three [[coon songs]] which "firmly established the term ''coon'' in the American vocabulary".

The song was a musical hit of the day by A. M. Rothschild and Company in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Display Ad 15 -- No Title. (1901, September 15). Chicago Daily Tribune (1872-1963), p. 45.

(Document ID: 118471848).&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen'', [[Nick Clooney]] refers to the song as part of the "hit parade" of popular music one could use to measure the temper of the times when ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' premiered in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003), pp. 285-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The tune is repeatedly referred to in the literature as having the ability to incite violence merely by whistling it in the direction of an African American. It was also [[Marie Dressler|Marie Dressler's]] contribution to the 'coon' genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Marie Dressler: A Biography, With a Listing of Major Stage Performances, a Filmography and a Discography'' (Jefferson NC: McFarland &amp; Company, December 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lottie Gilson]], [[Bert Williams|Williams and Walker]], [[Frances Curran]], [[Hodges and Launchmere]], [[Libby and Bennett]], [[Zoa Matthews]], [[Johnnie Carroll]], [[Clarice Vance]], [[Gerie Gilson]], [[Joe Bonnell]], [[The Eldridges]] and "100 other artists" sang the song with "overwhelming success" according to its sheet music.

The song motivated the creation of the [[Pan-African flag]] in 1920 by the members of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Flag for Afro-Americans," ''[[Africa Times and Orient Review]]''; 1 (October 1912):134; Cited in ''RACE FIRST: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1987), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the ''[[Negro World]]'' weekly newspaper, [[Marcus Garvey]] was quoted as saying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garvey|first1=Marcus|title=Honorable Marcus Garvey, Gifted Man of Vision, Sets Out In Unanswerable Terms the Reasons Why Negroes Must Build in Africa|work=Negro World|issue=Vol XXII No. 6|publisher=Universal Negro Improvement Association|date=March 19, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics to "Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon" include the musical meme [[Four Eleven Forty Four|"four eleven forty four"]].

The '''extraterrestrial hypothesis''' ('''ETH''') proposes that some [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs) are best explained as being physical [[spacecraft]] occupied by [[extraterrestrial life]] or non-human aliens, or non occupied alien probes from [[extrasolar planet|other planets]] visiting [[Earth]].

==Etymology==
Origins of the term ''extraterrestrial hypothesis'' are unknown, but use in printed material on UFOs seems to date to at least the latter half of the 1960s.  French [[ufologist]] [[Jacques Vallée]] used it in his 1966 book ''Challenge to science: the UFO enigma''.  It was used in a publication by French engineer [[Aimé Michel]] in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michel |last=Aimé |year=1967 |title=The Truth About Flying Saucers |publisher=Pyramid Books |asin=B0007DRR38}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[James E. McDonald]] in a symposium in March 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WWNkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d3wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=892,4105658&amp;dq=extra-terrestrial-hypothesis&amp;hl=en|title=The Calgary Herald - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again by McDonald and [[James Harder]] while testifying before the Congressional Committee on Science and Astronautics, in July 1968.&lt;ref name=harder1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncas.sawco.com/ufosymposium/harder.html |title=Testimony of Dr. J. A. Harder before the Congressional Committee on Science and Astronautics, 29 July 1968 |date=October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206064749/http://ncas.sawco.com/ufosymposium/harder.html |archivedate=6 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skeptic [[Philip J. Klass]] used it in his 1968 book ''UFOs--Identified.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9bS1YhiSa4C&amp;q=%22extraterrestrial+hypothesis%22&amp;dq=%22extraterrestrial+hypothesis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CCBCTeHaMITGsAPDwuHgCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg|title=UFOs--identified|first=Philip J.|last=Klass|date=1 February 1968|publisher=Random House|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 physicist [[Edward Condon]] defined the "extraterrestrial hypothesis" or "ETH" as the "idea that ''some'' UFOs may be spacecraft sent to Earth from another civilization or space other than Earth, or on a planet associated with a more distant star," while presenting the findings of the much debated [[Condon Report]].  Some UFO historians credit Condon with popularizing the term and its abbreviation "ETH".

==Chronology==
Although ETH as a word is a comparatively new concept, one which owes much to the ''flying saucer sightings'' of the 1940s–1960s, its origins can be traced back to a number of earlier events, such as the now-discredited [[Martian canal]]s and ancient Martian civilization promoted by astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], popular culture including the writings of [[H. G. Wells]] and fellow science fiction pioneers such as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], who likewise wrote of Martian civilizations, and even to the works of figures such as the Swedish [[philosopher]], [[mysticism|mystic]] and scientist [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who promoted a variety of unconventional views that linked other worlds to the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref name=Swedenborg&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel (1758) ''Concerning the Earths in Our Solar System ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 20th century, [[Charles Fort]] collected accounts of anomalous physical phenomena from newspapers and scientific journals, including many reports of extraordinary aerial objects.  These were published in 1919 in ''The Book of the Damned''. In this and two subsequent books, ''New Lands'' (1923) and ''Lo!'' (1931), Fort theorized that visitors from other worlds were observing Earth.  Fort's reports of aerial phenomena were frequently cited in American newspapers when the UFO phenomenon first attracted widespread media attention in June and July 1947.

The modern ETH—specifically, the implicit linking of unidentified aircraft and lights in the sky to alien life—took root during the late 1940s and took its current form during the 1950s. It drew on [[pseudoscience]], as well as popular culture. Unlike earlier speculation of extraterrestrial life, interest in the ETH was also bolstered by many unexplained sightings investigated by the U.S. government and governments of other countries, as well as private civilian groups, such as [[National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena|NICAP]] and [[Aerial Phenomena Research Organization|APRO]].

===Historical reports of extraterrestrial visits===
An early example of speculation over extraterrestrial visitors can be found in the French newspaper ''Le Pays'', which on June&amp;nbsp;17, 1864, published a story about two American geologists who had allegedly discovered an alien-like creature, a mummified three-foot-tall hairless humanoid with a trunk-like appendage on its forehead, inside a hollow [[Oval (geometry)|egg-shaped]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs David M (2000), “UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge”, University Press of Kansas, {{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}} (Compiled work quoting Jerome Clark; "So far as is known, the first mention of an extraterrestrial spacecraft was published in the 17 June 1864 issue of a French newspaper, [[La Pays]], which ran an allegedly real but clearly fabulous account of a discovery by two American geologists of a hollow, egg-shaped structure holding the three-foot mummified body of a hairless humanoid with a trunk protruding from the middle of his forehead.")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. G. Wells]], in his 1898 science fiction classic [[The War of the Worlds]], popularized the idea of Martian visitation and invasion. Even before Wells, there was a sudden upsurge in reports in "[[Mystery airship]]s" in the U.S. For example, the Washington ''Times'' in 1897 speculated that the airships were "a reconnoitering party from Mars" and the Saint Louis ''Post-Dispatch'' wrote, "these may be visitors from Mars, fearful, at the last, of invading the planet they have been seeking."&lt;ref&gt;David Michael Jacobs, ''The UFO Controversy In America'', p. 29, Indiana University Press, 1975, {{ISBN|0-253-19006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later there was a more international airship wave from 1909-1912. An example of an extraterrestrial explanation at the time was a 1909 letter to a New Zealand newspaper suggesting "atomic powered spaceships from Mars."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Clark, ''The UFO Book'', 1998, 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s the idea of alien visitation in space ships was commonplace in popular comic strips and radio and movie serials such as [[Buck Rogers]] and [[Flash Gordon]]. In particular, Flash Gordon serials have Earth being attacked from space by alien meteors, ray beams, and biological weapons. In 1938 a radio broadcast version '' of [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[Orson Welles]], using a contemporary setting for H.&amp;nbsp;G. Wells' Martian invasion, created some public panic in the United States.

===The 1947 U.S. flying saucer wave===
On June 24, 1947, at about 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, pilot [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting|Kenneth Arnold]] reported seeing nine unidentified disk-shaped aircraft flying near [[Mount Rainier]].&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Daily Tribune (June 26, 1947)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Kenneth, [http://www.project1947.com/fig/ka.htm Report on 9 unidentified aircraft observed on June 24, 1947, near Mt. Rainier, Washington], (October 1947)&lt;/ref&gt; When no aircraft emerged that seemed to account for what he had seen, Arnold quickly considered the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial.  On July 7, 1947, two stories came out where Arnold was raising the topic of possible extraterrestrial origins, both as his opinion and those who had written to him.  In an Associated Press story, Arnold said he had received quantities of fan mail eager to help solve the mystery.  Some of them "suggested the discs were visitations from another planet."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press story, July 7, 1947, e.g., Salt Lake City ''Deseret News'', p. 3, "Author of 'Discs' Story To Seek Proof" [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&amp;dat=19470707&amp;printsec=frontpage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chicago 'Times', July 7, 1947, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Arnold; Speaking to Journalist Edward R. Murrow (April 7, 1950), [http://www.project1947.com/fig/kamurrow.htm Transcript] care of [http://www.project1947.com/ Project 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spokane ''Daily Chronicle'', p.1, June 27, 1947, "More Sky-Gazers Tell About Seeing the Flying Piepans"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ddB7do2jUx8C&amp;dat=19470627&amp;printsec=frontpage]; Eugene (OR) Register-Guard, p.1, June 27, 1947; Bremerton (Washington) ''Sun'', June 28, 1947, "Eerie 'Whatsit objects' In Sky Observed Here."&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 1947 flying saucer wave hit the U.S., there was much speculation in the newspapers about what they might be in news stories, columns, editorials, and letters to the editor. For example, on July 10, U.S. Senator [[Glen H. Taylor|Glen Taylor]] of Idaho commented, "I almost wish the flying saucers would turn out to be space ships from another planet," because the possibility of hostility "would unify the people of the earth as nothing else could."  On July 8, Dewitt Miller was quoted by UP saying that the saucers had been seen since the early nineteenth century.  If the present discs weren’t secret Army weapons, he suggested they could be vehicles from Mars or other planets or maybe even "things out of other dimensions of time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Clark, ''UFO Encyclopedia'', p. 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;  Other articles brought up the work of [[Charles Fort]], who earlier in the 20th Century had documented numerous reports of unidentified flying objects that had been written up in newspapers and scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rUohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gIEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2393,814473&amp;dq=charles+fort&amp;hl=en|title=Schenectady Gazette - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if people thought the saucers were real, most were generally unwilling to leap to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial in origin.  Various popular theories began to quickly proliferate in press articles, such as secret military projects, Russian spy devices, hoaxes, [[optical illusions]], and [[mass hysteria]]. According to Murrow, the ETH as a serious explanation for "flying saucers" did not earn widespread attention until about 18 months after Arnold's sighting.&lt;ref name=uforaddocu&gt;[[Edward R. Murrow]] (April 7, 1950) ''[http://www.albany.edu/talkinghistory/arch2004jan-june.html The Case of the Flying Saucer]'', CBS News (Radio Documentary available in MP3/Real Media), (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

These attitudes seem to be reflected in the results of the first US poll of public UFO perceptions released by [[Gallup poll|Gallup]] on August 14, 1947.&lt;ref name=jacko1&gt;Jacobs David M  (2000), “UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge”, University Press of Kansas, {{ISBN|0-7006-1032-4}}  (Compiled work: section sourced from Jerome Clark)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "flying saucer" was familiar to 90% of the respondents.  As to what people thought explained them, the poll further showed that most people either held no opinion or refused to answer the question (33%), or generally believed that there was a mundane explanation.  29% thought they were [[optical illusion]]s, [[mirage]]s or imagination, 15% a US secret weapon, 10% a [[hoax]], 3% a “weather forecasting device”, 1% of Soviet origin, and 9% had “other explanations”, including fulfillment of [[Bible|Biblical]] [[prophecy]], secret commercial aircraft, or related to [[atomic testing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=feST4K8J0scC&amp;dat=19470815&amp;printsec=frontpage Gallup poll in August 15, 1947, ''St. Petersburg Times'', p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA military investigation and debunkery===
On July 9, Army Air Forces Intelligence began a secret study of the best saucer reports, including Arnold's. A follow-up study by the [[Air Materiel Command]] intelligence and engineering departments at [[Wilbur Wright Field#Wright Field|Wright Field]] Ohio led to the formation the U.S. Air Force's [[Project Sign]] at the end of 1947, the first official U.S. military UFO study.

In 1948, Project Sign wrote their [[Estimate of the Situation]], which concluded that the remaining unidentified sightings were best explained by the ETH. The report ultimately was rejected by the USAF Chief of Staff, General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]], citing a lack of physical evidence, and its existence was not publicly disclosed until 1956 by later [[Project Blue Book]] director [[Edward J. Ruppelt]]. Ruppelt also indicated that Vandenberg dismantled Project Sign after they wrote their ETH conclusion. With this official policy in place, all subsequent public Air Force reports concluded that there was either insufficient evidence to link UFOs and ETH, or that UFOs did not warrant investigation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Immediately following the great UFO wave of 1952 and military debunking of the radar and visual sightings plus jet interceptions over Washington, D.C. in August, the CIA’s Office of Scientific Investigation took particular interest in UFOs.  Though the ETH was mentioned, it was generally given little credence.  However, others within the CIA, such as the [[Psychological Strategy Board]], were more concerned about how an unfriendly power such as the Soviet Union might use UFOs for psychological warfare purposes, exploit the gullibility of the public for the sensational, and clog intelligence channels.  Under a directive from the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] to review the problem, in January 1953, the CIA organized the [[Robertson Panel]],&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Good, ''Above Top Secret'', 328-335&lt;/ref&gt; a group of scientists who quickly reviewed the Blue Book’s best evidence, including motion pictures and an engineering report that concluded that the performance characteristics were beyond that of earthly craft.  After two days' review, all cases were claimed to have conventional explanations.  An official policy of public debunkery was recommended using the mass media and authority figures in order to influence public opinion and reduce the number of UFO reports.

===Evolution of public opinion===
The early 1950s also saw a number of movies depicting flying saucers and aliens, including ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956). Despite this, public belief in ETH seems to have remained low during the early 1950s, even among those reporting UFOs. A poll published in ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine, in August 1951, showed that 52% of UFO witnesses questioned believed that they had seen a man-made aircraft, while only 4% believed that they had seen an alien craft.  However, an additional 28% were uncertain, with more than half of these stating they believed they were either man-made aircraft or "visitors from afar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=lyEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=74&amp;query=flying+saucer|title=Popular Science Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the total number of UFO witnesses who considered the ETH viable was approximately 20%. Within a few years, belief in ETH had increased due to the activities of people such as retired U.S. Marine Corps officer Maj. [[Donald E. Keyhoe]], who campaigned to raise public awareness of the UFO phenomenon. By 1957, 25% of Americans responded that they either believed, or were willing to believe, in ETH, while 53% responded that they were not (though a majority of these respondents indicated they thought UFOs to be real but of earthly origin). 22% said that they were uncertain.&lt;ref name=50plus/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}}&lt;ref name=trendx1&gt;Trendex Poll, St. Louis Globe Democrat (August 24, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the ETH proponents fragmented into distinct camps, each believing slightly different variations of the hypothesis. The "[[contactees]]" of the early 1950s said that the "[[Nordic aliens|space brothers]]" they met were peaceful and benevolent, but by the mid-1960s, a number of alleged [[alien abduction]]s; including that of [[Betty and Barney Hill abduction|Betty and Barney Hill]], and of the apparent [[Cattle mutilation|mutilation of cattle]] cast the ETH in more sinister terms.

Opinion polls indicate that public belief in the ETH has continued to rise since then.  For example, a 1997 Gallup poll of the U.S. public indicated that 87% knew about UFOs, 48% believed them to be real (vs. 33% who thought them to be imaginary), and 45% believed UFOs had visited Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc999.htm|title=Summaries of Some Recent Opinion Polls on UFOs - UFO Evidence|website=www.ufoevidence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly a Roper poll from 2002 found 56% thought UFOs to be real and 48% thought UFOs had visited Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/ufo/roper/05.html Roper poll results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203015119/http://www.scifi.com/ufo/roper/05.html |date=December 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls also indicate that the public believe even more strongly that the government is suppressing evidence about UFOs. For example, in both the cited Gallup and Roper polls, the figure was about 80%.

===Fewer sightings despite camera phone technology===
Support for the extraterrestrial hypothesis in the last decade has seen a decline as the proliferation of smartphone camera technology across the population has not led to a significant increase in recorded UFO sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/why-have-we-stopped-seeing-ufos-in-the-skies|title=Why have we stopped seeing UFOs in the skies? – Stuart Walton - Aeon Essays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This goes counter to the predictions of supporters of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, even causing a crisis of confidence among some within the informal UFO research community.

===Opinions among scientists===
The [[scientific community]] has shown very little support for the ETH, and has largely accepted the explanation that reports of UFOs are the result of people misinterpreting common objects or phenomena, or are the work of hoaxers. Professor [[Stephen Hawking]] has expressed skepticism about the ETH.&lt;ref name=hawking1&gt;Hawking Stephen, [http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html Space and Time Warps]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1969 lecture, U.S. astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan#Sagan and UFOs|Carl Sagan]] said:

:"The idea of benign or hostile space aliens from other planets visiting the Earth [is clearly] an emotional idea. There are two sorts of self-deception here: either accepting the idea of extraterrestrial visitation by space aliens in the face of very meager evidence because we want it to be true; or rejecting such an idea out of hand, in the absence of sufficient evidence, because we don't want it to be true. Each of these extremes is a serious impediment to the study of UFOs."&lt;ref name=saganandpage&gt;Sagan Carl,  Page Thornton (1972), “UFOs: A Scientific Debate”. Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|0-8014-0740-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, British astrophysicist [[Peter A. Sturrock]] wrote

:"for many years, discussions of the UFO issue have remained narrowly polarized between advocates and adversaries of a single theory, namely the extraterrestrial hypothesis&amp;nbsp;... this fixation on the ETH has narrowed and impoverished the debate, precluding an examination of other possible theories for the phenomenon."&lt;ref name=sturrock&gt;Sturrock Peter A (1999), “The UFO Enigma: A New Review of the Physical Evidence”, Warner Books, {{ISBN|0-446-52565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An informal poll done by Sturrock in 1973 of [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] members found that about 10% of them believed that UFOs were vehicles from outer space.&lt;ref name=50plus&gt;John F. Schuessler (January 2000), [http://www.mufon.com/znews_publicopinion.html Public Opinion Surveys and Unidentified Flying Objects; 50+ years of Sampling Public Opinions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111004644/http://www.mufon.com/znews_publicopinion.html |date=2005-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc592.htm More detailed account of Sturrock AIAA poll]; 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}}  In another informal poll conducted in 1977 by astrophysicist [[Peter A. Sturrock]], he surveyed members of the [[American Astronomical Society]]. Sturrock asked polled scientists to assign probabilities to eight possible explanations for UFOs. The results were:&lt;ref name=50plus/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}}

The primary scientific arguments against ETH were summarized by astronomer and UFO researcher [[J. Allen Hynek]] during a presentation at the 1983 [[Mutual UFO Network|MUFON]] Symposium, where he outlined seven key reasons why he could not accept the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Hynek, J. Allen (1983), "The case against ET", in Walter H. Andrus, Jr., and Dennis W. Stacy (eds), [[MUFON]] UFO Symposium&lt;/ref&gt;

# Failure of sophisticated surveillance systems to detect incoming or outgoing UFOs
# Gravitational and atmospheric considerations
# Statistical considerations
# Elusive, evasive and absurd behavior of UFOs and their occupants
# Isolation of the UFO phenomenon in time and space: the [[Cheshire Cat]] effect
# The space unworthiness of UFOs
# The problem of astronomical distances

Hynek argued that:

#Despite worldwide [[radar]] systems and Earth-orbiting satellites, UFOs are alleged to flit in and out of the atmosphere, leaving little to no evidence.
#Space aliens are alleged to be overwhelmingly [[humanoid]], and are allegedly able to exist on Earth without much difficulty often lacking "[[space suit]]s", even though [[exoplanet|extra-solar planets]] would likely have different [[atmosphere]]s, [[biosphere]]s, [[gravity]] and other factors, and extraterrestrial life would likely be very different from Earthly life.
#The number of reported UFOs and of purported encounters with UFO-inhabitants outstrips the number of expeditions that an alien civilization (or civilizations) could statistically be expected to mount.
#The behavior of extraterrestrials reported during alleged abductions is often inconsistent and irrational.
#UFOs are isolated in time and space: like the [[Cheshire Cat]], they seem to appear and disappear at will, leaving only vague, ambiguous and mocking evidence of their presence
#Reported UFOs are often far too small to support a crew traveling through space, and their reported flight behavior is often not representative of a craft under intelligent control (erratic flight patterns, sudden course changes).
#The distance between planets makes interstellar travel impractical, particularly because of the amount of energy that would be required for [[interstellar travel]] using conventional means, (According to a NASA estimate, it would take 7{{e|19}} [[joule]]s of energy to send the current space shuttle on a one-way, 50 year, journey to the nearest star, an enormous amount of energy&lt;ref name=Nasa2&gt;Warp Drive, When?:  [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/scales.html A Look at the Scaling], (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;) and because of the level of technology that would be required to ''circumvent'' conventional energy/fuel/speed limitations using exotic means such as [[Wormhole|Einstein-Rosen Bridges]] as ways to shorten distances from point A to point B.(see [[Faster-than-light]] travel).&lt;ref name=clark98&gt;Clark Jerome (1998), "The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial", Visible Ink, {{ISBN|1-57859-029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hynek, points 1 through 6 could be argued, but point 7 represented an insurmountable barrier to the validity of the ETH.&lt;ref name=clark98/&gt;

==NASA==
[[NASA]] frequently fields questions in regard to the ETH and UFOs. As of 2006, its official standpoint was that ETH has a lack of empirical evidence.

:"no one has ever found a single artifact, or any other convincing evidence for such alien visits". David Morrison.&lt;ref name=david2&gt;Morrison David, Senior Scientist at the NASA Astrobiology Institute (June 2006),  [http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/astrobio/astrobio_detail.cfm?ID=1538 Ask an Astrobiologist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928234930/http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/astrobio/astrobio_detail.cfm?ID=1538 |date=2006-09-28 }}, (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"As far as I know, no claims of UFOs as being alien craft have any validity -- the claims are without substance, and certainly not proved". David Morrison&lt;ref name=david1&gt;Morrison David, Senior Scientist at the NASA Astrobiology Institute (July 2006),  [http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/astrobio/astrobio_detail.cfm?ID=1551 Ask an Astrobiologist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928234811/http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/astrobio/astrobio_detail.cfm?ID=1551 |date=2006-09-28 }}, (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite public interest, NASA considers the study of ETH to be irrelevant to its work because of the number of false leads that a study would provide, and the limited amount of usable scientific data that it would yield.

==Conspiracy==
{{Main|UFO conspiracy theory}}

A frequent concept in ufology and popular culture is that the true extent of information about UFOs is being suppressed by some form of conspiracy of silence, or by an official [[cover-up]] that is acting to conceal information.

In 1968, American engineer [[James Harder]] argued that significant evidence existed to prove UFOs "beyond reasonable doubt," but that the evidence had been suppressed and largely neglected by scientists and the general public, thus preventing sound conclusions from being reached on the ETH.

:"Over the past 20 years a vast amount of evidence has been accumulating that bears on the existence of UFOs. Most of this is little known to the general public or to most scientists. But on the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref name=harder1/&gt; J A Harder

A survey carried out by Industrial Research magazine in 1971 showed that more Americans believed the government was concealing information about UFOs (76%) than believed in the existence of UFOs (54%), or in ETH itself (32%).&lt;ref name=50plus/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}}

===Documents and investigations regarding ETH===
Other private or governmental studies, some secret, have concluded in favor of the ETH, or have had members who disagreed with official conclusions against the conclusion by committees and agencies to which they belonged. The following are examples of sources that have focused specifically on the topic:
*In 1967, Greek physicist Paul Santorini, a [[Manhattan Project]] scientist, publicly stated that a 1947 Greek government investigation into the European [[Ghost rockets]] of 1946 under his lead quickly concluded that they were not missiles. Santorini claimed the investigation was then quashed by military officials from the U.S., who knew them to be extraterrestrial, because there was no defense against the advanced technology and they feared widespread panic should the results become public.&lt;ref&gt;Good (1988), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Photo}}[[File:1948 Top Secret USAF UFO extraterrestrial document.png|thumb|upright|November 1948 USAF Top Secret document citing extraterrestrial opinion.]]
*A 1948 Top Secret USAF Europe document ([[#Photo|at right]]) states that Swedish air intelligence informed them that at least some of their investigators into the ghost rockets and flying saucers concluded they had extraterrestrial origins: "...[[Flying saucers]] have been reported by so many sources and from such a variety of places that we are convinced that they cannot be disregarded and must be explained on some basis which is perhaps slightly beyond the scope of our present intelligence thinking.  When officers of this Directorate recently visited the Swedish Air Intelligence Service... their answer was that some reliable and fully technically qualified people have reached the conclusion that 'these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on earth.' They are therefore assuming that these objects originate from some previously unknown or unidentified technology, possibly outside the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Document quoted and published in Timothy Good (2007), 106–107, 115; USAFE Item 14, TT 1524, (Top Secret), 4 November 1948, declassified in 1997, National Archives, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1948, the USAF [[Project Sign]] produced a Top Secret [[Estimate of the Situation]], concluding that the ETH was the most likely explanation for the most perplexing unexplained cases. The study was ordered destroyed by USAF chief of staff General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]], citing lack of proof. Knowledge of the existence of the Estimate has come from insiders who said they read a surviving copy, including later USAF Project Blue Book head [[Edward J. Ruppelt]] and astronomer and USAF consultant [[J. Allen Hynek]].
*West Germany, in conjunction with other European countries, conducted a secret study from 1951 to 1954, also concluding that UFOs were extraterrestrial. This study was revealed by German rocketry pioneer [[Hermann Oberth]], who headed the study and who also made many public statements supporting the ETH in succeeding years.  At the study's conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared, "These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy." Soon afterwards, in an article in ''The American Weekly'', October 24, 1954, Oberth wrote "It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system. I think that they possibly are manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mufon.com/MUFONNews/znews_oberth.html Schuessler, John L., "Statements About Flying Saucers And Extraterrestrial Life Made By Prof. Hermann Oberth, German Rocket Scientist" 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125162907/http://mufon.com/MUFONNews/znews_oberth.html |date=2010-11-25 }}; Oberth's American Weekly article appeared in a number of newspaper Sunday supplements, e.g., ''[[The Washington Post|The Washington Post and Times Herald]]'', pg. AW4, and [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pm8xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MRAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5451,3094226&amp;dq=herman+oberth&amp;hl=en Milwaukee Sentinel]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[CIA]] started their own internal scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added, "...as long as a series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject." A report from later that month was similarly skeptical but nevertheless concluded "...sightings of UFOs reported at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]], at a time when the background [[radiation]] count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers." A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: "...the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles." Some of the memos also made it clear that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335)
*The CIA organized the January 1953 [[Robertson Panel]] of scientists to debunk the data collected by the Air Force's Project Blue Book. This included an engineering analysis of UFO maneuvers by Blue Book (including a motion picture film analysis by Naval scientists) that had concluded UFOs were under intelligent control and likely extraterrestrial.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, 189; Good, 287, 337; Ruppelt, Chapt. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
*Extraterrestrial "believers" within Project Blue Book included Major Dewey Fournet, in charge of the engineering analysis of UFO motion, who later became a board member on the civilian UFO organization [[NICAP]].  Blue Book director [[Edward J. Ruppelt]] privately commented on other firm "pro-UFO" members in the USAF investigations, including some Pentagon generals, such as [[Charles P. Cabell]], USAF Chief of Air Intelligence who, angry at the inaction and debunkery of [[Project Grudge]], dissolved it in 1951, established Project Blue Book in its place, and made Ruppelt director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufologie.net/htm/ruppeltwhoiswho.htm Ruppelt's private notes]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Cabell became deputy director of the CIA. Another defector from the official Air Force party line was consultant [[J. Allen Hynek]], who started out as a staunch skeptic. After 20 years of investigation, he changed positions and generally supported the ETH. He became the most publicly known UFO advocate scientist in the 1970s and 1980s.
*The first CIA Director, Vice Admiral [[Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter]], stated in a signed statement to Congress, also reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 28, 1960, "It is time for the truth to be brought out... Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. However, through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense... I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects." In 1962, in his letter of resignation from [[NICAP]], he told director [[Donald Keyhoe]], "I know the UFOs are not U.S. or Soviet devices. All we can do now is wait for some actions by the UFOs."&lt;ref&gt;Good, 347&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although the 1968 [[Condon Report]] came to a negative conclusion (written by [[Edward Condon|Condon]]), it is known that many members of the study strongly disagreed with Condon's methods and biases. Most quit the project in disgust or were fired for insubordination. A few became ETH supporters. Perhaps the best known example is David Saunders, who in his 1968 book ''UFOs? Yes'' lambasted Condon for extreme bias and ignoring or misrepresenting critical evidence. Saunders wrote, "It is clear... that the sightings have been going on for too long to explain in terms of straightforward terrestrial intelligence. It's in this sense that ETI (Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) stands as the 'least implausible' explanation of 'real UFOs'."&lt;ref&gt;David Saunders, ''UFOs? Yes''&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1999, the private French [[COMETA]] report (written primarily by military defense analysts) stated the conclusion regarding UFO phenomena, that a "single hypothesis sufficiently takes into account the facts and, for the most part, only calls for present-day science. It is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/newsite/files/COMETA_part2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716113351/http://www.ufoevidence.org/newsite/files/COMETA_part2.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted issues with formulating the extraterrestrial hypothesis, likening its study to the study of meteorites, but concluded that although it was far from the best scientific hypothesis, "strong presumptions exist in its favour". The report also concludes that the studies it presents "demonstrate the almost certain physical reality of completely unknown flying objects with remarkable flight performances and noiselessness, apparently operated by intelligent [beings] … Secret craft definitely of early origins (drones, stealth aircraft, etc.) can only explain a minority of cases. If we go back far enough in time, we clearly perceive the limits of this explanation."
*[[Jean-Jacques Velasco]], the head of the official French UFO investigation [[SEPRA]], wrote a book in 2005 saying that 14% of the 5800 cases studied by SEPRA were utterly inexplicable and extraterrestrial in origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1627.htm Velasco quoted in ''La Dépêche du Midi'', Toulouse, France, April 18, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yves Sillard]], the head of the new official French UFO investigation [[GEIPAN]] and former head of the French space agency [[CNES]], echoes Velasco's comments and adds the U.S. is guilty of covering up this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc2008.htm|title=Official French Gov't UFO study project to resume with new director - UFO Evidence|website=www.ufoevidence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this is not the official public posture of SEPRA, CNES, or the French government. (The CNES placed their 5,800 case files on the Internet starting March 2007.)

==Official White House position==
In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.  According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larson|first=Phil|title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet|url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet|date=5 November 2011|publisher=White House|accessdate=2011-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet|archivedate=24 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says|url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/|date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=2011-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;  The response further noted that efforts, like [[SETI]], the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler space telescope]] and the [[Mars Science Laboratory|NASA Mars rover]], continue looking for [[life|signs of life]]. The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2074">'''Fade Goff''' (September 17, 1780 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1836) was a [[land agent]] and political figure in [[Prince Edward Island]]. He represented [[Georgetown, Prince Edward Island|Georgetown]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island]] from 1812 to 1818.

He was born in [[Bryanstown]], [[County Wexford]], [[Ireland]], the son of Richard Goff. In 1809, he married Mary Somaindyke Ryan, the daughter of [[John Ryan (printer)|John Ryan]]. That same year, he emigrated to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] to join his father-in-law. There he met [[John Stewart (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Stewart]] who hired Goff as his agent for his property in Prince Edward Island and he moved to the island the following year. Goff also later became agent for George and Alexander Birnie. He found that the role of land agent left him in a position of permanent financial obligation to his employers. He attempted to profit by other activities, such as operating a flour mill and an emigration office, without much success. In 1813, he was named [[coroner]] and clerk of the crown by [[William Townshend (colonial governor)|William Townshend]], colonial administrator. Goff also was named a justice of the peace and was appointed high sheriff in 1831.  He was named to the colony's Council in 1832. He died at Erinvale in [[Lot 34, Prince Edward Island|Lot 34]] after a lengthy illness.

His son [[John Goff (politician)|John]] also served in the provincial assembly.

The '''Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis''' proposes to link genetic ties originating among [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] [[culture]]s and [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] to high rate of [[suicide]], claiming an [[allele]] common among them is responsible.

[[Mari people|Mari]] and [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]] have been found to have a three times higher suicide rate than Finns and Hungarians. It has been thus theorized that such a possible allele may have arisen in those populations.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990–1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/103/2/543.full.pdf|title=Ancestry, genes, and suicide: a test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis in the United States|journal=Percept Mot Skills|year=2006|volume=103|issue=2|pages=543–50|pmid=17165419|author=Voracek M|doi=10.2466/pms.103.2.543-550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2271">'''García Álvarez''' (died 1108?) was the ''[[alférez]]'', or commander of the royal military household, under King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] from 1100/2 to 1107.{{sfn|Reilly|1989|p=224|ps=, indicates 1100, but on p. 289 gives early 1102.}} He was the son of [[Álvar Díaz de Oca]] and a member of one of the leading families of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].

García may have died at the [[battle of Uclés (1108)|battle of Uclés]] on 29 May 1108. He does not appear in any contemporary records after 27 December 1107, but this may be simply because he had been replaced in the important post of ''alférez'' by [[Pedro González de Lara]].{{sfn|Reilly|1989|p=353 n. 27}} In any case, he died around this time, shortly after his own father.{{sfn|Reilly|1989|p=355}}

The 13th-century historian [[Lucas of Tuy]], in his ''Chronicon mundi'', reports that "King Alfonso [VI] gravely offended the Castilian count García de Cabrera and in order to placate the same gave him his sister Elvira as a wife and pacified the whole kingdom that was in rebellion."{{sfn|Reilly|1989|p=224: ''Eo tempore Rex Adefonsus offendit graviter Comitem Castellanum Garsiam de Cabrera et causa placendi ipsum dedit ei Geloyram sororem suam in uxorem, et pacificavit totum regnum quod seditionem vertebatur''.}} Since the title of count was rare in Castile in the late 11th century and the only known count of the name, [[García Ordóñez]], could not be whom Lucas meant, it has been surmised that García Álvarez is meant, and that Lucas is using the term "count" loosely to mean "magnate". If this is the case, then García was married to [[Elvira of Toro]]. Another 13th-century history, ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]'', records that García was the guardian of the king's son and heir, [[Sancho Alfónsez]], and died defending him at Uclés.{{sfn|Reilly|1989}}

'''Genetically modified crops''' ('''GM crops''' or '''biotech crops''') are plants used in [[agriculture]], the [[DNA]] of which has been modified using [[genetic engineering]] methods. In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, or resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a [[herbicide]]), or improving the nutrient profile of the crop. Examples in non-food crops include production of [[Plant manufactured pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical agents]], [[biofuels]], and other industrially useful goods, as well as for [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="James2013"&gt;ISAAA 2013 Annual Report [http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/46/executivesummary/ Executive Summary, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2013] ISAAA Brief 46-2013, Retrieved 6 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers have widely adopted GM technology. It is the fastest adopted crop technology in the world. Acreage increased from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 185.1 million hectares in 2016, some 12% of global cropland. As of 2016, major crop (soybean, maize, canola and cotton) traits consist of herbicide tolerance (95.9 million hectares) insect resistance (25.2 million hectares), or both (58.5 million hectares). In 2015, 53.6 million ha of GM maize were under cultivation (almost 1/3 of the maize crop). GM maize outperformed  its predecessors: yield was 5.6 to 24.5% higher with less [[mycotoxin]]s (−28.8%), [[Fumonisin B1|fumonisin]] (−30.6%) and thricotecens (−36.5%). Non-target organisms were unaffected, except for ''[[Braconidae]]'', represented by a [[parasitoid]] of [[European corn borer]], the target of ''[[Lepidoptera]]'' active Bt maize. Biogeochemical parameters such as lignin content did not vary, while biomass decomposition was higher.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pellegrino|first=Elisa|last2=Bedini|first2=Stefano|last3=Nuti|first3=Marco|last4=Ercoli|first4=Laura|date=15 February 2018|title=Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21284-2|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3113|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-21284-2|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5814441|pmid=29449686|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.3113P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects.&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations.

==Methods==
{{Main|Genetic engineering techniques}}

[[File:Transformation with Agrobacterium.JPG|thumb|Plants (''Solanum chacoense'') being transformed using agrobacterium]]
Genetically engineered crops have genes added or removed using [[genetic engineering]] techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Boyle for Popular Science.  24 January 2011. [http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/life-cycle-genetically-modified-seed?single-page-view=true How To Genetically Modify a Seed, Step By Step]&lt;/ref&gt; originally including [[gene gun]]s, [[electroporation]], [[microinjection]] and [[agrobacterium]]. More recently, [[CRISPR]] and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALEN]] offered much more precise and convenient editing techniques.

Gene guns (also known as biolistics) "shoot" (direct high energy particles or radiations against&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bombarded|title=Bombarded - Define Bombarded at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) target genes into plant cells. It is the most common method. [[DNA]] is bound to tiny particles of gold or tungsten which are subsequently shot into plant tissue or single plant cells under high pressure. The accelerated particles penetrate both the [[cell wall]] and [[cell membrane|membranes]]. The DNA separates from the metal and is integrated into plant DNA inside the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]. This method has been applied successfully for many cultivated crops, especially [[monocot]]s like wheat or maize, for which [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] using ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' has been less successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Shrawat | first1 = A.| last2 = Lörz | first2 = H.| title = Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cereals: a promising approach crossing barriers| journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal| volume = 4| issue = 6| pages = 575–603| year = 2006| pmid = 17309731| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2006.00209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage of this procedure is that serious damage can be done to the cellular tissue.

''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]-''mediated transformation is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant [[parasites]].&lt;ref name="Halford"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785724094|title=Genetically modified crops|last=G.|first=Halford, Nigel|date=2012|publisher=Imperial College Press|others=World Scientific (Firm)|isbn=978-1848168381|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=785724094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, resulting in a proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level ([[crown gall]]). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment ([[plasmid]]). When ''Agrobacterium'' infects a plant, it transfers this [[Ti plasmid|T-DNA]] to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA is removed from the bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for [[dicotyledon]]ous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.

Electroporation is used when the plant tissue does not contain cell walls. In this technique, "DNA enters the plant cells through miniature pores which are temporarily caused by electric pulses."

Microinjection is used to directly inject foreign DNA into cells.&lt;ref&gt;Maghari, Behrokh Mohajer, and Ali M. Ardekani. "Genetically Modified Foods And Social Concerns." Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology 3.3 (2011): 109-117. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant scientists, backed by results of modern comprehensive profiling of crop composition, point out that crops modified using GM techniques are less likely to have unintended changes than are conventionally bred crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isb.vt.edu/news/2006/news06.jan.htm#jan0603|title=Information Systems for Biotechnology News Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Catchpole|first1=G.

In research [[tobacco]] and ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' are the most frequently modified plants, due to well-developed transformation methods, easy propagation and well studied genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Koornneef | first1 = M.| last2 = Meinke | first2 = D.| title = The development of Arabidopsis as a model plant| journal = The Plant Journal| volume = 61| issue = 6| pages = 909–21| year = 2010| pmid = 20409266| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11816-011-0200-5 |title=Expression of an Arabidopsis sodium/proton antiporter gene (AtNHX1) in peanut to improve salt tolerance |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=19 December 2013 |doi=10.1007/s11816-011-0200-5 |volume=6 |journal=Plant Biotechnology Reports |pages=59–67|last1=Banjara |first1=Manoj |last2=Zhu |first2=Longfu |last3=Shen |first3=Guoxin |last4=Payton |first4=Paxton |last5=Zhang |first5=Hong }}&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as model organisms for other plant species.

Introducing new genes into plants requires a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] specific to the area where the gene is to be expressed. For instance, to express a gene only in rice grains and not in leaves, an [[endosperm]]-specific promoter is used. The [[codons]] of the gene must be optimized for the organism due to [[codon usage bias]].

== Types of modifications ==
[[File:Btcornafrica.jpg|thumb|[[Transgenic maize]] containing a gene from the bacteria ''Bacillus thuringiensis'']]

=== Transgenic ===
[[Transgenesis|Transgenic]] plants have genes inserted into them that are derived from another species.

=== Cisgenic ===
[[cisgenesis|Cisgenic]] plants are made using genes found within the same species or a closely related one, where conventional [[plant breeding]] can occur. Some breeders and scientists argue that cisgenic modification is useful for plants that are difficult to [[crossbreed]] by conventional means (such as [[potatoes]]), and that plants in the cisgenic category should not require the same regulatory scrutiny as transgenics.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Deborah (2 August 2008).

=== Subgenic ===
Genetically modified plants can also be developed using [[gene knockdown]] or [[gene knockout]] to alter the genetic makeup of a plant without incorporating genes from other plants. In 2014, Chinese researcher Gao Caixia filed patents on the creation of a strain of [[wheat]] that is resistant to [[powdery mildew]]. The strain lacks genes that encode proteins that repress defenses against the mildew. The researchers deleted all three copies of the genes from wheat's [[hexaploid]] genome. Gao used the [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] and [[CRISPR]] [[genome editing|gene editing]] tools without adding or changing any other genes. No field trials were immediately planned.&lt;ref name=tr1407&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot |first=David |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529181/chinese-researchers-stop-wheat-disease-with-gene-editing/ |title=Beijing Researchers Use Gene Editing to Create Disease-Resistant Wheat &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=19 July 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2969 | title=Simultaneous editing of three homoeoalleles in hexaploid bread wheat confers heritable resistance to powdery mildew | journal=Nature Biotechnology | date=2014 | first=Yanpeng | last=Wang | volume=32 | issue=9 | pages=947–51 | pmid=25038773}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRISPR technique has also been used to modify white button mushrooms (''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waltz|first1=Emily|title=Gene-edited CRISPR mushroom escapes US regulation|url=http://www.nature.com/news/gene-edited-crispr-mushroom-escapes-us-regulation-1.19754|website=nature.com|publisher=Nature|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics challenged the claimed benefits to farmers over the prevalence of biased observers and by the absence of [[randomized controlled trial]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The main Bt crop grown by small farmers in developing countries is cotton.

In 2013 the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) asked the EU to allow the development of agricultural GM technologies to enable more sustainable agriculture, by employing fewer land, water, and nutrient resources. EASAC also criticizes the EU's "time-consuming and expensive regulatory framework" and said that the EU had fallen behind in the adoption of GM technologies.&lt;ref name=easac&gt;[http://www.easac.eu/home/reports-and-statements/detail-view/article/planting-the.html Planting the future: opportunities and challenges for using crop genetic improvement technologies for sustainable agriculture], EASAC policy report 21, 27.06.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in agriculture business markets include seed companies, agrochemical companies, distributors, farmers, grain elevators and universities that develop new crops/traits and whose agricultural extensions advise farmers on best practices.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to a 2012 review based on data from the late 1990s and early 2000s, much of the GM crop grown each year is used for livestock feed and increased demand for meat leads to increased demand for GM feed crops.&lt;ref name="Rajib"&gt;Rajib Deb, et al.

Some patents on GM traits have expired, allowing the legal development of generic strains that include these traits. For example, generic glyphosate-tolerant GM soybean is now available.

== Yield ==
In 2014, the largest review yet concluded that GM crops' effects on farming were positive. The [[meta-analysis]] considered all published English-language examinations of the agronomic and economic impacts between 1995 and March 2014 for three major GM crops: soybean, maize, and cotton. The study found that herbicide-tolerant crops have lower production costs, while for insect-resistant crops the reduced pesticide use was offset by higher seed prices, leaving overall production costs about the same.&lt;ref name="KlumperQaim"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klümper | first1 = W | last2 = Qaim | first2 = M | year = 2014 | title = A Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 11| page = e111629 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0111629 | pmid=25365303|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9k1629K | pmc=4218791}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21630961-biggest-study-so-far-finds-gm-crops-have-large-widespread-benefits-field|title = Genetically modified crops - Field research|date= 8 November 2014|work = Economist|accessdate =3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yields increased 9% for herbicide tolerance and 25% for insect resistant varieties. Farmers who adopted GM crops made 69% higher profits than those who did not. The review found that GM crops help farmers in developing countries, increasing yields by 14 percentage points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The researchers considered some studies that were not peer-reviewed and a few that did not report sample sizes. They attempted to correct for [[publication bias]], by considering sources beyond [[academic journals]]. The large data set allowed the study to control for potentially confounding variables such as fertilizer use. Separately, they concluded that the funding source did not influence study results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traits==
GM crops grown today, or under development, have been modified with various [[Phenotypic trait|traits]]. These traits include improved [[shelf life]], [[Plant_disease_resistance|disease resistance]], stress resistance, [[herbicide resistance]], [[pest resistance]], production of useful goods such as biofuel or drugs, and ability to absorb toxins and for use in [[bioremediation]] of pollution.

Recently, [[research and development]] has been targeted to [[crop enhancement|enhancement of crops]] that are locally important in [[developing countries]], such as insect-resistant [[cowpea]] for Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seedquest.com/News/releases/2006/august/16608.htm|title=SeedQuest - Central information website for the global seed industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insect-resistant [[Bt brinjal|brinjal]] (eggplant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/35/default.asp|title=Bt Brinjal in India - Pocket K - ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved photosynthesis ===
Plants use [[non-photochemical quenching]] (NPQ) to protect them from excessive amounts of sunlight. Plants can switch on the quenching mechanism almost instantaneously but it takes much longer for it to switch off again. During the time that it is switched off, the amount of energy that is wasted increases.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A genetic modification in three genes allows to correct this (in a trial with tobacco plants). As a result, yields were 14-20% higher, in terms of the weight of the dry leaves harvested. The plants had bigger leaves, were taller and had more vigorous roots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/17/plants-genetically-modified-to-boost-photosynthesis-produce-greater-yields-study-shows Plants modified to boost photosynthesis produce greater yields, study shows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6314/857 Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another improvement that can be made on the photosynthesis process (with [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 pathway plants]]) is on [[photorespiration]]. By inserting the C4 pathway into C3 plants, productivity may increase by as much as 50% for [[cereal crop]]s, such as rice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theconversation.com/how-gm-crops-can-help-us-to-feed-a-fast-growing-world-71112 How GM crops can help us to feed a fast-growing world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535011/supercharged-photosynthesis/ Advanced genetic tools could help boost crop yields and feed billions more people.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/10/24/supercharged-gmo-rice-variety-increase-yields-50-percent-improved-photosynthesis/ ‘Supercharged’ GMO rice could increase yields 50 percent with improved photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4883725|year=2013|last1=Karki|first1=S|title=Improvement of photosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by inserting the C4 pathway|journal=Rice|volume=6|issue=1|pages=28|last2=Rizal|first2=G|last3=Quick|first3=W.

Drought resistance occurs by modifying the plant's genes responsible for the mechanism known as the [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM), which allows the plants to survive despite low water levels. This holds promise for water-heavy crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans and poplar to accelerate their adaptation to water-limited environments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/drought-resistant-crops-plants-genetic-engineering-a8091816.html Scientists aim to develop drought-resistant crops using genetic engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307873609_Genetically_Modified_Crops_with_Drought_Tolerance_Achievements_Challenges_and_Perspectives Genetically Modified Crops with Drought Tolerance: Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; Several salinity tolerance mechanisms have been identified in salt-tolerant crops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166913007192 Salt resistant crop plants]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, rice, canola and tomato crops have been genetically modified to increase their tolerance to salt stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/31/default.asp Pocket K No. 31: Biotechnology with Salinity for Coping in Problem Soils]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scidev.net/global/biotechnology/news/genetic-change-could-make-crops-thrive-on-salty-so.html Genetic change could make crops thrive on salty soils]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Herbicides ====

===== Glyphosate =====
As of 1999, the most prevalent GM trait was [[glyphosate]]-tolerance.&lt;ref name="agbioforum1999" /&gt;{{update inline|reason=Still true 18 years later?|date=July 2017}} Glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup and other herbicide products) kills plants by interfering with the [[shikimic acid|shikimate]] pathway in plants, which is essential for the synthesis of the [[Aromatic amino acids|aromatic]] amino acids [[phenylalanine]], [[tyrosine]], and [[tryptophan]]. The shikimate pathway is not present in animals, which instead obtain aromatic amino acids from their diet. More specifically, glyphosate inhibits the enzyme [[EPSP synthase|5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase]] (EPSPS).

This trait was developed because the herbicides used on grain and grass crops at the time were highly toxic and not effective against narrow-leaved weeds. Thus, developing crops that could withstand spraying with glyphosate would both reduce environmental and health risks, and give an agricultural edge to the farmer.&lt;ref name="agbioforum1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = J. | last2 = Gianessi | first2 = L. | year = 1999 | title = Herbicide tolerant soybeans: Why growers are adopting Roundup Ready varieties | url = http://agbioforum.org/v2n2/v2n2a02-carpenter.htm | journal = AgBioForum | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 65–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some micro-organisms have a version of EPSPS that is resistant to glyphosate inhibition. One of these was isolated from an ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' strain CP4 (CP4 EPSPS) that was resistant to glyphosate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2135/cropsci2005.0329 | title = Development and Characterization of a CP4 EPSPS-Based, Glyphosate-Tolerant Corn Event | author = G.

This transit peptide was used because it had shown previously an ability to deliver bacterial EPSPS to the chloroplasts of other plants. This CP4 EPSPS gene was [[Cloning#Molecular cloning|cloned]] and [[Transfection|transfected]] into [[soybeans]].

The [[plasmid]] used to move the gene into soybeans was PV-GMGTO4. It contained three bacterial genes, two CP4 EPSPS genes, and a gene [[encoding]] [[beta-glucuronidase]] (GUS) from ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' as a marker. The DNA was injected into the soybeans using the [[gene gun|particle acceleration method]]. Soybean cultivar A54O3 was used for the [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]].

===Bioremediation===

Retrieved 20 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 16 million hectares in the US (1.5% of the total surface) are estimated to be contaminated with TNT and RDX. However ''A. thaliana'' was not tough enough for use on military test grounds.&lt;ref name="Growing a grass that loves bombs"&gt;Chard, Abigail (2011) [http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/FestivalNews/Growingagrassthatlovesbombs.htm Growing a grass that loves bombs] The British Science Association.

Marine environments are especially vulnerable since pollution such as [[oil spills]] are not containable. In addition to anthropogenic pollution, millions of tons of [[petroleum]] annually enter the marine environment from natural seepages. Despite its toxicity, a considerable fraction of petroleum oil entering marine systems is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities. Particularly successful is a recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCCB) that may offer useful genes.&lt;ref name=chapter9&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/biod|author=Martins VAP|year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|url=http://www.lefitummidi.webs.com/biod|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asexual reproduction===

Crops such as [[maize]] reproduce sexually each year. This randomizes which genes get propagated to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits can be lost. To maintain a high-quality crop, some farmers purchase seeds every year. Typically, the seed company maintains two [[inbred]] varieties and crosses them into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] strain that is then sold. Related plants like [[sorghum]] and gamma grass are able to perform [[apomixis]], a form of asexual reproduction that keeps the plant's DNA intact. This trait is apparently controlled by a single dominant gene, but traditional breeding has been unsuccessful in creating asexually-reproducing maize. Genetic engineering offers another route to this goal. Successful modification would allow farmers to replant harvested seeds that retain desirable traits, rather than relying on purchased seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 March 2003|periodical=[[Technology Review]]|author=Daniel Charles|title=Corn That Clones Itself|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401826/corn-that-clones-itself/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Genetic modifications to some crops also exist, which make it easier to process the crop. For instance, the [[Onion#Eye irritation|"no tears" onion]] prevents the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions (otherwise put, it does not irritate the eyes when the onion is cut.

Also, some crops (such as tomatoes) have been genetic modified to contain no seed at all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127640-gene-editing-opens-doors-to-seedless-fruit-with-no-need-for-bees/ Gene editing opens doors to seedless fruit with no need for bees]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
The number of USDA-approved field releases for testing grew from 4 in 1985 to 1,194 in 2002 and averaged around 800 per year thereafter. The number of sites per release and the number of gene constructs (ways that the gene of interest is packaged together with other elements)&amp;nbsp;– have rapidly increased since 2005. Releases with agronomic properties (such as drought resistance) jumped from 1,043 in 2005 to 5,190 in 2013. As of September 2013, about 7,800 releases had been approved for corn, more than 2,200 for soybeans, more than 1,100 for cotton, and about 900 for potatoes. Releases were approved for herbicide tolerance (6,772 releases), insect resistance (4,809), product quality such as flavor or nutrition (4,896), agronomic properties like drought resistance (5,190), and virus/fungal resistance (2,616). The institutions with the most authorized field releases include Monsanto with 6,782, Pioneer/DuPont with 1,405, Syngenta with 565, and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service with 370. As of September 2013 USDA had received proposals for releasing GM rice, squash, plum, rose, tobacco, flax, and chicory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1282242/err162_summary.pdf|title=Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States (summary)|date=February 2014|accessdate=3 October 2016|website=Economic Research Service USDA|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|last=Fernandez-Cornejo|first=Jorge|first2=Seth|last2=Wechsler|first3=Mike|last3=Livingston|first4=Lorraine|last4=Mitchell|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127005201/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1282242/err162_summary.pdf|archive-date=27 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===

====''Bacillus thuringiensis''====
Constant exposure to a toxin creates [[evolutionary pressure]] for pests resistant to that toxin. Over-reliance on [[glyphosate]] and a reduction in the diversity of weed management practices allowed the spread of glyphosate resistance in 14 weed species in the US,&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; and in soybeans.&lt;ref name=perry/&gt;

To reduce resistance to ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) crops, the 1996 commercialization of transgenic cotton and maize came with a management strategy to prevent insects from becoming resistant. Insect resistance management plans are mandatory for Bt crops. The aim is to encourage a large population of pests so that any (recessive) resistance genes are diluted within the population. Resistance lowers evolutionary fitness in the absence of the stressor, Bt. In refuges, non-resistant strains outcompete resistant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tabashnik | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2003 | title = Insect Resistance to Transgenic Bt Crops: Lessons from the Laboratory and Field | url = http://www.gmo-safety.eu/pdf/dokumente/bt_tabashnik.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J. Econ. Entomol. | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 1031–38 | doi = 10.1603/0022-0493-96.4.1031 | pmid = 14503572 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130314215007/http://www.gmo-safety.eu/pdf/dokumente/bt_tabashnik.pdf | archivedate = 14 March 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With sufficiently high levels of transgene expression, nearly all of the heterozygotes (S/s), i.e., the largest segment of the pest population carrying a resistance allele, will be killed before maturation, thus preventing transmission of the resistance gene to their progeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Roush RT | year= 1997 | title=Bt-transgenic crops: just another pretty insecticide or a chance for a new start in the resistance management? | journal = Pestic. Sci. | volume = 51 | issue =3 | pages=328–34 | doi =10.1002/(SICI)1096-9063(199711)51:3&lt;328::AID-PS650&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refuges (i. e., fields of nontransgenic plants) adjacent to transgenic fields increases the likelihood that homozygous resistant (s/s) individuals and any surviving heterozygotes will mate with susceptible (S/S) individuals from the refuge, instead of with other individuals carrying the resistance allele. As a result, the resistance gene frequency in the population remains lower.

Complicating factors can affect the success of the high-dose/refuge strategy. For example, if the temperature is not ideal, thermal stress can lower Bt toxin production and leave the plant more susceptible. More importantly, reduced late-season expression has been documented, possibly resulting from [[DNA methylation]] of the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year= 2007 | title= Variability of Endotoxin Expression in Bt Transgenic Cotton | journal= Journal of Agronomy &amp; Crop Science | volume= 193 | pages=21–29 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00240.x | author= Dong, H. Z. | last2= Li | first2= W. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the high-dose/refuge strategy has successfully maintained the value of Bt crops. This success has depended on factors independent of management strategy, including low initial resistance allele frequencies, fitness costs associated with resistance, and the abundance of non-Bt host plants outside the refuges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tabashnik BE, Carrière Y, Dennehy TJ |title=Insect resistance to transgenic Bt crops: lessons from the laboratory and field |journal=J.

Companies that produce Bt seed are introducing strains with multiple Bt proteins. Monsanto did this with Bt cotton in India, where the product was rapidly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx|title=Monsanto - Pink Bollworm Resistance to GM Cotton in India|author=APPDMZ\ccvivr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto has also; in an attempt to simplify the process of implementing refuges in fields to comply with Insect Resistance Management(IRM) policies and prevent irresponsible planting practices; begun marketing seed bags with a set proportion of refuge (non-transgenic) seeds mixed in with the Bt seeds being sold. Coined "Refuge-In-a-Bag" (RIB), this practice is intended to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional labor needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Real Deal: Explaining Monsanto's Refuge-in-the-Bag Concept|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/explaining-refuge-in-the-bag-concept.aspx|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100910040406/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/Explaining-Refuge-in-the-Bag-Concept.aspx|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 10 September 2010|website = www.monsanto.com|accessdate = 3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for [[corn rootworm]], but may increase the risk of resistance for [[lepidopteran]] corn pests, such as [[European corn borer]]. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.&lt;ref name="Siegfried"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siegfried|first=B.D.|title= Understanding successful resistance management |journal= GM Crops &amp; Food |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages= 184–93 |year= 2012 |url= http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=ent_pubs |doi=10.4161/gmcr.20715|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Devos"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Devos|first=Y.|title= Resistance evolution to the first generation of genetically modified Diabrotica-active Bt-maize events by western corn rootworm: management and monitoring considerations |journal= Transgenic Research |volume= 22  |issue=2|pages= 269–99 |year= 2013 |url= http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2247&amp;context=usdaarsfacpub |doi=10.1007/s11248-012-9657-4|display-authors=etal |pmid=23011587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Herbicide resistance====
[[Best management practices]] (BMPs) to control weeds may help delay resistance. BMPs include applying multiple herbicides with different modes of action, rotating crops, planting weed-free seed, scouting fields routinely, cleaning equipment to reduce the transmission of weeds to other fields, and maintaining field borders.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The most widely planted GM crops are designed to tolerate herbicides. By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate some of the same herbicides. [[Palmer amaranth]] is a weed that competes with cotton. A native of the southwestern US, it traveled east and was first found resistant to glyphosate in 2006, less than 10 years after GM cotton was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culpepper, Stanley A|title=Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) confirmed in Georgia|volume=54|issue=4|pages=620–26|year=2006|journal=Weed Science|doi=10.1614/ws-06-001r.1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallant, Andre|title=Pigweed in the Cotton: A superweed invades Georgia|journal=Modern Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plant protection ===
Farmers generally use less insecticide when they plant Bt-resistant crops. Insecticide use on corn farms declined from 0.21 pound per planted acre in 1995 to 0.02 pound in 2010. This is consistent with the decline in [[European corn borer]] populations as a direct result of Bt corn and cotton. The establishment of minimum refuge requirements helped delay the evolution of Bt resistance. However, resistance appears to be developing to some Bt traits in some areas.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Tillage===
By leaving at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface from harvest through planting, [[conservation tillage]] reduces soil erosion from wind and water, increases water retention, and reduces soil degradation as well as water and chemical runoff. In addition, conservation tillage reduces the carbon footprint of agriculture.&lt;ref name=till&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.agbioforum.org/v15n3/v15n3a01-fernandez-cornejo.htm|title = Conservation Tillage, Herbicide Use, and Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States: The Case of Soybeans|last = Fernandez-Cornejo |first = Jorge |first2=Charlie |last2 = Hallahan, |first3 = Richard |last3 = Nehring,  |first4 = Seth |last4 = Wechsler |first5 = Arthur |last5 = Grube|date = 2014|journal = AgBioForum|doi = |pmid = |access-date =3 October 2016|volume = 15|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review covering 12 states from 1996 to 2006, found that a 1% increase in herbicde-tolerant (HT) soybean adoption leads to a 0.21% increase in conservation tillage and a 0.3% decrease in quality-adjusted herbicide use.&lt;ref name=till/&gt;

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation of genetic engineering|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of each product. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.&lt;ref name="Wesseler-2011"&gt;[[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]], J. and N.

Farmers have widely adopted GM technology (see figure). Between 1996 and 2013, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased by a factor of 100, from {{convert|17000|km2|acre|sp=us}} to 1,750,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (432 million acres).&lt;ref name="James2013" /&gt; 10% of the world's [[arable land]] was planted with GM crops in 2010.&lt;ref name="James2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp|title=ISAAA Brief 43, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2011|last=James|first=C|year=2011|work=ISAAA Briefs|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA)|location=Ithaca, New York|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres (160 million hectares) in 29 countries such as the US, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Mexico and Spain.&lt;ref name="James2011" /&gt; One of the key reasons for this widespread adoption is the perceived economic benefit the technology brings to farmers. For example, the system of planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with the opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land, since this allowed them to plant rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.&lt;ref name="HighPlainsJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=Hpj.com |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, using Bt seeds means that farmers do not have to purchase insecticides, and then invest time, fuel, and equipment in applying them. However critics have disputed whether yields are higher and whether chemical use is less, with GM crops. See [[Genetically modified food controversies]] article for information.

==Controversy==
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}

Direct genetic engineering has been controversial since its introduction. Most, but not all of the controversies are over GM foods rather than crops per se. GM foods are the subject of protests, vandalism, referenda, legislation, court action&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2015) [http://orgprints.org/29110/8/29110.pdf The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update], Agriculture &amp; Food, 3: 56-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific disputes. The controversies involve consumers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations and scientists.

Opponents have objected to GM crops on multiple grounds including environmental impacts, food safety, whether GM crops are needed to address food needs, whether they are sufficiently accessible to farmers in developing countries&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and concerns over subjecting crops to [[intellectual property]] law. Secondary issues include labeling, the behavior of government regulators, the effects of pesticide use and pesticide tolerance.

A significant environmental concern about using genetically modified crops is possible cross-breeding with related crops, giving them advantages over naturally occurring varieties. One example is a glyphosate-resistant rice crop that crossbreeds with a weedy relative, giving the weed a competitive advantage. The transgenic hybrid had higher rates of photosynthesis, more shoots and flowers, and more seeds than the non-transgenic hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qiu|first=Jane|date=2013-08-16|title=Genetically modified crops pass benefits to weeds|url=https://www.nature.com/news/genetically-modified-crops-pass-benefits-to-weeds-1.13517|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13517|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates the possibility of ecosystem damage by GM crop usage.

There is a [[scientific consensus]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronald 11–20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food,&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu" /&gt; but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslberger 2003 739–741" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marris 2001 545–548" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Final Report of the PABE research project" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt; The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.&lt;ref name="loc.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashshur" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifferlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations" /&gt;

'''Henry Haywood Bell''' (13 April 1808 – 11 January 1868) was an admiral in the [[United States Navy]]. In the [[American Civil War]], he took part in the liberation of New Orleans and the lower Mississippi. Later he was sent to the Far East to command the East India Squadron. In summer 1867, he led a [[punitive expedition]] to avenge the [[Rover incident]], where American sailors had been killed by Taiwanese aborigines. In January of the next year, while trying to force the Japanese to accept trade concessions, he drowned when his boat overturned in bad weather.

==Biography==
Bell was born in [[Orange County, North Carolina]]. Appointed a [[Midshipman]] on 4 August 1823, during the next two decades he served afloat in U.S. [[Atlantic]] waters, the [[Mediterranean]] Sea and the [[West Indies]] as an officer of the [[frigate]]s {{USS|Constitution||2}} and {{USS|United States|1797|2}}; the [[sloop of war|sloops of war]] {{USS|Erie|1813|2}}, {{USS|Vincennes|1826|2}}, and {{USS|Marion|1839|2}}; and the [[schooner]] {{USS|Grampus|1821|2}}. In March 1831, while in ''Vincennes'', Bell was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. He was assigned to special service on a vessel named ''Hunter'' (apparently not part of the U.S. Navy) during the mid-1840s, then was off Africa and in the Mediterranean as an officer of the frigate ''United States'' and as commanding officer of the [[schooner]] {{USS|Boxer|1832|2}}. Between early 1849 and mid-1855, Bell served ashore at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard|Philadelphia]], [[Norfolk Navy Yard|Norfolk]] and [[New York Navy Yard|New York]] Navy Yards.

Promoted to the rank of [[Commander]] in August 1854, Bell went to the [[East India Squadron|East Indies]] in 1855-1858 as commanding officer of the [[steamboat|steamer]] {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|2}}. He spent the late 1850s and early 1860s as a member of the Board of Examiners at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] and on ordnance duty at both [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]], New York and the [[Washington Navy Yard]].

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he served as [[Fleet Captain]] of the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]] under Admiral [[David Farragut]]. He served in the series of campaigns that captured [[New Orleans]] and gradually opened the [[Mississippi River]] for exploitation by Federal forces. In July 1862, while so-engaged, he attained the rank of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]]. After completing his Gulf assignment in 1864, he was assigned to the New York Navy Yard as Inspector of Ordnance.

With the Civil War at an end, in July 1865 Commodore Bell was sent to the Far East to command the [[East India Squadron|East India]] (later [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic]]) Squadron. He was advanced to [[Rear Admiral]] a year later and placed on the Retired List in April 1867, but remained active as the Asiatic Squadron's commander.

==Death==
In summer 1867, Rear Admiral Bell led the Formosan Expedition, a [[punitive expedition|punitive operation]] in response to the [[Rover incident | ''Rover'' incident]], where American sailors had been killed by [[Taiwanese aborigines]]. His squadron including screw sloops of war, {{USS|Hartford|1858|6}} (flagship), {{USS|Shenandoah|1862|6}}, and {{USS|Oneida|1861|6}}, with warships of other western countries, anchored in [[Osaka Bay]] to increase pressure on the Japanese government to open Hyōgo Port on 1 January 1868 as committed by various [[unequal treaties]]. On 11 January 1868, having passed [[Mount Tenpō|Tempōzan]] en route upriver, his boat overturned by heavy seas; Bell and all but three of the craft's other occupants perished in this accident.

==Namesakes==
Two ships, {{USS|Bell}}, have been named for him.

{{Eastern name order|Ábrahám Jenő}}
'''Jenő Ábrahám''' ({{lang-sh-Latn|Jeno Abraham}}, {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Јено Абрахам}}) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] international [[Association football|football]] player.

Born in [[Szeged]], Hungary, he started playing in his hometown club [[Szegedi AK]] (SZAK).  In 1922 he came to Yugoslavia to play in [[FK Vojvodina]]. In September 1924 he was back in Hungary playing with SZAK.&lt;ref&gt;Sportista, n 32, Belgrade September 22, 1924, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1925 he moved to another Yugoslav club, the [[Zagreb]] giants [[Građanski Zagreb|1. HŠK Građanski]] where he would play one season and win the [[1926 Yugoslav First League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exyufudbal.in.rs/igraci/article/136 Jenő Ábrahám Yugoslav First League stats] at exyufudbal.in.rs&lt;/ref&gt; He usually played as left-winger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fkvojvodina.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=54552&amp;sid=46389dd23bd1f720964b296dc0ca043a Abraham Geza Saraz] at vojvodina.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 he left Yugoslavia and joined [[Szegedi AK|Bástya]] playing with them in the [[Nemzeti Bajnokság I|Hungarian Championship]] between 1926 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nela.hu/nb_jatekos.php?id=7951 Jenő Ábrahám NBI stats] at nela.hu&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922 and 1923, he played two matches for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]] while playing with Vojvodina&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu-football.info/_player.php?id=18482 Géza Ábrahám "Sarasz"] at EU_Football.info&lt;/ref&gt; having scored two goals. He participated, and scored twice, in the friendly match played on 28 July 1922 in Zagreb against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], which was a first ever win of the Yugoslav national team, with a final result of 4-3. His other, and last, match was a year later, on 3 July 1923, in a friendly match in [[Kraków]], against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], a 2-1 win.

Born as ''Jenő Ábrahám'' ({{lang-hu|Ábrahám Jenő}}), while playing in Yugoslavia, and in the national team, he was recorded in the chronicles as "Saraz", a Serbo-Croatian transliteration of the Hungarian word "Száraz", which means "Dry" in Hungarian, a name he received probably because of his looks. Many websites confuse Jenő Ábrahám with Eugen "Geza" Ábrahám.  The two played in FK Vojvodina in same time, and usually the first was recorded as Saraz I and the second as Saraz II.  Unfortunatelly many football-specialized internet websites merged the two and erroneously named the player described in this article as Geza Abraham Sarasz.

'''Marriage''', also called '''matrimony''' or '''wedlock''', is a socially or ritually recognised union between [[spouse]]s that establishes rights and obligations between those spouses, as well as between them and any resulting biological or adopted children and [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] (in-laws and other family through marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William A. |last2=Prins |first2=Harald E. L. |last3=McBride |first3=Bunny |last4=Walrath |first4=Dana |year=2011 |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-81178-7 |edition=13th}} "A nonethnocentric definition of marriage is a culturally sanctioned union between two or more people that establishes certain rights and obligations between the people, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws."&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of marriage varies around the world not only between cultures and between religions, but also throughout the history of any given culture and religion, evolving to both expand and constrict in who and what is encompassed, but typically it is principally an [[institution]] in which interpersonal relationships, usually [[Human sexual activity|sexual]], are acknowledged or sanctioned. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory [[Premarital sex|before pursuing any sexual activity]]. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a [[cultural universal]]. A marriage ceremony is known as a [[wedding]].
[[File:Nepalese marriage.jpg|thumb|Nepali wedding]]

Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, [[Libido|libidinal]], emotional, financial, [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and religious purposes. Whom they marry may be influenced by [[gender]], [[Incest taboo|socially determined rules of incest]], [[Alliance theory|prescriptive marriage rules]], parental choice and individual desire. In some areas of the world, [[arranged marriage]], [[child marriage]], [[polygamy]], and sometimes [[forced marriage]], may be practiced as a cultural tradition. Conversely, such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns of the infringement of women's rights, or the infringement of children's rights (both female and male children), and because of international law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/ Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2008], Vol. 1, p. 1353, US Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world, primarily in developed democracies, there has been a general trend towards ensuring [[Women's rights|equal rights]] within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of [[interfaith marriage|interfaith]], [[interracial marriage|interracial]], and [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] couples. These trends coincide with the broader [[human rights movement]].

Marriage can be recognized by a [[State (polity)|state]], an [[organization]], a religious authority, a [[tribe|tribal group]], a local [[community]], or peers. It is often viewed as a [[contract]]. When a marriage is performed and carried out by a government institution in accordance with the [[marriage law]]s of the jurisdiction, without religious content, it is a [[civil marriage]]. Civil marriage recognizes and creates the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony before the state. When a marriage is performed with religious content under the auspices of a religious institution it is a religious marriage. Religious marriage recognizes and creates the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony before that religion. Religious marriage is known variously as [[sacrament|sacramental marriage]] in [[Catholicism]], [[nikah]] in [[Islam]], [[nissuin]] in [[Judaism]], and various other names in other faith traditions, each with their own constraints as to what constitutes, and who can enter into, a valid religious marriage.

Some countries do not recognize locally performed religious marriage on its own, and require a separate civil marriage for official purposes. Conversely, civil marriage does not exist in some countries governed by a [[Theocracy|religious legal system]], such as [[Saudi Arabia]], where marriages contracted abroad might not be recognized if they were contracted contrary to Saudi interpretations of [[Sharia|Islamic religious law]]. In countries governed by a [[Millet system|mixed secular-religious legal system]], such as in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]], locally performed civil marriage also does not exist within the country, preventing interfaith and various other marriages contradicting religious laws from being entered into in the country, however, civil marriages performed abroad are recognized by the state even if they conflict with religious laws (in the case of recognition of [[marriage in Israel]], this includes recognition of not only interfaith civil marriages performed abroad, but also overseas same-sex civil marriages).

The act of marriage usually creates [[normative]] or legal obligations between the individuals involved, and any offspring they may produce or adopt. In terms of legal recognition, most sovereign states and other jurisdictions limit marriage to [[heterosexuality|opposite-sex]] couples and a diminishing number of these permit [[polygyny]], [[child marriage]]s, and [[forced marriage]]s. In modern times, a growing number of countries, primarily developed democracies, have lifted bans on and have established legal recognition for the marriages of [[interfaith marriage|interfaith]], [[interracial marriage|interracial]], and [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] couples. Some cultures allow the dissolution of marriage through [[divorce]] or [[annulment]]. In some areas, child marriages and polygamy may occur in spite of national laws against the practice.

Since the late twentieth century, major social changes in Western countries have led to changes in the demographics of marriage, with the age of first marriage increasing, fewer people marrying, and more couples choosing to [[Cohabitation|cohabit]] rather than marry. For example, the number of marriages in Europe decreased by 30% from 1975 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Vucheva, Elitsa. (30 July 2013) [http://euobserver.com/social/27161 / Social Affairs / Europeans marry older, less often]. Euobserver.com. Retrieved on 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in most cultures, married women had very few rights of their own, being considered, along with the family's children, the property of the [[husband]]; as such, they could not own or inherit property, or represent themselves legally (see for example [[coverture]]). In Europe, the United States, and other places in the [[developed country|developed world]], beginning in the late 19th century and lasting through the 21st century, marriage has undergone gradual legal changes, aimed at improving the rights of the wife. These changes included giving wives legal identities of their own, abolishing the right of husbands to physically discipline their wives, giving wives property rights, liberalizing divorce laws, providing wives with [[reproductive rights]] of their own, and requiring a [[wife]]'s consent when sexual relations occur. These changes have occurred primarily in [[Western world|Western countries]]. In the 21st century, there continue to be controversies regarding the legal status of married women, legal acceptance of or leniency towards violence within marriage (especially sexual violence), traditional marriage customs such as [[dowry]] and [[bride price]], forced marriage, [[marriageable age]], and criminalization of consensual behaviors such as [[premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]].

==Etymology==
The word "marriage" derives from [[Middle English]] ''mariage'', which first appears in 1250–1300 [[Common Era|CE]]. This in turn is derived from [[Old French]], ''marier'' (to marry), and ultimately [[Latin]], ''marītāre'', meaning to provide with a husband or wife and ''marītāri'' meaning to get married. The adjective ''marīt-us -a, -um'' meaning matrimonial or nuptial could also be used in the masculine form as a noun for "husband" and in the feminine form for "wife".&lt;ref name="OED_marriage"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 11th Edition, "marriage"&lt;/ref&gt; The related word "matrimony" derives from the Old French word ''matremoine'', which appears around 1300 [[Common Era|CE]] and ultimately derives from Latin ''mātrimōnium'', which combines the two concepts: ''mater'' meaning "[[mother]]" and the suffix -''monium'' signifying "action, state, or condition".&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=matrimony |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Anthropologist]]s have proposed several competing definitions of marriage in an attempt to encompass the wide variety of marital practices observed across cultures.&lt;ref name = "Bell" /&gt; Even within [[Western culture]], "definitions of marriage have careened from one extreme to another and everywhere in between" (as Evan Gerstmann has put it).&lt;ref&gt;Gerstmann, Evan.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6o9FQgK7H8gC&amp;pg=PA22 Same-sex Marriage and the Constitution]'', p. 22 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation recognized by custom or law===
In ''[[The History of Human Marriage]]'' (1922), [[Edvard Westermarck]] defined marriage as "a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShU3N7_GaMYC|title=History of Human Marriage 1922|last=Westermarck|first=Edward|date=2003-04-01|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=9780766146181|location=|pages=71|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization'' (1936), he rejected his earlier definition, instead provisionally defining marriage as "a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by custom or law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ8LyGDtSZIC|title=The Future of Marriage in Western Civilisation|last=Westermarck|first=Edward|date=1936|publisher=Books for Libraries Press|isbn=9780836953046|location=|pages=3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimacy of offspring===
The anthropological handbook ''Notes and Queries'' (1951) defined marriage as "a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners."&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes and Queries on Anthropology|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute|year=1951|page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of a practice by the [[Nuer people]] of Sudan allowing women to act as a husband in certain circumstances (the [[Ghost marriage (Sudanese)|ghost marriage]]), [[Kathleen Gough]] suggested modifying this to "a woman and one or more other persons."&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gough|first=E. Kathleen|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|journal=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1959|pages=23–34|volume=89|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2844434|jstor=2844434}} Nuer female-female marriage is done to keep property within a family that has no sons. It is not a form of lesbianism.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of marriage among the Nayar, a polyandrous society in India, Gough found that the group lacked a husband role in the conventional sense; that unitary role in the west was divided between a non-resident "social father" of the woman's children, and her lovers who were the actual procreators. None of these men had legal rights to the woman's child. This forced Gough to disregard sexual access as a key element of marriage and to define it in terms of legitimacy of offspring alone: marriage is "a relationship established between a woman and one or more other persons, which provides a child born to the woman under circumstances not prohibited by the rules of relationship, is accorded full birth-status rights common to normal members of his society or social stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gough|first=Kathleen|title=Marriage, Family and Residence|year=1968|publisher=Natural History Press|location=New York|page=68|editor=Paul Bohannan &amp; John Middleton|chapter=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic anthropologist [[Duran Bell]] has criticized the legitimacy-based definition on the basis that some societies do not require marriage for legitimacy. He argued that a legitimacy-based definition of marriage is circular in societies where illegitimacy has no other legal or social implications for a child other than the mother being unmarried.&lt;ref name = "Bell" /&gt;

===Collection of rights===
[[Edmund Leach]] criticized Gough's definition for being too restrictive in terms of recognized legitimate offspring and suggested that marriage be viewed in terms of the different types of rights it serves to establish. In 1955 article in ''[[Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|Man]]'', Leach argued that no one definition of marriage applied to all cultures. He offered a list of ten rights associated with marriage, including sexual monopoly and rights with respect to children, with specific rights differing across cultures. Those rights, according to Leach, included:
# "To establish a legal father of a woman's children.
# To establish a legal mother of a man's children.
# To give the husband a monopoly in the wife's sexuality.
# To give the wife a monopoly in the husband's sexuality.
# To give the husband partial or monopolistic rights to the wife's domestic and other labour services.
# To give the wife partial or monopolistic rights to the husband's domestic and other labour services.
# To give the husband partial or total control over property belonging or potentially accruing to the wife.
# To give the wife partial or total control over property belonging or potentially accruing to the husband.
# To establish a joint fund of property – a partnership – for the benefit of the children of the marriage.
# To establish a socially significant 'relationship of affinity' between the husband and his wife's brothers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leach|first=Edmund|title=Polyandry, Inheritance and the Definition of Marriage|journal=Man|date=Dec 1955|volume=55|issue=12|page=183|doi=10.2307/2795331|jstor=2795331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right of sexual access===
In a 1997 article in ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', [[Duran Bell]] describes marriage as "a relationship between one or more men (male or female) in severalty to one or more women that provides those men with a demand-right of sexual access within a domestic group and identifies women who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men." In referring to "men in severalty", Bell is referring to corporate kin groups such as lineages which, in having paid brideprice, retain a right in a woman's offspring even if her husband (a lineage member) deceases ([[Levirate marriage]]). In referring to "men (male or female)", Bell is referring to women within the lineage who may stand in as the "social fathers" of the wife's children born of other lovers. (See Nuer "[[Ghost marriage (Sudanese)|ghost marriage]]")&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Duran|title=Defining Marriage and Legitimacy|jstor=2744491|url=http://www.economics.uci.edu/~dbell/marriageandlegit.pdf|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1997|volume=38|issue=2|pages=237–54|doi=10.1086/204606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of marriage==

===Monogamy===
[[File:Marriage_of_Inanna_and_Dumuzi.png|thumb|right|alt=The marriage of Inanna and Dumuzid|Ancient [[Sumer]]ian depiction of the marriage of [[Inanna]] and [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lung|first=Tang|title=Marriage of Inanna and Dumuzi|url=http://www.ancient.eu/image/2636/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main article|Monogamy}}

Monogamy is a form of marriage in which an individual has only one spouse during their lifetime or at any one time (serial monogamy).

Anthropologist [[Jack Goody]]'s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the [[Human Relations Area Files|Ethnographic Atlas]] found a strong correlation between intensive plough agriculture, dowry and monogamy. This pattern was found in a broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland. The majority of Sub-Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture, in contrast, show a correlation between "[[bride price]]" and polygamy.&lt;ref name="Goody 1976 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further study drawing on the Ethnographic Atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society, the belief in "high gods" to support human morality, and monogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roes|first=Frans L.|title=The Size of Societies, Monogamy, and Belief in High Gods Supporting Human Morality|journal=Tijdschrift Voor Sociale Wetenschappen|year=1992|volume=37|issue=1|pages=53–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the countries which do not permit polygamy, a person who marries in one of those countries a person while still being lawfully married to another commits the crime of [[bigamy]]. In all cases, the second marriage is considered legally null and void. Besides the second and subsequent marriages being void, the bigamist is also liable to other penalties, which also vary between jurisdictions.

====Serial monogamy====
Governments that support monogamy may allow easy divorce. In a number of Western countries divorce rates approach 50%. Those who remarry do so on average three times. Divorce and remarriage can thus result in "serial monogamy", i.e. having multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time. This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating, as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the [[Caribbean]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Brazil]] where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners. In all, these account for 16 to 24% of the "monogamous" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin|title=Reproduction &amp; Succession: Studies in Anthropology, Law and Society|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serial monogamy creates a new kind of relative, the "ex-". The "ex-wife", for example, remains an active part of her "ex-husband's" or "ex-wife's" life, as they may be tied together by transfers of resources (alimony, child support), or shared child custody. Bob Simpson notes that in the British case, serial monogamy creates an "extended family" – a number of households tied together in this way, including mobile children (possible exes may include an ex-wife, an ex-brother-in-law, etc., but not an "ex-child"). These "unclear families" do not fit the mould of the monogamous [[nuclear family]]. As a series of connected households, they come to resemble the polygynous model of separate households maintained by mothers with children, tied by a male to whom they are married or divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Bob|title=Changing Families: An Ethnographic Approach to Divorce and Separation|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polygamy===
{{main article|Polygamy}}
Polygamy is a marriage which includes more than two partners.&lt;ref name=Zeitzen&gt;{{cite book |last=Zeitzen |first=Miriam Koktvedgaard |title=Polygamy: a cross-cultural analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIzHjpTJgdQC&amp;pg=PA3 |publisher=Berg |page=3 |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84520-220-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, the relationship is called [[polygyny]], and there is no marriage bond between the wives; and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called [[polyandry]], and there is no marriage bond between the husbands. If a marriage includes multiple husbands and/or wives, it can be called [[group marriage]].&lt;ref name=Zeitzen/&gt;

A molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, and more recently in Africa and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dupanloup I, Pereira L, Bertorelle G, Calafell F, Prata MJ, Amorim A, Barbujani G | year = 2003 | title = A recent shift from polygyny to monogamy in humans is suggested by the analysis of worldwide Y-chromosome diversity | journal = J Mol Evol | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 85–97 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-003-2458-x | pmid = 12962309 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.1662 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, Anthropologist [[Jack Goody]]'s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the [[Human Relations Area Files|Ethnographic Atlas]] found that the majority of Sub-Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture show a correlation between "[[Bride price]]" and polygamy.&lt;ref name="Goody 1976 7"/&gt; A survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy, although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ember|first=Carol R.|title=What we know and what we don't know about variation in social organization: Melvin Ember's approach to the study of kinship|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=27–30|doi=10.1177/1069397110383947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriages are classified according to the number of legal spouses an individual has. The suffix "-gamy" refers specifically to the number of spouses, as in [[Bigamy|bi-gamy]] (two spouses, generally illegal in most nations), and poly-gamy (more than one spouse).

Societies show variable acceptance of polygamy as a cultural ideal and practice. According to the [[Human Relations Area Files|Ethnographic Atlas]], of 1,231 societies noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry.&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/worldcul/Codebook4EthnoAtlas.pdf ''Ethnographic Atlas Codebook''] derived from George P. Murdock's ''Ethnographic Atlas'' recording the marital composition of 1231 societies from 1960 to 1980&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Miriam Zeitzen writes, social tolerance for polygamy is different from the practice of polygamy, since it requires wealth to establish multiple households for multiple wives. The actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low, with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage. Tracking the occurrence of polygamy is further complicated in jurisdictions where it has been banned, but continues to be practiced (''de facto polygamy'').&lt;ref name="Zeitzen 2008 5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeitzen|first=Miriam Koktvedgaard|title=Polygamy: A Cross-Cultural Analysis|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=5|isbn=978-1847886170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeitzen also notes that Western perceptions of African society and marriage patterns are biased by "contradictory concerns of nostalgia for traditional African culture versus critique of polygamy as oppressive to women or detrimental to development."&lt;ref name="Zeitzen 2008 5"/&gt; Polygamy has been condemned as being a form of human rights abuse, with concerns arising over domestic abuse, forced marriage, and neglect. The vast majority of the world's countries, including virtually all of the world's developed nations, do not permit polygamy. There have been calls for the abolition of polygamy in developing countries.

{{See also|Concubinage}}
Polygyny usually grants wives equal status, although the husband may have personal preferences. One type of de facto polygyny is [[concubinage]], where only one woman gets a wife's rights and status, while other women remain legal house mistresses.

Although a society may be classified as polygynous, not all marriages in it necessarily are; monogamous marriages may in fact predominate. It is to this flexibility that Anthropologist [[Robin Fox]] attributes its success as a social support system: "This has often meant – given the imbalance in the sex ratios, the higher male infant mortality, the shorter life span of males, the loss of males in wartime, etc. – that often women were left without financial support from husbands. To correct this condition, females had to be killed at birth, remain single, become prostitutes, or be siphoned off into celibate religious orders. Polygynous systems have the advantage that they can promise, as did the Mormons, a home and family for every woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin|title=Reproduction &amp; Succession: Studies in Anthropology, Law, and Society|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, polygyny is a gender issue which offers men asymmetrical benefits. In some cases, there is a large age discrepancy (as much as a generation) between a man and his youngest wife, compounding the power differential between the two. Tensions not only exist ''between'' genders, but also ''within'' genders; senior and junior men compete for wives, and senior and junior wives in the same household may experience radically different life conditions, and internal hierarchy. Several studies have suggested that the wive's relationship with other women, including co-wives and husband's female kin, are more critical relationships than that with her husband for her productive, reproductive and personal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeitzen|first=Miriam Koktvedgaard|title=Polygamy: A Cross-Cultural Analysis|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|pages=125–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, the co-wives are relatives, usually sisters, a practice called ''sororal polygyny''; the pre-existing relationship between the co-wives is thought to decrease potential tensions within the marriage.&lt;ref name="Zeitzen 2008 9"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeitzen|first=Miriam Koktvedgaard|title=Polygamy: A Cross-Cultural Analysis|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox argues that "the major difference between polygyny and monogamy could be stated thus: while plural mating occurs in both systems, under polygyny several unions may be recognized as being legal marriages while under monogamy only one of the unions is so recognized. Often, however, it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line between the two."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin|title=Reproduction &amp; Succession: Studies in Anthropology, Law and Society|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As polygamy in Africa is increasingly subject to legal limitations, a variant form of ''de facto'' (as opposed to legal or ''de jure'') polygyny is being practised in urban centres. Although it does not involve multiple (now illegal) formal marriages, the domestic and personal arrangements follow old polygynous patterns. The de facto form of polygyny is found in other parts of the world as well (including some Mormon sects and Muslim families in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zeitzen|first=Miriam Koktvedgaard|title=Polygamy: A Cross-Cultural Analysis|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|pages=17, 89–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some societies such as the [[Lovedu]] of South Africa, or the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] of the Sudan, aristocratic women may become female 'husbands.' In the Lovedu case, this female husband may take a number of polygamous wives. This is not a lesbian relationship, but a means of legitimately expanding a royal lineage by attaching these wives' children to it. The relationships are considered polygynous, not polyandrous, because the female husband is in fact assuming masculine gendered political roles.&lt;ref name="Zeitzen 2008 9"/&gt;

Religious groups have differing views on the legitimacy of [[polygyny]]. It is allowed in [[Islam]] and [[Confucianism]]. [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] have mentioned practices involving polygyny in the past, however, outright religious acceptance of such practices was not addressed until its rejection in later passages. They do explicitly prohibit polygyny today.

====Polyandry====
{{main article|Polyandry|Polyandry in Tibet|Polyandry in India}}

[[Polyandry]] is notably more rare than polygyny, though less rare than the figure commonly cited in the ''Ethnographic Atlas'' (1980) which listed only those polyandrous societies found in the Himalayan Mountains. More recent studies have found 53 societies outside the 28 found in the Himalayans which practice polyandry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starkweather|first1=Katherine|last2=Hames|first2=Raymond|title=A survey of non-classical polyandry|journal=Human Nature|date=June 2012|volume=23|issue=2|pages=149–172|doi=10.1007/s12110-012-9144-x|pmid=22688804|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D1049%26context%3Danthropologyfacpub|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923033542/http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=anthropologyfacpub|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most common in egalitarian societies marked by high male mortality or male absenteeism. It is associated with ''partible paternity'', the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starkweather|first1=Katherine|last2=Hames|first2=Raymond|title=A survey of non-classical polyandry|journal=Human Nature|date=June 2012|volume=23|issue=2|pages=149–72|doi=10.1007/s12110-012-9144-x|pmid=22688804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanation for polyandry in the Himalayan Mountains is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife (''fraternal polyandry'') allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (the dis-inheriting of most siblings, some of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Nancy|title=The Dynamics of polyandry: kinship, domesticity, and population on the Tibetan border|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plural marriage====
[[Group marriage]] (also known as ''multi-lateral marriage'') is a form of [[polyamory]] in which more than two persons form a [[family]] unit, with all the members of the group marriage being considered to be married to all the other members of the group marriage, and all members of the marriage share [[parent]]al responsibility for any children arising from the marriage.&lt;ref name=murdock-1949-definition&gt;Murdock, 1949, p. 24. "''group marriage'' or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women."&lt;/ref&gt; No country legally condones group marriages, neither under the law nor as a common law marriage, but historically it has been practiced by some cultures of Polynesia, Asia, Papua New Guinea and the Americas – as well as in some [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] and alternative subcultures such as the [[Oneida Community|Oneida Perfectionists]] in up-state New York. Of the 250 societies reported by the American anthropologist [[George Murdock]] in 1949, only the [[Kaingang]] of Brazil had any group marriages at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/247131/group-marriage|title=Group Marriage|journal=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child marriage===
{{main article|Child marriage}}
A child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="Child Marriage"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html Child Marriage] UNICEF (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/14/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights|title=Q &amp; A: Child Marriage and Violations of Girls' Rights - Human Rights Watch|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to child [[Engagement#Betrothal|betrothal]] and [[teenage pregnancy]].

Child marriage was common throughout history, even up until the 1900s in the United States, where in 1880 CE, in the state of [[Delaware]], the age of consent for marriage was 7 years old.&lt;ref name=gmu-aoc&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Stephen|title=Age of Consent Laws|url=https://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24|website=Children and Youth in History|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in 2017, over half of the 50 United States have no explicit minimum age to marry and several states set the age as low as 14.&lt;ref name=tahirih&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding State Statutes on Minimum Marriage Age and Exceptions Laws|url=http://www.tahirih.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FINAL-State-Marriage-Age-Requirements-Statutory-Compilation-PDF.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215001447/http://www.tahirih.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FINAL-State-Marriage-Age-Requirements-Statutory-Compilation-PDF.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 December 2016|website=Tahirih Justice Center|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is condemned by international human rights organizations.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=I have a right to - BBC World Service|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/|title=WHO - Child marriages: 39 000 every day|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child marriages are often arranged between the families of the future bride and groom, sometimes as soon as the girl is born.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; However, in the late 1800s in England and the United States, [[Feminism|feminist]] activists began calling for raised age of consent laws, which was eventually handled in the 1920s, having been raised to 16-18.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia-aoc&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bullough|first1=Vern L.|title=Age of Consent|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/age_of_consent.aspx|website=Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale Group|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child marriages can also occur in the context of [[bride kidnapping]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In the year 1552 CE, John Somerford and Jane Somerford Brereton were both married at the ages of 3 and 2, respectively. Twelve years later, in 1564, John filed for divorce.&lt;ref name="woman-compendium"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Hermann Heinrich Ploss, Max Bartels, Paul Bartels |title=Woman: An Historical Gynæcological and Anthropological Compendium |date=1935 |publisher=William Heinemann (Medical Books) Ltd. |location=London, England |isbn=978-1-4831-9419-6 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yW0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faqs-aoc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Age of Consent |url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |website=Faqs.org |accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While child marriage is observed for both boys and girls, the overwhelming majority of child spouses are girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/policyanalysis/files/Note_on_Child_Marriage.pdf A Note on Child Marriage] UNICEF (July 2012), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, only one marriage-partner is a child, usually the female, due to the importance placed upon female [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Causes of child marriage include [[poverty]], [[bride price]], [[dowry]], laws that allow child marriages, [[Religion|religious]] and [[Peer pressure|social pressures]], regional customs, fear of remaining unmarried, and perceived inability of women to work for money.

Today, child marriages are widespread in parts of the world; being most common in [[South Asia]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with more than half of the girls in some countries in those regions being married before 18.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; The incidence of child marriage has been falling in most parts of the world. In developed countries child marriage is outlawed or restricted.

Girls who marry before 18 are at greater risk of becoming victims of [[domestic violence]], than those who marry later, especially when they are married to a much older man.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

===Same-sex and third-gender marriages===
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage|History of same-sex unions}}
As noted above, several kinds of same-sex, non-sexual marriages exist in some lineage-based societies. This section relates to same-sex sexual unions. Some cultures include [[third gender]] ([[Two-Spirit|two-spirit]] or transgender) individuals, such as the [[Two-Spirit|berdache]] of the [[Zuni]] in New Mexico. [[We'wha]], one of the most revered Zuni elders (an Ihamana, spiritual leader) served as an emissary of the Zuni to Washington, where he met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had a husband who was generally recognized as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.|title=A History of Same-Sex Marriage|journal=Virginia Law Review|year=1993|volume=79|pages=1453–58|doi=10.2307/1073379|issue=7|jstor=1073379|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/1504|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is a relatively new practice to grant same-sex couples the same form of legal marital recognition as commonly granted to mixed-sex couples, there is some history of recorded same-sex unions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PT267 |title=The Origins and Role of Same-sex Relations in Human Societies |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3513-5|year=2009|author1=Neill|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="same_sex_marriage_a09"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Alderson|first1=Kevin|last2=Lahey|first2=Kathleen A.|title=Same-Sex Marriage: The Personal and the Political|url = https://books.google.com/?id=hR0_CoNj6GAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA16|year = 2004|publisher = Insomniac Press |isbn=978-1-894663-63-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek]] [[same-sex relationship]]s were like modern companionate marriages, unlike their different-sex marriages in which the spouses had few emotional ties, and the husband had freedom to engage in outside sexual liaisons. The [[Codex Theodosianus]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) issued in 438 [[Common Era|CE]] imposed severe penalties or death on same-sex relationships,&lt;ref&gt;''ubi scelus est id, quod non proficit scire, ubi venus mutatur in alteram formam, ubi amor quaeritur nec videtur, iubemus insurgere leges, armari iura gladio ultore, ut exquisitis poenis subdantur infames, qui sunt vel qui futuri sunt rei.''[http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber09.htm#7 Ancientrome.ru] "where that crime is found, which is unfit even to know, we command the law to arise armed with an avenging sword that the infamous men who are, or shall in future be guilty of it, may undergo the most severe punishments." translation by Lord [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1769, Vol. IV, pp. 215–16.&lt;/ref&gt; but the exact intent of the law and its relation to social practice is unclear, as only a few examples of same-sex relationships in that culture exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kuefler |first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal = [[Journal of Family History]]|volume=32|pages=343–70|url=http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/32/4/343|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex unions were celebrated in some regions of China, such as [[Fujian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hinsch|first1=Bret|title=Passions of the Cut Sleeve: The Male Homosexual Tradition in China|year=1990|publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed Business Information, Inc.]]|isbn=978-0-520-07869-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the earliest documented same-sex wedding in [[Latin Church|Latin Christendom]] occurred in [[Rome|Rome, Italy]], at the [[San Giovanni a Porta Latina]] basilica in 1581.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bway.net/~halsall/lgbh/lgbh-montaigne.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=1998-12-05|access-date=2017-12-05|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981205014731/http://www.bway.net/~halsall/lgbh/lgbh-montaigne.txt|archivedate=5 December 1998|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary marriages===
Several cultures have practiced temporary and conditional marriages. Examples include the [[Celts|Celtic]] practice of [[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfasting]] and fixed-term marriages in the Muslim community. Pre-Islamic Arabs practiced a form of temporary marriage that carries on today in the practice of [[Nikah mut‘ah]], a fixed-term marriage contract. The Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] sanctioned a temporary marriage – [[Nikah mut‘ah|sigheh]] in [[Iran]] and muta'a in [[Iraq]] – which can provide a legitimizing cover for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The same forms of temporary marriage have been used in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran to make the donation of a human ova legal for [[in vitro fertilisation]]; a woman cannot, however, use this kind of marriage to obtain a sperm donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia|title=Making Muslim Babies: IVF and Gamete Donation in Sunni versus Shi'a Islam|journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=427–50|doi=10.1007/s11013-006-9027-x|pmid=17051430|pmc=1705533}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikah mut‘ah#Criticism of Nikah Mut.27ah|Muslim controversies related to Nikah Mut'ah]] have resulted in the practice being confined mostly to [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] communities. The matrilineal [[Mosuo]] of China practice what they call "walking marriage".

===Cohabitation===
{{See also|Cohabitation|Common-law marriage}}
In some jurisdictions [[cohabitation]], in certain circumstances, may constitute a [[common-law marriage]], an [[Unregistered cohabitation|unregistered partnership]], or otherwise provide the unmarried partners with various rights and responsibilities; and in some countries the laws recognize cohabitation in lieu of institutional marriage for taxation and social security benefits. This is the case, for example, in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1997240/s995.1.html Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 – Sect 995.1(1)]: ""spouse" of an individual includes: (a) another individual (whether of the same sex or a different sex) with whom the individual is in a relationship that is registered under a * State law or * Territory law prescribed for the purposes of section 22B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section; and (b) another individual who, although not legally married to the individual, lives with the individual on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple."&lt;/ref&gt; Cohabitation may be an option pursued as a form of resistance to traditional institutionalized marriage. However, in this context, some nations reserve the right to define the relationship as marital, or otherwise to regulate the relation, even if the relation has not been registered with the state or a religious institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew J.|title=The Deinstitutionalization of American Marriage|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|year=2004|volume=66|issue=4|pages=848–61|doi=10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00058.x|url=https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/evidence/DIX0049.pdf|access-date=25 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201000346/https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/evidence/DIX0049.pdf|archive-date=1 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.614.8920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, institutionalized marriages may not involve cohabitation. In some cases couples living together do not wish to be recognized as married. This may occur because pension or alimony rights are adversely affected; because of taxation considerations; because of immigration issues, or for other reasons. Such marriages have also been increasingly common in [[Beijing]]. Guo Jianmei, director of the center for women's studies at Beijing University, told a [[Newsday]] correspondent, "Walking marriages reflect sweeping changes in Chinese society." A "walking marriage" refers to a type of temporary marriage formed by the [[Mosuo]] of China, in which male partners live elsewhere and make nightly visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gargan|first=Edward A.|title=China's New Brides Put Freedom First/All perks, no work in 'walking marriages'|page=A.04|work=[[Newsday]]|date=19 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement in [[Saudi Arabia]], called [[Nikah Misyar|misyar marriage]], also involves the husband and wife living separately but meeting regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karam|first=Souhail|title=Misyar offers marriage-lite in strict Saudi society|agency= Reuters| date = 21 July 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/21/misyar_offers_marriage_lite_in_strict_saudi_society/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218200946/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/21/misyar_offers_marriage_lite_in_strict_saudi_society/|archivedate=18 February 2009|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partner selection==
There is wide cross-cultural variation in the social rules governing the selection of a partner for marriage. There is variation in the degree to which partner selection is an individual decision by the partners or a collective decision by the partners' kin groups, and there is variation in the rules regulating which partners are valid choices.

The United Nations World Fertility Report of 2003 reports that 89% of all people get married before age forty-nine.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations,2004"&gt;United Nations (2004). World Fertility Report: 2003. Retrieved 26 April 2006 from http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldfertility/World_Fertility_Report.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The percent of women and men who marry before age forty-nine drops to nearly 50% in some nations and reaches near 100% in other nations.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations,2000"&gt;United Nations (2000). World Marriage Patterns 2000. Retrieved 26 April 2006 from http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldmarriage/worldmarriagepatterns2000.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cultures with less strict rules governing the groups from which a partner can be chosen the selection of a marriage partner may involve either the couple going through a selection process of [[courtship]] or the marriage may be [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by the couple's parents or an outside party, a [[matchmaking|matchmaker]].

===Social status===
{{Main article|Hypergamy}}
Some people want to marry a person with higher or lower status than them. Others want to marry people who have similar status.

An [[Avunculate marriage]] is a marriage that occurs between an uncle and his niece or between an aunt and her nephew. Such marriages are illegal in most countries due to incest restrictions. However, a small number of countries have legalized it, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, [[Malaysia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%204/Act%20164.pdf Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307174301/http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%204/Act%20164.pdf |date=7 March 2012 }} (for Hindus only)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.semkodeks.ru/articles/sk-glava-3/sm-statia-14/ The Family Code of the Russian Federation, Article 14 (in Russian)].

In various societies the choice of partner is often limited to suitable persons from specific social groups. In some societies the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual's own social group – [[endogamy]], this is often the case in class- and caste-based societies. But in other societies a partner must be chosen from a different group than one's own – [[exogamy]], this may be the case in societies practicing [[totem]]ic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans, such as most [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal Australian]] societies. In other societies a person is expected to marry their [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousin]], a woman must marry her father's sister's son and a man must marry his mother's brother's daughter – this is often the case if either a society has a rule of tracing kinship exclusively through patrilineal or matrilineal descent groups as among the [[Akan people]] of West Africa. Another kind of marriage selection is the [[levirate marriage]] in which widows are obligated to marry their husband's brother, mostly found in societies where kinship is based on endogamous clan groups.

Religion has commonly weighed in on the matter of which relatives, if any, are allowed to marry. Relations may be by [[consanguinity]] or [[Affinity (law)|affinity]], meaning by blood or by marriage. On the marriage of cousins, [[Catholicism|Catholic]] policy has evolved from initial acceptance, through a long period of general prohibition, to the contemporary requirement for a dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;

===Prescriptive marriage===
{{Main article|Arranged marriage}}
[[File:Lodewijk XIV-Marriage.jpg|thumb|left|An arranged marriage between [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].]]

In a wide array of lineage-based societies with a [[Kinship|classificatory kinship system]], potential spouses are sought from a specific class of relative as determined by a prescriptive marriage rule. This rule may be expressed by anthropologists using a "descriptive" kinship term, such as a "man's mother's brother's daughter" (also known as a "cross-cousin"). Such descriptive rules mask the participant's perspective: a man should marry a woman from his mother's lineage. Within the society's kinship terminology, such relatives are usually indicated by a specific term which sets them apart as potentially marriageable. [[Pierre Bourdieu]] notes, however, that very few marriages ever follow the rule, and that when they do so, it is for "practical kinship" reasons such as the preservation of family property, rather than the "official kinship" ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK|pages=27–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as regular marriages following prescriptive rules occur, lineages are linked together in fixed relationships; these ties between lineages may form political alliances in kinship dominated societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radcliffe-Brown, A.R.|first=Daryll Forde|title=African Systems of Kinship and Marriage|year=1950|publisher=KPI Limited|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[Structural functionalism|structural]] anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] developed [[alliance theory]] to account for the "elementary" kinship structures created by the limited number of prescriptive marriage rules possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|year=1963|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pragmatic (or 'arranged') marriage is made easier by formal procedures of family or group politics. A responsible authority sets up or encourages the marriage; they may, indeed, engage a professional [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] to find a suitable spouse for an unmarried person. The authority figure could be parents, family, a religious official, or a group consensus. In some cases, the authority figure may choose a match for purposes other than marital harmony.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Forced marriage===
{{Main article|Forced marriage}}
[[File:Oskar Shmerling. Free love (Forced marriage). Molla Nasreddin.jpg|thumb|right|Criticism about the [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] society tradition from domestic violence to the social and political participation of women in the community]]
A forced marriage is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages continue to be practiced in parts of the world, especially in [[South Asia]] and [[Africa]]. The line between forced marriage and consensual marriage may become blurred, because the social norms of these cultures dictate that one should never oppose the desire of one's parents/relatives in regard to the choice of a spouse; in such cultures it is not necessary for violence, threats, intimidation etc. to occur, the person simply "consents" to the marriage even if he/she doesn't want it, out of the implied social pressure and duty. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], that exist in parts of the world, can lead to buying and selling people into marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/modern_1.shtml#section_2 Ethics – Slavery: Modern slavery]. BBC. Retrieved on 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session21/A-HRC-21-41_en.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, Gulnara Shahinian]. United Nations. Human Rights Council Twenty-first session. 10 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In some societies, ranging from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Caucasus]] to Africa, the custom of [[bride kidnapping]] still exists, in which a woman is captured by a man and his friends. Sometimes this covers an [[elopement]], but sometimes it depends on [[sexual violence]]. In previous times, ''[[raptio]]'' was a larger-scale version of this, with groups of women captured by groups of men, sometimes in war; the most famous example is [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]], which provided the first citizens of Rome with their wives.

Other marriage partners are more or less imposed on an individual. For example, [[widow inheritance]] provides a widow with another man from her late husband's brothers.

In rural areas of India, [[child marriage]] is practiced, with parents often arranging the wedding, sometimes even before the child is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_child_marriage.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070816221639/http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_child_marriage.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2007 |title=Child Marriage Factsheet: State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was made illegal under the [[Child Marriage Restraint Act]] of 1929.

==Economic considerations==
{{see also|Economics of marriage|Family economics}}
The financial aspects of marriage vary between cultures and have changed over time.

In some cultures, dowries and bridewealth continue to be required today. In both cases, the financial arrangements are usually made between the groom (or his family) and the bride's family; with the bride often not being involved in the negotiations, and often not having a choice in whether to participate in the marriage.

In [[Early modern Britain]], the social status of the couple was supposed to be equal. After the marriage, all the property (called "fortune") and expected inheritances of the wife belonged to the husband.

===Dowry===

A [[dowry]] is "a process whereby parental property is distributed to a daughter at her marriage (i.e. ''inter vivos'') rather than at the holder's death (''mortis causa'')… A dowry establishes some variety of conjugal fund, the nature of which may vary widely. This fund ensures her support (or endowment) in widowhood and eventually goes to provide for her sons and daughters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, especially in countries such as [[Turkey]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Morocco]], [[Nepal]], dowries continue to be expected. In India, thousands of dowry-related deaths have taken place on yearly basis,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm India's dowry deaths]".

TIME Magazine. Volume 146, No. 11&lt;/ref&gt; to counter this problem, several jurisdictions have enacted laws restricting or banning dowry (see [[Dowry system in India#Dowry Prohibition Act.2C 1961|Dowry law in India]]). In Nepal, dowry was made illegal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/nepal-bans-dowry-caste-based-discrimination#.UGH0Nq4Zh0I |title=Nepal bans dowry, caste-based discrimination – OneWorld South Asia |publisher=Southasia.oneworld.net |date=27 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors believe that the giving and receiving of dowry reflects the status and even the effort to climb high in social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Tanwar, Reicha|title=Dowery the North Indian Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NS_TOHRTWpgC&amp;pg=PT36|year= 2007|publisher=Pinnacle Technology|isbn=978-1-61820-208-6|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dower===
{{Main article|Bride price|Dower}}

Direct Dowry contrasts with [[Bride price|bridewealth]], which is paid by the groom or his family to the bride's parents, and with indirect dowry (or [[dower]]), which is property given to the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage and which remains under her ownership and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jewish tradition, the rabbis in ancient times insisted on the marriage couple entering into a [[prenuptial agreement]], called a ''[[ketubah]]''. Besides other things, the ''ketubah'' provided for an amount to be paid by the husband in the event of a [[get (divorce document)|divorce]] or his estate in the event of his death. This amount was a replacement of the biblical [[dower]] or [[bride price]], which was payable at the time of the marriage by the groom to the father of the bride.{{bibleref2c|Exodus|22:15–16}} This innovation was put in place because the biblical bride price created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the bride price at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they would be more likely to have the sum. It may also be noted that both the dower and the ''ketubah'' amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support cease, either by death or divorce. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. It is the predecessor to the wife's present-day entitlement to [[alimony|maintenance]] in the event of the breakup of marriage, and family maintenance in the event of the husband not providing adequately for the wife in his [[Will and testament|will]]. Another function performed by the ''ketubah'' amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.

[[Dower|Morning gifts]], which might also be arranged by the bride's father rather than the bride, are given to the bride herself; the name derives from the Germanic tribal custom of giving them the morning after the wedding night. She might have control of this morning gift during the lifetime of her husband, but is entitled to it when widowed. If the amount of her inheritance is settled by law rather than agreement, it may be called [[dower]]. Depending on legal systems and the exact arrangement, she may not be entitled to dispose of it after her death, and may lose the property if she remarries. Morning gifts were preserved for centuries in [[morganatic marriage]], a union where the wife's inferior social status was held to prohibit her children from inheriting a noble's titles or estates. In this case, the morning gift would support the wife and children. Another legal provision for widowhood was [[jointure]], in which property, often land, would be held in joint tenancy, so that it would automatically go to the widow on her husband's death.

Islamic tradition has similar practices. A '[[mahr]]', either immediate or deferred, is the woman's portion of the groom's wealth (divorce) or estate (death). These amounts are usually set on the basis of the groom's own and family wealth and incomes, but in some parts these are set very high so as to provide a disincentive for the groom exercising the divorce, or the husband's family 'inheriting' a large portion of the estate, especially if there are no male offspring from the marriage. In some countries, including Iran, the [[mahr]] or alimony can amount to more than a man can ever hope to earn, sometimes up to US$1,000,000 (4000 official Iranian gold coins). If the husband cannot pay the [[mahr]], either in case of a divorce or on demand, according to the current laws in Iran, he will have to pay it by installments. Failure to pay the [[mahr]] might even lead to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-divorce.com/iran_divorce.htm |title=A translation of some parts of the Civil Code of Iran |publisher=International-divorce.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridewealth===
{{main article|Bride price}}
[[File:Thai Bride Price 2008.jpg|thumb|Traditional, formal presentation of the bridewealth (also known as "sin sot") at an engagement ceremony in [[Thailand]]]]
Bridewealth is a common practice in parts of [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]]), parts of [[Central Asia]], and in much of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. It is also known as brideprice although this has fallen in disfavor as it implies the purchase of the bride. Bridewealth is the amount of [[money]] or [[property]] or wealth paid by the groom or his family to the parents of a woman upon the marriage of their daughter to the groom. In [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature, bride price has often been explained as payment made to compensate the bride's family for the loss of her labor and fertility. In some cases, bridewealth is a means by which the groom's family's ties to the children of the union are recognized.

===Taxation===
In some countries a married person or couple benefits from various taxation advantages not available to a single person. For example, spouses may be allowed to average their combined [[income tax|incomes]]. This is advantageous to a married couple with disparate incomes. To compensate for this, countries may provide a higher [[tax bracket]] for the averaged income of a married couple. While income averaging might still benefit a married couple with a stay-at-home spouse, such averaging would cause a married couple with roughly equal personal incomes to pay more total tax than they would as two single persons. In the United States, this is called the [[marriage penalty]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

When the rates applied by the tax code are not based income averaging, but rather on the ''sum'' of individuals' incomes, higher rates will usually apply to each individual in a two-earner households in a progressive tax systems. This is most often the case with high-income taxpayers and is another situation called a marriage penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Renacci, James B. "Simplifying America's Tax System." ''Simplifying America's Tax System'' (2016): 1-11. ''Renacci.house.gov''. July 2016. Web. 26 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, when progressive tax is levied on the individual with no consideration for the partnership, dual-income couples fare much better than single-income couples with similar household incomes. The effect can be increased when the welfare system treats the same income as a shared income thereby denying welfare access to the non-earning spouse. Such systems apply in Australia and Canada, for example.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Post-marital residence==
In many Western cultures, marriage usually leads to the formation of a new household comprising the married couple, with the married couple living together in the same home, often sharing the same bed, but in some other cultures this is not the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenblatt|first=Paul C.|title=Two in a Bed: The Social System of Couple Bed Sharing|year = 2006|publisher = State University of New York Press|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/details.asp?id=61306|isbn=978-0-7914-6829-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of [[West Sumatra]], residency after marriage is [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], with the husband moving into the household of his wife's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|title=Women at the center: life in a modern matriarchy|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8014-8906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residency after marriage can also be [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] or [[Avunculate#Avunculocal societies|avunculocal]]. In these cases, married couples may not form an independent household, but remain part of an extended family household.

Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Edward Tylor]], or [[George Peter Murdock]]&lt;/ref&gt; connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, to date, [[cross-cultural]] tests of this [[hypothesis]] using worldwide samples have failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. However, [[Korotayev]]'s tests show that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general. However, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor.

Although, in different-sex marriages, an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal [[polygyny]] which effectively destroys [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocality]]. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple [[Regression analysis|regression]] model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though&lt;ref&gt;as has been shown by [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]]&lt;/ref&gt; the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |title=Form of marriage, sexual division of labor, and postmarital residence in cross-cultural perspective: A reconsideration |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51985620 |year=2003 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=69–89 |jstor=3631445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |title=Division of Labor by Gender and Postmarital Residence in Cross-Cultural Perspective: A Reconsideration |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |year=2003 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=335–72 |doi=10.1177/1069397103253685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage law==
{{Family law}}
{{Main article|Marriage law}}

Marriage laws refer to the legal requirements which determine the validity of a marriage, which vary considerably between countries.

===Rights and obligations===
{{See also|Matrimonial regime|Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States}}

A marriage bestows rights and obligations on the married parties, and sometimes on [[kinship|relatives]] as well, being the sole mechanism for the creation of [[affinity (law)|affinal ties]] (in-laws). These may include, depending on jurisdiction:
* Giving one spouse or his/her family control over the other spouse's sexual services, labor, and property.
* Giving one spouse responsibility for the other's debts.
* Giving one spouse visitation rights when the other is incarcerated or hospitalized.
* Giving one spouse control over the other's affairs when the other is incapacitated.
* Establishing the second [[legal guardian]] of a parent's child.
* Establishing a [[community property|joint fund of property]] for the benefit of children.
* Establishing a relationship between the families of the spouses.

These rights and obligations vary considerably between societies, and between groups within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Leach| first =Edmund|editor=Paul Bonannan and John Middleton|title=Marriage, Family, and Residence|publisher=The Natural History Press| year =1968|isbn=978-1-121-64470-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These might include arranged marriages, family obligations, the legal establishment of a [[nuclear family]] unit, the legal protection of children and public declaration of [[Promise|commitment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James E.|last=Krier|author2=Gregory S.

The Public Purposes of Marriage Law|last=Gallagher|first=Maggie|year=2002|publisher=Louisiana law review|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property regime===
In many countries today, each marriage partner has the choice of keeping his or her property [[community property|separate]] or combining properties. In the latter case, called [[community property]], when the marriage ends by divorce each owns half. In lieu of a [[Will and testament|will]] or [[trust law|trust]], property owned by the deceased generally is inherited by the surviving spouse.

In some legal systems, the partners in a marriage are "jointly liable" for the debts of the marriage. This has a basis in a traditional legal notion called the "Doctrine of Necessities" whereby, in a heterosexual marriage, a husband was responsible to provide necessary things for his wife. Where this is the case, one partner may be sued to collect a debt for which they did not expressly contract. Critics of this practice note that debt collection agencies can abuse this by claiming an unreasonably wide range of debts to be expenses of the marriage. The cost of defense and the burden of proof is then placed on the non-contracting party to prove that the expense is not a debt of the family. The respective maintenance obligations, both during and eventually after a marriage, are regulated in most [[jurisdiction]]s; [[alimony]] is one such method.

===Marriage restrictions===
Marriage is an institution that is historically filled with restrictions. From age, to race, to social status, to [[consanguinity]], to gender, restrictions are placed on marriage by society for reasons of benefiting the children, passing on healthy genes, maintaining cultural values, or because of [[prejudice]] and [[fear]]. Almost all cultures that recognize marriage also recognize [[adultery]] as a violation of the terms of marriage.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica adultery"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery "Adultery"] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age====
Most jurisdictions set a [[marriageable age|minimum age for marriage]], that is, a person must attain a certain age to be legally allowed to marry. This age may depend on circumstances, for instance exceptions from the general rule may be permitted if the parents of a young person express their consent and/or if a court decides that said marriage is in the best interest of the young person (often this applies in cases where a girl is pregnant). Although most age restrictions are in place in order to prevent children from being forced into marriages, especially to much older partners – marriages which can have negative education and health related consequences, and lead to [[child sexual abuse]] and other forms of violence&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/14/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights Q &amp; A: Child Marriage and Violations of Girls' Rights | Human Rights Watch]. Hrw.org (14 June 2013). Retrieved on 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; – such [[child marriage]]s remain common in parts of the world. According to the UN, child marriages are most common in rural [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[South Asia]]. The ten countries with the highest rates of child marriage are: [[Niger]] (75%), Chad, Central African Republic, Bangladesh, Guinea, Mozambique, Mali, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, and Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/ WHO | Child marriages: 39,000 every day].

To prohibit incest and eugenic reasons, marriage laws have set restrictions for relatives to marry. Direct blood relatives are usually prohibited to marry, while for branch line relatives, laws are wary.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1967, in [[Nazi Germany]] (The [[Nuremberg Laws]]) from 1935 until 1945, and in South Africa during most part of the [[Apartheid]] era (1949–1985). All these laws primarily banned marriage between persons of different racially or ethnically defined groups, which was termed "amalgamation" or "miscegenation" in the U.S. The laws in Nazi Germany and many of the U.S. states, as well as South Africa, also banned sexual relations between such individuals.

In the United States, laws in some but not all of the states prohibited the marriage of whites and blacks, and in many states also the intermarriage of whites with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or [[Asian Americans|Asians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karthikeyan|first=Hrishi |author2=Chin, Gabriel|year=2002|title=Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910–1950|journal=Asian Law Journal|volume=9|issue=1|ssrn=283998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., such laws were known as [[anti-miscegenation laws]].

In 1967, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously ruled in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' that anti-miscegenation laws are [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. With this ruling, these laws were no longer in effect in the remaining 16 states that still had them.

The Nazi ban on interracial marriage and interracial sex was enacted in September 1935 as part of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the ''Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre'' (The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour). The Nuremberg Laws classified [[Judaism|Jews]] as a race and forbade marriage and extramarital sexual relations at first with people of Jewish descent, but was later ended to the "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring" and people of "German or related blood".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Burleigh | title = The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 | date = 7 November 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39802-2 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such relations were marked as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (lit. "race-disgrace") and could be punished by imprisonment (usually followed by deportation to a concentration camp) and even by death.

[[Apartheid|South Africa under apartheid]] also banned interracial marriage. The [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949]] prohibited marriage between persons of different races, and the [[Immorality Act]] of 1950 made [[Miscegenation|sexual relations with a person of a different race]] a [[crime]].

The introduction of same-sex marriage has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to [[marriage law]], a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via [[ballot initiative]] or [[referendum]]).

In most other jurisdictions, polygamy is illegal.

Over a century ago, citizens of the self-governing territory of what is present-day [[Utah]] were forced by the United States federal government to abandon the practice of [[polygamy]] through the vigorous enforcement of several [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] [[History of Utah#Utah Territory|and eventually complied]]. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] formally abolished the practice in 1890, in a document labeled '[[1890 Manifesto|The Manifesto]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Edward Leo |last=Lyman |contribution=Statehood for Utah |url=http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/s/STATEHOOD.html |editor-last=Powell |editor-first=Allan Kent |year=1994 |title=Utah History Encyclopedia |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher=[[University of Utah Press]] |isbn=978-0874804256 |oclc=30473917 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101131036/http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/s/STATEHOOD.html |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Islam in the United States|American Muslims]], a small minority of around 50,000 to 100,000 people are estimated to live in families with a husband maintaining an illegal polygamous relationship.&lt;ref name=quietly/&gt;

===State recognition===
In various jurisdictions, a civil marriage may take place as part of the religious marriage ceremony, although they are theoretically distinct. Some jurisdictions allow civil marriages in circumstances which are notably not allowed by particular religions, such as [[same-sex marriage]]s or [[civil union]]s.

The opposite case may happen as well. Partners may not have full juridical acting capacity and churches may have less strict limits than the civil jurisdictions. This particularly applies to minimum age, or physical infirmities.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{clarify|reason=did editor mean "Mentally challenged" instead of "physical infirmities"?|date=August 2013}}

It is possible for two people to be recognised as married by a religious or other institution, but not by the state, and hence without the legal rights and obligations of marriage; or to have a civil marriage deemed invalid and sinful by a religion. Similarly, a couple may remain married in religious eyes after a civil divorce.

====Marriage license, civil ceremony and registration====
{{Main article|Wedding}}
[[File:Shinto married couple.jpg|thumb|upright|Couple married in a [[Shinto]] ceremony in [[Takayama, Gifu]] prefecture.]]
[[File:Assyrian wedding, Mechelen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A newly married [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] couple.]]
A marriage is usually formalized at a wedding or marriage ceremony. The ceremony may be officiated either by a religious official, by a government official or by a state approved celebrant. In various European and some Latin American countries, any religious ceremony must be held separately from the required civil ceremony. Some countries – such as Belgium, [[Bulgaria]], France, the Netherlands, [[Romania]] and [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wwhr.org/images/CivilandPenalCodeReforms.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061231021938/http://www.wwhr.org/images/CivilandPenalCodeReforms.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2006-12-31  |title=Turkish Civil and Penal Code Reforms from a Gender Perspective: The Success of two Nationwide Campaigns }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(6.21 MB)}} (p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt; – require that a civil ceremony take place before any religious one. In some countries – notably the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the [[Republic of Ireland]], Norway and Spain – both ceremonies can be held together; the officiant at the religious and civil ceremony also serving as agent of the state to perform the civil ceremony. To avoid any implication that the state is "recognizing" a religious marriage (which is prohibited in some countries) – the "civil" ceremony is said to be taking place at the same time as the religious ceremony. Often this involves simply signing a register during the religious ceremony. If the civil element of the religious ceremony is omitted, the marriage ceremony is not recognized as a marriage by government under the law.

Some countries, such as Australia, permit marriages to be held in private and at any location; others, including [[England and Wales]], require that the civil ceremony be conducted in a place open to the public and specially sanctioned by law for the purpose. In England, the place of marriage formerly had to be a church or [[Register office (United Kingdom)|register office]], but this was extended to any public venue with the necessary licence. An exception can be made in the case of marriage by special emergency license (UK: licence), which is normally granted only when one of the parties is terminally ill. Rules about where and when persons can marry vary from place to place. Some regulations require one of the parties to reside within the jurisdiction of the register office (formerly parish).

Each religious authority has rules for the manner in which marriages are to be conducted by their officials and members. Where religious marriages are recognised by the state, the officiator must also conform with the law of the jurisdiction.

====Common-law marriage====
{{See also|Common-law marriage}}

In a small number of jurisdictions marriage relationships may be created by the operation of the law alone.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Unlike the typical [[ceremonial marriage]] with legal contract, wedding ceremony, and other details, a [[common-law marriage]] may be called "marriage by habit and repute (cohabitation)." A de facto common-law marriage without a license or ceremony is legally binding in some jurisdictions but has no legal consequence in others.&lt;ref name=Nolo&gt;"Common Law Marriage FAQ." ''Nolo.'' 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil unions====
{{Main article|Civil union}}
[[File:New York City Proposition 8 Protest outside LDS temple 20.jpg|thumb|left|size=40px|Various advocates of same-sex marriage, such as this protester at a demonstration in New York City against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]], consider [[civil unions]] an inferior alternative to legal recognition of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Towleroad&gt;[http://www.towleroad.com/2008/11/we-did-it.html NYC Protest and Civil Rights March Opposing Proposition 8], [[Andy Towle]], Towleroad.com, 13 November 2008. Retrieved 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A ''civil union'', also referred to as a ''civil partnership'', is a legally recognized form of partnership similar to marriage. Beginning with [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] in 1989, civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in several countries in order to provide [[homosexuality|same-sex couples]] [[rights]], benefits, and [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]] similar (in some countries, identical) to opposite-sex civil marriage. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, such as [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Civil union in New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Civil solidarity pact|France]] and the U.S. states of [[Same-sex marriage in Hawaii|Hawaii]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Illinois|Illinois]], civil unions are also open to opposite-sex couples.

===="Marriage of convenience"====
Sometimes people marry to take advantage of a certain situation, sometimes called a [[marriage of convenience]] or a sham marriage. For example, according to one publisher of information about [[green card marriage]]s, "Every year over 450,000 United States citizens marry foreign-born individuals and petition for them to obtain a permanent residency (Green Card) in the United States." While this is likely an overestimate, in 2003 alone 184,741 immigrants were admitted to the U.S. as spouses of [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/yearbook/2003/2003IMMtables.pdf |title=Immigration to the United States: Fiscal years 1820–2003 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.03&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; More were admitted as fiancés of US citizens for the purpose of being married within 90 days. Regardless of the number of people entering the US to marry a US citizen, it does not indicate the number of these marriages that are convenience marriages, which number could include some of those with the motive of obtaining permanent residency, but also include people who are US citizens. One example would be to obtain an inheritance that has a marriage clause. Another example would be to save money on health insurance or to enter a health plan with preexisting conditions offered by the new spouse's employer. Other situations exist, and, in fact, all marriages have a complex combination of conveniences motivating the parties to marry. A marriage of convenience is one that is devoid of normal reasons to marry.

[[File:Esposas de Matrimonio 1.jpg|thumb|"''Esposas de Matrimonio''" ("Wedding Cuffs"), a [[wedding ring]] sculpture expressing the criticism of marriages' effects on individual liberty.

{{Main article|Criticism of marriage}}
People have proposed arguments against marriage for reasons that include political, philosophical and religious criticisms; concerns about the [[Divorce demography|divorce rate]]; individual liberty and gender equality; questioning the necessity of having a personal relationship sanctioned by government or religious authorities; or the promotion of [[celibacy]] for religious or philosophical reasons.

====Power and gender roles in opposite-sex marriages====
[[Feminist theory]] approaches opposite-sex marriage as an institution traditionally rooted in [[patriarchy]] that promotes male superiority and power over women. This [[power (social and political)|power dynamic]] conceptualizes men as "the provider operating in the public sphere" and women as "the caregivers operating within the private sphere".&lt;ref name="Weadock"&gt;Weadock, Briana. [http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/0/3/0/p110303_index.html "Disciplining Marriage: Gender, Power and Resistance"]. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Hilton San Francisco &amp; Renaissance Parc 55 Hotel, San Francisco, CA,, 14 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; "Theoretically, women ... [were] defined as the property of their husbands .... The adultery of a woman was always treated with more severity than that of a man."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Tanya (2005) ''Women, Marriage and the Family'', p. 64 in Barker, Hannah, &amp; Elaine Chalus, eds., ''Women's History: Britain, 1700–1850: An Introduction'', Oxon/London: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-29177-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]eminist demands for a wife's control over her own property were not met [in parts of Britain] until ...

Traditional heterosexual marriage imposed an obligation of the wife to be sexually available for her husband and an obligation of the husband to provide material/financial support for the wife. Numerous philosophers, feminists and other academic figures have commented on this throughout history, condemning the hypocrisy of legal and religious authorities in regard to sexual issues; pointing to the lack of choice of a woman in regard to controlling her own sexuality; and drawing parallels between marriage, an institution promoted as sacred, and [[prostitution]], widely condemned and vilified (though often tolerated as a "[[lesser of two evils principle|necessary evil]]"). [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], in the 18th century, described marriage as "legal prostitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wollstonecraft, Mary |title=Wollstonecraft: A Vindication of the Rights of Man and a Vindication of the Rights of Woman and Hints |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UOzywCVo3swC |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Goldman]] wrote in 1910: "To the moralist prostitution does not consist so much in the fact that the woman sells her body, but rather that she sells it out of wedlock".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/goldman/works/1910/traffic-women.htm The Traffic in Women by Emma Goldman 1910].

Some critics object to what they see as [[propaganda]] in relation to marriage – from the government, religious organizations, the media – which aggressively promote marriage as a solution for all social problems; such propaganda includes, for instance, [[marriage promotion]] in schools, where children, especially [[girl]]s, are bombarded with positive information about marriage, being presented only with the information prepared by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hardisty, Jean (2008) [http://www.publiceye.org/jeans_report/marriage-promotion-part-2.pdf Marriage as a cure for poverty?].

The performance of dominant gender roles by men and submissive gender roles by women influence the power dynamic of a heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Jaris Tichenor, "Thinking About Gender and Power in Marriage", The Kaleidoscope of Gender, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In some American households, women internalize gender role stereotypes and often assimilate into the role of "wife", "mother", and "caretaker" in conformity to societal norms and their male partner. Author [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- bell hooks, the writer, spells her name in all lower-case, and that applies even at the beginning of a sentence. --&gt; states "within the family structure, individuals learn to accept sexist oppression as 'natural' and are primed to support other forms of oppression, including heterosexist domination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=bell hooks|title=Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvIQbop4cdsC|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1663-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he cultural, economic, political and legal supremacy of the husband" was "[t]raditional ... under English law".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Hilaire A, ''Introduction to Feminist Jurisprudence'' (London, G.B., U.K.: Cavendish Publishing, 1998 ({{ISBN|1859412378}})), p. 35 and, per p. 35 n. 35, see chap. 3 (author then of Queen Mary &amp; Westfield Coll., Univ. of London).&lt;/ref&gt; This patriarchal dynamic is contrasted with a conception of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] or [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage|Peer Marriage]] in which power and labour are divided equally, and not according to [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name="Weadock" /&gt;

In the US, studies have shown that, despite egalitarian ideals being common, less than half of respondents viewed their opposite-sex relationships as equal in power, with unequal relationships being more commonly dominated by the male partner.&lt;ref name="Sprecher"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1025601423031|year=1997|last1=Sprecher|first1=Susan|last2=Felmlee|first2=Diane|journal=Sex Roles|volume=37|issue=5/6|pages=361–379|url=http://business.highbeam.com/435388/article-1G1-20247079/balance-power-romantic-heterosexual-couples-over-time|title=The Balance of Power in Romantic Heterosexual Couples Over Time from "His" and "Her" Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies also show that married couples find the highest level of satisfaction in egalitarian relationships and lowest levels of satisfaction in wife dominate relationships.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt; In recent years, egalitarian or [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage|Peer Marriages]] have been receiving increasing focus and attention politically, economically and culturally in a number of countries, including the United States.

====Marriage and sexual violence====
{{Main article|Marital rape}}
An issue that is a serious concern regarding marriage and which has been the object of international scrutiny is that of [[marital rape|sexual violence within marriage]]. Throughout much of the history, in most cultures, sex in marriage was considered a 'right', that could be taken by force (often by a man from a woman), if 'denied'. As the concept of [[human rights]] started to develop in the 20th century, and with the arrival of [[second-wave feminism]], such views have become less widely held.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The legal and social concept of marital rape has developed in most industrialized countries in the mid- to late 20th century; in many other parts of the world it is not recognized as a form of abuse, socially or legally. Several countries in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] made marital rape illegal before 1970, and other countries in [[Western Europe]] and the English-speaking [[Western world]] outlawed it in the 1980s and 1990s. In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. Although marital rape is being increasingly criminalized in [[Developing country|developing countries]] too, cultural, religious, and traditional ideologies about "conjugal rights" remain very strong in many parts of the world; and even in many countries that have adequate laws against rape in marriage these laws are rarely enforced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Apart from the issue of rape committed against one's spouse, marriage is, in many parts of the world, closely connected with other forms of sexual violence: in some places, like [[Morocco]]&lt;!---see specific example below---&gt;, unmarried girls and women who are raped are often forced by their families to marry their rapist. Because being the victim of rape and losing [[virginity]] carry extreme social stigma, and the victims are deemed to have their "reputation" tarnished, a marriage with the rapist is arranged. This is claimed to be in the advantage of both the victim – who does not remain unmarried and doesn't lose social status – and of the rapist, who avoids punishment. In 2012, after a Moroccan 16-year-old girl committed [[suicide]] after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist and enduring further abuse by the rapist after they married, there have been protests from activists against this practice which is common in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News – Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |publisher=BBC News |date=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some societies, the very high social and religious importance of marital fidelity, especially female fidelity, has as result the criminalization of adultery, often with harsh penalties such as [[stoning]] or [[Flagellation|flogging]]; as well as leniency towards punishment of violence related to infidelity (such as [[honor killing]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Domestic violence]] is today illegal in the [[Western World]], but this is not the case in many [[developing countries]]. In [[Jordan]], for instance, part of article 340 of the Penal Code states that "''he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty''. {{cite book|author1=Altstein, Howard  |author2=Simon, Rita James |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Global perspectives on social issues: marriage and divorce|publisher=''[[Lexington Books]]''|location=Lexington, Mass|year=2003|page=11|isbn=978-0-7391-0588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial with international organizations calling for their abolition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/adultery-laws-unfairly-target-women-u-n-says/ IPS – Adultery Laws Unfairly Target Women, U.N.

====Marriage laws, human rights and the global status of women====

Throughout history, and still today in many countries, laws have provided for [[extenuating circumstances]], partial or complete defenses, for men who killed their wives due to adultery, with such acts often being seen as [[Crime of passion|crimes of passion]] and being covered by legal defenses such as [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] or defense of [[honor killing|family honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html|title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses|website=www.endvawnow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right and ability to divorce====
While international law and conventions recognize the need for consent for entering a marriage - namely that people cannot be forced to get married against their will - the right to obtain a divorce is not recognized; therefore holding a person in a marriage against their will (if such person has consented to entering in it) is not considered a violation of human rights, with the issue of divorce being left at the appreciation of individual states. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has repeatedly ruled that under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] there is neither a right to apply to divorce, nor a right to obtain the divorce if applied for it; in 2017, in ''Babiarz v. Poland'', the Court ruled that Poland was entitled to deny a divorce because the [[grounds for divorce]] were not met, even if the marriage in question was acknowledged both by Polish courts and by the ECHR as being a [[legal fiction]] involving a long-term separation where the husband lived with another woman with whom he had an 11-year-old child.&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-170344%22]}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, the last country to allow divorce was [[Malta]], [[Maltese divorce referendum, 2011|in 2011]].

[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore|Bangalore, India]].]]

In recent years, the customs of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] have received international criticism for inciting conflicts between families and clans; contributing to [[violence against women]]; promoting materialism; increasing property crimes (where men steal goods such as cattle in order to be able to pay the bride price); and making it difficult for poor people to marry. African women's rights campaigners advocate the abolishing of bride price, which they argue is based on the idea that women are a form of property which can be bought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.arts.ubc.ca/asiwan/siwan-jep2.pdf |title=The Economics of Dowry and Brideprice |format=PDF |website=econ.arts.ubc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bride price has also been criticized for contributing to [[child trafficking]] as impoverished parents sell their young daughters to rich older men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Human+rights+groups+ask+NWFP+Govt.+to+ban+%27bride+price%27+to+curb+women...-a0216984357 |title=Human rights groups ask NWFP Govt. to ban 'bride price' to curb women Trafficking. – Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Papua New Guinea police officer has called for the abolishing of bride price arguing that it is one of the main reasons for the mistreatment of women in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=iSite Interactive Limited |url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=26256/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126135528/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=26256/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 January 2013 |title=PNG Police blame bride price for violence in marriage |publisher=Islands Business |date=21 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite practice of dowry has been linked to a high level of violence (see [[Dowry death]]) and to crimes such as [[extortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/830-addressing-dowry-related-violence-through-criminalization-of-dowry-demands.html |title=Addressing dowry-related violence through criminalization of dowry demands |publisher=Endvawnow.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, and still in many countries, children born outside marriage suffered severe social stigma and discrimination. In England and Wales, such children were known as [[Bastard (law of England and Wales)|bastards and whoresons]].

There are significant differences between world regions in regard to the social and legal position of non-marital births, ranging from being fully accepted and uncontroversial to being severely stigmatized and discriminated.&lt;ref&gt;The 1997 Global Study on Family Values found that only 3% of respondents in Iceland, 8% in France, and 9% in Germany, thought that it was "wrong" to have a child outside marriage.

The 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock protects the rights of children born to unmarried parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/085.htm European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock].

Retrieved on 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention states, among others, that: "The father and mother of a child born out of wedlock shall have the same obligation to maintain the child as if it were born in wedlock" and that "A child born out of wedlock shall have the same right of succession in the estate of its father and its mother and of a member of its father's or mother's family, as if it had been born in wedlock."&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/085.htm Council of Europe – ETS no. 085 – European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock].

While in most Western countries legal inequalities between children born inside and outside marriage have largely been abolished, this is not the case in some parts of the world.

The legal status of an unmarried father differs greatly from country to country. Without voluntary formal recognition of the child by the father, in most cases there is a need of due process of law in order to establish [[Paternity law|paternity]]. In some countries however, unmarried cohabitation of a couple for a specific period of time does create a presumption of paternity similar to that of formal marriage. This is the case in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s69q.html FAMILY LAW ACT 1975 – SECT 69Q Presumption of paternity arising from cohabitation].

A special situation arises when a married woman has a child by a man other than her husband. Some countries, such as [[Israel]], refuse to accept a legal challenge of paternity in such a circumstance, in order to avoid the stigmatization of the child (see [[Mamzer]], a concept under [[Halakha|Jewish law]]). In 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him to see the children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/d0cd2c2c444d8d94c12567c2002de990/db5e85a236de283dc1257803004974b7?OpenDocument ECHR : Anayo v.

The steps that an unmarried father must take in order to obtain rights to his child vary by country. In some countries (such as the UK – since 2003 in England and Wales, 2006 in Scotland, and 2002 in Northern Ireland) it is sufficient for the father to be listed on the birth certificate for him to have parental rights;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility Parental rights and responsibilities]. GOV.UK (1 July 2013). Retrieved on 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in other countries, such as Ireland, simply being listed on the birth certificate does not offer any rights, additional legal steps must be taken (if the mother agrees, the parents can both sign a "statutory declaration", but if the mother does not agree, the father has to apply to court).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/cohabiting_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html Legal guardianship and cohabiting couples].

Children born outside marriage have become more common, and in some countries, the majority. Recent data from [[Latin America]] showed figures for non-marital childbearing to be 74% for [[Colombia]], 69% for [[Peru]], 68% for [[Chile]], 66% for [[Brazil]], 58% for [[Argentina]], 55% for [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustaindemographicdividend.org/articles/international-family-indicators/global-childrens-trends |title=Global Children's Trends &amp;#124; The Sustainable Demographic Dividend |publisher=Sustaindemographicdividend.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joice Melo Vieira.

During the first half of the 20th century, unmarried women in some Western countries were coerced by authorities to give their children up for [[adoption]]. This was especially the case in Australia, through the [[forced adoption in Australia|forced adoptions in Australia]], with most of these adoptions taking place between the 1950s and the 1970s. In 2013, [[Julia Gillard]], then Prime Minister of Australia, offered a national apology to those affected by the forced adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ag.gov.au/About/ForcedAdoptionsApology/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-21872954/julia-gillard-sorry-for-shameful-forced-adoptions|title=Gillard sorry for forced adoptions|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some married couples [[Voluntary childlessness|choose not to have children]]. Others are unable to have children because of [[infertility]] or other factors preventing [[Fertilisation|conception]] or the bearing of children. In some cultures, marriage imposes an ''obligation'' on women to bear children.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217152549/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm|archivedate=17 February 2007|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, Article Seven, Paragraph 1601 |publisher=Vatican.va }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Catholic and Methodist Christians, the mutual love between man and wife becomes an image of the eternal love with which God loves humankind.&lt;ref name="Church2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church 2016|date=16 December 2016|publisher=United Methodist Publishing House|language=English|isbn=9781501833250|page=623|quote=For the church, the marriage covenant is gounded in the covenant between God and God's people into which Christians enter in their baptism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Methodist Church]], the celebration of Holy Matrimony ideally occurs in the context of a Service of Worship, which includes the celebration of the Eucharist.&lt;ref name="Jr.Warrick2013"/&gt; Likewise, the celebration of marriage between two Catholics normally takes place during the public liturgical celebration of the Holy Mass, because of its sacramental connection with the unity of the Paschal mystery of Christ (Communion). Sacramental marriage confers a perpetual and exclusive bond between the spouses. By its nature, the institution of marriage and conjugal love is ordered to the procreation and upbringing of offspring. Marriage creates rights and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children: "[e]ntering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an annulment".&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, P. [http://www.catholic-pages.com/marriage/sacrament.asp Sacrament of Holy Matrimony]. Catholic-pages.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to current [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] legislation, progeny of annulled relationships are considered legitimate. Civilly remarried persons who civilly divorced a living and lawful spouse are not separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic Communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217152549/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, Article Seven, Paragraph 1665 |publisher=Vatican.va }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Divorce]] and [[remarriage]], while generally not encouraged, are regarded differently by each Christian denomination. Most Protestant Churches allow persons to marry again after a divorce, while other require an [[annulment]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] allows divorce for a limited number of reasons, and in theory, but usually not in practice, requires that a marriage after divorce be celebrated with a penitential overtone. With respect to marriage between a Christian and a pagan, the early Church "sometimes took a more lenient view, invoking the so-called Pauline privilege of permissible separation (1 Cor. 7) as legitimate grounds for allowing a convert to divorce a pagan spouse and then marry a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/augustweb-only/46.0c.html?start=2 Divorce and Remarriage from Augustine to Zwingli]. Christianity Today. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] adheres to the proscription of [[Jesus]] in ''Matthew'', 19: 6 that married spouses who have consummated their marriage "are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.”&lt;ref&gt;''Matthew'', 19: 6, ''New American Bible Revised Edition'', [http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/19].&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the [[Catholic Church]] understands that it is wholly without authority to terminate a sacramentally valid and consummated marriage, and its ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' ([[1983 Code of Canon Law]]) confirms this in Canons 1055-7. Specifically, Canon 1056 declares that "the essential properties of marriage are unity and ''indissolubility''; in [C]hristian marriage they acquire a distinctive ''firmness'' by reason of the sacrament."&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Canon Law Annotated'', edited by Ernest Caparros et alia, Canon 1056, pages 806-7 (Woodridge, Illinois: Midwest Theological Forum, 2004); see the printed work to correctly cite the translator(s) et alia; emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 1057, §2 declares that marriage is  "an ''irrevocable'' covenant".&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Canon Law Annotated'', edited by Ernest Caparros et alia, Canon 1057, §2, page 807 (Woodridge, Illinois: Midwest Theological Forum, 2004); see the printed work to correctly cite the translator(s) et alia; emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, divorce of such a marriage is a metaphysical, moral, and legal impossibility. However, the Church has the authority to annul a presumed "marriage" by declaring it to have been invalid from the beginning, i. e., declaring it not to be and never to have been a marriage, in an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] procedure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/chmarriageanddivorcerev1.shtml |title= GCSE Bitesize: Marriage |publisher= BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is basically a fact-finding and fact-declaring effort.

For [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, the purposes of marriage include intimate companionship, rearing children, and mutual support for both spouses to fulfill their life callings. Most [[Calvinism|Reformed Christians]] did not regard marriage to the status of a [[sacrament]] "because they did not regard matrimony as a necessary means of grace for salvation"; nevertheless it is considered a covenant between spouses before God.&lt;sup&gt;cf.&lt;/sup&gt;{{bibleref2c|Ephesians|5:31–33}} In addition, some Protestant denominations (such as the Methodist Churches) affirmed that Holy Matrimony is a "[[means of grace]], thus, sacramental in character".&lt;ref name="Mulhall2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulhall|first=Daniel S.|title=The Ecumenical Christian Dialogues and The Catechism of the Catholic Church|date=18 September 2013|publisher=Paulist Press|language=English |isbn=9781616438098|page=155|quote=The Protestant reformers of the sixteenth century were unwilling to call marriage a sacrament because they did not regard matrimony as a necessary means of grace for salvation.

Since the 16th century, five competing models of marriage have shaped Protestant marriage and legal tradition:
* The Protestant [[Reformation]]ists denied the [[Roman Catholic]] sacramental model.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Martin Luther]] saw marriage as a social "estate of the earthly kingdom ... subject to the prince, not the Pope."{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[John Calvin]] taught that marriage was a ''covenant of grace'' that required the coercive power of the state to preserve its integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ssrn=1014729|title=Marriage and Family Life|last=Witte|first=John|work=The Calvin Handbook|publisher=Wm.

* Anglicans regarded marriage as a ''domestic [[commonwealth]]'' within [[England]] and the Church. By the 17th century, Anglican theologians had begun to develop a theology of marriage as opposed to the Roman Catholic model of marriage. These "regarded the interlocking commonwealths of state, church, and family as something of an earthly form of heavenly government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witte|first1=John|title=From sacrament to contract : marriage, religion, and law in the Western tradition|date=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=978-0664255435|page=257|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pIL7Gihul0oC&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=%22regarded%20the%20interlocking%20commonwealths%20of%20state%2C%20church%2C%20and%20family%20as%20something%20of%20an%20earthly%20form%20of%20heavenly%20government%22&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q=%22regarded%20the%20interlocking%20commonwealths%20of%20state,%20church,%20and%20family%20as%20something%20of%20an%20earthly%20form%20of%20heavenly%20government%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) believe that "[[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|marriage]] between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Creator's plan]] for the eternal destiny of His children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng|title=The Family: A Proclamation to the World|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Their view of marriage is that family relationships can endure beyond the grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-5-laws-and-ordinances?lang=eng|title=Lesson 5: Laws and Ordinances|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as 'eternal marriage' which can be eternal only when authorized priesthood holders perform the sealing ordinance in sacred [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/the-eternal-family-teacher-manual/lesson-15-eternal-marriage?lang=eng|title=Lesson 15: Eternal Marriage|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many Christian denominations do not currently perform [[same-sex marriage]]s, many do, such as the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church (U.S.A)]], some dioceses of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], [[Quakers]], [[United Church of Canada]], and [[United Church of Christ]] congregations, and some [[Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion#Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] dioceses, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070703002853/http://marriagelaw.cua.edu/publications/wrr.pdf "World Religions and Same-Sex Marriage"], Marriage Law Project, [[Columbus School of Law]] at The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., July 2002 revision&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="united"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/exploring/marriage/affirmingcongregations |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531085742/http://www.united-church.ca/exploring/marriage/affirmingcongregations |archivedate=31 May 2010 |title=Affirming Congregations, The Episcopal Church and Ministries of the United Church of Canada |publisher=United-church.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage is recognized by various [[religious denomination]]s.&lt;ref name="pewforum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109194247/http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 |archivedate=9 November 2008 |publisher=pewforums.org|date=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT UCC SSM"&gt;{{cite news|title=United Church of Christ Backs Same-Sex Marriage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/national/05church.html |author=Shaila Dewan|date=5 July 2005|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
{{Main article|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
[[File:Jeunes Mariés dans le parc dAk Saray (Shahrisabz) (6018352949).jpg|thumb|[[Newlywed]] couples visit [[Timur]]'s statues to receive wedding blessings in [[Uzbekistan]].]]
[[File:Signing the Nikah.jpg|thumb|A Muslim bride of [[Pakistan]] origin signing the ''nikkah nama'' or [[marriage certificate]].]]
[[File:Muslim wedding in India.jpg|thumb|A Muslim couple being wed alongside the [[Tungabhadra River]] at [[Hampi]], India.]]

[[Islam]] also commends marriage, with the age of marriage being whenever the individuals feel ready, financially and emotionally.

In Islam, [[polygyny]] is allowed while [[polyandry]] is not, with the specific [[Polygamy in Islam|limitation]] that a man can have no more than four legal wives at any one time and an unlimited number of [[Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage|female slaves]] as [[Concubinage|concubines]], with the requirement that the man is able and willing to partition his time and wealth equally among the respective wives.

For a Muslim wedding to take place, the bridegroom and the guardian of the bride (''[[wali]]'') must both agree on the marriage. Should the guardian disagree on the marriage, it may not legally take place. If the ''wali'' of the girl her father or paternal grandfather, he has the right to force her into marriage even against her proclaimed will, if it is her first marriage. A guardian who is allowed to force the bride into marriage is called ''[[Marriage in Islam#Conditions|wali mujbir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, Vol. VIII, p. 27, Leiden 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an Islamic ([[Sharia]]) law perspective, the minimum requirements and responsibilities in a Muslim marriage are that the groom provide living expenses (housing, clothing, food, maintenance) to the bride, and in return, the bride's main responsibility is raising children to be proper Muslims. All other rights and responsibilities are to be decided between the husband and wife, and may even be included as stipulations in the marriage contract before the marriage actually takes place, so long as they do not go against the minimum requirements of the marriage.

In [[Sunni Islam]], [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|marriage]] must take place in the presence of at least two reliable witnesses, with the consent of the guardian of the bride and the consent of the groom. Following the marriage, the couple may consummate the marriage. To create an '[[urf]] marriage, it is sufficient that a man and a woman indicate an intention to marry each other and recite the requisite words in front of a suitable Muslim. The wedding party usually follows but can be held days, or months later, whenever the couple and their families want to; however, there can be no concealment of the marriage as it is regarded as public notification due to the requirement of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3079 The method of pronouncing the marriage formula]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218220414/http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3078 Marriage formula]. sistani.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218001957/http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3080 Conditions of pronouncing Nikah]. sistani.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3083 Women with whom matrimony is Haraam]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], marriage may take place without the presence of witnesses as is often the case in temporary [[Nikah mut‘ah]] (prohibited in Sunni Islam), but with the consent of both the bride and the groom. Following the marriage they may consummate their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/muta-temporary-marriage-in-islamic-law-sachiko-murata/four-pillars-muta|title=The Four Pillars Of Mut&amp;amp;#039;a|website=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Jewish views on marriage}}
In [[Judaism]], marriage is based on the laws of the [[Torah]] and is a contractual bond between spouses in which the spouses dedicate to be exclusive to one another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah]] Kidushin 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; This contract is called [[Erusin|Kiddushin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juchre.org/talmud/kiddushin/kiddushin1.htm#2a|title=JCR - The Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin|website=juchre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is also expected to fulfill the commandment to have children.{{bibleref2c|Gen.|1:28}} The main focus centers around the relationship between the spouses. [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistically]], marriage is understood to mean that the spouses are merging into a single soul. This is why a man is considered "incomplete" if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |title=Why Marry? |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224153323/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |archivedate=24 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] (Christian [[Old Testament]]) describes a number of marriages, including those of [[Isaac]] ({{Bibleverse||Gen|24:49–67|NIV}}), [[Jacob]] ({{Bibleverse||Gen|29:27|NIV}}) and [[Samson]] ({{Bibleverse||Judges|14:7–12|NIV}}). [[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Marriage|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are prohibited to take more than one wife because of a ban instituted on this by [[Rabbi|Gershom ben Judah]] (Died 1040).

Among ancient Hebrews, marriage was a domestic affair and not a religious ceremony; the participation of a priest or rabbi was not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sumner|first1=William Graham|year=2007|origyear=1906|chapter=X. The Marriage Institution|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoY-tEMgJ8UC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;lpg=PA395&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=marriage+ceremony+%22early+christianity%22&amp;hl=nl|title=Folkways: A Study of Mores, Manners, Customs and Morals|location=New York|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|page=398|isbn=9781602067585|oclc=254079323|quote=The whole proceeding was a domestic and family affair, in which no priest or other outsider had any part, except as witness, and there was no religious element in it.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Bergel, ''Eheverhält. der Juden'', 19.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betrothal (''[[erusin]]''), which refers to the time that this binding contract is made, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[Jewish wedding|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=MARRIAGE|section=Manius-Mash|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In biblical times, a wife was regarded as [[Personal property|chattel]], belonging to her husband;&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; the descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wives were usually looked after with care, and men with more than one wife were expected to ensure that they continue to give the first wife food, clothing, and marital rights.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; Divorcing a woman against her will was also banned by [[Gershom ben Judah]]. A divorced couple were permitted to get back together, unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

===Hinduism===
{{Main article|Marriage in Hinduism}}
[[File:Hindu marriage ceremony offering.jpg|thumb|Hindu marriage ceremony from a [[Rajput]] wedding.]]
[[File:Bride Groom NP.JPG|thumb|A Nepali Hindu couple in marriage ceremony.]]

[[Hinduism]] sees marriage as a sacred duty that entails both religious and social obligations. Old Hindu literature in [[Sanskrit]] gives many different types of marriages and their categorization ranging from "Gandharva Vivaha" (instant marriage by mutual consent of participants only, without any need for even a single third person as witness) to normal (present day) marriages, to "Rakshasa Vivaha" ("demoniac" marriage, performed by abduction of one participant by the other participant, usually, but not always, with the help of other persons). In India and generally in South Asia, [[arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged marriages]], the spouse's parents or an older family member choose the partner, are still predominant in comparison with so called [[love marriage]]s until nowadays. The Hindu Widow's Remarriage Act 1856 empowers a Hindu widow to remarry.

According to some estimates, there wasn't even 1% of divorce among Hindu arranged marriages.&lt;ref&gt;"Am I a Hindu?", by "Edakkandiyil Viswanathan", p. 71, published by [[Rupa &amp; Co.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|Buddhist view of marriage}}
The Buddhist view of marriage considers marriage a secular affair and thus not a [[sacrament]]. Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments. Gautama Buddha, being a [[kshatriya]] was required by Shakyan tradition to pass a series of tests to prove himself as a warrior, before he was allowed to marry.

===Sikhism===
In a Sikh marriage, the couple walks around the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'' holy book four times, and a holy man recites from it in the [[kirtan]] style. The ceremony is known as '[[Anand Karaj]]' and represents the holy union of two souls united as one.

===Wicca===
Wiccan marriages are commonly known as handfastings. Although handfastings vary for each Wiccan they often involve honoring Wiccan gods. Sex is considered a pious and sacred activity.&lt;ref&gt;A Wiccan Bible: Exploring the Mysteries of the Craft from Birth to Summerland – p. 124, A. J. Drew – 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce and annulment==
{{main article|Divorce|Divorce law by country}}

In most societies, the death of one of the partners terminates the marriage, and in monogamous societies this allows the other partner to remarry, though sometimes after a waiting or mourning period.

In some societies, a marriage can be [[annulment|annulled]], when an authority declares that a marriage never happened. Jurisdictions often have provisions for [[void marriage]]s or  [[voidable marriage]]s.

A marriage may also be terminated through [[divorce]]. Countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987), Paraguay (1991), Colombia (1991), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011). As of 2012, the [[Philippines]] and the [[Vatican City]] are the only jurisdictions which do not allow divorce (this is currently under discussion in Philippines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/07/12/philippines-ready-divorce-law |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607204409/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/07/12/philippines-ready-divorce-law |archivedate=7 June 2012 |title=Is Philippines ready for a divorce law? |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=6 July 2012|author=Malig, Jojo }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
After divorce, one spouse may have to pay [[alimony]]. [[Divorce law by country|Laws concerning divorce]] and the ease with which a divorce can be obtained vary widely around the world. After a divorce or an annulment, the people concerned are free to remarry (or marry).

A statutory right of two married partners to mutually consent to divorce was enacted in western nations in the mid-20th century. In the United States [[no-fault divorce]] was first enacted in California in 1969 and the final state to legalize it was New York in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divorcesupport.about.com/od/maritalproblems/i/nofault_fault_2.htm |title=No-Fault Divorce – The Pros and Cons Of No-Fault Divorce |publisher=Divorcesupport.about.com |date=30 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of marriage==
The history of marriage is often considered under [[History of the family]] or legal history.&lt;ref&gt;for the historiography see Frederik J.G. Pedersen, "Marriage" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA766|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=766–68|isbn=9781884964336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===
====Ancient Near East====
Many cultures have legends concerning the origins of marriage. The way in which a marriage is conducted and its rules and ramifications has changed over time, as has the institution itself, depending on the culture or demographic of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hobhouse, Leonard Trelawny]] (1906) [https://archive.org/details/moralsinevolutio00hobh ''Morals in evolution: a study in comparative ethics''], New York, H. Holt and Co, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---taken from article, "Jewish views on marriage"---&gt;
According to ancient Hebrew tradition, a wife was seen as being property of high value and was, therefore, usually, carefully looked after.&lt;ref name="JewEncMar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /&gt; Early nomadic communities in the middle east practised a form of marriage known as ''[[Beena marriage|beena]]'', in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband;&lt;ref name="WRSKinship167"&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 167&lt;/ref&gt; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession&lt;ref name="WRSKinship167" /&gt; (specifically, [[Jael]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:26|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacob's wives&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|31:33–34|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The husband, too, is indirectly implied to have some responsibilities to his wife. The [[Covenant Code]] orders "If he take him another; her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish(or lessen)".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:11|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Husband and Wife|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&amp;artid=986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2013}} However, "duty of marriage" is also interpreted as whatever one does as a married couple, which is more than just sexual activity. And the term diminish, which means to lessen, shows the man must treat her as if he was not married to another.

As a [[polygyny|polygynous]]&lt;!--this is NOT a spelling mistake for 'polygamous'--&gt; society, the Israelites did not have any laws that imposed marital fidelity on men.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal"&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Jealousy, Ordeal of|section=Jannaeus-Jerah|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JewEncAdu"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Adultery|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&amp;letter=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prophet Malachi states that none should be faithless to the wife of his youth and that God hates divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Malachi|2:15–16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery|Adulterous]] married women, adulterous betrothed women, and the men who slept with them however, were subject to the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] by [[Adultery#In the Hebrew Bible|the biblical laws against adultery]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:40|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22–25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Priestly Code]] of the [[Book of Numbers]], if a pregnant&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]'' (1962 edition), ad loc&lt;/ref&gt; woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the [[Ordeal of the bitter water|Ordeal of Bitter Water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:11–31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[trial by ordeal]], but one that took a miracle to convict. The [[literary prophets]] indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|7:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hosea|4:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:5|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these legal strictnesses.&lt;ref name="CheyneAndBlackJeal" /&gt;

====Classical Greece and Rome====
{{see also|Marriage in ancient Rome|Ancient Greek wedding customs}}
In [[ancient Greece]], no specific civil ceremony was required for the creation of a heterosexual marriage – only mutual agreement and the fact that the couple must regard each other as husband and wife accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Men usually married when they were in their 20s{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and women in their teens. It has been suggested that these ages made sense for the Greeks because men were generally done with military service or financially established by their late 20s, and marrying a teenage girl ensured ample time for her to bear children, as life expectancies were significantly lower.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Married Greek women had few rights in ancient Greek society and were expected to take care of the house and children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Time was an important factor in Greek marriage. For example, there were superstitions that being married during a [[full moon]] was good luck and, according to [[Robert Flacelière]], Greeks married in the winter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Inheritance was more important than feelings: a woman whose father dies without male heirs could be forced to marry her nearest male relative – even if she had to divorce her husband first.&lt;ref name = "PT"&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200505/marriage-history "Marriage, a History."] ''Psychology Today'', 1 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several types of marriages in ancient Roman society. The traditional ("conventional") form called ''conventio in manum'' required a ceremony with witnesses and was also dissolved with a ceremony.&lt;ref name="magnusHirschfeldSexology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/history_of_marriage_in_western.html |title=Magnus Hirschfeld Archive of Sexology |publisher=Erwin J.

She now was subject to the authority of her husband.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} There was the free marriage known as ''sine manu''. In this arrangement, the wife remained a member of her original family; she stayed under the authority of her father, kept her family rights of inheritance with her old family and did not gain any with the new family.&lt;ref name="RomanEmpireMarriage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roman-empire.net/society/soc-marriage.html |title=Roman empire.net marriage |publisher=Roman-empire.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212170628/http://www.roman-empire.net/society/soc-marriage.html |archivedate=12 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum age of marriage for girls was 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Treggiari, Susan |title=Roman Marriage: Isusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0J1A6o4GuQC&amp;pg=PA39|year=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-814939-2|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germanic tribes====
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]]

Among ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, the bride and groom were roughly the same age and generally older than their Roman counterparts, at least according to [[Tacitus]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, and hence pass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried into marriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes unite equally matched and robust; and the children inherit the vigor of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus (by commentator Edward Brooks). 2013. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7524/7524-h/7524-h.htm#link2H_4_0002 The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus]. Project Gutenberg. Footnotes 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Where [[Aristotle]] had set the prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women, the [[Visigothic Code|Visigothic Code of law]] in the 7th century placed the prime of life at 20 years for both men and women, after which both presumably married. Tacitus states that ancient Germanic brides were on average about 20 and were roughly the same age as their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, David. (1985). ''Medieval Households''. Harvard University Press, pp. 73–5, {{ISBN|067456376X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus, however, had never visited the German-speaking lands and most of his information on [[Germania]] comes from secondary sources. In addition, [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] women, like those of other Germanic tribes, are marked as women from the age of 12 and older, based on archaeological finds, implying that the age of marriage coincided with [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Dennis Howard and Siegmund, Frank. 2003.

In 12th-century Europe, women took the surname of their husbands and starting in the second half of the 16th century parental consent along with the church's consent was required for marriage.&lt;ref name="those_terrible_middle_ages"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Pernoud|first1 = Régine|title = Those terrible Middle Ages: debunking the myths|year = 2000|publisher = Ignatius Press| location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-0-89870-781-6|page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With few local exceptions, until 1545, Christian marriages in Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties.&lt;ref name="upennExcerptFromBook"&gt;[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/toc/14042.html upenn.edu Excerpt from Marriage, Sex, and Civic Culture in Late Medieval London] "the sacramental bond of marriage could be made only through the freely given consent of both parties."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marriageDotAbout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/generalhistory/a/marriagehistory.htm |title=marriage.about.com |publisher=marriage.about.com |date=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploregenealogy.co.uk/FindingEarlyMarriageRecords.html |title=Marriage Records |publisher=Exploregenealogy.co.uk |date=29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This promise was known as the "verbum." If freely given and made in the present tense (e.g., "I marry you"), it was unquestionably binding;&lt;ref name="upennExcerptFromBook"/&gt; if made in the future tense ("I will marry you"), it would constitute a [[Engagement|betrothal]].

In 1552 a wedding took place in Zufia, [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], between Diego de Zufia and Mari-Miguel following the custom as it was in the realm since the Middle Ages, but the man denounced the marriage on the grounds that its validity was conditioned to "riding" her ("''si te cabalgo, lo cual dixo de bascuence (...) balvin yo baneça aren senar içateko''"). The tribunal of the kingdom rejected the husband's claim, validating the wedding, but the husband appealed to the tribunal in [[Zaragoza]], and this institution annulled the marriage.&lt;ref name="Matrimonios a lo Navarro"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Esparza Zabalegi |first1=Jose Mari|date=March 2010 |title=Matrimonios a lo Navarro |journal=Nabarralde Kazeta |volume= |issue=7 |page=45 |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Fueros of Navarre|Charter of Navarre]], the basic union consisted of a civil marriage with no priest required and at least two witnesses, and the contract could be broken using the same formula.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The Church in turn lashed out at those who got married twice or thrice in a row while their formers spouses were still alive. In 1563 the [[Council of Trent]], twenty-fourth session, required that a valid marriage must be performed by a priest before two witnesses.&lt;ref name="Matrimonios a lo Navarro"/&gt;

One of the functions of churches from the [[Middle Ages]] was to register marriages, which was not obligatory. There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status, with these issues being adjudicated in [[ecclesiastical court]]s. During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged, sometimes as early as birth, and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families, nobles, and heirs of fiefdoms. The church resisted these imposed unions, and increased the number of causes for nullification of these arrangements.&lt;ref name="those_terrible_middle_ages"/&gt; As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it.&lt;ref name="those_terrible_middle_ages"/&gt;

In [[Middle Ages|Medieval Western Europe]], later marriage and higher rates of definitive [[celibacy]] (the so-called "European marriage pattern") helped to constrain patriarchy at its most extreme level. For example, [[England in the Middle Ages|Medieval England]] saw marriage age as variable depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and falling to the late teens after the [[Black Death]], when there were labor shortages;&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara A. 1986.

The age of marriage was not absolute, however, as child marriages occurred throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and later, with just some of them including:

As part of the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state, reflecting [[Martin Luther]]'s view that marriage was a "worldly thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=History of Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, many of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] European countries had a state involvement in marriage.

In England, under the Anglican Church, marriage by consent and cohabitation was valid until the passage of [[Marriage Act 1753|Lord Hardwicke's Act]] in 1753. This act instituted certain requirements for marriage, including the performance of a religious ceremony observed by witnesses.&lt;ref name="WestLaw"&gt;''West's Encyclopedia of American Law, 2nd Edition.''

As part of the [[Counter-Reformation]], in 1563 the [[Council of Trent]] decreed that a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] marriage would be recognized only if the marriage ceremony was officiated by a priest with two witnesses. The Council also authorized a [[Catechism]], issued in 1566, which defined marriage as "The conjugal union of man and woman, contracted between two qualified persons, which obliges them to live together throughout life."&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte Jr.|first=John|title=From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year = 1997|pages = 39–40|isbn=978-0-664-25543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[early modern period]], [[John Calvin]] and his [[Protestantism|Protestant]] colleagues reformulated Christian marriage by enacting the Marriage Ordinance of Geneva, which imposed "The dual requirements of state registration and church consecration to constitute marriage"&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt; for recognition.

In [[England and Wales]], Lord Hardwicke's [[Marriage Act 1753]] required a formal ceremony of marriage, thereby curtailing the practice of [[Fleet Marriage]], an irregular or a clandestine marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/leneman.html |title=The Scottish Case That Led to Hardwicke's Marriage Act |last=Leneman |first=Leah |year=1999 |publisher=Law and History Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525024450/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/leneman.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were clandestine or irregular marriages performed at Fleet Prison, and at hundreds of other places.

The Act did not apply to Jewish marriages or those of Quakers, whose marriages continued to be governed by their own customs.

In England and Wales, since 1837, civil marriages have been recognized as a legal alternative to church marriages under the [[Marriage Act 1836]]. In Germany, civil marriages were recognized in 1875. This law permitted a declaration of the marriage before an official clerk of the civil administration, when both spouses affirm their will to marry, to constitute a legally recognized valid and effective marriage, and allowed an optional private clerical marriage ceremony.

In contemporary [[English law|English common law]], a marriage is a voluntary [[contract]] by a man and a woman, in which by agreement they choose to become husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Marriage |title=Marriage&amp;#124;LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Topics.law.cornell.edu |date=19 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325205909/http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Marriage |archivedate=25 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edvard Westermarck proposed that "the institution of marriage has probably developed out of a primeval habit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Human Marriage|last=Westermarck|first=Edward Alexander|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan and Co., Ltd., London]]|year=1903|isbn=978-1-4021-8548-9|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2000, the average marriage age range was 25–44 years for men and 22–39 years for women.

===China===
{{Main article|Chinese marriage}}

The mythological origin of Chinese heterosexual marriage is a story about [[Nüwa]] and [[Fu Xi]] who invented proper marriage procedures after becoming married. In ancient Chinese society, people of the same surname are supposed to consult with their [[family tree]]s prior to marriage to reduce the potential risk of unintentional incest. Marrying one's maternal relatives was generally not thought of as incest. Families sometimes intermarried from one generation to another. Over time, Chinese people became more geographically mobile. Individuals remained members of their biological families. When a couple died, the husband and the wife were buried separately in the respective clan's graveyard. In a maternal marriage a male would become a son-in-law who lived in the wife's home.

The [[New Marriage Law]] of 1950 radically changed Chinese heterosexual marriage traditions, enforcing [[monogamy]], equality of men and women, and choice in marriage; [[arranged marriage]]s were the most common type of marriage in China until then. Starting October 2003, it became legal to marry or divorce without authorization from the couple's work units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html|title=Danwei|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=new marriage law or what?|date=October 2013}} Although people with infectious diseases such as AIDS may now marry, marriage is still illegal for the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1439403/China-relaxes-laws-on-love-and-marriage.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Spencer | title=China relaxes laws on love and marriage | date=21 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monsanto Company''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|æ|n|t|oʊ}}) was an American [[agrochemical]] and [[agricultural biotechnology]] corporation that existed from 1901 until 2018 when it was acquired by [[Bayer]]. It was headquartered in [[Creve Coeur, Missouri|Creve Coeur]], [[Missouri]]. Monsanto developed [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]], a [[glyphosate]]-based [[herbicide]] in the 1970s, and became a major producer of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops.

Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants (1983),&lt;ref name="pbn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vib.be/en/about-vib/plant-biotech-news/Pages/The-race-towards-the-first-genetically-modified-plant.aspx|title=The race towards the first genetically modified plant|publisher=Plant Biotech News|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the first to conduct field trials of [[genetically modified crops]], (1987). It was one of the top 10 U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on [[biotechnology]]. Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the [[History of biotechnology#Biotechnology and industry|biotechnology industry]] business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Leonard-Barton, Gary P.

Monsanto's roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products and lobbying of government agencies and roots as a chemical company resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the [[insecticide]] [[DDT]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Agent Orange]] and [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[bovine somatotropin|bovine growth hormone]]. Its seed patenting model was criticized as [[biopiracy]] and a threat to [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Parsai"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2861063.ece|title=Opposition to Monsanto patent on Indian melons|last=Parsai|first=Gargi|date=February 5, 2012|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/nov/15/genetics2?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Biopirates who seek the greatest prizes|last=Vidal|first=John|date=November 15, 2000|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, [[Bayer]] announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion.

==== 1901 to WWII ====
In 1901 Monsanto was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, as a [[chemical company]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/biotech-firms-need-innovation-strategies/5563/ |title=Biotech Firms Need Innovation Strategies |last = Glick |first=J.

He funded the firm with his own money and capital from a [[soft drink]] distributor. He used his wife's maiden name for the company. The company's first products were commodity food additives, such as the [[artificial sweetener]] [[saccharin]], [[caffeine]] and [[vanillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Simani, World Resources Institute. 2001.

Monsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at [[Cefn Mawr]], Wales. The venture produced vanillin, [[aspirin]] and its raw ingredient [[salicylic acid]], and later [[rubber]] processing chemicals. In the 1920s, Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as [[sulfuric acid]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]. Queeny's son [[Edgar Monsanto Queeny]] took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in [[Illinois]] (now known as [[Sauget, Illinois|Sauget]]). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for Monsanto plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115984289083380869|title=Yes, in My Backyard: Tiny Sauget, Illinois, Likes Business Misfits|last=Spain|first=William|date=2006-10-03|work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Monsanto bought the [[Swann Chemical Company]] in [[Anniston, Alabama]], and thereby entered the business of producing [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]].&lt;ref name="CIA1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poisoned By PCBs: 'A Lack of Control'|url=http://www.chemicalindustryarchives.org/dirtysecrets/anniston/2.asp|website=Chemical Industry Archives|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Head|first1=Thomas R., III|title=PCBs—The Rise and Fall of an Industrial Miracle|journal=Natural Resources &amp; Environment|date=Spring 2005|page=18|url=http://www.americanbar.org/tools/digitalassetabstract.html/content/dam/aba/publishing/natural_resources_environment/environ_mo_premium_nr_nre_spring05_Head.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montague"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montague|first1=Peter|title=How We Got Here -- Part 1:  The History of Chlorinated Diphenyl (PCB's)|url=http://www.hudsonwatch.net/rachels01.html|website=HudsonWatch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Monsanto acquired Thomas &amp; Hochwalt Laboratories in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to acquire the expertise of [[Charles Allen Thomas]] and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became Monsanto's Central Research Department.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;Ralph Landau, [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4548&amp;page=338 "Charles Allen Thomas," ''Memorial Tributes''], vol. 2, National Academy of Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340–341}} Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951–1960) and Board Chair (1960–1965). He retired in 1970.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;David Bird, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/obituaries/charles-thomas-ex-chairman-of-monsanto.html "Charles Thomas, Ex-Chairman of Monsanto" (obituary)], ''The New York Times'', March 31, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, D.C., with [[Leslie Groves]], commander of the [[Manhattan Project]], and [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], president of [[Harvard University]] and chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC).&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;''Dayton Daily News''.

==== Post-WWII====
In 1946, Monsanto developed and marketed "All" laundry detergent, which they sold to [[Lever Brothers]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published: September 15, 2003 |url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/unilever-lever-brothers/98749/ |title=Unilever (Lever Brothers Co.) &amp;#124; AdAge Encyclopedia of Advertising – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=September 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, its [[styrene]] factory was destroyed in the [[Texas City Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fire on the Grandcamp| url=http://www.texascity-library.org/disaster/first.php| publisher=Moore Memorial Public Library| location=Texas City, TX|date=n.d.|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Monsanto acquired American Viscose from [[Courtaulds]]. In 1954, Monsanto partnered with German chemical giant [[Bayer]] to form [[Mobay]] and market [[polyurethane]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Cynthia Day|title=Legal control of the multinational enterprise : national regulatory techniques and the prospects for international controls|date=1982|publisher=Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=9789024726684|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto began manufacturing [[DDT]] in 1944, along with some 15 other companies. This insecticide was critical to the fight against [[malaria]]-transmitting mosquitoes. Due to DDT's toxicity, it was banned in the United States in 1972. In 1977, Monsanto stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/about.htm Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)].

====1960s and 1970s====
In the mid‑1960s, [[William Standish Knowles]] and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize [[enantiomers]] via [[asymmetric hydrogenation]]. This was the first method for the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] production of pure [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Knowles.

In the mid-1960s, chemists at Monsanto developed the [[Monsanto process]] for making [[acetic acid]], which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, Monsanto chemists invented [[AstroTurf]] (initially ChemGrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroturf.com/1964/06/|title=June - 1964 - AstroTurf|publisher=|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, Monsanto was a producer of [[Agent Orange]] for [[United States Armed Forces]] operations in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and settled out of court in a lawsuit brought by veterans in 1984.&lt;ref name="EncNatSec"&gt;"Agent Orange" entry in Encyclopedia of United States National Security, edited by Richard J. Samuel.

From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards.

Fred Schubert|title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|chapter=1|isbn=978-0-8194-3956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto became a pioneer of [[optoelectronics]] in the 1970s. Between 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the [[PGA Tour]] event in Pensacola, Florida, which was renamed the [[Pensacola Open|Monsanto Open]].

In 1974, [[Harvard University]] and Monsanto signed a 10-year [[Medical research#Privately .28industry.29 funded biomedical research|research grant]] to support the cancer research of [[Judah Folkman]], which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit [[patent application]].&lt;ref name=NASbio&gt;Patricia K Donahoe.

====1980 to 1989: Becoming an agribiotech====
Monsanto scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983.&lt;ref name=pbn/&gt; Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of [[genetically modified crops]]. Increasing involvement in [[agricultural biotechnology]] dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as Monsanto's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involvement increased under the leadership of [[Robert B. Shapiro|Robert Shapiro]], appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1985, Monsanto acquired [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]], a [[life sciences]] company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for [[celecoxib|Celebrex]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/patexclnew.cfm?Appl_No=020998&amp;Product_No=003&amp;table1=OB_Rx Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations]. accessdata.fda.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5466823 |title=Patent US5466823 – Substituted pyrazolyl benzenesulfonamides – Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1998 became the first selective [[COX-2 inhibitor|COX‑2 inhibitor]] to be approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/98/20998.cfm |title=Drug Approval Package: Celebrex (Celecoxib) NDA# 20-998 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrex became a [[blockbuster drug]] and was often mentioned as a key reason for [[Pfizer]]'s acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Frank, Robert |author2=Hensley, Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Pfizer to Buy Pharmacia For $60 Billion in Stock|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1026684057282753560|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990 to 1999: Moving into the seed market &amp; industry consolidation====
In 1994, Monsanto introduced a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] version of [[bovine somatotropin]], brand-named Posilac.&lt;ref name = MG&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html | title = General information – Posilac| year = 2007 | publisher = Monsanto | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101123956/http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html| archivedate = January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto later sold this business to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].

In 1996, Monsanto purchased [[Agracetus]], the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which Monsanto had been licensing technology since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = WR Grace Sells Agracetus to Monsanto for $150M|url = http://www.biotechprofiles.com/companyfiles/madisonnetwork/c81a944349224f0984a586f89719edb6.pdf|date = April 8, 1996|publisher = W.

Monsanto first entered the [[maize]] seed business when it purchased 40% of [[DEKALB Genetics Corporation|Dekalb]] in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite press release |title = Justice Department Approves Monsanto's Acquisition of Dekalb Genetics Corporation|date = November 30, 1998|url = http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/2103.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040218013852/http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/2103.htm|archivedate=February 18, 2004 |publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company first published an annual report citing Monsanto's Law, a biotechnological take on [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]], indicating its future directions and exponential growth in the use of biotechnology. In 1998, Monsanto purchased [[Cargill]]'s international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2005, it finalized the purchase of [[Seminis Inc]], a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monsanto closes $1.4 billion buy of Seminis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/03/21/daily37.html|accessdate=2018-01-06|work=St. Louis Business Journal|date=23 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it the world's largest conventional seed company.

In 1999 Monsanto sold off NutraSweet Co.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In December of the same year, Monsanto agreed to merge with [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]], in a deal valuing the transaction at $27 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deogun|first1=Nikhil|last2=Langreth|first2=Robert|last3=Burton|first3=Thomas M.|title=Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Monsanto Boards Approve $27 Billion Merger of Equals|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB945650774971796642|accessdate=2018-01-06|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the "new" Pharmacia; Monsanto's medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barboza|first1=David|title=Monsanto and Pharmacia to Join, Creating a Pharmaceutical Giant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/20/business/monsanto-and-pharmacia-to-join-creating-a-pharmaceutical-giant.html |accessdate=2018-01-06|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000 to 2009: Birth of the "new" Monsanto====
In 2000: Pharmacia spun off its agro-biotech subsidiary into a new company,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the "new Monsanto",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Monsanto Raises $700 Million in IPO|date = October 18, 2000|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/18/business/fi-38228|work = [[Los Angel.

As a result, the new Monsanto continued to be a party to numerous lawsuits over the prior Monsanto. Pharmacia was bought by [[Pfizer]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/15/business/pfizer-said-to-buy-large-drug-rival-in-60-billion-deal.html|title=Pfizer Said to Buy Large Drug Rival in $60 Billion Deal|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|date=2002-07-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, CNN/Money.

In 2005 Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. Monsanto's goal was to obtain "a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/monsanto_to_acquire_emergent_genetics__stoneville_and_nexgen_cotton_brands-25250.html |title=Monsanto to Acquire Emergent Genetics, Stoneville and NexGen Cotton Brands |publisher=Seed Today |date=February 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015161004/http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/monsanto_to_acquire_emergent_genetics__stoneville_and_nexgen_cotton_brands-25250.html |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Glyphosate herbicides====
{{see also|Glyphosate}}

Following its 1970 introduction, Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. Glyphosate has since been marketed by many [[agrochemical]] companies, in various solution strengths and with various [[Agricultural spray adjuvant|adjuvants]], under dozens of tradenames.&lt;ref&gt;Farm Chemicals International [http://www.farmchemicalsinternational.com/crop-protection-database/#//product/brief/203900 Glyphosate entry in Crop Protection Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fruits/gapeach/pdf/mirror.pdf |title=Mirror or Mirror on the Wall Show Me the Best Glyphosate Formulation of All |author=Mitchem W |publisher=North Carolina State University Extension |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlISU Weed Science Online - Glyphosate - A Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeds.iastate.edu/mgmt/2001/glyphosate%20review.htm#Glyphosate%20Products |title=ISU Weed Science Online - Glyphosate - A Review |author=Hartzler B |format= |website= |publisher=Iowa State University Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weed Handbook Glyphosate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invasive.org/gist/products/handbook/14.Glyphosate.pdf |title=Glyphosate |vauthors=Tu M, Hurd C, Robison R, Randall JM |date=November 1, 2001 |format= |work=Weed Control Methods Handbook |publisher=The Nature Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14904184 |title=The debate over whether Monsanto is a corporate sinner or saint |date=November 19, 2009 |work=The Economist |accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's [[gross margin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/29/monsanto-potash-fertilizer-personal-finance-investing-ideas-agrium-mosaic.html |title= The Seeds Of A Monsanto Short Play | author= Cavallaro M |date=June 26, 2009 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crop seed====
{{see also|Hybrid seed|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}

As of 2015, Monsanto's line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.

==== Row crops ====
Many of Monsanto's agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to [[herbicide]]s, including glyphosate and [[dicamba]]. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds ''Roundup Ready''. Monsanto's introduction of this system (planting a glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together.&lt;ref name=HighPlainsJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=High Plains Journal |date=August 10, 2010 |author=Latzke, Jennifer M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.&lt;ref name=HighPlainsJ /&gt; Farmers widely adopted the technology—for example over 80% of maize ([[Mon 832]]), [[Roundup Ready soybean|soybean]] (MON-Ø4Ø32-6), cotton, [[sugar beet]] and [[canola]] planted in the United States are [[glyphosate]]-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready [[genetically modified wheat]] ([[MON 71800]]) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about the rejection of genetically modified (GM) wheat by foreign markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Person|first1=Daniel|title=Sale could change wheat industry: WestBred's owner Monsanto looks to develop 'genetically modified' varieties|url=http://missoulian.com/business/agriculture/sale-could-change-wheat-industry-westbred-s-owner-monsanto-looks/article_1db27912-ac3b-11de-8024-001cc4c002e0.html|website=Missoulian|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two patents were critical to Monsanto's GM soybean business; one expired in 2011 and the other in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Patently-O Blog, September 26, 2011. [http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2011/09/when-monsantos-patents-expire.html When Monsanto's Patents Expire]&lt;/ref&gt; The second expiration meant that glyphosate resistant soybeans became "generic".&lt;ref name="HighPlainsJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/business/18seed.html "As Patent Ends, a Seed's Use Will Survive"], ''The New York Times''.

Monsanto invented and sells genetically modified seeds that make a crystalline insecticidal protein from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto's potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A0YyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4631,1776980&amp;dq=bacillus+thuringiensis+potato+1996+approved&amp;hl= Genetically Altered Potato Ok'd For Crops]
''Lawrence Journal-World'', May 6, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto subsequently developed [[Transgenic maize#Bt corn|Bt maize]] ([[MON 802]], [[MON 809]], [[MON 863]], [[MON 810]]), [[Genetically modified soybean|Bt soybean]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Crop Biotech Update |url=http://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=6565 |title=Monsanto's Bt Roundup Ready 2 Yield Soybeans Approved for Planting in Brazil – Crop Biotech Update (8/27/2010) &amp;#124; ISAAA.org/KC |publisher=Isaaa.org |date=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bt cotton]].

Monsanto produces seed that has multiple genetic modifications, also known as "stacked traits"—for instance, cotton that make one or more Bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate. One of these, created in collaboration with [[Dow Chemical Company]], is called [[SmartStax]]. In 2011 Monsanto launched the Genuity brand for its stacked-trait products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southeastfarmpress.com/agribusiness-monsanto-unveils-genuity-branding "Agribusiness: Monsanto unveils Genuity branding"]. ''SE Farm News'', March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the agricultural seed lineup included ''Roundup Ready'' alfalfa, canola and sugarbeet; Bt and/or ''Roundup Ready'' cotton; sorghum hybrids; soybeans with various oil profiles, most with the ''Roundup Ready'' trait; and a wide range of wheat products, many of which incorporate the nontransgenic "clearfield" imazamox-tolerant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agproducts.basf.us/products/clearfield-wheat.html |title=The CLEARFIELD Production System for Wheat|publisher=Agproducts.basf.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; trait from [[BASF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/monsanto-agricultural-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Agricultural Seeds |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids branded DroughtGard.&lt;ref&gt;OECD BioTrack Database.

===== India-specific issues =====
In 2009, Monsanto scientists discovered insects that had developed resistance to the [[Bt cotton|Bt Cotton]] planted in [[Gujarat]]. Monsanto communicated this to the Indian government and its customers, stating that "Resistance is natural and expected, so measures to delay resistance are important. Among the factors that may have contributed to [[pink bollworm]] resistance to the Cry1Ac protein in Bollgard I in Gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved Bt cotton seed, planted prior to GEAC approval of Bollgard I cotton, which may have had lower protein expression levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx|title=Monsanto ~ Cotton In India|date=November 3, 2008|publisher=Monsanto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of Bt cotton – Bolguard II – which had two resistance genes instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/06/stories/2010030664831400.htm|title=Bt cotton ineffective against pest in parts of Gujarat, admits Monsanto|date=March 6, 2010|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this advice was criticized: "an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it 'appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events [that is, the first-generation Bollgard I product] and promote double genes [the second generation Bollgard II] which would fetch higher price.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/12/stories/2010031263690900.htm|title=Monsanto 'admission' has business motives?|date=March 12, 2010|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto's GM cotton seed was the subject of NGO agitation because of its higher cost. Indian farmers crossed GM varieties with local varieties, using [[plant breeding]], violating their agreements with Monsanto.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab (June 17, 2003), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/science/nature/2998150.stm "India's GM seed Piracy"], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, high prices of Bt Cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of [[Jhabua]] district into debt when the crops died due to lack of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/25/stories/2009082554841400.htm|title=Jhabua on its way to becoming Vidarbha-II?|date=August 25, 2009|publisher=Hindu.com|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vegetables ====
In 2012 Monsanto was the world's largest supplier of non-GE vegetable seeds by value, with sales of $800M. 95% of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding.

The use of rBST remains controversial with respect to its effects on cows and their milk.&lt;ref name=Dobs&gt;Dobson, William D. (June 1996) [http://www.aae.wisc.edu/pubs/sps/pdf/stpap397.pdf The BST Case]. University of Wisconsin-Madison Agricultural and Applied Economics Staff Paper Series No. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

In some markets, milk from cows that are not treated with rBST is sold with labels indicating that it is rBST-free: this milk has proved popular with consumers.&lt;ref name = "nytimes milk label"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09feed.html Fighting on a Battlefield the Size of a Milk Label], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to this, in early 2008 a pro-rBST advocacy group called "American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology" (AFACT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itisafact.org/ |title=AFACT: American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology |publisher=Itisafact.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of dairies and originally affiliated with Monsanto, formed and began lobbying to ban such labels. AFACT stated that "absence" labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior.&lt;ref name = "nytimes milk label" /&gt;

===Uncommericalized products===
Monsanto also developed notable technologies that were not ultimately commercialized.

===="Terminator" seeds====
{{Main article|Genetic use restriction technology}}

Genetic use restriction technology, colloquially known as "terminator technology", produces plants with sterile seeds. This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild. It also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest, requiring them to purchase seed for every planting, allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology. Farmers have been buying [[hybrid seed]]s for generations, instead of replanting their harvest, because second-generation hybrid seeds are inferior. Nevertheless, most seed companies contract only with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds.

Terminator technology has been developed by governmental labs, university researchers and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngin.tripod.com/353.htm |title=RAFI on new Terminator patent |publisher=Ngin.tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=gm-104#gm-104 |title=Context of 'July 20, 1999: USDA and Delta &amp; Pine Land Secure New Patent for Improvements in Terminator Genetic Seed Sterilization Technology' |publisher=Historycommons.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warwick Terminator"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Hugh |last=Warwick |editor-last=Wijeratna |editor-first=Alex |editor2-last=Meienberg |editor2-first=François |editor3-last= Meienberg |title = Syngenta – Switching off farmers' rights? |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date=October 2000 |url = http://www.fao.org/righttofood/KC/downloads/vl/docs/AH428.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512172032/http://www.fao.org/righttofood/KC/downloads/vl/docs/AH428.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology has not been used commercially.&lt;ref name="monsanto pledge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/terminator-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Is Monsanto Going to Develop or Sell "Terminator" Seeds? |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banterminator.org/The-Issues/Introduction |title=Introduction / The Issues / |publisher=Ban Terminator |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors that Monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology caused protests, for example in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/465969.stm |work=BBC News |title=Farmers welcome halt of 'terminator' |date=October 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/doc/RHerring.pdf |title=CAS 38-4 24 Oct 2006.vp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531024738/http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/doc/RHerring.pdf |archivedate=May 31, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and litigation ==
{{Main article|Monsanto legal cases}}Monsanto is internationally notable for its involvement in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It defended lawsuits mostly over its products' health and environmental effects. Monsanto used the courts to enforce its patents, particularly in agricultural [[biotechnology]], an approach similar to that of other companies in the field, such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Dupont Pioneer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/93431968/Pioneer-Hi-Bred-International-v-Does-1-5|title=Pioneer Hi Bred International v.

===Argentina===
Argentina approved ''Roundup Ready'' soy in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 soy production grew from 14 million acres to 42 million acres. The growth was driven by Argentine investors' interest in export markets.&lt;ref name="SoyRepublic"&gt;[http://www.towardfreedom.com/32-archives/environment/1600-the-soy-republic-of-argentina The Soy Republic of Argentina]. Towardfreedom.com (September 2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation led to a decrease in production of many staples such as [[milk]], [[rice]], [[maize]], [[potato]]es and [[lentils]]. As of 2004 about 150,000 small farmers had left the countryside; including 50% as of 2009 in the Chaco region.&lt;ref name="SoyRepublic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianArgentina"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/apr/16/gm.food GM soya 'miracle' turns sour in Argentina].

[[Norte Grande Geography Journal]] Revista de geografía Norte Grande 45: 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a Monsanto representative had said, "any problems with GM soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture, not because it was GM. If you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems."&lt;ref name="GuardianArgentina" /&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, Monsanto attempted to enforce its patents on soymeal imported into Spain from Argentina by having Spanish customs officials seize the soymeal shipments. This has been an attempt made by Monsanto to put pressure on the Argentinian government for allowing them to enforce their seed patents in Argentina as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cropchoice.com/leadstrygmo013106.html Seeds of conflict take root in debate over Michigan farming bill]. Cropchoice.com, January 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 environmentalist groups objected to a Monsanto corn seed conditioning facility in [[Malvinas Argentinas, Córdoba]]. Neighbours objected to the risk of environmental impact. Court rulings supported the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/monsanto-podra-continuar-con-obra-civil-pero-no-con-operativa|title=Monsanto podrá continuar con obra civil pero no con operativa|date=April 23, 2013|publisher=La Voz|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but environmentalist groups organised demonstrations and opened an online petition for the subject to be decided in a popular [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argenpress.info/2013/12/monsanto-contamina-el-medio-ambiente-y.html|title=Monsanto contamina el medio ambiente y también la democracia|author=Marín|first=Emiliom|date=December 2, 2013|website=|publisher=Argenpress.info|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rulings stipulated that while construction could continue, the facility could not begin operating until the [[environmental impact report]] required by law had been duly presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/ratifican-que-monsanto-podra-continuar-con-la-obra-civil|title=Ratifican que Monsanto podrá continuar con la obra civil|date=October 10, 2013|publisher=La Voz|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Monsanto reached an agreement with Argentina's government on soybean seed royalty payments. Monsanto agreed to give the Argentine Seed Institute (Inase) oversight over crops grown from Monsanto's Intacta genetically modified soybean seeds. Before the agreement, Argentine farmers generally avoided royalties by using seeds from previous harvests or purchased from non-registered suppliers. Inase agreed to delegate testing to grain exchanges. About 6 million sample tests were to be conducted annually. Seeds that appear to be GMOs may be tested again using a [[polymerase chain reaction]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-14/monsanto-argentina-seed-pact-said-to-become-effective-next-week|title=Monsanto-Argentina Seed Pact Said to Become Effective Next Week|last=Gonzalez|first=Pablo Rosendo|date=2016-06-14|work=|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-12-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC News (June 3, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Brazil passed a law creating a regulatory pathway for GM crops. Agriculture minister Roberto Rodrigues stated, "Brazilian soy farmers, who have used cloned or smuggled versions of the biotechnology company's Roundup Ready variety for years, will no longer have to worry about breaking the law or facing legal action from Monsanto as long as regulators approve the seeds for planting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/13773 "Brazil Approves Law to Legalize Genetically Modified Crops"].

{{main article|Farmers' suicides in India}}
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, public attention was drawn to suicides by indebted farmers following crop failures.&lt;ref name=FrontLine&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2005/07/seeds_of_suicid.html FRONTLINE/WORLD.

PBS (July 26, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the early 2000s, farmers in [[Andhra Pradesh]] (AP) were in economic crisis due to high-interest rates and crop failures, leading to widespread unrest and farmer suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3855517.stm | work=BBC News | title=India PM pledge over suicide farmers | date=July 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto was one focus of protests with respect to the price and yields of Bt seed. In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields.&lt;ref&gt;The Hindu Business Line.

==== PCBs ====
In the late 1960s, the Monsanto plant in [[Sauget, Illinois]], was the nation's largest producer of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which remained in the water along Dead Creek there. An EPA official referred to Sauget as "one of the most polluted communities in the region" and "a soup of different chemicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06276/727066-28.stm |title=Tiny Sauget, Illinois, likes business misfits |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=October 3, 2006 |first=William |last=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GM wheat ====

In 2013 a Monsanto-developed strain of [[glyphosate]]-resistant [[genetically modified wheat|wheat]] (a GMO) was discovered on a farm in Oregon, growing as a weed or [[volunteer (botany)|"volunteer plant"]]. The final Oregon field test had occurred in 2001. As of May 2013, the GMO seed source was unknown. Volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and was not found to be glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto faced penalties up to $1 million over potential violations of the [[Plant Protection Act]]. The discovery threatened world-leading US wheat exports, which totaled $8.1 billion in 2012.&lt;ref name="BloombergWheat"&gt;Alan Bjerga, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-29/monsanto-modified-wheat-unapproved-by-usda-found-in-oregon-field.html "Monsanto Modified Wheat Not Approved by USDA Found in Field"], ''Bloomberg News''.

Monsanto has faced controversy in the United States over claims that its herbicide products might be carcinogens.

===Improper accounting for incentive rebates ===
From 2009 to 2011, Monsanto improperly accounted for incentive rebates. The actions inflated Monsanto's reported profit by $31 million over the two years. Monsanto paid $80 million in penalties pursuant to a subsequent settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|US Securities and Exchange Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/business/for-monsanto-whistle-blower-a-22-million-award-that-fell-short.html|title=Monsanto Whistle-Blower: $22 Million Richer, but Not Satisfied|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|date=2016-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings in response to losing market share of Roundup to generic producers.

===Alleged ghostwriting controversy===

A review of glyphosate's carcinogenic potential by four independent expert panels, with a comparison to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] assessment, was published in September 2016. Using emails released in August 2017 by plaintiffs' lawyers who are suing Monsanto, ''[[Bloomberg Business Week]]'' reported that "Monsanto scientists were heavily involved in organizing, reviewing, and editing drafts submitted by the outside experts." A Monsanto spokesperson responded that Monsanto had provided only non-substantive cosmetic copyediting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsanto Was Its Own Ghostwriter for Some Safety Reviews|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/monsanto-was-its-own-ghostwriter-for-some-safety-reviews|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto made political contributions of $186,250 to federal candidates in the 2008 election cycle through its [[political action committee]] (PAC) (42% to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 58% to [[Republican Party (USA)|Republicans]]) and  $305,749 in the 2010 election cycle (48% Democrat, 52% Republicans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strID=C00042069 2008 PAC Summary Data], ''Open Secrets.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]]'s 2012 [[Proposition 37#Proposition 37|Proposition 37]] would have mandated the [[GMO food labelling|disclosure]] of [[genetically modified crops]] used in the production of California food products.

'In response to recent urgent requests by [Spanish rural affairs ministry] state secretary Josep Puxeu and Monsanto, post requests renewed US government support of Spain's science-based agricultural biotechnology position through high-level US government intervention.'"&lt;ref name="07Paris4723" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. targeted EU on GM foods: WikiLeaks |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/03/08/genetically-modified-food.html |date=March 9, 2011 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked documents showed that in 2009, when the Spanish government's policy approving [[MON810]] was under pressure from EU interests, Monsanto's Director for Biotechnology for Spain and Portugal requested that the US government support Spain on the matter.&lt;ref name="07Paris4723"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/03/wikileaks-us-eu-gm-crops |title=WikiLeaks: US targets EU over GM crops |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Vidal, John |date=January 3, 2011 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="09MADRID482"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09MADRID482.html |title=Spain's biotech crop under threat (Wikileaks telegram 09MADRID482) |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=May 19, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080152/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09MADRID482.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=EUobserver |title=Spain a key ally of pro-GMO America, cables reveal |url=http://euobserver.com/news/31544 |date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaks indicated that Spain and the US had worked closely together to "persuade the EU not to strengthen biotechnology laws".&lt;ref name="07Paris4723" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Spain was viewed as a key GMO supporter and a leading indicator of support across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Presses Europe to Worship Genetically Modified Foods |author=Estabrook, Barry |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/01/us-presses-europe-to-worship-genetically-modified-foods/69633/|date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Pais"&gt;{{cite web |title=EE UU: "España nos pide que presionemos a Bruselas a favor de los transgénicos" |work=El Pais |url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=es&amp;to=en&amp;a=http://elpais.com/diario/2010/12/19/espana/1292713201_850215.html |date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaks also revealed that in response to an attempt by France to ban MON810 in late 2007, then-US ambassador to France, [[Craig Roberts Stapleton]], asked Washington to "calibrate a targeted retaliation list that [would cause] some pain across the EU", targeting countries that did not support the use of GM crops.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/03/wikileaks-us-eu-gm-crops |title=WikiLeaks: US targets EU over GM crops |work=The Guardian |author=Vidal, John |date=January 3, 2011 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity transpired after the US, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico and New Zealand had brought an action against Europe via the World Trade Organization with respect to the EU's banning of GMOs; in 2006, the [[WTO]] had ruled against the EU.&lt;ref name="El Pais" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/trade/eu-gmo-ban-illegal-wto-rules/article-155197 Euractive.com EU GMO ban was illegal, WTO rules], euractiv.com (updated May 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds291sum_e.pdf EC – Approval and Marketing of Biotech Products (Disputes DS291, 292, 293)], World Trade Organisation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto was a member of [[EuropaBio]], the leading biotechnology trade group in Europe. One of EuropaBio's initiatives is "Transforming Europe's position on GM food". It found "an urgent need to reshape the terms of the debate about GM in Europe".&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2011/oct/20/transforming-europe-gm-food Transforming Europe's position on GM food – ambassadors programme executive summary] ''The Guardian'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; EuropaBio proposed the recruitment of high-profile "ambassadors" to lobby EU officials.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/europabio-gm-ambassadors-europe?intcmp=239 Biotech group bids to recruit high-profile GM 'ambassadors'] John Vidal and Hanna Gersmann, ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2011/oct/20/gm-food Draft letter from EuropaBio to potential GM ambassadors] (Draft letter from EuropaBio to potential GM ambassadors seeking their involvement in the outreach programme), ''The Guardian'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti ===
After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Monsanto donated $255,000 for disaster relief&lt;ref name=SeedDaily&gt;[http://www.seeddaily.com/reports/Haitian_farmers_protest_Monsanto_seed_donations_999.html Haitian farmers protest Monsanto seed donations], Hinche, Haiti (AFP) June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 60,000 seed sacks (475 tons) of hybrid (non-GM) corn and vegetable seeds worth $4 million.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Jonathan M. |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FMUQN80.htm |title=Monsanto gives Haiti $4 million in hybrid seeds |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Catholic Relief Services]] (CRS) rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the five most common food security crops found that the Haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds be introduced only on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151257/http://oneresponse.info/Disasters/Haiti/Agriculture/publicdocuments/CRS.%20Rapid%20Seed%20Assessment.%20Mars-10.pdf "A Rapid Seed Assessment in the Southern Department of Haiti."] Catholic Relief Services, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuel Prophete, head of Haiti's Ministry of Agriculture's Service National Semencier (SNS), stated that SNS was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because they at least double yields. Louise Sperling, Principal Researcher at the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) told HGW that she was not opposed to hybrids, but noted that most hybrids required extra water and better soils and that most of Haiti was not appropriate for hybrids.

Activists objected that some of the seeds were coated with the [[fungicide]]s Maxim or [[thiram]]. In the United States, [[pesticide]]s containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not have adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1009J9G.PDF US EPA: Pesticides – RED Facts Thiram]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; Activists wrote that the coated seeds were handled in a dangerous manner by the recipients.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/monsanto-haiti/1304605989 |title=Monsanto in Haiti |publisher=Truth-out.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The donated seeds were sold at a reduced price in local markets.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek /&gt; However, farmers feared that they were being given seeds that would "threaten local varieties"&lt;ref name=SeedDaily /&gt; and an estimated 8,000–12,000 farmers attended a protest of the donation on June 4, 2010, organized by a Haitian farmers' association, the Peasant Movement of Papay, where a small pile of seeds was symbolically burned.&lt;ref name=Epoch&gt;{{cite news |title=Haiti GM food aid is a 'trojan horse' |author=Skorbach, Kristina |url=http://epoch-archive.com/a1/en/ie/nnn/2010/06-June/24/ET220610005.pdf |newspaper=The Epoch Times |date=June 24 – July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Stroke of Insight''''' (2008) is a non-fiction book by American author [[Jill Bolte Taylor]]. In it, she tells of her experience in 1996 of having a [[stroke]] in her left hemisphere, and how that gave her insight into brain functioning, particularly as it relates to the different functions of the two brain hemispheres. It is Taylor's first book.

==Critical reception==
Desmond O'Neill, M.D. writes in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', that although the account is gripping and insightful, that it is "burdened by an interpretation of stroke through the narrow lens of hemispheric function." He also argues that the advice Taylor gives to stroke patients might not be valuable for all stroke patients.&lt;ref name="Book Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMbkrev0805088 |title=My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The book was initially released in October 2006 as a paperback by the author through the [[self-publishing]] company [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]]. It was then sold to [[Viking Press|Viking]] and published in hardcover, by Viking, on May 12, 2008 ({{ISBN|0670020745}}). Audio and E-book versions were also released.  The paperback edition was released May 26, 2009, by [[Plume_(publisher)|Plume]] ({{ISBN|0452295548}}).

== Ballet ==
Cedar Lake Ballet Company made a ballet about ''My Stroke of Insight'' called ''Orbo Novo''.  The piece's title is drawn from a 1493 reference to North America by Spanish historian Pietro Martire d'Anghiera. But the "new world" that [[Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui|Cherkaoui]] is exploring is current theories about the brain, and the text that the 17 dancers speak during the first moments of the 75-minute work comes from ''My Stroke of Insight'', neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor's uncanny recollection of her stroke. The choreography is based on the ramifications of a single resonant idea: the duality between rationality (the left brain) and instinctive, sensual responses (the right brain); between control and the lack of it; between balance and instability, solitude and society. &lt;ref name="Choreographer Cherkaoui Ballet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-07-22/dance/sidi-larbi-cherkaoui-tries-getting-in-our-heads-with-cedar-lake-contemporary-ballet/ |title=Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui Tries Getting In Our Heads}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Thus were the dancers speaking Taylor's words (“My spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria”), while they physically embodied brain waves and misfiring synapses, with a nod, perhaps, to the double helix:  rubbery splayed limbs; über-arched backs; ever-rippling torsos."   &lt;ref name="Orbo Novo Cedar Lake Ballet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/05/dance-review-cedar-lake-ballet-at-uclas-royce-hall.html |title=Cedar Lake Ballet at UCLA - Review | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;   “‘Orbo Novo’ is a humorous and insightful take on (Taylor’s) story,” said dancer Jubal Battisti. “It has a lot to do with the hemispheres of the brain switching between left and right and what that reveals.”  &lt;ref name="Orbo Novo Jill Bolte Taylor Ballet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybruin.com/index.php/article/2010/05/not-the-typical-ballet-show?&amp;cp=1 |title=Not The Typical Ballet Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Talking Tom''''' is a [[digital pet|virtual pet]] [[mobile application|app]] developed by Slovenian studio [[Outfit7]] in November 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/my-talking-tom-iphone-android-kitten-app-children-asked-users-if-they-wanna-fk-1532487|title=My Talking Tom: Ads asked children if they 'wanna f**k' in Android and iPhone app|last=Wright|first=Paul|date=2015-12-09|website=|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/my-talking-tom-game-explicit-sex-ads-irresponsibly-placed-in-smartphone-app-for-children-a6766476.html|title=My Talking Tom: Explicit sex ads 'irresponsibly placed' in smartphone app for children|last=|first=|date=2015-12-09|website=|publisher=[[The Independent]]|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to ''[[Pou (video game)|Pou]]'' and the fourteenth app of the [[Talking Tom and Friends]] series overall. A similar app called ''My Talking Angela'' was released in December 3, 2014. Another similar app called ''My Talking Hank'' was released in January 12, 2017. A sequel, ''My Talking Tom 2'', was released in November 3, 2018.

The official English [[slogan]] is "''Customize Your Tom!''".

In 2015, the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) ruled that [[Online advertising|advertising]] for an [[adult web site]] was delivered to [[underage children]] via the app.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The ASA noted that Outfit7 "had a strict advertising policy" but that the company "had not been able to identify which [[ad network]] had served the ad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2015/6/Mobjizz-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_296967.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on Mobjizz Ltd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.asa.org.uk|publisher=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)]]|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The goal of the game is to take care of an anthropomorphic [[kitten]] named ''Tom'' (who can optionally be renamed by the player). The player is invited to care for "Tom" and help him grow from a baby kitten to a full-grown tomcat by interacting with him in different ways, such as feeding him, taking him to the bathroom, playing mini games, and tucking him into his bed to sleep when he is tired. Tom can repeat words spoken into the device's microphone for up to 25 seconds using a [[speech synthesis|synthesized voice]]. Through in-app purchases, in-game currency, or by logging into [[Facebook]], there is an option to visit Tom's friends, or travel around the world. Using in-game currency, various different outfits, skins, and accessories can be purchased to dress-up and customize Tom.

The Talking Tom itself is one of most famous video game chargers and often was a [[marketing]] [[brand]] (sometimes without the official consent with its creator, [[Outfit7]]). The character is called as the "world`s most popular cat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Talking Tom: Review|url=http://omegadroid.co/talking-tom-review/|publisher=OmegaDroid|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-mortem photography''' (also known as '''memorial portraiture''' or a '''mourning portrait''') is the practice of photographing the recently deceased. Various cultures use and have used this practice, though the best-studied area of post-mortem photography is that of Europe and America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Looking at Death|last=Norfleet|first=Barbara|publisher=David R. Godine|year=1993|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be considerable dispute as to whether individual early photographs actually show a dead person or not, often sharpened by commercial considerations.

The form continued the tradition of earlier painted [[mourning portraits]].  Today post-mortem photography is most common in the contexts of police and [[pathology]] work.

==History and popularity==
The invention of the [[daguerreotype]] in 1839 made portraiture much more commonplace, as many of those who were unable to afford the commission of a painted portrait could afford to sit for a [[photography]] session.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bunge, J.A., &amp; Mord, J. (2015). ''Beyond the dark veil: Post-mortem &amp; mourning photography from the Thanatos archive.'' San Francisco, CA: Grand Central Press &amp; Last Gasp.&lt;/ref&gt; This cheaper and quicker method also provided the middle class with a means for memorializing dead loved ones.

Post-mortem photography was very common in the nineteenth century when "death occurred in the home and was quite an ordinary part of life."&lt;ref name="Hirsche"/&gt; As photography was a new medium, it is plausible that "many daguerreotype post-mortem portraits, especially those of infants and young children, were probably the only photographs ever made of the sitters. The long exposure time made deceased subjects easy to photograph.'"&lt;ref name="Hirsche"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsche|first=Robert|title=Seizing the Light: a Social History of Photography|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=New York |page=34-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The problem of long exposure times also led to the phenomenon of [[hidden mother photography]], where the mother was hidden in-frame to calm a young child and keep them still.&lt;ref name="Bathurst 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bathurst|first1=Bella|title=The lady vanishes: Victorian photography's hidden mothers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/02/hidden-mothers-victorian-photography|accessdate=January 28, 2018|work=The Guardian|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) According to Mary Warner Marien, "post-mortem photography flourished in photography's early decades, among clients who preferred to capture an image of a deceased loved one rather than have no photograph at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marien|first=Mary Warner|title=Photography: A Cultural History|year=2002|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These photographs served as keepsakes to remember the deceased. The later invention of the [[carte de visite]], which allowed multiple prints to be made from a single negative, meant that copies of the image could be mailed to relatives. Approaching the 20th century, cameras became more accessible and more people began to be able to take photographs for themselves.

In America, post-mortem photography became an increasingly private practice by the mid-to-late nineteenth century, with discussion moving out of trade journals and public discussion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secure the Shadow: Death Photography in America|last=Ruby|first=Jay|publisher=MIT Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The now more private practice was studied by anthropologist [[Jay Ruby]] who was able to find limited information after the turn of the century, but noted a resurgence in the so-called "mourning tableaux" - where the living were photographed surrounding the coffin of the deceased, sometimes with the deceased visible - in America in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  He was also able to find examples of death photography as a private practice in America his own time - the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Barbara Norfleet investigated further and discovered the practice of post-mortem photography continued in America right up until World War II "at least among rural and urban working-and middle-class families [in ethnic minorities]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Her conclusion centred on the work of African-American portrait photographer [[James Van Der Zee]] in Harlem from 1917-1940s, whose ''Harlem Book of the Dead'' is a collection post-mortem portraits of other African Americans in Harlem over the course of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harlem Book of the Dead|last=Van Der Zee|first=James|publisher=Morgan and Morgan|year=1978|isbn=|location=Dobbs Ferry, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Britain, Audrey Linkman found a similar continuation of post-mortem photography in the inter-war years, indicating the practice was not limited to the Victorian Era in Britain, though she said little about wider Europe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  She also was a strong supporter of Barbara Norfleet's research into the ethnic minorities and middle-classes of America, insisting that post-mortem photography remained popular among these groups for far longer than the upper classes who had previously been studied.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Post-mortem photography as early as the 1970s was taken up by artists, and continues today.  Audrey Linkman,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Christopher Townsend&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art and Death|last=Townsend|first=Chris|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lauren Summersgill&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Summersgill, Lauren. ''Visible Care: Nan Goldin and Andres Serrano’s Post-mortem Photography.'' Doctoral thesis (Birkbeck, University of London: 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; have all researched this particular area of study. Artists include [[Jeffrey Silverthorne]], [[Hans Danuser]], [[Hannah Wilke]], [[Nick Waplington|Nick Wapping]], British photographer Sue Fox, [[Nan Goldin|Nan Golden]], and [[Andres Serrano]]'s series ''The Morgue.''  Summersgill argues that artists in America in the 1990s used post-mortem photography to fight against the increasing medicalisation of death.&lt;ref&gt;Summersgill, Lauren. “‘Cookie in her Casket’ as a response to the Medical Death”. ''And Death Shall Have Dominion: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Dying, Caregivers, Death, Mourning, and the Bereaved,'' eds. K. Malecka and R. Gibbs. (London: Interdisciplinary Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal post-mortem photography is considered to be largely private, with the exception of the public circulation of stillborn children in the charity website ''Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nowilaymedowntosleep.org/|title=Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the controversial rise of funeral selfies on phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/are-funeral-selfies-bad-2016-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Should You Take Funeral Selfies?|last=Fussell|first=Sidney|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Evolving style==
[[Image:Bishop-Syria.jpg|thumb|Syrian [[bishop]] seated in state at his funeral (ca. 1945).]]
Jay Ruby’s analysis of various styles in post-mortem photography – particularly the poses of the deceased – argued that key poses reflected cultural attitudes toward death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ruby argued for the dominance of the ‘Last Sleep’ pose in the first forty years of post-mortem portraiture. In the ‘Last Sleep’ the deceased’s eyes are closed and they lay as though in repose, which Ruby argued reflected the American desire to associate death with sleep.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another popular arrangement was to have the deceased  presented seated in a chair or arranged in a portrait to mimic life because  these photographs would serve as their last social presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Edwards |first=Elizabeth |year=2005 |chapter=Post-mortem and memorial photography |editor1-last=Lenman |editor1-first=Robin |editor2-last=Nicholsen |editor2-first=Angela |title=The Oxford Companion to the Photograph |isbn=978-0-19-866271-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Victorian era it was not uncommon to photograph deceased young children or newborns in the arms of their mother.  The inclusion of the mother, it has been argued, encourages one to see through the mother's eyes: "The desire to see through the mother’s eyes, and even identify with such pain would have been more potent at the time, when the daguerreotype would be shown to friends and family who might have known the child and certainly knew the family."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summersgill|first=Lauren|date=2015|title=Family Expressions of Pain in Postmortem Portraiture|url=http://journalonarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SVACij-Vol2_No1_2015-Summersgill-Pain-and-Portrait.pdf|journal=Studies in Visual Arts and Communication: an international journal|volume=2|pages=|via=Journal On Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Post-mortem photograph of young child with flowers.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth-century photograph of a deceased child with flowers{{according to whom|date=April 2016}}]]

While some images (especially [[tintype]]s and [[ambrotype]]s) have a rosy tint added to the cheeks of the corpse, it is untrue that metal stands and other devices were used to pose the dead as though they were living.&lt;ref name="The Myth of the Stand Alone Corpse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dealer042.wix.com/post-mortem-photos |title=The Myth of the Stand Alone Corpse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use by photographers of a stand or arm rest (sometimes referred to as a [[Mathew Brady|Brady stand]]), which aided living persons to remain still long enough for the camera's lengthy exposure time, has given rise to this myth. While 19th-century people may have wished their loved ones to look their best in a memorial photograph, evidence of a metal stand should be understood as proof that the subject was a living person.&lt;ref name="The Myth of the Stand Alone Corpse"/&gt;

Later photographic examples  show the subject in a coffin. Some very late examples show the deceased in a coffin with a large group of funeral attendees; this type of photograph was especially popular in Europe and less common in the United States.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Photography and Death|last=Linkman|first=Audrey|publisher=Reaktion|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, post-mortem photography is still practised and is common in America among women who experienced [[stillbirth]]; commemorated on websites such as "Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nowilaymedowntosleep.org|title=Homepage - Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep|website=Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep|language=en-US|access-date=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of mother holding child was also common in the Victorian era when death of infants was common.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secure the Shadow: Death and Photography in America|last=Ruby|first=Jay|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs, especially depicting persons who were considered to be very holy lying in their coffins, are still circulated among faithful Eastern Catholic, [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secure the shadow|last=Ruby|first=Jay|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other cultures ==
===Iceland===

It is believed that the post-mortem photography died out in the Nordic countries around 1940. When examining [[Iceland]]'s culture surrounding death, it is concluded that the nation held death as an important and significant companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03087298.1999.10443798|title=History of Photography. Post-mortem and funeral photography in Iceland, History of Photography, 23:1, 49–54,|date=2005|access-date=July 31, 2016|doi=10.1080/03087298.1999.10443798|volume=23|journal=History of Photography|pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of the nineteenth century, the country's infant mortality rate was higher than the rest of European countries. Consequently, death was a public topic that was considerably seen through Icelanders' religious lenses. There are many that believe Iceland's attitudes about post-mortem photography can be drawn out from its earlier attitudes about death. In the early 1900s, it wasn't uncommon to read a local newspaper's obituary section and find detailed information regarding an individual's death, including instances where suicide occurred. How post-mortem photography began in Iceland remains uncertain, but these photographs can be traced to the late nineteenth century.

===United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland===

Post-mortem photography was particularly popular in Victorian Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Victorians: Photographic Portraits|last=Linkman|first=Audrey|publisher=Tauris Parke Books|year=1993|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1860-1910, these Post-mortem portraits were much like American portraits in style, focusing on the deceased either displayed as asleep or with the family; often these images were placed in family albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linkman|first=Audrey|date=2006|title=Taken from Life: Post-Mortem Portraiture in Britain 1860-1910|url=|journal=History of Photography: An International Quarterly|volume=30|pages=309-347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study has often been mixed with American traditions, because the two are so similar.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

He served as president of [[Miami University]] of Ohio from 1868 to 1871. He also served as president of [[Oakland College (Lorman, Mississippi)|Oakland College]] in Mississippi.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Robert Lodowick Stanton was born on March 28, 1810, in [[Preston, Connecticut]], the son of Joseph Stanton and Susan M. Brewster. His father manufactured woolen goods and traded with the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Stanton, Henry Brewster|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert's older brother was [[Henry Brewster Stanton]], who became a journalist and abolitionist, publishing widely in New York and abolitionist newspapers, and lecturing on the abolitionist circuit. He married [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Cady]], who became a leader on issues of temperance, women's rights and suffrage, as well as abolition.

Robert Stanton graduated from the [[Lane Seminary]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and earned his D.D. degree from [[Princeton University]].

===Career===
He became the pastor of churches in [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Ohio]]. He served as the second president of [[Oakland College (Lorman, Mississippi)|Oakland College]] in [[Lorman, Mississippi]] from 1851 to 1854; it was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi'', Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing, 1999, Part 1, p. 310 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eMX-Snn_mEsC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=Rev.+Joseph+Calvin+mississippi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lN0FbhXU7H&amp;sig=WkU3LHjQMxd_z7GHYEr33dPjUUc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eF9MVLysGoKwmwXowYCgBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rev.%20Joseph%20Calvin%20mississippi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic philosophy}}
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' defines [[virtue]] as "a habitual and firm disposition to do the [[good]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#461/z Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1803]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the '''seven Christian virtues''' or '''heavenly virtues''' combine the four classical [[cardinal virtues]] of [[prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[courage]] (or fortitude) with the three [[theological virtues]] of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. These were adopted by the [[Church Fathers]] as the seven virtues.

==Cardinal virtues==
{{Main|Cardinal virtues}}
The Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], regarded temperance, wisdom, justice, and courage as the four most desirable character traits. The [[Book of Wisdom]] is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books]] included in the [[Septuagint]]. Wisdom 8:7 states that the fruits of Wisdom "...are virtues; For she teaches moderation and prudence, justice and fortitude, and nothing in life is more useful for men than these."

The moral virtues are attitudes, dispositions, and good habits that govern one's actions, passions, and conduct according to reason; and are acquired by human effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#461/z CCC §1804]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] said, "Virtue is the moral strength of the will in obeying the dictates of duty".&lt;ref name=Rickaby&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm Rickaby, John. "Fortitude." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.

* '''Prudence''' from {{lang|la|prudentia}} meaning "seeing ahead, sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''Auriga virtutum'' (the charioteer of the virtues) as it guides the other virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#462/z CCC §1806]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Justice''' is the virtue which regulates man in his dealings with others. Connected to justice are the virtues of [[Religion (virtue)|religion]], piety, and gratitude. &lt;ref name=Waldron&gt;{{catholic|title=Virtue|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm|last=Waldron|firtst=Martin Augustine|volume=15|year=1912|accessdate=6 April 2017|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fortitude''' which [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranks third after prudence and justice and equates with brave endurance.&lt;ref name=Rickaby/&gt; Patience and perseverance are virtues related to fortitude.
* '''Temperance''' is the virtue which moderates in accordance with reason the desires and pleasures of the sensuous appetite. Related to temperance are the virtues of continence, humility, and meekness.&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

Philosophers recognized the interrelatedness of the virtues such that courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness. Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (''prudentia'') and moral virtue. This is frequently termed "the Unity of the Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Annas, Julia. ''The Morality of Happiness'' (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 73–84&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also argued that it not only matters what a person does but how the person does it. The person must aim at a good end and also make a right choice about the means to that end. The moral virtues direct the person to aim at a good end, but to ensure that the person make the right choices about the means to a good end, one needs practical wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics'', Book VI, Lecture XI, ##1279–1280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological virtues==
{{Main|Theological virtues}}
The traditional understanding of the differences in the natures of Cardinal and Theological virtues, is that the latter are not fully accessible to humans in their natural state without assistance from God. "All virtues have as their final scope to dispose man to acts conducive to his true happiness. The happiness, however, of which man is capable is twofold, namely, natural, which is attainable by man's natural powers, and supernatural, which exceeds the capacity of unaided human nature. Since, therefore, merely natural principles of human action are inadequate to a supernatural end, it is necessary that man be endowed with supernatural powers to enable him to attain his final destiny. Now these supernatural principles are nothing else than the theological virtues."&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

==Seven virtues and the seven capital sins==

A list of seven virtues that oppose the [[seven deadly sins]] appeared later in an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] titled  ''[[Psychomachia]]'', or ''Battle/Contest of the Soul''. Written by [[Prudentius|Aurelius Clemens Prudentius]], a Christian governor who died around 410 AD, it entails the battle between good virtues and evil [[vice]]s. The enormous popularity of this work in the [[Middle Ages]] helped to spread the concept of holy virtue throughout [[Europe]].

After Pope Gregory released his list of seven deadly sins in 590 AD, the seven virtues became identified as [[chastity]], [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[diligence]], [[patience]], [[kindness]], and [[humility]]. Practicing them is said to protect one against [[temptation]] from the seven deadly sins.

It should be noted, however, that these seven virtues do not correspond to the seven heavenly virtues arrived at by combining the cardinal and theological virtues.  Furthermore, efforts in the Middle Ages to set the seven heavenly virtues in direct opposition to the seven capital sins are both uncommon and beset with difficulties. “[T]reatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Bejczy |first1= István P. |title= The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century |date=2011|publisher= Brill |location=Boston|pages=228, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And there are problems with this parallelism.
{{quote|The opposition between the virtues and the vices to which these works allude despite the frequent inclusion of other schemes may seem unproblematic at first sight.  The virtues and the vices seem to mirror each other as positive and negative moral attitudes, so that medieval authors, with their keen predilection for parallels and oppositions, could conveniently set them against each other. . . . Yet artistic representations such as Conrad’s trees are misleading in that they establish oppositions between the principal virtues and the capital vices which are based on mere juxtaposition.  As to content, the two schemes do not match each other.  The capital vices of lust and avarice, for instance, contrast with the remedial virtues of chastity and generosity, respectively, rather than with any theological or cardinal virtue; conversely, the virtues of hope and prudence are opposed to despair and foolishness rather than to any deadly sin.  Medieval moral authors were well aware of the fact.  Actually, the capital vices are more often contrasted with the remedial or contrary virtues in medieval moral literature than with the principal virtues, while the principal virtues are frequently accompanied by a set of mirroring vices rather than by the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;Bejczy, 2011, pp. 232-33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Sirolimus''', also known as '''rapamycin''', is a [[macrolide]] compound that is used  to coat [[coronary stent]]s, prevent [[organ rejection|organ transplant rejection]] and to treat a rare lung disease called [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]].&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vezi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vézina C, Kudelski A, Sehgal SN | title = Rapamycin (AY-22,989), a new antifungal antibiotic.

It inhibits activation of [[T cells]] and [[B cells]] by reducing their sensitivity to [[interleukin-2]] (IL-2) through [[mTOR]] inhibition.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_2009" /&gt;

It is produced by the [[bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Streptomyces hygroscopicus]]'' and was isolated for the first time in 1972 by [[Surendra Nath Sehgal]] and colleagues from samples of ''Streptomyces hygroscopicus'' found on [[Easter Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seto B | title = Rapamycin and mTOR: a serendipitous discovery and implications for breast cancer | journal = Clinical and Translational Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 29 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23369283 | pmc = 3561035 | doi = 10.1186/2001-1326-1-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RapamycinOrigin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pritchard DI | title = Sourcing a chemical succession for cyclosporin from parasites and human pathogens | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 688–91 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15896681 | doi = 10.1016/S1359-6446(05)03395-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui.&lt;ref name="Vezi" /&gt; Sirolimus was initially developed as an [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agent. However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties due to its [[mTOR inhibitors|ability to inhibit mTOR]]. It was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name '''Rapamune''' by [[Pfizer]] (formerly by [[Wyeth]]).

==Medical uses==

Sirolimus is [[Indication (medicine)|indicated]] for the [[prophylaxis|prevention]] of [[organ rejection|organ transplant rejection]] and for the treatment of [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]] (LAM).&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

===Prevention of transplant rejection===
{{See also|Organ rejection|Immunosuppression#Deliberately induced}}
The chief advantage sirolimus has over [[calcineurin inhibitor]]s is its low toxicity toward kidneys. Transplant patients maintained on calcineurin inhibitors long-term tend to develop impaired kidney function or even [[Chronic Renal Failure|chronic renal failure]]; this can be avoided by using sirolimus instead. It is particularly advantageous in patients with kidney transplants for [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]], as this disease is likely to recur in the transplanted kidney if a calcineurin-inhibitor is used. However, on 7 October 2008, the FDA approved safety labeling revisions for sirolimus to warn of the risk for decreased renal function associated with its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIyxO5cLEAcC|title=Drug Discovery: Practices, Processes, and Perspectives|last=Li|first=Jie Jack|last2=Corey|first2=E.

Sirolimus can also be used alone, or in conjunction with a [[calcineurin inhibitor]] (such as [[tacrolimus]]), and/or [[mycophenolate mofetil]], to provide steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Impaired wound healing and [[thrombocytopenia]] are a possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in immunosuppression has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukherjee S, Mukherjee U | title = A comprehensive review of immunosuppression used for liver transplantation | journal = Journal of Transplantation | volume = 2009 | pages = 1–20 | date = 2009-01-01 | pmid = 20130772 | pmc = 2809333 | doi = 10.1155/2009/701464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lymphangioleiomyomatosis===
On May 28, 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus to treat [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]] (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to treat this disease.&lt;ref name="FDA_2015" /&gt; LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]]-like cells with mutations of the [[tuberous sclerosis complex]] gene ([[TSC2]]). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic [[growth factor]]s. Sirolimus blocks this pathway.&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

The safety and efficacy of sirolimus treatment of LAM were investigated in [[clinical trial]]s that compared sirolimus treatment with a [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo]] group in 89 patients for 12 months. The patients were observed for 12 months after the treatment had ended. The most commonly reported side effect of sirolimus treatment of LAM were mouth and lip ulcers, [[diarrhea]], abdominal pain, nausea, sore throat, acne, chest pain, leg swelling, [[upper respiratory tract infection]], headache, dizziness, muscle pain and elevated [[cholesterol]]. Serious side effects including hypersensitivity and swelling ([[edema]]) have been observed in [[renal transplant]] patients.&lt;ref name="FDA_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm448523.htm|title=FDA approves Rapamune to treat LAM, a very rare lung disease|last=Pahon|first=Eric | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 28, 2015|website=FDA.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date=1 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While sirolimus was considered for treatment of LAM, it received [[Orphan drug|orphan product]] designation status because LAM is a rare condition. Development for the product was partially supported by the FDA Orphan Products Grants Program, which provides grants for clinical studies on safety and/or effectiveness of products for use in rare diseases or conditions.&lt;ref name="FDA_2015" /&gt;

The safety of LAM treatment by sirolimus in patients younger than 18 years old has not been tested.&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

===Coronary stent coating===
{{further|Drug-eluting stent}}
The antiproliferative effect of sirolimus has also been used in conjunction with [[coronary stent]]s to prevent restenosis in coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty.  The sirolimus is formulated in a polymer coating that affords controlled release through the healing period following coronary intervention.  Several large clinical studies have demonstrated lower restenosis rates in patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stents when compared to bare-metal stents, resulting in fewer repeat procedures. A sirolimus-eluting coronary stent was marketed by [[Cordis (medical)|Cordis]], a division of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], under the tradename [[Cypher stent|Cypher]].&lt;ref name="Cypher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cypherusa.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030427143416/http://www.cypherusa.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2003 |title=Cypher Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent |accessdate=1 April 2008 |publisher=[[Cypher Stent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this kind of stent may also increase the risk of vascular thrombosis.&lt;ref name="Shuchman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shuchman M | title = Trading restenosis for thrombosis?

==Contraindications==
Sirolimus is [[contraindicated]] in individuals with a known [[hypersensitivity]] to the drug.&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse reactions (≥30% occurrence, leading to a 5% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies of organ rejection prophylaxis in individuals with kidney transplants include: [[peripheral edema]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, constipation, [[hypertriglyceridemia]], [[hypertension]], increased [[creatinine]], fever, [[urinary tract infection]], [[anemia]], [[arthralgia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]].&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

The most common adverse reactions (≥20% occurrence, leading to a 11% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis are: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, [[stomatitis]], [[nasopharyngitis]], acne, [[upper respiratory tract infection]], dizziness, and [[myalgia]].&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

===Diabetes-like symptoms===
While sirolimus inhibition of [[mTORC1]] appears to mediate the drug's benefits, it also inhibits [[mTORC2]], which results in diabetes-like symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} This includes decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamming DW, Ye L, Katajisto P, Goncalves MD, Saitoh M, Stevens DM, Davis JG, Salmon AB, Richardson A, Ahima RS, Guertin DA, Sabatini DM, Baur JA | title = Rapamycin-induced insulin resistance is mediated by mTORC2 loss and uncoupled from longevity | journal = Science | volume = 335 | issue = 6076 | pages = 1638–43 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22461615 | pmc = 3324089 | doi = 10.1126/science.1215135 | bibcode = 2012Sci...335.1638L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirolimus treatment may additionally increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston O, Rose CL, Webster AC, Gill JS | title = Sirolimus is associated with new-onset diabetes in kidney transplant recipients | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 1411–8 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18385422 | pmc = 2440303 | doi = 10.1681/ASN.2007111202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mouse studies, these symptoms can be avoided through the use of alternate dosing regimens or [[Substrate analog|analogs]] such as [[everolimus]] or [[temsirolimus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arriola Apelo SI, Neuman JC, Baar EL, Syed FA, Cummings NE, Brar HK, Pumper CP, Kimple ME, Lamming DW | title = Alternative rapamycin treatment regimens mitigate the impact of rapamycin on glucose homeostasis and the immune system | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–38 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26463117 | pmc = 4717280 | doi = 10.1111/acel.12405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowered effectiveness of immune system===
There have been warnings about the use of sirolimus in transplants, where it may increase mortality due to an increased risk of infections.&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=3275b824-3f82-4151-2ab2-0036a9ba0acc|title=RAPAMUNE- sirolimus solution  RAPAMUNE- sirolimus tablet, sugar coated|publisher=DailyMed |website=dailymed.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer risk===
According to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] prescribing information, sirolimus may increase an individual's risk for contracting [[skin cancer]]s from exposure to sunlight or UV radiation, and risk of developing [[lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapamune Prescribing Information|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/021083s058,021110s075lbl.pdf|website=United States Food and Drug Administration|publisher=Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|access-date=28 May 2016|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies, the skin cancer risk under sirolimus was lower than under other immunosuppressants such as [[azathioprine]] and [[calcineurin inhibitor]]s, and lower than under [[placebo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{drugs.com|pro|rapamune}} on Rapamune.

===Impaired wound healing===
Individuals taking sirolimus are at increased risk of experiencing impaired or delayed wound healing, particularly if they have a high [[body mass index]] (i.e., a BMI of ≥30&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

== Interactions ==

Sirolimus is metabolized by the [[CYP3A4]] [[enzyme]] and is a substrate of the [[P-glycoprotein]] (P-gp) [[efflux pump]]; hence, inhibitors of either protein may increase sirolimus concentrations in [[blood plasma]], whereas inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations in blood plasma.&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt;

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
{{See also|mTOR inhibitors}}
Unlike the similarly named [[tacrolimus]], sirolimus is not a [[calcineurin inhibitor]], but it has a similar suppressive effect on the immune system. Sirolimus inhibits IL-2 and other cytokine receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on [[mTOR]], and thereby blocks activation of [[T cell|T]] and [[B cell]]s. Ciclosporin and tacrolimus inhibit the secretion of IL-2, by inhibiting [[calcineurin]].&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_2009" /&gt;

The mode of action of sirolimus is to bind the [[cytosol]]ic protein [[FKBP|FK-binding protein 12]] (FKBP12) in a manner similar to tacrolimus. Unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex, which inhibits calcineurin (PP2B), the sirolimus-FKBP12 complex inhibits the [[mammalian target of rapamycin|mTOR]] (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin, rapamycin being another name for sirolimus) pathway by directly binding to mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_2009" /&gt;

mTOR has also been called FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein), RAFT (rapamycin and FKBP target), RAPT1, or SEP.  The earlier names FRAP and RAFT were coined to reflect the fact that sirolimus must bind FKBP12 first, and only the FKBP12-sirolimus complex can bind mTOR. However, mTOR is now the widely accepted name, since Tor was first discovered via genetic and molecular studies of sirolimus-resistant mutants of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' that identified FKBP12, Tor1, and Tor2 as the targets of sirolimus and provided robust support that the FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits Tor1 and Tor2.&lt;ref name="Heitman_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heitman J, Movva NR, Hall MN | title = Targets for cell cycle arrest by the immunosuppressant rapamycin in yeast | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5022 | pages = 905–9 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1715094 | doi = 10.1126/science.1715094 | bibcode = 1991Sci...253..905H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_2009" /&gt;

===Pharmacokinetics===

Sirolimus is metabolized by the [[CYP3A4]] [[enzyme]] and is a substrate of the [[P-glycoprotein]] (P-gp) [[efflux pump]].&lt;ref name="Rapamune Rx info" /&gt; It has an [[elimination half-life]] of 57–63&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="Pubchem Rapamycin" /&gt;

The absorption of sirolimus into the blood stream from the intestine varies widely between patients, with some patients having up to eight times more exposure than others for the same dose. Drug levels are, therefore, taken to make sure patients get the right dose for their condition.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee_2009" /&gt; This is determined by taking a blood sample before the next dose, which gives the trough level. However, good correlation is noted between trough concentration levels and drug exposure, known as area under the concentration-time curve, for both sirolimus (SRL) and tacrolimus (TAC) (SRL: r2 = 0.83; TAC: r2 = 0.82), so only one level need be taken to know its [[pharmacokinetic]] (PK) profile. PK profiles of SRL and of TAC are unaltered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected drug exposure of TAC correlates with SRL (r2 = 0.8), so patients have similar bioavailability of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McAlister VC, Mahalati K, Peltekian KM, Fraser A, MacDonald AS | title = A clinical pharmacokinetic study of tacrolimus and sirolimus combination immunosuppression comparing simultaneous to separated administration | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 346–50 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12021624 | doi = 10.1097/00007691-200206000-00004 | url = http://journals.lww.com/drug-monitoring/Abstract/2002/06000/A_Clinical_Pharmacokinetic_Study_of_Tacrolimus_and.4.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=August 2016}}

===Biosynthesis===
The [[biosynthesis]] of the rapamycin core is accomplished by a type I [[polyketide synthase]] (PKS) in conjunction with a [[nonribosomal peptide synthetase]] (NRPS). The domains responsible for the [[biosynthesis]] of the linear [[polyketide]] of rapamycin are organized into three multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, which contain a total of 14 modules (figure 1). The three multienzymes are organized such that the first four modules of polyketide chain elongation are in RapA, the following six modules for continued elongation are in RapB, and the final four modules to complete the [[biosynthesis]] of the linear polyketide are in RapC.&lt;ref name=Rapamycin_domains_and_primary_genes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwecke T, Aparicio JF, Molnár I, König A, Khaw LE, Haydock SF, Oliynyk M, Caffrey P, Cortés J, Lester JB | title = The biosynthetic gene cluster for the polyketide immunosuppressant rapamycin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 17 | pages = 7839–43 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7644502 | pmc = 41241 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.17.7839 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.7839S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the linear [[polyketide]] is modified by the NRPS, RapP, which attaches L-pipecolate to the terminal end of the polyketide, and then cyclizes the molecule, yielding the unbound product, prerapamycin.&lt;ref name=prerapamycin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory MA, Gaisser S, Lill RE, Hong H, Sheridan RM, Wilkinson B, Petkovic H, Weston AJ, Carletti I, Lee HL, Staunton J, Leadlay PF | title = Isolation and characterization of pre-rapamycin, the first macrocyclic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the immunosuppressant rapamycin by S. hygroscopicus | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 43 | issue = 19 | pages = 2551–3 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15127450 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200453764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core [[macrocycle]], prerapamycin (figure 2), is then modified (figure 3) by an additional five enzymes, which lead to the final product, rapamycin. First, the core macrocycle is modified by RapI, SAM-dependent O-methyltransferase (MTase), which O-methylates at C39. Next, a carbonyl is installed at C9 by RapJ, a [[cytochrome P-450]] monooxygenases (P-450). Then, RapM, another MTase, O-methylates at C16. Finally, RapN, another P-450, installs a hydroxyl at C27 immediately followed by O-methylation by Rap Q, a distinct MTase, at C27 to yield rapamycin.&lt;ref name=Rapamycin_genes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory MA, Hong H, Lill RE, Gaisser S, Petkovic H, Low L, Sheehan LS, Carletti I, Ready SJ, Ward MJ, Kaja AL, Weston AJ, Challis IR, Leadlay PF, Martin CJ, Wilkinson B, Sheridan RM | title = Rapamycin biosynthesis: Elucidation of gene product function | journal = Organic &amp; Biomolecular Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = 19 | pages = 3565–8 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16990929 | doi = 10.1039/b608813a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biosynthetic [[genes]] responsible for rapamycin synthesis have been identified. As expected, three extremely large [[open reading frames]] (ORF's) designated as ''rapA'', ''rapB'', and ''rapC'' encode for three extremely large and complex multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, respectively.&lt;ref name=Rapamycin_domains_and_primary_genes /&gt; The [[gene]] ''rapL'' has been established to code for a [[NAD+]]-dependent [[lysine]] cycloamidase, which converts L-[[lysine]] to L-[[pipecolic acid]] (figure 4) for incorporation at the end of the polyketide.&lt;ref name=rapamycin_report&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graziani EI | title = Recent advances in the chemistry, biosynthesis and pharmacology of rapamycin analogs | journal = Natural Product Reports | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 602–9 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19387497 | doi = 10.1039/b804602f }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gatto GJ, Boyne MT, Kelleher NL, Walsh CT | title = Biosynthesis of pipecolic acid by RapL, a lysine cyclodeaminase encoded in the rapamycin gene cluster | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 11 | pages = 3838–47 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16536560 | doi = 10.1021/ja0587603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[gene]] ''rapP'', which is embedded between the PKS genes and translationally coupled to ''rapC'', encodes for an additional [[enzyme]], an NPRS responsible for incorporating L-pipecolic acid, [[chain termination]] and cyclization of prerapamycin. In addition, genes ''rapI'', ''rapJ'', ''rapM'', ''rapN'', ''rapO'', and ''rapQ'' have been identified as coding for tailoring enzymes that modify the macrocyclic core to give rapamycin (figure 3). Finally, ''rapG'' and ''rapH'' have been identified to code for enzymes that have a positive regulatory role in the preparation of rapamycin through the control of rapamycin PKS gene expression.&lt;ref name=rapG_rapH&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aparicio JF, Molnár I, Schwecke T, König A, Haydock SF, Khaw LE, Staunton J, Leadlay PF | title = Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for rapamycin in Streptomyces hygroscopicus: analysis of the enzymatic domains in the modular polyketide synthase | journal = Gene | volume = 169 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–16 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8635756 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00800-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle begins as the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which is derived from the shikimate pathway.&lt;ref name=Rapamycin_domains_and_primary_genes /&gt; Note that the [[cyclohexane]] ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of [[Claisen condensation]]s with [[malonyl]] or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an [[acyl carrier protein]] (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive [[condensation]], the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to [[redox|reduce]] and [[dehydrate]] it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS [[enzymes]] through [[methylation]]s by MTases and [[oxidation]]s by P-450s to yield rapamycin.

A [[combination therapy]] of [[doxorubicin]] and sirolimus has been shown to drive [[AKT]]-positive lymphomas into [[remission (medicine)|remission]] in mice. Akt signalling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the [[cytotoxic]] effects of [[chemotherapy]] drugs, such as [[doxorubicin]] or [[cyclophosphamide]]. Sirolimus blocks Akt signalling and the cells lose their resistance to the chemotherapy.

===Tuberous sclerosis complex===
Sirolimus also shows promise in treating [[tuberous sclerosis complex]] (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and [[angiomyolipomas]] in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth's Rapamune) and [[everolimus]] (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance | date = October 2009 | title = Current Clinical Trials | accessdate = 14 October 2009 | url = http://www.tsalliance.org/pages.aspx?content=370 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122192859/http://tsalliance.org/pages.aspx?content=370 | archivedate = 22 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies thus far have noted that tumors often regrew when treatment stopped.{{mcn|date=May 2016}}

[[Tuberous sclerosis|Facial angiofibromas]] occur in 80% of patients with TSC, and the condition is very disfiguring. A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical sirolimus treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began during the early stages of the disease. Sirolimus treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, gel, solution, and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of perioral dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases of irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balestri R, Neri I, Patrizi A, Angileri L, Ricci L, Magnano M | title = Analysis of current data on the use of topical rapamycin in the treatment of facial angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis complex  | journal = Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–20 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25174683 | doi = 10.1111/jdv.12665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on longevity===
[[mTOR]], specifically mTOR1, was first shown to be important in aging in 2003, in a study on worms; sirolimus was shown to inhibit and slow aging in worms, yeast, and flies, and then to improve the condition of [[mouse model]]s of various diseases of aging.&lt;ref name=Apelo2016rev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arriola Apelo SI, Lamming DW | title = Rapamycin: An InhibiTOR of Aging Emerges From the Soil of Easter Island | journal = The Journals of Gerontology.

In contrast to the immunosuppressive effects found in long-term high dosing, a study combining low-dose [[Everolimus]] (a rapamycin analog) and [[Dactolisib]] for a single 6 week course followed by influenza vaccination in healthy elderly patients (&gt;65 years of age) found that this combination significantly reduced the number of infections reported by participants relative to placebo (from 2.41 to 1.49 infections per person per year), increased the serological response by more than 20%, did not produce any excess events of hyperglycemia or hypercholesteremia (associated with mTORC2 inhibition) and was generally well tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mannick JB, Morris M, Hockey HP, Roma G, Beibel M, Kulmatycki K, Watkins M, Shavlakadze T, Zhou W, Quinn D, Glass DJ, Klickstein LB | title = TORC1 inhibition enhances immune function and reduces infections in the elderly | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 449 | pages = eaaq1564 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29997249 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaq1564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapamycin has complex effects on the immune system—while [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] goes up and [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] decreases, which suggests an immunostimulatory response, [[Tumor necrosis factor superfamily|TNF]] and [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] are decreased, which suggests an immunosuppressive response.

===Lupus===
As of 2016 studies in cells, animals, and humans have suggested that mTOR activation as process underlying [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin may be a disease-modifying treatment.&lt;ref name=Oaks2016rev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oaks Z, Winans T, Huang N, Banki K, Perl A | title = Activation of the Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin in SLE: Explosion of Evidence in the Last Five Years | journal = Current Rheumatology Reports | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 73 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27812954 | pmc = 5314949 | doi = 10.1007/s11926-016-0622-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016 rapamycin had been tested in small clinical trials in people with lupus.&lt;ref name=Oaks2016rev/&gt;

Each fusion protein also contains additional domains that are brought into proximity when rapamycin induces binding of FRB and FKBP. In this way, rapamycin can be used to control and study protein localization and interactions.

[[Image:SlowFoodThera06676.JPG|thumb|300px|A [[slow food]] restaurant placard in [[Santorini]], [[Greece]].]]

The '''slow movement''' (sometimes capitalised '''Slow movement''' or '''Slow Movement''') advocates a cultural shift toward slowing down life's pace. It began with [[Carlo Petrini]]'s protest against the opening of a [[McDonald's]] restaurant in [[Piazza di Spagna]], [[Rome]] in 1986 that sparked the creation of the [[slow food]] movement. Over time, this developed into a [[subculture]] in other areas, like the [[Cittaslow]] organisation for "slow cities". The "slow" [[epithet]] has subsequently been applied to a variety of activities and aspects of culture.

Geir Berthelsen and his creation of The World Institute of Slowness&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theworldinstituteofslowness.com The World Institute of Slowness]&lt;/ref&gt; presented a vision in 1999 for an entire "slow planet" and a need to teach the world the way of slowness. [[Carl Honoré]]'s 2004 book, ''In Praise of Slowness'', first explored how the Slow philosophy might be applied in every field of human endeavour and coined the phrase "slow movement". The ''[[Financial Times]]'' said the book is "to the Slow Movement what ''[[Das Kapital]]'' is to communism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://howtospendit.ft.com/art/1032-a-craft-exhibition-thats-moving-slowly-around-the-country Lucia van der Post (27 January 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Honoré describes the Slow Movement thus:

"It is a cultural revolution against the notion that faster is always better. The Slow philosophy is not about doing everything at a [[snail]]'s pace. It's about seeking to do everything at the right speed. Savoring the hours and minutes rather than just counting them. Doing everything as well as possible, instead of as fast as possible. It’s about quality over quantity in everything from work to food to parenting." —&amp;thinsp;Reda.{{cite quote|date=December 2013}}

Professor [[Guttorm Fløistad]] summarises the philosophy, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The only thing for certain is that everything changes. The rate of change increases. If you want to hang on you better speed up. That is the message of today.  It could however be useful to remind everyone that our basic  needs never change. The need to be seen and appreciated!  It is the need to belong. The need for nearness and care, and for a little love! This is given only through slowness in human relations.  In order to master changes, we have to recover slowness, reflection and togetherness. There we will find real renewal."{{cite quote|date=December 2013}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The slow movement is not organised and controlled by a single organisation. A fundamental characteristic of the slow movement is that it is propounded, and its momentum maintained, by individuals who constitute the expanding global community of Slow. Its popularity has grown considerably since the rise of [[slow food]] and Cittaslow in [[Europe]], with slowness initiatives spreading as far as [[Australia]] and [[Japan]].{{Clear}}

''Slow [[ageing]]'' (or ''slow aging'') is a scientifically backed and distinct approach to [[successful ageing]], advocating a personal and wholly encompassing positive choice to the process of [[ageing]].&lt;ref name=FLSA&gt;{{cite book|title=Fast Living Slow Ageing|author=Kate Marie &amp; Christopher Thomas|publisher=Mileage Media|date=November 10, 2009|ISBN=9780980633900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GY&gt;{{cite book|title=Growth Youthful|author=David Niven Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established as part of the broader slow movement in the 1980s,&lt;ref name=FLSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=GY/&gt; as opposed to the interventionist-based and commercially backed medical [[anti-aging]] system, it involves personal ownership and non-medical intervention options in gaining potential natural [[life extension]].&lt;ref name="FLSA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GY"/&gt; 

== Cinema ==
{{main|Slow cinema}}

''[[Slow cinema]]'' is a [[cinematography]] style which derives from the [[art film]] genre and which consists in conveying a sense of calculated slowness to the viewer. Slow films often consist of a resistance to movement and emotion, a lack of causality and a devotion to realism.&lt;ref&gt;https://kar.kent.ac.uk/43155/1/Screening.Boredom.Caglayan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually obtained through the use of long takes, minimalist acting, slow or inexistent camera movements, unconventional use of music and sparse editing. Well-known slow cinema directors are [[Béla Tarr]], [[Nuri Bilge Ceylan]], [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Tsai Ming-Liang]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Theo Angelopoulos]].

== Cittaslow ==
{{Main|Cittaslow}}
The goal of the [[Cittaslow]] organisation is to resist the homogenisation and [[globalisation]] of towns and cities. It seeks to improve the quality and enjoyment of living by encouraging happiness and self-determination.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Counseling ==
Recent technological advances have resulted in a fast-paced style of living. ''Slow [[Counseling|counselors]]'' understand that many clients are seeking ways to reduce stress and cultivate a more balanced approach to life. Developed by Dr. Randy Astramovich and Dr. Wendy Hoskins and rooted in the slow movement, slow counseling offers counselors a wellness focused foundation for addressing the time urgency and stress often reported by clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&amp;context=jice "Slow Counseling: Promoting Wellness in a Fast World"],  ''Journal for International Counselor Education'' (2012) Volume 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
{{main|Slow fashion}}
The term ''slow fashion'' was coined by Kate Fletcher in 2007 (Centre for Sustainable Fashion, UK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/28b5b36bec7ba32bc125744b004b97d0/a97ef79c5d4af3cec125774c004d6240!OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,slow*,fashion*Slow Fashion:Tailoring a Strategic Approach Towards Sustainability] by  Maureen Dickson, Carlotta Cataldi, and Crystal Grover&lt;/ref&gt;  "Slow fashion is not a seasonal trend that comes and goes like animal print, but a sustainable fashion movement that is gaining momentum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slowfashioned.com/about What is Slow Fashion?] by  Jessica Bourland, Slow Fashioned&lt;/ref&gt;

The slow fashion style is based on the same principles of the slow food movement, as the alternative to mass-produced clothing (also known as [[fast fashion]]). Initially, The slow clothing movement was intended to reject all mass-produced clothing, referring only to clothing made by hand,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131214112955/http://www.groovygreen.com/groove/?p=2274%2F Slow Clothing] by Sharon Astyk, groovy green&lt;/ref&gt; but has broadened to include many interpretations and is practiced in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abitslow.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/slow-fashion-101/ Slow Fashion 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of slow fashion practices include:
* Opposing and boycotting mass-produced "fast fashion" or "McFashion".
* Choosing artisan products to support smaller businesses, fair trade and locally-made clothes.
* Buying [[secondhand]] or vintage clothing and donating unwanted garments.
* Choosing clothing made with sustainable, ethically-made or recycled fabrics.
* Choosing quality garments that will last longer, transcend trends (a "classic" style), and be repairable.
* [[Do it yourself|Doing it yourself]] - making, mending, customising, altering, and up-cycling one's own clothing.
* Slowing the rate of fashion consumption: buying fewer clothes less often.

The slow fashion ethos is a unified representation of all the "sustainable", "eco", "green", and "ethical" fashion movements.  It encourages education about the garment industry's connection and impact on the environment and depleting resources, slowing of the supply chain to reduce the number of trends and seasons, to encourage quality production, and return greater value to garments removing the image of disposability of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notjustalabel.com/articles/slow_fashion "Slow Fashion"] by  Maureen Dickson, Carlotta Cataldi, and Crystal Grover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lousagar.blogspot.com/2011/01/slow-fashion-is-not-trend-its-movement.html Slow Fashion is not a Trend]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Elizabeth L. (2012) ''Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion''. Penguin Group. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A key phrase repeatedly heard in reference to slow fashion is "quality over quantity".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} This phrase is used to summarise the basic principles of slowing down the rate of clothing consumption by choosing garments that last longer.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Food ==
{{Main|Slow Food}}
Opposed to the culture of [[fast food]], the sub-movement known as ''[[slow food]]'' seeks to encourage the enjoyment of [[Local food|regional produce]], traditional foods, which are often grown [[Organic food|organically]] and to enjoy these foods in the company of others. It aims to defend agricultural biodiversity.

The movement claims 83,000 members in 50 countries, which are organised into 800 ''Convivia'' or local chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/mighty-appetite/2008/08/whats_slow_food_anyway.html "What's Slow Food, Anyway?"], ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes operating under a logo of a snail, the collective philosophy is to preserve and support traditional ways of life. Today, 42 states in the United States have their own ''convivium''.

In 2004, representatives from food communities in more than 150 countries met in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], under the umbrella of the [[Terra Madre]] (Mother Earth) network.

== Gardening ==
{{Main|Slow gardening}}

''[[Slow gardening]]'' is an approach that helps gardeners savor what they grow using all their senses through all the seasons. It is not about being lazy; rather it is aimed at getting more out of what they do.

== Goods ==
''Slow goods'' takes its core direction from various elements of the overall slow movement and applying it to the concept, design and manufacturing of physical objects. It focuses on low production runs, the usage of craftspeople within the process and on-shore manufacturing. Proponents of this philosophy seek and collaborate with smaller, local supply and service partners.

Slow goods practitioners must have those tenets baked into their business model, it must be the top driver in the procurement of sustainable materials and manufacturing techniques. The rationale for this local engagement facilitates the assurance of quality, the revitalisation of local manufacturing industries and reduces greatly the footprint related to the shipment of goods across regions of land and or water.

Again, quality always supersedes quantity. The genesis of a product is becoming more of concern for consumers. Some companies have now woven this philosophy into their corporate structure. The source of a product and its parts has become increasingly more important.

Physical goods affected by the slow movement represent much diversity, including architecture and building design. The slow movement is affecting the concept and planning stages of commercial buildings, chiefly LEED certified projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slowdesign.org/ Slow Design in Building Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

This movement seeks to break current conventions of perpetuating the disposable nature of mass production. By using higher-quality materials and craftsmanship, items attain a longer lifespan that harkens back to manufacturing golden era of the past.

== Living ==
{{Main|Slow living}}
''[[Slow living]]'' is a lifestyle choice. Authors Beth Meredith and Eric Storm summarize slow living as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slow Living means structuring your life around meaning and fulfillment. Similar to "voluntary simplicity" and "downshifting," it emphasizes a less-is-more approach, focusing on the quality of your life. ... Slow Living addresses the desire to lead a more balanced life and to pursue a more holistic sense of well-being in the fullest sense of the word.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In order to embrace the benefits of Slow Living we should start with daily mundane tasks. For example when we brush our teeth, take a bath we are normally distracted and focus is to complete that activity as soon as possible. If we do these everyday tasks slowly we will be more mindful and hence we connect more deeply. The degree of joy after doing mundane tasks slowly will be immense and benefits of slow living will slowly creep into our life.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Beth and Storm, Eric.

== Media ==
{{Main|Slow television}}
''[[Slow television|Slow media]]'' (or more specifically ''slow television'') is a movement aiming at sustainable and focused media production as well as [[media consumption]]. It formed in the context of a massive acceleration of news distribution ending in almost realtime digital media such as [[Twitter]]. Beginning in 2010, many local slow media initiatives formed in the USA&lt;ref&gt;[http://slowmedia.typepad.com/ Slow Media Blog] by Jennifer Rauch&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe (Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://slow-media.net/manifesto German Slow Media Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; France, Italy) leading to a high attention in mass-media.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes Magazine, "[https://archive.is/20130123123342/http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/29/media-newspapers-internet-opinions-columnists-trevor-butterworth.html Time for a Slow-Word Movement]"&lt;/ref&gt; Others experiment with a reduction of their daily media intake and log their efforts online ("slow media diet").

== Money ==
{{Main|Slow Money}}

[[Slow Money]] is a specific non-profit organisation, founded to organise investors and donors to steer new sources of capital to small food enterprises, organic farms, and local food systems. Slow Money takes its name from the Slow Food movement. Slow Money aims to develop the relationship between capital markets and place, including social and soil fertility. Slow Money is supporting the grass-roots mobilisation through network building, convening, publishing, and incubating intermediary strategies and structures of funding.

== Parenting ==
{{Main|Slow parenting}}

[[Slow parenting]] encourages parents to plan less for their children, allowing them to explore the world at their own pace. It is a response to hyper-parenting and [[helicopter parent]]ing; the widespread trend for parents to schedule activities and classes after school every day and every weekend, to solve problems on behalf of the children, and to buy commercial services and products. It was described by [[Carl Honoré]] in ''Under Pressure: Rescuing Our Children from the Culture Of Hyper-Parenting''.&lt;ref name="underpressure"&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Pressure: Rescuing Our Children From The Culture Of Hyper-Parenting|first=Carl|last=Honoré|publisher=Orion|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7528-7531-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photography ==
{{Main|Slow photography}}
[[Slow photography]] is a term describing a tendency in today's contemporary [[photography]] and [[visual arts]]. In response to the spread of digital photography and the snapshot, artists and photographers retake manual techniques and working methods to work slower, manually and in constant dialogue with the physical materials of the images.

The term was first introduced by Norwegian photographer, artist and photo educator Johanne Seines Svendsen in the article "The Slow Photography – In Motion", published in the book ''Through a Glass, Darkly'' in January 2013, in collaboration with the North Norwegian Art Center, the Arts Council of Norway, and the Norwegian Photographical Fund.

The term was put into shape in the installation ''The Slow Photography'' at The 67th North Norwegian Art Exhibition, first opened in the city of [[Bodø]] in January 2013. The installation contained five original [[ambrotype]]s and [[alumitype]]s presented in a monter{{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=In a what?}}; and presents contemporary work with the historical photographical process [[wet-plate collodion]] (1851–1880).

== Religion ==
''Slow church'' is a movement in Christian [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] which integrates slow-movement principles into the structure and character of the local church.

== Slow sex ==
See detailed article : [[OneTaste|One Taste]]

== Science ==
{{Main|Slow Science}}
The ''[[slow science]]'' movement's objective is to enable scientists to take the time to think and read. The prevalent culture of science is [[publish or perish]], where scientists are judged to be better if they publish more papers in less time, and only those who do so are able to maintain their careers. Those who practice and promote slow science suggest that "society should give scientists the time they need".&lt;ref&gt;[http://slow-science.org/ ''The Slow Science Academy'', "The Slow Science Manifesto"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The ''slow technology'' approach aims to emphasise that technology can support reflection rather than efficiency. This approach has been discussed through various examples, for example those in interaction design&lt;ref&gt;Hallnäs, Lars and Johan Redström (2001). "Slow Technology: Designing for Reflection", ''Personal Ubiquitous Computing'', 5, 3, pp. 201-212 [http://www.johan.redstrom.se/thesis/pdf/slowtech.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or virtual environments.&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2013). 'Portmanteau Worlds: Hosting Multiple Worldviews in Virtual Environments', in  Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium of Electronic Art, ISEA2013, ed. by Kathy Cleland, Laura Fisher and Ross Harley (Sydney: ISEA International, the Australian Network for Art &amp; Technology, the University of Sydney)[https://www.academia.edu/5185272/Portmanteau_Worlds_Hosting_Multiple_Worldviews_in_Virtual_Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to other parallel efforts such as those towards reflective design,&lt;ref&gt;Sengers, Phoebe, Kirsten Boehner, Shay David and Joseph Kaye (2005). "Reflective Design", in ''Proceedings of the 4th Decennial Conference on Critical Computing: between Sense and Sensibility'', ed. by Olav W. Bertelsen, Niels Olof Bouvin, Peter G. Krogh and Kynd Morten (Aarhus, Denmark: ACM), pp. 49-58 [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/reflectivedesign.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[critical design]] and [[critical technical practice]].

== Travel ==
''Slow travel'' is an evolving movement that has taken its inspiration from nineteenth-century European travel writers, such as [[Théophile Gautier]], who reacted against the cult of speed, prompting some modern analysts to ask "If we have slow food and slow cities, then why not slow travel?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiddeneurope.co.uk/article_info.php?articles_id=633''hidden europe magazine (March 2009)'', "A Manifesto for Slow Travel"]&lt;/ref&gt; Other literary and exploration traditions, from early Arab travellers to late nineteenth-century Yiddish writers, have also identified with slow travel, usually marking its connection with community as its most distinctive feature. Espousing modes of travel that were the norm in some less developed societies became, for some writers and travellers from western Europe such as [[Isabelle Eberhardt]], a way of engaging more seriously with those societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiddeneurope.co.uk/the-warm-shadow-of-isabelle-eberhardt''hidden europe notes (August 2012)'', "The Warm Shadow of Isabelle Eberhardt"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow travel is not only about traveling from one place to another, it is also about immersing oneself in a destination. It consists in staying in the same place for a while to develop a deep connection with it. Frequenting local places, spending time with locals and discovering their habits and customs can turn a regular trip into a slow travel experience. The key is to take one's time and to let oneself be carried along.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barcelonaslowtravel.com/slow-travel/''Slow Travel, Barcelona Slow Travel'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of slow travel argue that all too often the potential pleasure of the journey is lost by too eager anticipation of arrival. Slow travel, it is asserted, is a state of mind which allows travellers to engage more fully with communities along their route, often favouring visits to spots enjoyed by local residents rather than merely following guidebooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slowtraveleurope.eu/index.php?pid=33''Slow Travel Europe'', "The Slow Way"]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, slow travel shares some common values with [[ecotourism]]. Its advocates and devotees generally look for low-impact travel styles, even to the extent of eschewing flying.

Aspects of slow travel, including some of the principles detailed in the "Manifesto for Slow Travel:,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slowtraveleurope.eu/data/downloads/hiddeneurope_25_slowtravel.pdf ''Slow Travel Europe'' (March 2009), "A Manifesto for Slow Travel"]&lt;/ref&gt; are now increasingly featuring in travel writing. The magazine ''Hidden Europe'', which first published the "Manifesto for Slow Travel", has particularly showcased slow travel, featuring articles that focus on unhurried, low-impact journeys and advocating a stronger engagement with communities that lie en route.

A new book series launched in May 2010 by [[Bradt Travel Guides]] explicitly espouses slow travel ideas with volumes that focus very much on local communities within a tightly defined area, often advocating the use of public transport along the way. Titles include ''Bus-pass Britain'', ''Slow Norfolk and Suffolk'', ''Slow Devon and Exmoor'', ''Slow Cotswolds'', ''Slow North Yorkshire'' and ''Slow Sussex and South Downs National Park''.

In the United States, the slow travel movement has engendered renewed interest of historic two-lane roads, including [[U.S. Route 66]], and the [[Lincoln Highway]], both transcontinental roads which are much slower than modern interstate highways.{{disputed inline|date=November 2015|reason=This is ridiculous nonsense; Route 66 has had an enormous enthusiast community dating back to year of its official replacement with the Interstate highway system, obviously pre-dating this "slow movement" stuff, and certainly had nothing to do with "slow travel".}}

==Time poverty==
The principal perspective of the slow movement is to experience life in a fundamentally different way. Adherents believe that the experience of being present leads to what [[Abraham Maslow]] refers to as [[Peak experience]].

The International Institute of Not Doing Much&lt;ref&gt;http://slowdownnow.org&lt;/ref&gt; is a humorous approach to the serious topic of "time poverty", incivility, and workaholism. The Institute’s fictional presence promotes counter-urgency. First created in 2005, SlowDownNow.org is a continually evolving work of art and humor which reports it has over 6,000 members.

'''Sunni Ali''', also known as '''Sunni Ali Ber''', was born '''Ali Kolon'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adeleke|1996|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siiasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Chapter-2-The-Origin-of-the-Sonni.pdf |title=Chapter 2: The Origin of the Sonni |website=siiasi.org |publisher=Sankore Institute of Islamic African Studies International |format=PDF |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[reign]]ed from about 1464 to 1492.  Sunni Ali was the first king of the [[Songhai Empire]], located in Africa and the 15th ruler of the Sunni dynasty. Under Sunni Ali's infantry and cavalry many cities were captured and then fortified, such as [[Timbuktu]] (captured in 1468) and [[Djenné]] (captured in 1475). Sonni conducted a repressive policy against the scholars of [[Timbuktu]], especially those of the [[Sankore]] region who were associated with the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] whom Ali expelled to gain control of the town.

Sunni Ali organized a fleet to patrol the [[Niger river]]. During his reign, Songhai surpassed the height of the [[Mali Empire]], engulfing areas under the Mali Empire (and the [[Ghana Empire]] before it). His death, in late 1492, is a matter of conjecture. According to the ''[[Tarikh al-Sudan]]'', Ali drowned while crossing the Niger River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunwick|1999|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral tradition believes he was killed by his sister's son, [[Askia Mohammad I|Askia Muhammad Ture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunwick|1999|p=100n55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of African historical biography'', Editors Mark R. Lipschutz and R. Kent Rasmussen, (University of California Press, 1986), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his son, [[Sonni Baru]], who was challenged by Askia because Baru was not seen as a faithful Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GX1fNzyNO5AC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Sunni+Baru%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aBLHUoyYF5GM7AbS14G4Cw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sunni%20Baru%22&amp;f=false Towards an Understanding of the African Experience from Historical] By Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam&lt;/ref&gt; Askia succeeded to the throne. According to the ''Tarikh al-Sudan'' it is believed that this action caused Sonni Ali's sister to shout out "Askia!"(forceful one), at the news of this take over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanlegends.info |title=African Legends |publisher=Africanlegends.info |date= |accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni Ali ruled over both urban Muslims and rural non-Muslims at a time when the traditional co-existence of different beliefs was being challenged. His adherence to African [[animism]] while also [[wiktionary:profess|professing]] Islam leads some writers to describe him as ''outwardly'' or ''[[wiktionary:nominal|nominally]]'' Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunwick|1999|p=xxxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jadin Robert Joseph Bell''' (June 4, 1997 – February 3, 2013) was an American youth known for his [[suicide]] which raised the national profile on youth [[bullying]] and [[gay bashing|gay victimization in bullying]].

Bell, a 15-year-old gay youth, was "intensely bullied" both in person and on the [[Cyberbullying|internet]] because he was gay. He was a member of the [[La Grande High School]] [[Cheerleading#High school|cheerleading team]] in [[La Grande, Oregon]], where he was a sophomore. On January 19, 2013, Bell went to a local elementary school and [[suicide by hanging|hanged]] himself from the play structure.&lt;ref name=Toutonghi1 /&gt; He did not immediately die from the strangulation and was rushed to the [[emergency department]], where he was kept on life support.&lt;ref name=Huff1&gt;{{cite news|title=Jadin Bell, Gay Oregon Teen, Taken Off Life Support After Hanging Himself|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/29/jadin-bell-gay-oregon-teen-hanging-suicide-life-support-_n_2576404.html|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] reported that a spokesman for the [[OHSU Hospital]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] announced that after being taken off [[life support]], Bell died on February 3, 2013.&lt;ref name=Huff2&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Jadin Bell Dead: Gay Oregon Teen Who Hanged Himself Dies After Being Taken Off Life Support|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/jadin-bell-dead-gay-oregon-teen-hanging_n_2617909.html|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's death was widely reported in the media, starting discussions about bullying, the effect it has on youth, and gay bullying.

The media reported his suicide stemmed from being bullied for being gay, which Bell's father fully believed, stating: "He was hurting so bad. Just the bullying at school. Yeah there were other issues, but ultimately it was all due to the bullying, for not being accepted for being gay."&lt;ref name=KATU1&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|title=Father killed on walk to honor bullied son who committed suicide|url=http://www.katu.com/news/local/Joe-Bell-killed-on-walk-to-honor-Jadin-Bell-227255411.html|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=KATU|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Bell's death, Oregon LGBTQ activist Alex Horsey stated: "Sometimes, it can be easy to become disconnected to so many stories like Jadin's in the media... Every story (including those not covered by media outlets) has equal importance... It's heartbreaking that Jadin's story has become a reminder of the horrifying consequences of bullying, rather than a story of a young man overcoming adversity and a community changing its ways."&lt;ref name=Rook1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rook|first=Erin|title=Project Believe in Me Founder Speaks Out on Bullying and Suicide|url=http://www.pqmonthly.com/project-believe-in-me-founder-speaks-out-on-bullying-and-suicide/11820|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=PQ Monthly|date=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Bell's death, his father, Joe Bell, planned a cross-country tribute in honor of his son. He planned to walk across the entire continental United States within two years, spreading awareness about bullying and the effects that it can have. Bell resigned from his position at [[Boise Cascade]] and helped launch Faces for Change, a non-profit anti-bullying foundation, to speak in high schools across the U.S. He stated: "Not doing anything is not acceptable. [Those who watch and do nothing] are just as guilty. They are saying that it is acceptable."&lt;ref name=Huff4&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Bell, Father Of Gay Teen Jadin, To Walk Cross-Country With Anti-Bullying Message|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/22/joe-bell-gay-teen-cross-country-walk-_n_3132550.html|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Bell was killed half way through his journey after he was hit by a [[semi-truck]] in Colorado. The driver of the truck, Kenneth Raven, was charged with [[reckless driving]] and may have fallen asleep at the wheel.&lt;ref name=Huff5&gt;{{cite news|last=Nichols|first=James|title=Jadin Bell's Father, Joe Bell, Killed While Walking Cross Country For Tribute To Dead Gay Teen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/10/joe-bell-dead_n_4079989.html|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joe had begun the walk in April 2013 and was killed on October 6, 2013. He was pronounced dead at the scene on the shoulder of [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|US 40]] when authorities arrived.&lt;ref name=Sandell1&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandell|first=Clayton|title=Man Killed on Walk to Highlight Dead Son's Struggle With Bullying|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/10/man-killed-on-walk-to-highlight-dead-sons-struggle-with-bullying/|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholson1&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Kieran|title=Oregon man walking to honor his son hit, killed by truck in Colorado|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24282181/joe-bell-man-walking-son-fatally-hit-colorado|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=Denver Post|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Silbón''' (The whistler) is a legendary figure in [[Venezuela]], associated especially with [[Los Llanos (South America)|Los Llanos]], described as a lost soul. The legend arose sometime in the middle of the 19th century.

According to the legend, the spirit is a youth who murdered and disembowelled his father for killing his wife, saying that she was a “slut”, and that she was asking for it. Afterwards, his grandfather ordered the youth to be tied to a post in the middle of the countryside, and lashed him until his back was destroyed. His wounds were then cleaned with alcohol and he was released with two rabid, starving dogs set upon him. Before releasing him, his grandfather condemned him to carry the bones of his father for all eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leyendas-urbanas.com/el-silbon/|title=El Silbón|access-date=7 April 2016|website=Leyendas Urbanas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/nacionales/leyendas-venezolanas-que-te-dejaran-piel-gallina/|title=Leyendas venezolanas que te dejarán con la piel de gallina  {{!}} Correo del Orinoco|access-date=7 April 2016|website=www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a characteristic whistle that resembles the musical notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B in that order. Rising in tone to F, then lowering to B. It is said that when the whistling sounds close, there's no danger, and the whistler is far away, but when the whistling sounds distant, it means it is nearby. It is also said that hearing the whistling foretells your own death, and you can hear it anywhere at any time. In this situation, the only thing that can save you is the sound of a dog barking, as it is the only thing it is afraid of, a chili, or a whip. The spirit tends to take revenge on womanisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llanera.com/llanos/?l=2033|title=Leyenda del silbón, sinfín  o finfín - Llanera.com - un solo llano|access-date=7 April 2016|website=www.llanera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==

Many inhabitants of [[Los Llanos (South America)|Los Llanos]] say that they have seen it, primarily in the summer, a time when the Venezuelan savannah burns in the harsh drought. The whistler sits in the trees and gathers dust in his hands. But it is mainly on rainy or humid days that the spirit wanders, hungry for death, and eager to punish drunkards, womanisers or sometimes innocent victims. It is said that it sucks the alcohol out of drunkards through their navel when it finds them alone, and that it tears womanisers to pieces, removes their bones, and puts them in the sack where it keeps the remains of its father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdnh.es/la-leyenda-del-silbon-de-venezuela/|title=La leyenda del Silbón de Venezuela {{!}} Historias de nuestra Historia|access-date=7 April 2016|website=Historias de nuestra Historia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some versions say it appears as a giant of about six metres that moves about the treetops, creaking, and emitting its chilling whistle. Inside its old and tattered sack lie the bones of its father, or according to some renditions, its multiple victims. Other versions say he appears as the shadow of a tall thin man, with a hat, and goes after drunkards most of all.

They say that the whistler can appear by a house on certain nights, drop his sack on the ground and count the bones one by one. If anyone hears it, nothing will happen, but if no one hears it before dawn, one member of the family will never wake up again.

'''''Viva Piñata''''' is a 2006 [[life simulation game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game revolves around the player tending to a neglected garden in Piñata Island, in which different variations of piñatas must be bred whilst fending off disruptive interlopers. The project was headed by [[Gregg Mayles]] and the team behind the [[Banjo-Kazooie series|''Banjo-Kazooie'' series]], based on an idea from Rare co-founder [[Tim and Chris Stamper|Tim Stamper]]. Microsoft wanted the game to become a key franchise for the platform, and developed [[Viva Piñata (TV series)|a tie-in television show]] to accompany the series. ''Viva Piñata'' was released in November 2006. 

The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised the graphics, color palette, and numerous types of piñatas. They disliked the disruption caused by frequent autosaving. A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version was released in November 2007. The game started the [[Viva Piñata|''Viva Piñata'' series]], with [[Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise|a direct sequel]] and [[Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise|a portable version]] both released in 2008. ''Viva Piñata'' is included in Rare's 2015 ''[[Rare Replay]]'', a compilation of 30 games for the [[Xbox One]].

Once two piñatas of the same species are residents and their [[mating]] requirements are met, they can perform a "romance" dance. If the player successfully completes a maze [[minigame]], the romance results in a baby piñata egg, which is delivered by a [[stork]].

==Development==
[[Rare (company)|Rare]] co-founder Tim Stamper conceptualized a gardening game for the handheld [[Pocket PC]] platform in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mundorare.com/old/especial/pinatoween/interview.html|title=Interview with the Piñata Team|work=MundoRare|accessdate=February 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070124034234/http://www.mundorare.com/especial/pinatoween/interview.html |archivedate = January 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-person&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p1"/&gt; team began work on a simple prototype while the company was still affiliated with [[Nintendo]], prior to its [[Microsoft]] acquisition.&lt;ref name="A Rare pleasure Page 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bramwell|first=Tom|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=70473|title=A Rare pleasure Page 1|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|date=November 29, 2006|accessdate=February 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031312/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/eg_rare_int|archivedate=September 11, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Online connectivity was needed to be able to trade with other players.&lt;ref name="A Rare pleasure Page 1"/&gt;}} Development transferred to the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and, ultimately, to the [[Xbox 360]] for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the [[piñata]] conceit. The idea was exciting for the team, as piñatas were not commonplace in the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare int"/&gt;

The ''Viva Piñata'' team was a model for productivity and regular output within Rare and [[Microsoft Studios]].&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare int"/&gt; Though compared to the 12-person teams behind earlier Rare games, the company's Xbox 360 development teams consisted of 50 to 60 people.&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p1"/&gt; The ''Viva Piñata'' team included about 50 people at its zenith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundorare.com/especial/pinatoween/chronicle.html|title= Tasting piñata sweets before Halloween|work=MundoRare|accessdate=February 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070105165151/http://www.mundorare.com/especial/pinatoween/chronicle.html |archivedate = January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft transitioned its development teams to use its [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] package to streamline and reduce duplication in engineering efforts. Microsoft pressured the ''Viva Piñata'' development team to keep the game's themes children-friendly,&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare int"/&gt; as the parent company planned for the game and resulting franchise to increase the market appeal of their Xbox 360. In 2006, a Microsoft Games executive called the game its most important franchise. But its reception was tepid.&lt;ref name="1UP: makes sense"/&gt;

''Viva Piñata'' was planned as a larger intellectual property. 4Kids TV had agreed to make a ''Viva Piñata'' cartoon before the game was released. 4Kids selected the series out of several Microsoft properties offered. 4Kids also handled the series merchandising. The cartoon is tied very closely to the game, and its animations are based on the game's own 3D character models. Its episodes are approved by Rare's [[Gregg Mayles]] for their applicability to the game. The cartoon was also designed to give viewers tips on how to interact with the in-game piñatas.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare int"/&gt; The animated series' storyline later influenced the plot of ''Trouble in Paradise''.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p2"/&gt;

===Release===

After the release of ''Viva Piñata'' in 2006, its development team saw it as incomplete. The developers cut partial ideas from the release to meet their deadlines.&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p1"/&gt; Rare's [[Gregg Mayles]] said that the game sold well and steadily on par with their expectations&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p2"/&gt; and Xbox executive [[Phil Spencer (business executive)|Phil Spencer]] added that the game was considered a success inside the company.&lt;ref name="1UP: makes sense"/&gt; The team incorporated player feedback and worked towards a "more definitive version" of the original.&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p1"/&gt;

During the Microsoft press conference at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] 2007, a [[Microsoft Windows]] port of ''Viva Piñata'' was announced. The conversion was handled by [[Climax Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Delivers More Fun, More Experiences and More Choices to Its Ever-Expanding Games Library|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/microsoft-delivers-more-fun-more-experiences-and-more-choices-to-its-ever-expanding-games-library|website=Gamesindustry.biz|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=May 13, 2016|date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viva Pinata overview|url=http://www.polygon.com/game/viva-pinata/37867|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is part of the [[Games for Windows]] programme which offers easier installation and support for Windows Vista's Games Explorer, [[Xbox 360 Controller]] for Windows, Parental Controls, and the use of [[Games For Windows - Live]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faylor|first1=Chris|title=Microsoft Launches Games for Windows Live Marketplace with Viva Pinata Demo|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/56201/microsoft-launches-games-for-windows|publisher=Shacknews|accessdate=May 13, 2016|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Microsoft collaborated with amusement park [[Six Flags Mexico]] to promote the Xbox 360 as well as ''Viva Piñata''. To accomplish this, a {{convert|48|ft}} tall, {{convert|52|ft}} long piñata, specifically a Horstachio, was constructed at the park. At the time, it was the largest recorded piñata ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimavida.com/2006/12/03/la-pinata-mas-grande-del-mundo-2|title= La piñata más grande del mundo|work=Última Vida|accessdate=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Viva Piñata'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCX360"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt; Nearly a year after its release, Rare's Justin Cook said that the game had sold about 500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Brandon |title=A Rare Opportunity: On Piñatas, Microsoft and More |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2007-10-12 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1953/a_rare_opportunity_on_piatas_.php?print=1 |accessdate=2016-07-05 |df=mdy-all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109081236/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1953/a_rare_opportunity_on_piatas_.php?print=1 |archivedate=November 9, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphics were unanimously praised by critics. Justin Calvert of [[GameSpot]] stated the attention to detail was "uniformly impressive", and asserted that the visuals were cohesive.&lt;ref name=GSpot/&gt; Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] found that the game's graphical slowdown during its frequent autosaving to be startling, although he praised the presentation overall.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Andrew Taylor of the ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' praised the vibrant use of colors and attention to detail.&lt;ref name=OXMUK/&gt; Will Tuttle of [[Team Xbox]] similarly stated the colors were "vividly vibrant" and the design aesthetics "remarkably appealing", although he also found the autosaving slowdown frustrating.&lt;ref name=TX/&gt; Gerald Villoria of [[GameSpy]] stated the graphics were "breathtaking", and noted the color palettes of the piñatas themselves gave the appearance that they were "stripped directly from an animated show".&lt;ref name=GSpy/&gt;

Critics commended various aspects of the gameplay. Calvert enjoyed the wide customization options and large number of piñata variations, stating that the gameplay itself was "silky smooth".&lt;ref name=GSpot/&gt; Brudvig noted that there was a "ton to do"; he praised the encouragement of discovery and stated that it was "constantly filled with moments where you find something new to do".&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Tuttle commended the large number of piñatas, stating that finding managing all of the resources is "a lot of work".&lt;ref name=TX/&gt; Villoria praised the "surprisingly deep" strategic gameplay, saying that it was one of the most "entertaining and fulfilling" experiences for the Xbox 360.&lt;ref name=GSpy/&gt;

'''[[Champion (dog)|Ch.]] Warren Remedy''', (1905-1912), was a Best in Show winner of the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1907, 1908, and 1909. She was a [[Fox Terrier (Smooth)|Smooth-coated fox terrier]] owned by [[Winthrop Rutherfurd]], and is the only dog to have won Westminster three years in a row.&lt;ref name="NAPSI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bengtson|first=Bo|title=Best in show|year=2008|publisher=Kennel Club books|location=Freehold, NJ 07728, USA|isbn=978 1 931993 85 2|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Remedy was sired by Sabine Resist from Routon Dainty.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; She was bred by [[Winthrop Rutherfurd]], and brought up at the Warren Kennels in [[Allamuchy Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American Dogs Ahead|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/03/03/104981351.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 1907|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other dogs which were bred from the same pairing included Warren Drastic, Warren Deputy, Warren Vogue and Warren Rescue.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox Terrier Warren Remedy Dead|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/12/17/100385000.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 12, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Show career==
The [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] introduced a Best in Show competition in 1907, the first since the show's inception in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club History|url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/about/history.html|publisher=Westminster Kennel Club|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 20 months, Warren Remedy was entered in the competition and progressed through breed and group victories into the Best in Show round. She faced off against sixteen other breeds of dogs. These included the [[Rough Collie]] Squire of Tytton, who had won the Van Schaick Cup earlier in the show, and the [[Old English Sheepdog|English Sheepdog]] Dolly Gray, who won the Castle Gould Cup. Ten judges preceded over the Best in Show round and awarded the title to Warren Remedy. Immediately afterwards, Remedy competed once again at the show, this time for Ballyhoo Bay Challenge Cup awarded by the Ladies Kennel Association of America. A similar lineup of dogs competed for the trophy, with the exception of Squire of Tytton being replaced with the American-bred Rough Collie Mountaineer Magistrate. Remedy was expected to win this title as well, but it was instead awarded to the [[English Setter]] Deodora Prince.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Later in the 1907 show season, Remedy was named Best in Show at the inaugural North Jersey Kennel Club dog show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warren Remedy Best Dog|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/08/16/106712914.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 16, 1907|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after that victory and also in New Jersey, Remedy also won the award for the best dog or bitch in show at the [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] dog show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warren Remedy Best Dog|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/08/22/106713139.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 22, 1907|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remedy retained the Best in Show title at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1908, and afterwards was declared to be the "best dog of her kind in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prize Dogs Draw Record Patronage|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/02/13/105002882.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 13, 1908|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1908, Remedy was named the best bitch in the show at the Ladies Kennel Association of America show held in [[Mineola, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Surprises in Dog Show Awards|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/06/06/104729346.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 6, 1908|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She won Westminster once again in 1909, although reports mistakenly gave her name as "Warren Rutherford".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bulldog Gamin II Sold for Big Price|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/02/13/106117077.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 13, 1909|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her victory at Westminster in 1909, Remedy competed in the New England Kennel Club Show later in the same month. There she was beaten by the Smooth Fox Terrier Sabine Fernie from the Sabine Kennels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sabine Fernie Wins Two Prizes|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/02/26/101867841.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 26, 1909|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1910 Westminster Show, Remedy was beaten in what was viewed as a surprise victory in the best Smooth Fox Terrier bitch contest by Sabine Fernie. Fernie went on to be beaten by fellow Sabine Kennel's dog, Sabine Rarebit in the best overall Smooth Fox Terrier contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mike, Fireman's Dog, Gets Prize at Show|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/02/11/102035857.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 11, 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarebit went on to win the Best in Show title, the first time it had been awarded to a dog other than Warren Remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sabine Rarebit is Best Dog in Show|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/02/12/104920803.pdf|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 12, 1910|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren Remedy's death was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on December 17, 1912. She died in the Warren Kennels on [[Winthrop Rutherfurd|Winthrop Rutherfurd's]] farm in [[Allamuchy Township]].&lt;ref name=death /&gt;

==Legacy==
Warren Remedy remains the only dog to have won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on three occasions, the most victories by any single dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenblum|first=Ira|title=Signoff; Champions All, But Only One Top Dog|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/tv/signoff-champions-all-but-only-one-top-dog.html|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze statues were later crafted of Remedy's form by Ric Chashoudian. These statues were used as awards to show dog owners for a series of awards by the Westminster Kennel Club.

'''Éric Borel''' ({{IPA-fr|bɔʁɛl|lang}}; 11 December 1978 &amp;ndash; 24 September 1995) was a [[French people|French]] high-school student and [[spree killer]] who, at the age of 16, murdered his family in [[Solliès-Pont]] in the [[arrondissement of Toulon]] on 23 September 1995, and afterwards shot dead twelve other people and injured four more in the village of [[Cuers]] the next day. When police arrived at the scene, Borel committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varmatin.com/article/var/dossier-la-tuerie-de-cuers-14-ans-apres-mystere-sur-une-folie-meurtriere.17086.html Dossier : La tuerie de Cuers 14 ans après Mystère sur une folie meurtrière] "Éric Borel, le meurtrier de 16 ans, a emporté dans sa tombe son lourd secret."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au-troisieme-oeil.com/index.php?page=actu&amp;type=skr&amp;news=31132 Il y a 14 ans à Cuers, la folie meurtrière d'un jeune homme de 16 ans faisait 17 morts ] "La folie meurtrière d’Éric Borel, un adolescent de 16 ans, est sans précédent en France"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Childhood ===
Éric Borel was the son of Marie-Jeanne Parenti and Jacques Borel, who were both working in the military at the time of his birth. However, their liaison was rather short, and after they separated, Eric was sent to Jacques Borel's parents in [[Limoges]], where he stayed until he was five. When his mother, who had visited Eric only occasionally up to that time, began to live with Yves Bichet, she again took care of her son, much to his dislike, and took him to their home in [[Solliès-Pont]].&lt;ref name=dossier&gt;[http://www.affaires-criminelles.com/dossier_19-1.php La tuerie de Cuers] (in [[French (language)|French]]), ''affaires-criminelles.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9225846.html?name=Eine+Art+von+Rache Eine Art von Rache] (in [[German (language)|German]]), ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (41/1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Borel's mother, an [[authoritarian]] and &amp;ndash; at least outwardly &amp;ndash; religious person and activist in the [[Catholic Relief Services|Secours catholique]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/1995-09-26_Articles_-Plonges-dans-le-traumatisme-deux-villages-veulent-comprendre Plongés dans le traumatisme deux villages veulent comprendre], ''[[L'Humanité]]'' (September 26, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; mistreated and beat him—she believed him to be a "child of sin". He never developed a close relationship with his mother's new companion, with whom he was said to have frequent rows and who reportedly also beat him on occasions.&lt;ref name=Ind29&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-black-day-in-provence-1603338.html A black day in Provence], ''[[The Independent]]'' (September 29, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Franck and Jean-Luc Bichet, Yves Bichet's sons, stated that their father had always been nice to Eric, even building him a shack for his chickens and other animals he took home.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

When Eric broke his arm at the age of eight, rather than to go home, he preferred to run away and hide, until he was found, shivering from pain. In this type of situation, Borel, who was known as a quiet and taciturn boy who kept to himself and rather tend the chickens in the backyard during his free time than to go out, grew up and developed an increasing admiration for the military, telling lies about heroic deeds of his father during the [[Indochina Wars|Indochina War]] and adoring his stepbrother Franck Bichet, who served in the army. He had an affection for weapons and used to shoot [[sparrow]]s with an [[air gun]].&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

=== Later years and motive ===
Until his death, Borel attended the [[Lycée#Lyc.C3.A9e professionnel|lycée professionnel]] Georges-Cisson in [[Toulon]], where he studied electromechanics and did quite well academically. He was said to be a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.&lt;ref name=dossier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt;

Borel had one friend, 17-year-old Alan Guillemette, a classmate who was rather outgoing and popular among his peers and with whom he would hang out after school.&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt;

Many reports erroneously stated that Borel's room was full of [[Nazi]]-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist ideologies were spurred even more by the fact that his stepfather had attended several meetings of the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] in 1989. But besides a picture of [[Adolf Hitler]] cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a [[swastika]] on his door, a few books on [[World War II]], as well as a documentary about [[David Koresh]] and the [[Waco siege]], no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics.&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt; Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, who was supposed to be his pregnant girlfriend. However, the sister in question did not exist, nor was it true that his father had died of cancer shortly before his rampage.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

== Attacks ==

=== Familicide ===
The series of attacks started on 23 September 1995, at about 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Coordinated Universal Time|CET]], when Borel killed his stepfather, Yves Bichet, in the kitchen by shooting him four times with a [[J. G. Anschütz|Anschütz]] [[.22 Long Rifle|.22-caliber]] [[rifle]], before smashing his head with a [[hammer]]. Police assumed that they had a quarrel beforehand, when Borel tried to run away from home. Next, Borel assaulted his half-brother, 11-year-old Jean-Yves Bichet, who was watching TV, in a similar manner, by first shooting him with the rifle and afterwards bludgeoning his head with the hammer. After wiping up the blood trails, Borel waited for his mother to come home.&lt;ref name=dossier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt;

As soon as his mother, Marie-Jeanne Parenti, arrived at home from church at about 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Borel immediately killed her with a single shot to the head. In contrast to her husband and son no blunt force was used on Mrs. Parenti,&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt; although some reports have suggested that he beat her as well with either the [[hammer]] or a [[baseball bat]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD6143AF936A1575AC0A963958260 Teen-Age Gunman Kills Himself and 12 Others in France], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (September 25, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; When his mother lay dead, Borel once again started to clean the house from blood, covered the bodies with sheets and closed all shutters, as well as the steel gate. Carrying a bag packed with food, money, a raincoat, a map of Limoges, and a pistol shooting rubber bullets, which was erroneously identified as a .22-caliber pistol in some reports,&lt;ref&gt;Death brings rampage toll to 13, ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' (September 26, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/death-toll-in-gun-massacre-rises-to-13-1602941.html Death toll in gun massacre rises to 13], ''[[The Independent]]'' (September 26, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and armed with his father's rifle and his pockets full of ammunition, Borel made his way towards Cuers, at first by car, but eventually he crashed it into a wall, where he continued his path by foot. Presumably he spent the night between [[Vitis vinifera|vines]].&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt;

The bodies of the murdered family were found at approximately 1 a.m. by Yves Bichet's son Jean-Luc, a student living in [[Antibes]] who only occasionally visited his father on weekends. After calling police Bichet was first considered a suspect in the murders when giving contradictory information. The absence of Eric Borel remained undetected until about three hours later.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ocala&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pDUVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0AcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6899,5582669&amp;dq= Murdering rampage shocks small town], ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'' (September 26, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shooting spree ===
On the following day at 7:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., Borel arrived at the home of his friend Alan Guillemette. When Guillemette's mother opened the door Eric asked her to wake him. The two had a lengthy discussion in the garden, and apparently Eric wanted something from Guillemette, but when he declined and turned to go back into the house, Eric shot him in the back, mortally wounding him.&lt;ref name=dossier/&gt; From 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was [[hunting season]] and the sight of rifles outside was to be expected.

First he shot at Ginette Vialette through an open window, mortally wounding her, as well as Denise Otto, whom he killed, while she was bringing the trash out. He also hit Otto's husband, Jean, in the shoulder. Subsequently Borel injured an elderly woman who was walking in the streets with her husband and shot and wounded two brothers who were crossing his path. The shots he fired at Rodolphe Incorvala, once again through an open window, were eventually lethal. He later died in a hospital. Borel crossed the street to shoot and kill shopkeeper Mario Pagani, who was out buying a newspaper, with shots in the abdomen and head, as well as Mohammed Maarad in front of the "Café du Commerce". Marius Boudon and André Touret were killed while they were drawing money from an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and Andrée Coletta while she was taking her poodle for a walk. Finally he shot Pascal Mostacchi to death at Place Peyssoneau.&lt;ref name=dossier/&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1995/09/25/sociedad/66470.html Un joven neonazi mata a 12 personas en Francia], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' (September 25, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., police arrived at the scene. Realizing that he was surrounded, Borel fatally shot himself in the head under a cypress tree in front of a school.&lt;ref name=Ind29/&gt; Observers of the rampage stated he had been poised and calm all the while, taking great care at aiming and shooting, hitting most of his victims in the head and returning when he did not hit properly the first time. In total, Borel had fired about 40 shots.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

On 23 October 1995, Jeanne Laugiero, 68, died in hospital from injuries sustained in the shooting, raising the death toll to 14 victims.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Monde]]'' (26 October 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The last death in the killing spree was 68-year-old Pierre Marigliano, who succumbed to his wounds on 2 March 1996, bringing the death toll to 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'' (March 6, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Borel's shooting spree was the deadliest act of mass murder in France since [[Christian Dornier]] killed 14 people in [[Luxiol]] on 12 July 1989.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;
