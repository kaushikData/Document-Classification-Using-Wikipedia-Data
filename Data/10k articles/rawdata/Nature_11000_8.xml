'''{{mp|(214869) 2007 PA|8}}''' is an [[asteroid]] and [[List of slow rotators (minor planets)|slow rotator]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo group]], approximately 1.4 kilometers in diameter.

It came within 6.5 million km (4 million miles, 17 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]) of Earth on November 5, 2012.&lt;ref name=UT20121106 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;

It was discovered on 9 August 2007, by the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] team (LINEAR) at the U.S. [[Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site]] in Socorro, New Mexico.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

It was studied by the 70-meter (230&amp;nbsp;ft) Goldstone Deep Space Network antenna as it came near Earth, which resulted in radar images and other data about the asteroid, such as its very long [[rotation period]] of approximately 100 hours.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;

{{mp|2007 PA|8}} may be a [[dormant comet]] related to the November γ Pegasids [[meteor shower]].&lt;ref name=Jenniskens2014 /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was [[Minor planet designation|numbered]] by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 9 May 2009.&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; As of 2018, it has not been [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''367943 Duende''', provisional designation {{mp|2012 DA|14}}, is a micro-[[asteroid]] and a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten]] and [[Atira asteroid|Atira group]], approximately {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter. It was discovered by astronomers of the [[Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca]] at its robotic [[La Sagra Observatory]] in 2012, and named for the [[Duende (mythology)|duende]], a goblin-like creature from Iberian and Filipino mythology and folklore.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; ''Duende'' is likely an uncommon [[L-type asteroid]] and significantly elongated. For an asteroid of its size, it has a relatively long [[rotation period]] of 9.485 hours.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

On 15 February 2013, ''Duende'' passed at a [[List of record-setting asteroid close approaches to Earth|record distance]] of {{convert|27,700|km|mi|abbr=on}} or 4.3 [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] from Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="NASA-news-177" /&gt; Due to its close passage, the orbit of the former [[Apollo asteroid]] was significantly [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]].  ''Duende''{{'s}} passage also [[Chelyabinsk meteor#Coincidental asteroid approach|coincided]] with the completely unrelated [[Chelyabinsk meteor]], which entered Earth's atmosphere above Russia just 16 hours earlier.&lt;ref name="news130301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meteor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA" /&gt;

== Discovery and past risk assessments ==

''Duende'' was discovered on 23 February 2012, seven days after passing {{convert|0.0174|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth,&lt;ref name="jpl-close" /&gt; by the [[La Sagra Observatory]] in [[Granada Province]], Spain,&lt;ref name="MPEC" /&gt; using a 0.45-m [[Reflecting telescope|reflector]] which was remotely operated by [[amateur astronomers]] at the [[Astronomical Observatory of Mallorca]].&lt;ref name="Tri-City-Herald" /&gt;

The still relatively imprecise orbit deduced from the short arc of the 2012 observations already made clear that Duende would pass no closer to Earth's surface than 3.2 [[Earth radii]] during its 2013 passage.&lt;ref name="news174" /&gt; There was at the time, however, a cumulative risk of 0.033% (1 in 3,030) that ''Duende'' would impact Earth during one of its 2026 to 2069 approaches.&lt;ref name="NASA-risk-archive" /&gt;

==2013 passage==
[[File:2012da14-news174.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Diagram of ''Duende'' passing Earth on 15 February 2013.]]

On 9 January 2013, Duende was observed again by [[Las Campanas Observatory]] and the observation arc immediately increased from 79 days to 321 days.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; On 15 February 2013 at 19:25 [[Universal Time]], Duende passed {{convert|0.0002276|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from the center of Earth, with an uncertainty region of about {{convert|0.0000001|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref name="jpl-close" /&gt;

It passed {{convert|27743|km|sp=us}} above Earth's surface, closer than satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]]. It briefly peaked at an [[apparent magnitude]] of roughly 7.2, a factor of a few fainter than would have been visible to the [[naked eye]]. The best observation location for the closest approach was Indonesia. Eastern Europe, Asia, and Australia also were well situated to observe Duende during its closest approach.&lt;ref name="NASA-news-177" /&gt;

''Duende'' was not expected to pass any closer than 1950&amp;nbsp;km to any satellites.&lt;ref name="jsr" /&gt; [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone Observatory]] observed Duende with [[Radar astronomy|radar]] from February 16 to February 20.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spacedaily" /&gt; Radar observations showed that is it an elongated asteroid with dimensions of {{convert|20|x|40|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Plait" /&gt; This gives Duende a [[geometric mean]] (spherical) diameter equivalent to {{convert|28|m|sp=us}}.

During the close approach an observational campaign involving 5 different telescopes in 4 different observatories was carried on in order to get information on the physical properties of this NEO.&lt;ref name="de-Leon-2014" /&gt;

Visible and near-Infrared photometry, and visible spectroscopy were obtained at [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]], [[Telescopio Nazionale Galileo]] and [[Calar Alto Observatory]] and put together. The classification using the M4AST online tool says this is an L-type asteroid. Those peculiar asteroids are characterized by a strongly reddish spectrum shortward of 0.8 μm, and a featureless flat spectrum longward of this, with little or no concave-up curvature related to a 1 μm silicon absorption band.
Time-series photometry was also obtained in the Observatorio de La Hita ({{small|[[IAU code#I95|I95]]}})&lt;ref name="MPEC" /&gt; and [[Observatorio de Sierra Nevada]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} during two consecutive nights (15–16 February 2013). All of this data were co-phased to build a [[lightcurve]] of the object. This lightcurve is double-peak and presents large variations in magnitude, implying a very elongated object, which is compatible with radar observations.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt; The amplitude of the lightcurve yields an axial ratio that, together with the long axis of 40&amp;nbsp;m inferred from the radar images by [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]], results in an equivalent diameter of 18&amp;nbsp;m, much smaller than the estimations before the close-approach.

The [[rotational period]] was precisely determined from the lightcurve obtaining a value of 8.95 ± 0.08 h.&lt;ref name="de-Leon-2014" /&gt; This value is confirmed with an analysis of all the photometry of this objects reported to the [[Minor Planet Center]]. Using data pre and post close approach the authors find that the object suffered a spin-up during the event that decreased the rotational period from {{val|9.8|0.1}} down to {{val|8.8|0.1}} hours, which is compatible with the more accurate value estimated from the light-curve.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

[[File:Earth and 2012 DA14 - 2013.svg|thumb|left|Closest approach of asteroid drawn to scale.]]

=== Orbital shift ===

The close approach to Earth reduced the orbital period of Duende from 368 days to 317 days, Its aphelion was reduced from 1.110 to 0.9917&amp;nbsp;AU, leaving it almost entirely inside Earth's orbit and [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbing]] it from the [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] class to the [[Aten asteroid|Aten]] class of near-Earth asteroids.&lt;ref name="NASA-news-177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horizons" /&gt;

Its next close approach to Earth will be on 15 February 2046 when it will pass about {{convert|0.0148|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth. Based on 7 radar observations, the next close approach to Earth similar to the 2013 passage will be on 16 February 2123 when Duende will pass no closer than {{convert|0.0002|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from the center of Earth. For the 2123 passage, the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] pass will be {{convert|0.003|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the center of the Moon and then {{convert|0.005|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the center of Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;

Risk assessments calculated before the 2013 passage were based on a diameter of 45 meters and a mass of 130,000 metric tons.&lt;ref name="NASA-risk-archive" /&gt; It was estimated that, if it were ever to impact Earth, it would enter the atmosphere at a speed of 12.7&amp;nbsp;km/s, would have a [[kinetic energy]] equivalent to 2.4 [[TNT equivalent|megatons of TNT]],&lt;ref name="NASA-risk-archive" /&gt; and would produce an [[air burst]] with the equivalent of 2.1 megatons of TNT&lt;ref name="Earth-impact" /&gt; at an altitude of roughly {{convert|10.1|km|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Earth-impact" /&gt; The [[Tunguska event]] has been estimated at 3–20 megatons.&lt;ref name="Sandia" /&gt; Asteroids of approximately 50 meters in diameter are expected to impact Earth once every 1200 years or so.&lt;ref name="science" /&gt; Asteroids larger than 35 meters across can pose a threat to a town or city,&lt;ref name="SA2013" /&gt; and the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] which serendipitously occurred on the day of the 2013 passage was due to a 17-meter asteroid. As a result of radar observations it is now known that Duende is only about 30 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;
* The uncertainty region of Duende during planetary encounters is now well determined through 2123.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;
* Duende was therefore removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 16 February 2013.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt;
* It is estimated that there are more than a million near-Earth asteroids smaller than 100 meters.&lt;ref name="NEOWISE2011-304"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">'''Actor analysis''' can be seen as an approach to [[environmental management]]. [[Environmental issue]]s are often very complex, because many parties are involved.  All parties have their own interests, goals and strategies.  Actor analysis provides a structured inventory of the parties and their interests to get an overview.

Instead of parties we speak of actors which comprise both individuals and groups like [[organizations]], administrative authorities or [[consumer organisations]]. All these actors can change an existing situation by their priorities or [[value systems]].

There have been many changes of environmental behaviour that can be described via Actor Analysis. For example, all cars are now equipped with [[catalytic converter]]s. Environmental organisations, governments, companies, legislators, customers, have all been actors in this process.

'''Alexander "Alex" Shoumatoff''' (born November 4, 1946) is an American writer known for his literary journalism, nature and environmental writing, and books and magazine pieces about political and environmental situations and world affairs.  He was a staff writer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine from 1978 to 1987, a founding contributing editor of [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'' magazine]] and ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]'', and was the senior-most contributing editor to [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] since its re-inception in 1986 through 2015 before he pseudo retired. He is known for reporting from the most remote corners of the world.

Career highlights include Vanity Fair's article about [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art collector)|Cornelius Gurlitt]] who was discovered with hundreds of paintings from [[art theft and looting during World War II]] from [[Nazi plunder]]ing; a 1986 article for ''Vanity Fair'' magazine about the mountain gorilla advocate [[Dian Fossey]] in 1986 in [[Rwanda]] which became the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]''; one of the first international articles about the [[Brazil]]ian musician [[Caetano Veloso]] in 1984 for ''The New Yorker''; tracing the origin of AIDS for Vanity Fair which became his book ''African Madness''; a profile of the organization [[Product Red]] led by [[U2]] front man [[Bono]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/07/lazarus200707 |title=The Lazarus Effect |first=Alex |last=Shoumatoff |date=June 5, 2007 |journal=Vanity Fair |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his arrest in 2008 for trespassing at the [[Bohemian Grove]] in [[Monte Rio, California]] in 2008 that was featured in Page 6 of ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'' and ''Vanity Fair''&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2009/05/bohemian-grove200905 |title=Bohemian Tragedy |first=Alex |last=Shoumatoff |date=April 1, 2009 |journal=Vanity Fair |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; about how members of the Grove were attempting to log old-growth redwood trees, but became much more than that after news of his arrest was picked up by news outlets.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;  
He has 10 published books and since 2001 has been the editor of a web site, "Dispatches From The Vanishing World", devoted to "documenting and raising awareness about the planet's rapidly disappearing natural and cultural diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/ |title=Welcome |work=Dispatches From The Vanishing World |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of pages of his writing are posted on the site. His eleventh book, The Wasting of Borneo: Dispatches From A Vanishing World," will be published by Beacon Press in April, 2017.

Shoumatoff has been called "the greatest writer in America" by [[Donald Trump]]&lt;ref name=trump&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/trump-between-you-and-me-i-m-going-to-get-it-1-1162224 |title=Trump - 'between you and me I'm going to get it' |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of our greatest story tellers" by [[Graydon Carter]].

==Ethnicity and ancestry==
Shoumatoff descends from a family of the [[Russian nobility]] he traced back dozens of generations in his 1982 book, ''Russian Blood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/pastdispatches/oldrussia/russia1.html |title=Old Russia, Part 1 |work=Dispatches From The Vanishing World |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His paternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth Shoumatoff]], was a prominent portrait artist who was painting President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] when he collapsed before her with a cerebral hemorrhage and she escorted his mistress [[Lucy Rutherford]] away from the scene before the media arrived.  Her brother/Shoumatoff's great uncle [[Andrey Avinoff]], was a "gentleman-in-waiting" to the Tsar at the time of the [[Soviet Revolution]], was an artist also, and was a renowned [[lepidopterist]] who was fictionalized by Nabokov in Dar (The Gift) and became the director of the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]] from 1925 to 1945, and was profiled shortly before his death in 1948 by The New Yorker.  His paternal grandfather, Leo Shoumatoff, was the business manager of [[Igor Sikorsky]]'s [[Sikorsky Aircraft|aircraft company]], which developed the [[helicopter]] and the first passenger airplane. His other grandfather was a [[Colonel]] in the Empress's cavalry guard. His father Nicholas Shoumatoff was an engineer who designed paper mills around the world, an entomologist, and well-known alpine ecologist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/nyregion/nicholas-shoumatoff-81-nature-enthusiast.html |title=Nicholas Shoumatoff, 81, Nature Enthusiast |date=26 September 1999 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the books ''Europe's Mountain Center'' and ''Around the Roof of the World,'' whose obituary was featured in the New York Times.

==Childhood and education==
Shoumatoff was born in [[Mount Kisco, New York]]. He grew up in the 1950s in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]], an exurban enclave of old-line [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]] that is now mostly inhabited by famous people and  business leaders. He went to the local country-day school, Rippowam School, where he later taught middle-school science in his mid-twenties. Upon his graduation from the eighth grade, the family moved to London and began to spend summers in Switzerland's [[Bernese Oberland]]. His father, a passionate mountain climber, took Shoumatoff and his older brother Nick up major peaks in the [[Alps]].  When he was four, his parents put him in a summer camp in [[Gstaad]], Switzerland, where he learned to speak French.

Shoumatoff did his secondary schooling at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], a then all-boys boarding school in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], where he was at the top of his class and the captain of the squash team and was friends with, and eventually profiled in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.readabstracts.com/General-interest/Battle-of-the-bluebloods-Vanity-Fair-nominates-Carol-M-Browner.html|title=Battle of the bluebloods. Vanity Fair nominates: Carol M. Browner. Sun without a moon|website=www.readabstracts.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Kerry]]. When he was 16, impressed with recordings by the [[South Carolina]] blues man [[Pink Anderson]], he bought a guitar and wandered to the [[Folklore Center]] in [[Greenwich Village]], New York, where [[Izzy Young]] sent him to [[Harlem]] to take lessons from the [[Reverend Gary Davis]].  Davis would have a huge impact on Shoumatoff and would become the subject of Shoumatoff's first published magazine piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/pastdispatches/garydavis/davis1.html |title=The Reverend Gary Davis |first=Alex |last=Shoumatoff |journal=Rolling Stone |date=December 23, 1971 |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was admitted to [[Harvard University]].  He studied poetry writing with [[Robert Lowell]] in a class that included fellow literary journalist [[Tracy Kidder]] and was on the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. His senior year roommates included [[Douglas Kenney]], founder of [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] and co-scriptor of Animal House and Caddyshack.

==Early writing and music career==
Graduating at 1968 into the turbulence of the late [[Vietnam War]] and with influence from [[Bob Dylan]], Shoumatoff aspired to be a songwriter. After a stint on the ''[[Washington Post]]'' as a night police reporter, and with a draft classification of [[Selective Service System|I-A]], he enlisted in an obscure [[Marine Corps]] reserve intelligence unit that trained him to be parachuted behind the [[Iron Curtain]] and to melt into the local population. He was given intensive Russian Language schooling in [[Monterey, California]]. There, however, he fell in with the psychedelic [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture of the late 1960s]]. He turned to the Reverend Gary Davis with his predicament and Davis made him a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in a heated moment in a [[Storefront church|store-front church]] in [[Harlem]].  This enabled him to get an honorable, IV-D discharge from the Marines (the D standing for Divinity).

In 1969, rather than returning to the Washington Post and becoming its Moscow correspondent, which the newspaper's editor Benjamin Bradlee had offered him,  Shoumatoff chose to "drop out" with his girlfriend and they moved to an old farm in [[New Hampshire]]. He taught French at a local college and drove a school bus and became engrossed with nature. Breaking up with the girl that fall, he drifted to northern California hanging out on a succession of communes and playing music around bonfires and writing more songs. There, he sold his profile of Gary Davis to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and had a song-writing contract with [[Manny Greenhill]], the manager of [[Joan Baez]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Doc Watson]]. He went to New York City to perform his songs but ended up instead writing for magazines, starting with the ''[[Village Voice]]''. He developed a piece on Florida into his first book, ''Florida Ramble'', and married his editor's assistant. The newlyweds lived in the Marsh Sanctuary in Mount Kisco, where he became the resident naturalist. The marriage lasted only two years, and the heartbroken Shoumatoff, after turning in his second book, a natural and cultural history of [[Westchester County, New York]], left for [[Amazon Rainforest|the Amazon Rainforest]].

Returning to Mount Kisco with a Brazilian wife, he learned that his Westchester book had been taken by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and joined its staff in 1978. Shoumatoff established himself as "consistently one of the farthest-flung of the New Yorker's far-flung correspondents",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/blog/posting.asp?ID=281 |title=Vanity Fair's Alex Shoumatoff Discusses the Environment – Part 2 |first=Graham |last=Lanktree |date=March 26, 2010 |journal=[[Canadian Geographic]] |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ''New York Times'' described him, and he wrote pieces on [[pygmies]] in the [[Ituri Forest]], [[lemurs]] of [[Madagascar]], and traced the legend of [[Amazon women]] to a tributary of the Amazon called the Nhamunda, which no white person had visited since a Frenchman in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1986/03/24/amazons |first=Alex |last=Shoumatoff |title=Amazons |date=March 24, 1986 |journal=The New Yorker |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and journalistic techniques==
Shoumatoff is known for his style of "long fact writing" which was developed at The New Yorker under the editorship of [[William Shawn]]. Shawn encouraged his writers to pursue their interests in exhaustive detail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Here But Not Here: My Life with William Shawn and The New Yorker |first=Lillian |last=Ross |authorlink=Lillian Ross (journalist) |year=2001 |publisher=Counterpoint |isbn=978-1582431109}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice used to provide comprehensive reporting about often little-known but fascinating and important subjects, and to fill the weekly magazine's pages. Shoumatoff began recording everything that he was told or observed or thought in little red Chinese and later Staples notebooks, and has filled 500 of them with 200,000 pages to date. To this day Shoumatoff attempts to give the best of his ability, "the full picture, in all its complexity and ambiguity," and still submits very long pieces, much to the consternation of his magazine editors.

Most of his books, beginning with ''Florida Ramble'', and continuing to his last published book, ''Legends of the American Desert'', are portraits of a place (a state, a county, a rainforest, a desert) and often originated with a magazine article. They identify and present, in a mixture of travelogue and exposition, elements that Shoumatoff believes make the place the way it is: flora and fauna; natural, cultural, and political history; local dialects and belief systems. His writing is often characterized by a fascination with "the Other", disenchantment with the modern consumer culture, and an insatiable quantity of detail that he developed at the New Yorker. The essayist [[Edward Hoagland]] described him as "admirably protean, encyclopedic, and indefatigable, Shoumatoff has the curiosity of an army of researchers and writes like a house afire."  Shoumatoff also appeals to, frequently works with, and his work often crosses with, work in cultural anthropology. He works often with specialists in species, cultures, and music.

==Mid to later life and career==

In 1986 Shoumatoff wrote his first piece for ''Vanity Fair'', about the murder of [[Dian Fossey]], which was made into the movie ''Gorillas in the Mist,'' and was considered to be one of the newly resurrected magazine's stars by then-editor [[Tina Brown]]. He wrote an account of the fall of Paraguay's dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]], which was the sole subject of Brown's introduction to the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/?p=1373 |title=Dispatch #28: The Fall of General Stroessner  |work=Dispatches From The Vanishing World |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in l987 attempted to pinpoint the source of the AIDS virus in central Africa which he developed into the book ''African Madness''.  In 1990, his book ''The World Is Burning'' about the murder of [[Chico Mendes]] was optioned by director/actor [[Robert Redford]].  In the early 1990s, he became interested in [[golf]], and had a column in [[Esquire Magazine]] called "Investigative Golf."  Two of his more-famous pieces about golf were one in 1994 which former President [[Bill Clinton]]'s golf buddies discussed rumors of Clinton's extra-marital affairs prior to the Monica Lewinsky scandal; and another piece about playing with [[O.J. Simpson]]'s golf buddies who believed Simpson may have hidden the murder weapon in his golf bag. He also profiled Uma Thurman and her father, Buddhist [[Robert Thurman]], for a cover feature in Vanity Fair. During this era, Shoumatoff appeared on the tabloid T.V. shows ''[[Inside Edition]]'' and ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''.

In 1997, his book ''Legends of the American Desert: Sojourns in the Greater Southwest'', (Knopf, 1997) was named a ''New York Times'' notable book and was on ''Time'' magazine and ''New York Post''{{'}}s top ten books of 1997.  He wrote about [[global warming]] and the defeat of the USA's endorsement of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatchesfromthevanishingworld.com/dispatch5/kyoto1.html |title=Dispatch #5: Kyoto  |work=Dispatches from the Vanishing World |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997, In 2000, he was selected as the correspondent from ''Vanity Fair'' to profile [[Al Gore]], whom he had gone to college with, before the election in a piece that was not published. In 2001, Shoumatoff strengthened his focus on the environment and an interest in creating a written record of these places and/or cultures and species, believing that many of the places that he had been writing about since the 1970s had been drastically changed by the West's appetite for goods, and started his web site, ''Dispatches From The Vanishing World'', with his son Andre.

In the late 2000s Shoumatoff recorded his first musical album with his longtime friend [[Kate McGarrigle]], the mother of [[Rufus Wainwright]] and [[Martha Wainwright]], that was featured on NPR's weekend edition of ''All Things Considered'' during the Pennsylvania primary for the 2008 primary election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/sundaysoapbox/2008/04/pennsylvania_turnpike_blues.html |title=Pennsylvania Turnpike Blues |first=Ned |last=Wharton |work=NPR |date=April 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoumatoff has lived in [[Montreal]] since 1998 and is still active primarily with magazines such as [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/author/alex-shoumatoff/|title=Articles by Alex Shoumatoff {{!}} Smithsonian|website=www.smithsonianmag.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is active on speaker circuits about writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-c61CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=from+bedford+to+borneo+shoumatoff#v=onepage&amp;q=from%2520bedford%2520to%2520borneo%2520shoumatoff&amp;f=false|title=Thank You, Teacher: Grateful Students Tell the Stories of the Teachers Who Changed Their Lives|last=Holbert|first=Holly and Bruce|date=2016-04-03|publisher=New World Library|isbn=9781608684182|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alien Planet''''' is a 94-minute [[docufiction]], originally airing on the [[Discovery Channel]], about two internationally built [[robot]] probes searching for alien life on the fictional planet [[Darwin IV]]. It was based on the book ''[[Expedition (book)|Expedition]]'', by sci-fi/fantasy artist and writer [[Wayne Douglas Barlowe]], who was also executive producer on the special. It premiered on May 14, 2005.

The show uses [[computer-generated imagery]], which is interspersed with interviews from such notables as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[George Lucas]], [[Michio Kaku]] and [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]]. The show was filmed in [[Iceland]] and [[Mono Lake]] in [[California]].

==Plot==
{{Main|Darwin IV}}
''Alien Planet'' starts out with an interstellar spacecraft named ''[[Wernher von Braun|Von Braun]]'', leaving [[Earth]]'s [[orbit]]. Traveling at 20% the speed of light (37,000 miles/s), it reaches Darwin IV in 42 years. Upon reaching orbit, it deploys the ''Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter'', which looks for potential landing sites for the probes. The first probe, ''[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]],'' explodes along with its [[lifting body]] transport during entry, because one of its wings failed to unfold. Two backup probes, ''[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'' (nicknamed Leo) and ''[[Isaac Newton]]'' (nicknamed Ike), successfully land on the planet, and learn much about its bizarre indigenous lifeforms, including an apparently [[sapience|sapient]] species.

The robotic probes sent out to research on Darwin IV are called [[Horus]] Probes. Each Horus probe consists of an {{convert|8|ft|m|sing=on}} high, {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} long inflatable, [[hydrogen]]-filled balloon, which is covered with solar receptors, a computer 'brain', a 'head' covered with sensors, and several smaller robots that can be sent to places too dangerous for the probes themselves. The probes have a limited degree of artificial intelligence, very similar to the 'processing power' of a 4-year-old. All the real thinking is done by a supercomputer in the orbiting ''Von Braun''. The probes are programmed with different personalities; Ike is more cautious, while Leo is the risk-taker. The two probes are also equipped with a holographic message that will be projected to any sentient life found on Darwin.

After the two probes inflate their gas-bags, they encounter a voracious Arrowtongue and watch it pursue a Gyrosprinter. Later that night, the twins find the wreckage of Balboa and are ordered to split up, Ike studying the unique plant life and Leo going after big game. Ike's voyage takes him to one of Darwin IV's pocket forests, where he encounters a flock of Trunk Suckers and their predator, the Daggerwrist. Before his research is finished, a massive hurricane-like storm hits and Ike must take to the sky, launching [[weather balloons]]. Leo goes to the mountain ranges and finds a herd of Unths engaged in rutting-like behavior.

Afterward, Leo finds a pair of Bladderhorns engaging in combat. It tries to communicate with one, but a sonic ping interrupts the conversation and scares off the animal, and he is knocked out by a mysterious creature. Ike ventures to the meadows and gullies of Darwin IV, encountering massive Grovebacks and a herd of Littoralopes. Flying above, dangerous predators: the Skewers.

Leo gets destroyed by a mysterious and evasive creature, and Ike, ordered by the ''Von Braun'' to search for Leo's attacker, hopes to find a new sentient species. Ike's route takes him across perilous terrain, and across the Amoebic Sea in its quest for Leo. As it embarks on its journey, one of the Grovebacks seen earlier falls victim to a swarm of Beach Quills. Ike then finds a pack of Prongheads hunting a Gyrosprinter, and crosses the [[Amoeba|Amoebic]] Sea (which attempted to attack Ike), encountering a herd of giant Sea Striders.

Ike manages to find Leo after a harrowing experience with a Skewer which tries to attack it, but is killed by a spear thrown by the newly discovered floating Eosapien. Shortly afterward, Ike communicates with the Eosapien tribe and discovers that they are truly intelligent. Ike launches a camera disk to record the moment, or perhaps "to assess the threat" due to a third Eosapien appearing; however one of the Eosapiens mistakes it as an attack and destroys the camera disk. Before shutting down, the wrecked camera disk records the Eosapien tribe carrying Ike away.

Commentary from notable people discussing the details behind the fictional world of Darwin IV and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life in general is interspersed throughout the movie.

==Craft==
The following are the craft and probes that appear in the film:

===Von Braun===
The cruise speed of the '''''Von Braun''''' is 20% the [[speed of light]]. At this speed it reaches the planet Darwin IV in 42 years. The ''Von Braun'', named after [[Wernher von Braun]], has two primary propulsion systems: [[Ion thruster|nuclear ion engines]] for low-speed maneuvers during the first year of spaceflight and an [[antimatter rocket|antimatter catalyst]] to accelerate to 20% the speed of light. Once in orbit it deploys the ''Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter'' and the landing probes. It also has [[artificial intelligence]] computers to act as the central command for the mission. During the long cruise to Darwin IV, a [[Composite material|metal-composite]] dust shield protects the spacecraft from interstellar debris. It is jettisoned before ''Von Braun'' brakes in orbit around Darwin IV. Finally, it has a {{convert|165|ft|m|sing=on}} diameter communications dish, deployed in orbit, for information transfer to Earth. It transfers a large amount of information via a [[Laser|laser beam]] at a frequency of 8 [[Hertz|GHz]] in the [[X-band]].

===Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter===
The '''Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter''' (DRO) was deployed in orbit around Darwin IV from the ''Von Braun''. The spacecraft has a mass of about 5,000 kilograms. Unlike the nuclear-powered ''Von Braun'', the DRO utilizes [[Photovoltaics|solar panel]]s, capable of generating several [[megawatt]]s for power.  Its primary purpose was to look for potential landing sites for the Horus probes and to map the entire planet. After deployment, the DRO utilizes its own [[booster rocket]] to place it in the proper orbit. The DRO studied the planet for about 1 Darwin IV year (about 1.6 Earth years) to ensure the Horus probes would not land in unacceptable conditions. Instruments carried on the DRO include a [[synthetic aperture radar]], a [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] camera, a near-[[infrared]] camera, and a [[spectrometer]]. The exact timing of the landings would be determined by computers in the ''Von Braun'' based on data from the DRO.

===Horus Probes===
The '''Horus probes''' are used for the surface operations of the Darwin IV expedition. The ''Von Braun'' carries three probes. Each probe is essentially identical with the exception of their behavior and external color. Each probe is carried to the surface in a lifting body lander. The probes also have the intelligence on par with a 4 year old child.

====Probe Balboa====
Probe Balboa, named after [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]], was the first probe launched to explore Darwin IV. However, it experienced a malfunction while the two small wings/fins were unfolding. When it entered Darwin IV's atmosphere, non-heat-resistant material which was exposed caught fire, leading to the breakup of the craft. If Probe Balboa's entry into Darwin IV atmosphere is watched carefully, it can be seen that the right wing/fin does not extend and lock into place. Probe Balboa was never given a nickname. It was the shortest lasting probe, since it was never activated. Its color is red.

====Probe Da Vinci====
Probe Leo, named after [[Leonardo da Vinci]], was the second probe to attempt landing on [[Darwin IV]], which was a success. Leo was programmed to take risks and be adventurous, and study animal life. It explored the planet for several days before it went offline due to an [[Eosapien]] attack. It came back online momentarily, launching a camera disk, which disturbed the Eosapiens and provoked them to attack a second time. Leo never came back online. Its color is blue.

====Probe Newton====
Probe Ike, named after [[Isaac Newton]], was the third and final probe to land. He was programmed to be more observational and avoid risks. His first objective was the study of plant life; but Ike encountered many more creatures in the process. After Leo went offline, the ''Von Braun'' commanded probe Newton to search for Leo and to take more risks studying animal life. On the way, Ike traveled some distance and discovered several new aliens. Upon arrival at Leo's final transmission site, Ike was almost killed by a Skewer, but was miraculously saved by an Eosapien's spear. It is unknown if this was simply pure luck, or, as a genuine form of extraterrestrial intelligence, if it willingly saved Ike's life. Ike then showed the Eosapien the Earth communication message. Ike was surrounded by Eosapiens and launched its sixth and last camera disk. The Eosapiens thought the camera disk was a threat and attacked it and possibly Ike, thus terminating surface operations of the mission. If an observer looks carefully, they can see that Ike is last seen being carried away by the Eosapien tribe and is presumed to have been destroyed, although his true fate is still debatable. It was the longest lasting probe on Darwin IV. Its color is yellow.

===Mini probes===
The Horus probes (Leo, Ike, and Balboa) carry mini-probes to venture into places too dangerous or too small for the Horus probes. The spiders and disks can be collected and recharged, while the balloons cannot.

====Camera disks====
Camera disks are small, flying-saucer like disks that can be launched and fly at high speeds. The disks are equipped with two small cameras to record video. The disks were considered as threats by the Eosapiens (Probably because they see them as throwing weapons), and was the main culprit for the probe's destruction. Leo, Ike, and Balboa each have six of them.

Ike constantly launched camera disks to study life-forms.

Camera disks 1, 5, and 6 from Ike were destroyed by native life. They were lost to - Daggerwrists (Because it "wasn't interested in posing"), Sea Striders (One stepped on the disk by accident), and Eosapiens (They mistook it for a threat for some reason, probably seeing it as throwing a weapon).  One of Leo's camera disks was destroyed by an Eosapien (Again, because the disk was mistaken for a threat).

====Weather balloons====
Green weather balloons are used to help Ike, Leo, and Balboa analyze the current weather conditions. They are built with a sensor that tells the Horus probes what is going on. They also have a small camera. Unlike the camera disks and spider probes, the weather balloons are not retrieved for re-use. It's unknown if any of them got destroyed by some force.

====Robotic spiders====
These robotic spiders are four-legged, and are used to help the Horus probes.

'''Atum''' ({{IPA|/ɑ.tum/}}, [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''jtm(w)'' or ''tm(w);'' [[Coptic language|Coptic]] {{Script/Coptic|ⲁⲧⲟⲩⲙ}} ''Atoum''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/entry.cgi?entry=4083&amp;super=1605|title=Coptic Dictionary Online|website=corpling.uis.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaew2.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/GetWcnDetails?wn=33040|title=Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae |website=[[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] |access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes rendered as '''Atem''' or '''Tem''', is an important [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] in [[Egyptian mythology]].

== Name ==
Atum's name is thought to be derived from the verb ''tm'' which means to complete or finish. Thus he has been interpreted as being the "complete one" and also the finisher of the world, which he returns to watery chaos at the end of the creative cycle. As creator he was seen as the underlying substance of the world, the deities and all things being made of his flesh or alternatively being his [[Egyptian soul#Ka|ka]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 99"&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Atum is one of the most important and frequently mentioned deities from earliest times, as evidenced by his prominence in the [[Pyramid Texts]], where he is portrayed as both a creator and father to the king.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 99"/&gt;

== Role ==
In the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|Heliopolitan creation myth]], Atum was considered to be the [[creator deity|first god]], having [[causa sui|created himself]], sitting on a mound ([[benben]]) (or identified with the mound itself), from the [[tohu wa-bohu|primordial waters]] ([[Naunet|Nu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The British Museum|title=Picture List|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1.1.4-PICTURE.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early myths state that Atum created the god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and goddess [[Tefnut]] by spitting them out of his mouth.&lt;ref name=Philae&gt;{{cite web|title=The Egyptian Gods: Atum|url=http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html#Atum|accessdate=December 30, 2006|ref=Egyptian gods Atum; URL accessedt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817021937/http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html|archivedate=2002-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how Atum did this, the myth uses the metaphor of [[masturbation]], with the hand he used in this act representing the [[Spirit|female principle]] inherent within him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', pp. 18, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Other interpretations state that he has made union with his shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experience-ancient-egypt.com/egyptian-creation-myth.html|title=The Egyptian Creation Myth&amp;nbsp;— How the World Was Born|website=Experience Ancient Egypt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109182713/http://www.experience-ancient-egypt.com/egyptian-creation-myth.html|archivedate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Old Kingdom]] the Egyptians believed that Atum lifted the dead king's soul from his pyramid to the starry heavens.&lt;ref name=Philae/&gt; He was also a [[solar deity]], associated with the primary sun god [[Ra]]. Atum was linked specifically with the evening sun, while Ra or the closely linked god [[Khepri]] were connected with the sun at morning and midday.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of the Dead]], which was still current in the Graeco-Roman period, the sun god Atum is said to have ascended from [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]-waters with the appearance of a [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]], the animal renewing itself every morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toorn|first1=Karel van der|last2=Becking|first2=Bob|last3=Horst|first3=Pieter Willem van der|title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible|date=1999|publisher=Wm.

Atum is the god of [[pre-existence]] and [[post-existence]]. In the binary [[Diurnal_motion|solar cycle]], the serpentine Atum is contrasted with the ram-headed scarab [[Khepri]]—the young sun god, whose name is derived from the Egyptian ''hpr'' "to come into existence". Khepri-Atum encompassed sunrise and sunset, thus reflecting the entire cycle of morning and evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toorn|first1=Karel van der|last2=Becking|first2=Bob|last3=Horst|first3=Pieter Willem van der|title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible|date=1999|publisher=Wm.

== Relationship to other gods ==
Atum was a [[causa sui|self-created deity]], the first being to emerge from the darkness and endless [[primordial ocean|watery abyss]] that existed before creation. A product of the energy and matter contained in this chaos, he created his children—the first deities, out of [[loneliness]]. He produced from his own sneeze, or in some accounts, semen, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], the god of air, and [[Tefnut]], the goddess of moisture. The brother and sister, curious about the primeval waters that surrounded them, went to explore the waters and disappeared into the darkness. Unable to bear his loss, Atum sent a fiery messenger, the [[Eye of Ra]], to find his children. The tears of joy he shed on their return were the [[protoplasts|first human beings]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Geraldine (2004). ''Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt.'' Oxford University Press. pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==

Atum is usually depicted as a man wearing either the royal head-cloth or the dual [[Hedjet|white]] and [[Deshret|red crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Lower Egypt]], reinforcing his connection with kingship. Sometimes he also is shown as a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], the form he returns to at the end of the creative cycle, and also occasionally as a [[mongoose]], [[lion]], [[Bull (mythology)|bull]], [[lizard]], or [[ape]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 99"/&gt;

== Worship ==

Atum's worship centered on the city of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Annu'' or ''Iunu'').&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 99"/&gt; The only surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the Temple of Re-Atum [[Egyptian obelisk|obelisk]] located in Al-Masalla of [[Al-Matariyyah|Al-Matariyyah, Cairo]]. It was erected by [[Senusret I]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth dynasty]], and still stands in its original position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OBELISK (Gr. b/3EXivrc... - Online Information article about OBELISK (Gr. b/3EXivrc...|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/NUM_ORC/OBELISK_Gr_b3EXivrcos_diminutiv.html|website=encyclopedia.jrank.org|ref=1911 edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|68|ft|2|abbr=on}} high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000&amp;nbsp;lbs, 108,900&amp;nbsp;kg), the weight of about 20 African elephants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2984">The '''Baron Tornado Index''' (BTI), also called '''Vipir Tornado Index''' (VTI) is a meteorological computer model. Its main usage is to determine the probabilities of a tornado inside a [[Tornadic Vortex Signature]] on the rear flank of a storm, to better alert potential high-risk areas for [[tornado]]es and to easily track them.

With the help of [[NEXRAD]] [[weather radar]] data, [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] models and algorithms, the index is measured on a scale of 0 to 10. The higher the BTI value is, the more likely a tornado is on the ground. Shear markers from different colors are used depending on the scale above 2. Yellow markers are used for values between 2 and 3.9, Orange markers are used for values between 4 and 6.9 and red markers are used for values over 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baronservices.com/bti/bti.php Baron Services: About BTI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303125309/http://www.baronservices.com/bti/bti.php |date=2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6528310.html|publisher=''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]''|date=2008-02-04|title=Small Scale for the Big Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/pages/s.0017/t.11648.html|publisher=TVtechnology.com|date=2008-02-29|title= Deployed Guardsman Uses Station’s Online Video to Give Family Tornado Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/baron_tornado_index_predicts_0125/ |publisher=''Broadcast Engineering'' |date=2008-01-25 |title=New Baron Tornado Index predicts likelihood of twisters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514202137/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/baron_tornado_index_predicts_0125/ |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product was developed and is marketed by [[Baron Services]] of [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and is a part of the company's [[VIPIR]] radar analysis product. The system is primarily used by television stations. The BTI first saw public usage in early 2008. [[WMC-TV]], the NBC affiliate in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] was the first station to implement the BTI during the [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak]] on February 5, 2008 when tracking tornadoes over the Memphis and [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] areas. The precise tracking of severe storms led WMC-TV in a significant viewer rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baronservices.com/news_pdf/BTI_success.pdf |publisher=''Baron Services'' |accessdate=2008-05-13 |title=Station's Severe Weather Coverage Results in Big Ratings Boost |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120021928/http://baronservices.com/news_pdf/BTI_success.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brabrand Lake''' ({{lang-da|Brabrand-søen or Brabrand Sø}}) is a lake in the district of [[Brabrand]] (Gellerup), west of [[Aarhus]] city, [[Denmark]]. The [[Aarhus River]] passes through Brabrand Lake and it is possible to [[canoe]] all the way to the inner city from here. The lake is oblong-shaped.

Since 2003, Brabrand Lake has been steadily extended 3–4&amp;nbsp;km further west, with the new lake of '''Årslev Engsø''' (lit.: Årslev meadow-lake). In 2001–2, it was politically decided to abandon the artificial draining of the meadows and as of 2013, Årslev meadow lake has a surface area of around {{convert|100|ha|acre}}. The total area including adjoining meadows and [[reed bed]]s totals {{convert|240|ha|acre}}. It is hoped that [[Eurasian bittern]] and [[otter]] will find themselves a new home here with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturinfo.dk/aarslevengsoe |title=The Årslev Engsø project |publisher=Aarhus municipality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103032205/http://www.naturinfo.dk/aarslevengsoe/ |archivedate=2012-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In everyday parlance, "Brabrand Lake" is a general term including the surroundings as well, indicating a total area of around {{convert|560|ha|acre}} with {{convert|253|ha|acre}} for the lake alone.

A public hiking trail surrounds the lake, whose landscape varies from wide meadows and reed beds to dense woods. Privately-owned pastures almost completely surround the lake and are not publicly accessible, but public paths leading to the lake are scattered in between. There are several [[Allotment (gardening)|garden allotments]] ("kolonihaver" in Danish) near Brabrand Lake and it is a popular recreational spot. It is a statutory goal of the Aarhus municipality to make the area publicly accessible and attractive to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhus.dk/da/borger/natur-og-miljoe/miljoeregnskab/natur/tilgaengelighed-til-bynaer-natur.aspx Accessibility to urban-close nature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203023607/http://www.aarhus.dk/da/borger/natur-og-miljoe/miljoeregnskab/natur/tilgaengelighed-til-bynaer-natur.aspx |date=2014-02-03 }} Aarhus municipality&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and sports==
[[File:Brabrandstien i Juni.jpg|left|thumb|Brabrandstien (1956) is a pathway running from the inner city of Aarhus and encircling both Brabrand Sø and Årslev Engsø. It is c. 26 km long.]]
''Brabrandstien'' (lit.: the Brabrand pathway), which runs along the Aarhus river from the [[Midtbyen (Aarhus)|inner city]] and around both Brabrand Sø and Årslev Engsø, was established by the City Council in 1956 as a labor project for the unemployed, to give the public better access to green space. The pathway is c. 26&amp;nbsp;km long, with 9.5&amp;nbsp;km for Brabrand Lake alone. With the addition of Årslev Engsø, the pathway grew another 8&amp;nbsp;km. A large part of Brabrandstien is asphalted and is popular for [[cycling]], [[rollerskating]] and [[jogging]]. Some of the graveled western parts are used for horseback riding. Cars are not allowed and motor vehicles are restricted. Brabrandstien is part of the Aarhus-Silkeborg hiking trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE4451949/historien-om-en-sti?page=2|title=The history of a pathway|language=Danish|author=Mogens Weinrich|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|date=13 November 2000|accessdate=18 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083411/http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE4451949/historien-om-en-sti?page=2|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/vis_artikel.asp?ArticleId=20439|title=A Layby at Brabrandstien|language=Danish|publisher=Aarhusportalen.dk|date=7 July 2005|accessdate=18 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085322/http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/vis_artikel.asp?ArticleId=20439|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/publikationer/2009/mar/vandreruten-aarhus-silkeborg/|title=Vandreruten Århus-Silkeborg|language=Danish|publisher=Århus Amt, Natur- og Miljøkontore|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the northern bank of Brabrand Lake lies the facilities of ''Brabrand Rostadion'' (Brabrand Rowing Stadium). The stadium was established in 1952 and was heavily renovated and rebuilt in the year 2010. [[C. F. Møller Architects]] was the architectural firm behind the new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfmoller.com/p/brabrand-rostadion-i2580.html Brabrand Rostadion] C. F. Møller&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[kayak]]ing clubs have used the lake for practice and larger [[regatta]]s for many years. ''Rocenter Aarhus RCA'' (Aarhus Rowing Center) is located here, offering qualified training for rowers and clubs in East and South [[Jutland]] on all levels (including elite) and for all ages. There is a 2,000 m racing track on Brabrand Lake and it is generally perceived as very good for [[outrigger]] racing, but other types of boats are also rowed here, including [[kayak]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarhus.dk/omkommunen/nyheder/2010/3--kvartal/Det-nye-Brabrand-Rostadion-indvies-i-morgen.aspx The new 'Brabrand Rostadion' is inaugurated Thursday] Aarhus Municipality (22.09.2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rostadion.dk/ Aarhus Rostadion, Brabrand] A meta-site on the rowing activities associated with Brabrand Rostadion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asr.dk/brabrand Brabrand Rostadion] Homepage under the Aarhus Studentclub&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aarhus Roklub'' (Aarhus Rowing Club), based here, have scored several prestigious medals. In 2005, [[Maria Pertl]] won silver in the [[World Rowing Championships]] in collaboration with [[Juliane Elander Rasmussen]]. In 2011, [[Andrej Lawaetz Bendtsen]] won gold at the WRC for seniors in a team of four.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aarhus.lokalavisen.dk/vm-guld-til-aarhus-roer-/Sport/20110725/artikler/110729668/1454 WC gold to Aarhus rower] Lokalavisen Aarhus (25th of July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental projects ==

The lake is not very deep and has suffered from [[eutrophication]] for many years. The excessive nutrients originate from waste water and agricultural activities and pose a constant environmental threat to the surrounding ecology and the Bay of Aarhus. Eutrophication is a common problem all over the developed world. Starting in 1959 with 158 hectares, several environmental projects have aimed to alleviate the environmental burdens and at the same time maintain the aesthetic value of the lake and surrounding areas. These projects includes mud pumping of the lakebed and [[willow]] afforestations. Also, the local water company ''Aarhus Vand A/S'' began extracting phosphor from wastewater in 2013 at a water treatment plant in [[Aaby, Aarhus|Åby]] close to the lake. [[Phosphor]] is a key element in the eutrophication process but a valuable resource on its own and the water treatment plant is among only a few in the world to engage with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhusvand.dk/en/international/new_solutions/from-wastewater-to-valuable-fertiliser2/|title=From wastewater to valuable fertiliser|publisher=Aarhus Vand|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stiften.dk/aarhus/AAby-Renseanlaeg-skal-lave-supergoedning/artikel/160503|title=Åby Renseanlæg skal lave supergødning|trans-title=Åby treatment plant to make superfertilizer|publisher=Århus Stiftstidende|author=|date=3 June 2013|language=Danish|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that the [[rich fen]] ecology which formerly characterized the lake, and is a threatened nature-type in general, can be restored in the future.&lt;ref name="Natura2000 Plan 233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brabrand Lake"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brabrand Lake|url=http://www.visitdenmark.fr/fr/tellus-product/653347|publisher=VisitDenmark|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.dk/Default.aspx?ID=26501| title=The struggle for life in Aarhus Bay |publisher=The Danish Society for Nature Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The groundwater beneath and adjoining Brabrand Lake is very important, as it provides drinking water to more than 100,000 people in the greater Aarhus area. Acting partly on this fact, the lake water was also included in a large water treatment project led by ''Aarhus Vand A/S'' from 2006 to 2013. The project involved the Brabrand Lake, the Aarhus River and the Aarhus habour, budgeted at [[euro sign|€]] 45 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhusvand.dk/projekter/spildevand/overordnede-planer/soerne-aen-og-havnen/|title=Renere vand i havn, å og søer|trans-title=Cleaner water in harbour, stream and lakes|publisher=Aarhus Vand|language=Danish|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the waters in Brabrand Lake and the Aarhus River attained bathing quality in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.danva.dk/nyheder/2012/aarhus-vand-fejrede-god-vandkvalitet-i-aarhus-%C3%A5-og-brabrand-soe-med-ol-roere/|title=Aarhus Vand fejrede god vandkvalitet i Aarhus Å og Brabrand Sø med OL-roere|trans-title=Aarhus Vand celebrated good water quality in Aarhus River and Brabrand Lake with Olympic rowers|publisher=DANVA|author=Birgitte Skjøtt|language=Danish|date=25 September 2012|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateofgreen.com/en/Profiles/City-of-Aarhus/Solutions/Safeguarding-the-Bathing-Water-Quality-of-the-Stream-Aarhus-A Safeguarding the Bathing Water Quality of the Stream Aarhus Å] State of Green {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special flora and fauna ==
Many species of flora and fauna at Brabrand Lake are either rare or relatively rare in Denmark and on the Danish Red List (under [[IUCN Red List]]). Some also are protected under different [[Habitats Directive|habitat directive]]s of the EU. Here are a few examples:&lt;ref name="List of Species"/&gt;
* Several [[Lathyrus]] species grow here, such as the [[Lathyrus tuberosus|tuberous pea]], which is rare in Denmark, and the relatively rare [[Lathyrus palustris|marsh pea]].
* Several relatively rare [[Juncus|rush]] species grow here, such as [[Juncus inflexus|European hard rush]], [[Juncus squarrosus|heath rush]] and [[Juncus tenuis|slender rush]].
* Several orchids of the [[Dactylorhiza]] species are found growing here. Worthy of special mention is the common [[Dactylorhiza majalis|western marsh orchid]] and the relatively rare [[Dactylorhiza incarnata|early marsh orchid]], both of which are protected and mentioned in the Danish Nature Protection Law ( §3) and the Washington Convention (list II.B). Although the ''w.m. orchid'' is one of the most common orchids in Denmark, it is also included due to alarming population decline.
* The [[white stork]]s occasionally resting here are critically endangered (CR) and relatively rare in Denmark.
* The [[common nightingale]] living here is rare in Denmark. The [[thrush nightingale]], common in Denmark, is also found at the lake.
* Årslev Engsø regularly attracts rare birds such as [[osprey]] (CR), [[white-tailed eagle]] (vulnerable VU), [[peregrine falcon]] (extinct as breeders RE), [[little gull]] (RE), [[mediterranean gull]], [[black tern]] (endangered EN), [[caspian tern]], [[spotted crake]] (near threatened NT), [[broad-billed sandpiper]], [[red-necked phalarope]] and [[water pipit]].
* The [[Aeshna viridis|green hawker]] dragonflies are near threatened (NT) and rare in Denmark. They have been protected here under the EU habitat directive (IV) since 1992.
* The population of [[pond bat]]s living at Brabrand Lake is protected under the Natura 2000 Plan 233.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.habitatarter.dk/udpegningsomraader.asp?id=233 |title= Habitat species (in Denmark)| publisher=Naturbasen ApS and Natural History Museum Aarhus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pond bats are endangered (EN) in western Europe, but maybe only near threatened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/14127/0 |title= The IUCN Red List on Pond Bats}}{{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these rarer species, the Brabrand Lake area is characterized by many common species living here, mostly birds, insects and aquatic plants.

== Archaeological finds ==
The area around Brabrand Lake has been populated for at least 6,000 years. In prehistoric times, Brabrand Lake was part of a deep [[brackish water]] [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]], offering natural protection and food in abundance. There were archaeological excavations here as early as 1903, revealing early [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] settlements and activities from the [[Ertebølle culture|Ertebølle Culture]]. The Brabrand Lake area is still an active archaeological site today and has revealed [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] settlements and [[Vikings|Viking]] activities such as a large shipbuilding yard.

'''Climate ethics''' is an area of research that focuses on the ethical dimensions of climate change (also known as [[global warming]]), and concepts such as [[climate justice]].

Human-induced climate change raises many profound [[Ethics|ethical]] questions, yet many {{Who||date=February 2012}} believe that these ethical issues have not been addressed adequately in climate change policy debates or in the scientific and economic literature on climate change; and that, consequently, ethical questions are being overlooked or obscured in climate negotiations, policies and discussions . It has been pointed out that those most responsible for climate change are not the same people as those most vulnerable to its effects.

Terms such as [[climate justice]] and ecological justice ('eco justice') are used worldwide, and have been adopted by various organizations.

== Overview ==

An article in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (Patz, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Impact of regional climate change on human health|volume=438|pages=310–317|date=17 November 2005|doi=10.1038/nature04188|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/nature04188.html|first1=Jonathan A|last1=Patz|first2=Diarmid|last2=Campbell-Lendrum|first3=Tracey|last3=Holloway|first4=Jonathan A|last4=Foley|bibcode=2005Natur.438..310P}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the human-induced warming that the world is now experiencing is already causing 150,000 deaths and 5 million incidents of disease each year from additional [[malaria]] and [[diarrhea]], mostly in the poorest nations.  Death and disease incidents are likely to soar as warming increases. Facts such as this demonstrate that climate change is compromising rights to life, liberty and personal security.  Hence, ethical analysis of climate change policy must examine how that policy  impacts on those basic rights.

Climate change raises a number of particularly challenging ethical issues about [[distributive justice]], in particular concerning how to fairly share the benefits and burdens of climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems such as [[cost-benefit analysis]] usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution.

== ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' ==

In December 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' was launched at the 10th Conference of Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].  The major outcome of this meeting was the Buenos Aires Declaration on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change.

===Objectives===
The program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change seeks to:
*Facilitate express examination of ethical dimensions of climate change particularly for those issues entailed by specific positions taken by governments, businesses, NGOs, organizations, or individuals on climate change policy matters;
*Create better understanding about the ethical dimensions of climate change among policy makers and the general public;
*Assure that people around the world, including those most vulnerable to climate change, participate in any ethical inquiry about responses to climate change;
*Develop an interdisciplinary approach to inquiry about the ethical dimensions of climate change and support publications that examine the ethical dimensions of climate change;
*Make the results of scholarship on the ethical dimensions of climate change available to and accessible to policy makers, scientists, and citizen groups;
*Integrate ethical analysis into the work of other institutions engaged in climate change policy including the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change and the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.

===Position===
Given the severity of impact to be expected and given the likelihood that some level of important disruptions in living conditions will occur for great numbers of people due to climate change events, this group contends that there is sufficient convergence among ethical principles to make a number of concrete recommendations on how governments should act, or identify ethical problems with positions taken by certain governments, organizations, or individuals.

Facts about climate change and fundamental human rights provide the starting point for climate ethics.

'''Cryptomelane''' is a [[potassium]] [[manganese]] [[oxide mineral]] with formula K(Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;.

In 1942 the name ''cryptomelane'' was proposed as part of an effort to sort out the manganese oxide minerals referred to as ''psilomelane''. Cryptomelane was identified and defined based on [[X-ray diffraction]] studies of samples from [[Tombstone, Arizona]]; [[Deming, New Mexico]]; [[Mena, Arkansas]]; and [[Philipsburg, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM27/AM27_607.pdf Richmond, W. E., and Fleischer, M., ''Cryptomelane, a new name for the commonest of the "psilomelane" minerals,'' American Mineralogist, 27, 607, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptomelane was approved in 1982 by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).  The [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] is the [[Tombstone District]], [[Cochise County, Arizona]], US. The name comes from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] for hidden and black, in reference to the confusion and difficulty in recognition of the various black manganese oxide minerals referred to as ''[[psilomelane]]'', the collective term for hard manganese oxides.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

It is of rather common occurrence in [[Redox|oxidized]] manganese deposits where it occurs as replacements and open space fillings in [[Vein (geology)|veins]] and [[vug]]s. It occurs in association with [[pyrolusite]], [[nsutite]], [[braunite]], [[chalcophanite]], [[manganite]] and various other manganese oxides.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

A '''dication''' is any [[cation]], of general formula X&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, formed by the removal of two [[electrons]] from a neutral species.

Diatomic dications corresponding to stable neutral species (e.g. {{chem|H|2|2+}} formed by removal of two electrons from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) often decay quickly into two singly charged particles (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), due to the loss of electrons in bonding molecular orbitals. Energy levels of diatomic dications can be studied with good resolution by measuring the yield of pairs of zero-kinetic-energy electrons from double [[photoionization]] of a molecule as a function of the photoionizing wavelength (threshold photoelectrons coincidence [[spectroscopy]] – TPEsCO). The {{chem|He|2|2+}} dication is kinetically stable.

An example of a stable diatomic dication which is not formed by oxidation of a neutral diatomic molecule is the [[dimercury]] dication {{chem|Hg|2|2+}}. An example of a polyatomic dication is {{chem|S|8|2+}}, formed by oxidation of S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and unstable with respect to further oxidisation over time to form SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Many organic dications can be detected in [[mass spectrometry]] for example {{chem|CH|4|2+}} (a {{chem|CH|2|2+|·H|2}} complex) and the acetylene dication {{chem|C|2|H|2|2+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lammertsma |first1=K. |last2=von Ragué Schleyer |first2=P. |last3=Schwarz |first3=H. |date=1989 |title=Organic Dications: Gas Phase Experiments and Theory in Concert |journal=Angew.

Some metals are commonly found in the form of dications when in the form of salts, or dissolved in water. Examples include the [[alkaline earth]] metals (Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ra&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;); later [[transition metal]]s (V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;); [[group 12 element]]s (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;); and the heavy members of the [[carbon group]] (Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).

'''Differential dynamic microscopy'''
Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) is an optical technique that allows performing [[light scattering]] experiments by means of a simple [[optical microscope]].&lt;ref name="cerbino08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cerbino | first1 = R. | last2 = Trappe | first2 = V. | year = 2008 | title = Differential dynamic microscopy: Probing wavevector-dependent dynamics with a microscope | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.188102 | journal = Phys.

E | volume = 80 | issue = | page = 031403 | bibcode = 2009PhRvE..80c1403G | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/12910/files/trappe_sio.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; DDM is suitable for typical [[Soft matter|soft materials]] such as for instance [[liquid]]s or [[gels]] made of [[colloids]], [[polymers]] and [[liquid crystal]]s but also for biological materials like bacteria and [[Cell (biology)|cells]].

==The basic idea==
The typical DDM data is a time sequence of microscope images (movie) acquired at some height within the sample (typically at its mid-plane). If the image intensity is locally proportional to the concentration of particles or molecules to be studied (possibly convoluted with the microscope [[Point spread function|point spread function (PSF)]]), each movie can be analyzed in the Fourier space to obtain information about the dynamics of concentration Fourier modes, '''independent on the fact that the particles/molecules can be individually optically resolved or not'''. After suitable calibration also information about the Fourier amplitude of the concentration modes can be extracted.

==Applicability and working principle==
The concentration-intensity proportionality is valid at least in two very important cases that distinguish two corresponding classes of DDM methods:

# '''scattering-based DDM''': where the image is the result of the superposition of the strong transmitted beam with the weakly scattered light from the particles. Typical cases where this condition can be obtained are [[Bright field microscopy|bright field]], [[phase contrast]], [[Polarized light microscopy|polarized]] microscopes.
# '''fluorescence-based DDM''': where the image is the result of the incoherent addition of the intensity emitted by the particles ([[Fluorescent microscope|fluorescence]], [[Confocal microscopy|confocal]]) microscopes

In both cases the convolution with the [[Point spread function|PSF]] in the [[real coordinate space|real space]] corresponds to a simple product in the [[Reciprocal space|Fourier space]], which guarantees that studying a given Fourier mode of the image intensity provides information about the corresponding Fourier mode of the concentration field. In contrast with [[Single particle tracking|particle tracking]], there is no need of resolving the individual particles, which allows DDM to characterize the dynamics of particles or other moving entities whose size is much smaller than the wavelength of light. Still, the images are acquired in the real space, which provides several advantages with respect to traditional (far field) scattering methods.

==Data analysis==
DDM is based on an algorithm proposed in&lt;ref name="croccolo06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Croccolo | first1 = F. | last2 = Brogioli | first2 = D. | last3 = Vailati | first3 = A. | last4 = Giglio | first4 = M. | last5 = Cannell | first5 = D. S. | year = 2006 | title = Use of dynamic schlieren interferometry to study fluctuations during free diffusion | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 45 | issue = | page = 2166 | doi=10.1364/ao.45.002166| bibcode = 2006ApOpt..45.2166C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and,&lt;ref name="alaimo06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alaimo | first1 = M. | last2 = Magatti | first2 = D. | last3 = Ferri | first3 = F. | last4 = Potenza | first4 = M.A.C. | year = 2006 | title = Heterodyne speckle velocimetry | url = | journal = Appl. Phys. Lett. | volume = 88 | issue = | page = 191101 | doi=10.1063/1.2200396| bibcode = 2006ApPhL..88s1101A }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is conveniently named [[Differential Dynamic Algorithm|Differential Dynamic Algorithm (DDA)]]. DDA works by subtracting images acquired at different times and taking advantage that, as the delay &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; between two subtracted images gets large, the energy content of the difference image increases correspondingly. A two-dimensional [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)]] analysis of the difference images allows to quantify the growth of the signal contains for each wave vector &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and one can calculate the Fourier power spectrum of the difference images for different delays &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the so-called ''image structure function'' &lt;math&gt;D(q;\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;. Calculation shows that for both scattering- and fluorescence-based DDM
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;D(q;\Delta t) =B(q)+T(q)I(q)[1-f(q;\Delta t)] \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;f(q;\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized [[intermediate scattering function]] that would be measured in a [[Dynamic light scattering|Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)]] experiment, &lt;math&gt;I(q)&lt;/math&gt; the sample scattering intensity that would be measured in a [[Static light scattering|Static Light Scattering (SLS)]] experiment, &lt;math&gt;B(q)&lt;/math&gt; a background term due to the noise along the detection chain &lt;math&gt;T(q)&lt;/math&gt; a transfer function that depends on the microscope details.&lt;ref name="giavazzi09" /&gt; Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) shows that DDM can be used for [[Dynamic light scattering|DLS]] experiments, provided that a model for the normalized [[intermediate scattering function]] is available.&lt;ref name="giavazzi09" /&gt; For instance, in the case of [[Brownian motion]] one has &lt;math&gt;f(q;\Delta t)=e^{-Dq^{2}\Delta t},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]] of the Brownian particles. If the transfer function &lt;math&gt;T(q)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by calibrating the microscope with a suitable sample, DDM can be employed also for [[Static light scattering|SLS]] experiments. Alternative algorithms for data analysis are suggested in.&lt;ref name="giavazzi09" /&gt;

==Relationship with other imaging-based scattering methods==
Scattering-based DDM belongs to the so-called '''near-field (or deep Fresnel) scattering''' family,&lt;ref name="cerbino09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cerbino | first1 = R. | last2 = Vailati | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Near-field scattering techniques: Novel instrumentation and results from time and spatially resolved investigations of soft matter systems", Curr. Op. Coll. Int | doi = 10.1016/j.cocis.2009.07.003 | journal = Science | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 416–425 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a recently introduced family of imaging-based scattering methods.&lt;ref name="giglio00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giglio | first1 = M. | last2 = Carpineti | first2 = M. | last3 = Vailati | first3 = A. | year = 2000 | title = Space intensity correlations in the near field of the scattered light: a direct measurement of the density correlation function g(r) | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1416 | journal = Phys.

The near field scattering family includes also quantitative [[shadowgraph]]y&lt;ref name="wu95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = M. | last2 = Ahlers | first2 = G. | last3 = Cannell | first3 = D.

==Applications of DDM==
DDM was introduced in 2008 and it was applied for characterizing the dynamics of [[colloidal particle]]s in [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref name="cerbino08" /&gt; More recently it has been successfully applied also to the study of aggregation processes of colloidal nanoparticles,&lt;ref name="ferri11"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferri | first1 = F. | last2 = D'Angelo | first2 = A. | last3 = Lee | first3 = M. | last4 = Lotti | first4 = A. | last5 = Pigazzini | first5 = M.C. | last6 = Singh | first6 = K. | last7 = Cerbino | first7 = R. | year = 2011 | title = Kinetics of colloidal fractal aggregation by differential dynamic microscopy | doi = 10.1140/epjst/e2011-01509-9 | journal = Eur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3962">'''Display Energy Certificates''' (DECs) are records of the actual energy usage of public buildings, introduced by a number of European governments in response to the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which all EU member states had to implement by January 2009. DECs are designed to increase transparency about the energy efficiency of public buildings. The certificate looks similar to the energy labels provided on new cars and electrical appliances such as fridges and freezers – it uses a similar scale for energy efficiency, i.e. from A to G with A being the most efficient and G the least. The aim of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is for the public to receive energy information about a building they are visiting.

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the display of a DEC became mandatory for all public buildings over 1,000m² from 1 January, 2009. Since 9 July 2015, all public buildings in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] over 250m² must display a DEC prominently at all times.  Where the building has a total useful floor area of more than 1,000m², a UK DEC is valid for 12 months. The accompanying advisory report is valid for seven years. Where the building has a total useful floor area of between 250m² and 999m², the DEC and advisory report are valid for 10 years.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

DECs are designed to promote the improvement of the energy performance of buildings. The A3 sized certificate is valid for one year and is accompanied by an Advisory Report (AR) which is valid for seven years. The advisory report is designed to help building owners and occupiers to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings so that future DECs show a better rating. ARs do not need to be displayed, but must be available.

DECs and ARs must be undertaken by an accredited energy assessors using approved software. In order to produce the DEC the energy assessor needs to know the gross internal floor area of the building and the operating hours together with actual meter readings or consignment notes for all fuels used during the year of assessment. It is, therefore, important for owners and occupiers of public buildings over 1,000m² to maintain good records of fuel used. If the energy assessor does not have access to suitable and sufficient information then a DEC cannot be produced.

==United Kingdom==
The option to generate a default G rating was withdrawn in the UK on April 16, 2011.

The penalty for each breach is £500 for failing to display a DEC at all times in a prominent place clearly visible to the public and £1,000 for failing to have possession of a valid advisory report. In addition to these penalties, it is still necessary to commission a DEC and an advisory report.

In the future the Government is expected to extend the requirement for DECs large privately owned buildings which the public have access to, such as supermarkets.

The '''earth pyramids of Ritten''' (German: ''Erdpyramiden am Ritten''; {{lang-it|Piramidi di terra del Renon}} {{IPA-it|piˈraːmidi di ˈtɛrra del reˈnon|}}) are a natural monument that is located on the [[Ritten]], a [[plateau]] not far from [[Bolzano]] in northern Italy. The [[earth pyramids of South Tyrol]] are a fairly widespread phenomenon which are existing in various locations.

&lt;!-- [[File:RittenLehmpyramiden.jpg|left|thumb|Another view of the Pyramids of the Ritten towards Mittelberg]] picture not upright, fj --&gt;
The original name in this area for these earth pyramids is ''Lahntürme'', i.e. landslide towers.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Paul Stacul, ''Die erste Erwähnung der Südtiroler Erdpyramiden'' (''The first mention of the South Tyrolean earth pyramides''), in "[[Der Schlern]]", 51, 1977, pp. 675-678.&lt;/ref&gt; They are rather unusual formations of their kind which originate from morainic rocks of glacial origin. The columns of the pyramids may be more or less elongated, and the higher they are the thinner they get, ending usually with a stone cover. These earth pyramids are not static, they are constantly evolving, because their life cycle foresees a continuous [[erosion]], or even a final collapse leaving room for new formations.

In [[South Tyrol]] there are other natural monuments like this such as the [[earth pyramids of Platten]], but the ones of Ritten are considered the parents of them all.

The '''East–West pipeline''' is a [[natural gas]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] in [[Turkmenistan]].  It will carry natural gas from gas fields in eastern Turkmenistan to the coast of [[Caspian Sea]] across the southern part of the country.

==History==
In 2007–2008, Russia and Turkmenistan negotiated construction of the East–West pipeline to supply the planned [[Caspian Coastal pipeline]], an extension of the [[Central Asia–Center gas pipeline system]]. The pipeline was to be built in cooperation with the Russian gas company [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref name=rbc240510/&gt;  The main designated contractor was Zarubezhneftegaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom.&lt;ref name=edm210409&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on 27 March 2009 after tensions between Russia and Turkmenistan over gas supplies from Turkmenistan to Russia, Turkmenistan launched an international tender for the pipeline.&lt;ref name=edm210409/&gt;&lt;ref name=nca060409&gt;

'''Ed Baird''' (born May 17, 1958) is an [[United States|American]] sailor. He was a coach of the [[1995 America's Cup]]-winning [[Team New Zealand]] and a [[helmsman]] for the [[2007 America's Cup]]-winning [[Alinghi]] syndicate.&lt;ref name=sailworld&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sail-world.com/usa/index.cfm?nid=35679&amp;rid=4|title=A Great Week and a Great Year for Ed Baird|date=13 July 2007|work=sailworld.com|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in Florida, Baird raced in the [[Optimist (dinghy)|Optimist]] class at junior level, before moving onto other dinghies. He won the World [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]] Championships in 1980 and the World [[J/24]] Championships in 1983.&lt;ref name="sailworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americascup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://32nd.americascup.com/en/acclopaedia/circlinggalaxy/profil.php?idIndex=&amp;idContent=5191|title=Ed Baird|work=32nd America's Cup: official website|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Baird joined [[Team New Zealand]] as a coach for the [[1995 America's Cup]], guiding the syndicate to New Zealand's first ever Cup win. In the same year, he won the World Match Racing Championships,&lt;ref name="americascup"/&gt; and was named the [[US Sailor of the Year Awards|US's Yachtsman of the Year]].&lt;ref name="ISAF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sailing.org/21232.php|title=Claire LEROY And Ed BAIRD Enter The Select Circle|date=7 November 2007|work=[[International Sailing Federation]]|accessdate=23 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430074244/http://www.sailing.org/21232.php|archivedate=30 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, he skippered ''Young America'' in the Louis Vuitton series to determine the challenger for the following year's America's Cup, but the syndicate's challenge faltered when one of its two yachts nearly sank in a race against a Japanese team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/baird-crew-overboard-as-wave-hits-challenge-741498.html|title=Baird crew overboard as wave hits challenge|last=McFadden|first=Suzanne|date=10 November 1999|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing highlights==
Baird has also ventured into open water racing, having competed in [[Volvo Ocean Race|round the world races]] in 1997–98 (for ''[[Innovation Kvaerner]]'') and 2001–02 (for ''[[Djuice Dragons]]'').&lt;ref name="americascup"/&gt; As part of these offshore racing challenges, Baird was a member of the winning team in the grueling, Sydney to Hobart Race in 2000, aboard the maxi yacht, ''[[Nicorette II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lulham, Amanda, and James Breshnehan. "Sweden Smell of Success." ''Hobart Mercury'', 29 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[helmsman]] of the [[Alinghi]] team for the [[2007 America's Cup]], he led the syndicate to win the series 5-2 against his former team, [[Team New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2007-07-08-655804655_x.htm|title=Swiss celebrate return of America's Cup winner Alinghi|last=Engeler|first=Eliane|date=8 July 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, he was named the [[International Sailing Federation]]'s male [[ISAF World Sailor of the Year|World Sailor of the Year]].&lt;ref name="ISAF"/&gt;

Winning 4 of 5 events, Baird skippered Alinghi’s [[Extreme 40]] to a dominant win on the [[Extreme Sailing Series|iShares Extreme-40 Catamaran Circuit]] in 2008. He then coached team owner, [[Ernesto Bertarelli]], who helmed the massive catamaran, [[Alinghi 5]] in the [[2010 America's Cup]].

From 2011 to 2016, Baird skippered the US-flagged, Quantum Racing [[TP 52]] to win 4 seasons of the [[Audi MedCup]]/52 Super Series  and three TP 52 World Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transpac 52 class - Quantum Racing|url=http://www.transpac52.org/teams/teams2008/quantum-racing.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520053026/http://www.transpac52.org/teams/teams2008/quantum-racing.html|archivedate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird currently races on international circuits for the TP 52 and [[RC 44]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rc44.com/teams/view/synergy_sailing_team|title=» Teams » RC Forty Four|author=OC Thirdpole|work=rc44.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While best known as a champion match racer and fleet racing helmsman, Baird has also coached world and Olympic champions such as [[Anna Tunnicliffe]], Sally Barkow and [[Kevin Mahaney]].  He was a premier instructor for North-U’s Tactical and speed clinics in the 90’s, has written an instructional book (''Laser Racing'') and over a hundred tactical how-to articles.  Baird has worked with [[ESPN]], [[OLN|Outdoor Life Network]], [[NBC Sports Network|Versus]] and [[Television New Zealand]] as an expert commentator for shows about sailboat racing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5501">==Oil==
Paraguay consumed {{convert|28000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of [[petroleum]] in 2006. It does not currently produce any [[crude oil]]. In February 2006, Paraguay’s Public Works Ministry announced that oil had been discovered in the western [[Gran Chaco|Chaco region]] by British oil company [[CDS Energy Services|CDS]], though CDS stated that the reservoir was too tight to facilitate unassisted oil production.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Paraguay_Uruguay/Background.html Country analysis brief: Paraguay/Uruguay]. [[Energy Information Administration]] (November 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

State-owned [[Petróleos Paraguayos]] (Petropar) has a monopoly on all crude oil and petroleum product sales and imports in Paraguay. It operates Paraguay's sole refinery, the {{convert|7500|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} Villa Elisa facility.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

Like many oil-importing countries in the Western Hemisphere, Paraguay has tried to foster the development of special deals for importing crude oil and refined products from [[Venezuela]]. Paraguay, along with [[Uruguay]], signed a deal in 2005 to receive crude oil imports from Venezuela under preferential financing terms. In December 2005, [[ANCAP (Uruguay)|ANCAP]] and [[PdVSA]], the Uruguayan and Venezuelan national oil companies, agreed to fund a study for the proposed doubling of the capacity at the La Teja plant. The project, which would cost an estimated $800 million, would also upgrade facilities at the refinery so that it could handle heavier Venezuelan crude varieties.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

==Natural gas==
Paraguay has no proven [[natural gas reserves]], and it neither produces nor consumes natural gas. In recent years, the country has sought to promote the consumption of natural gas as a way to decrease the use of firewood and charcoal, which has contributed to deforestation in the country. However, barriers to natural gas consumption include a lack of domestic natural gas production and the absence of import pipelines.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

Paraguay has attracted some interest from international natural gas companies, with UK-based CDS Oil &amp; Gas announcing in early 2004 that it had successfully completed a production test at its Independencia-1 well in the northwestern part of the country. Other companies that have signed exploration concessions with Paraguay’s government include [[H.A &amp; E.R. Exploraciones]], [[Pilcomayo Petróleos]] S.A., [[Hidroener Consultora]], [[Guaraní Exploration]], [[Union Oil]], [[Paraguay Gas]], [[Boreal Petróleos]], [[Aurora Petróleos]] and [[Amerisur]].&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

Paraguay has pursued several natural gas import options. In 2001, Brazil proposed the [[Gas Integration Project]] (Gasin), a natural gas pipeline linking Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. There has not been much progress to date on the implementation of this proposal. In 2002, the Bolivian and Paraguayan governments signed a preliminary agreement allowing for the construction of a pipeline from southern Bolivia to Asuncion. In June 2006, the two governments approved a plan to move forward with the pipeline, which would have an initial capacity of {{convert|700|e6cuft/d|m3/d}} and require an investment of at least $2 billion.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

==Electricity==
Paraguay [[electricity generation|generated]] 51.8 [[terawatt]]-hours of electricity in 2004, while consuming only 3.1 TWh. Almost all of the country’s electricity consumption comes from a single facility, the bi-national [[Itaipu dam]]. Paraguay is one of the world’s largest net exporters of electric power.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

Paraguay's state-owned utility, [[Administracion Nacional de Electricidad]] (ANDE), controls the country’s entire electricity market, including generation, distribution and transmission. It operates a single [[hydroelectric]] dam, [[Acaray Dam|Acaray]], and six [[thermal power plant]]s, with total installed capacity of 220 megawatts (MW). The company is also responsible for Paraguay’s share of two bi-national hydroelectric facilities (see below). ANDE operates {{convert|2100|mi|km|order=flip}} of transmission lines and {{convert|670|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of distribution lines. Over 92 percent of the country has electricity service.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

Paraguay operates two hydroelectric dams in cooperation with its neighbors: [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu]] (Brazil) and [[Yacyretá Dam|Yacyreta]] (Argentina). The Itaipu dam was the largest hydroelectric facility in the world, before the completion of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China. Itaipu has 18 generators and a total installed capacity of 14,000 MW, evenly shared between Paraguay and Brazil. In 2004, Paraguay consumed 16 percent of its share of Itaipu production, exporting the rest to Brazil. Yacyreta, completed in 1999, has 20 generators and a total installed capacity of 3,100 MW. In 2014 Paraguay consumed almost 5 percent of its share of Yacyreta’s production, exporting the rest to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/revelan-cifra-que-usara-argentina-para-revision-de-tratado-de-yacyreta Revelan cifra que usará Argentina para revisión del tratado de Yacyretá]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, Ente Binacional Yacyreta, the binational company responsible for operating the facility, announced that it was cancelling the planned Aña Cuá expansion of the facility.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;

A '''flood risk assessment''' (FRA) is an [[Risk assessment|assessment of the risk]] of [[flood]]ing from all flooding mechanisms, the identification of flood mitigation measures and should provide advice on actions to be taken before and during a flood.

The sources of water which produce floods include:
* [[Groundwater]] (saturated groundwater)
* [[Vadose zone|Vadose]] (water flowing the ground in an unsaturated state)
* Surface water
* Artificial water (burst water mains, canals or reservoirs)
* Rivers, streams or watercourses
* Sewers and drains
*Flooding of low-lying coastal regions due to [[sea level rise]]

For each of the sources of water, different hydraulic intensities occur. Floods can occur because of a combination of sources of flooding, such as high groundwater and an inadequate surface water drainage system. The topography, hydrogeology and physical attributes of the existing or proposed development need to be considered. A flood risk assessment should be an evaluation of the flood risk and the consequences and impact and [http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/flood-risk-and-coastal-change/flood-zone-and-flood-risk-tables/table-2-flood-risk-vulnerability-classification/ vulnerability].

''Non-professiona''l flood risk assessments can be produced by members of the public, Architects, environment assessors, or others who are not specifically professionally qualified in this field. However, it is a complex evaluation and such assessments they can be rejected by Authorities as inadequate, or could be considered as negligent in the event of a flooding event, damage and a claim to insurers being made.

'''In the UK, the writing of''' '''''professional''''' '''flood risk assessments''' '''is undertaken by Civil Engineering Consultants'''. They will have membership of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] and are bound by their [https://www.ice.org.uk/ICEDevelopmentWebPortal/media/Documents/About%20Us/ice-code-of-professional-conduct.pdf rules of professional conduct]. A key requirement is to ensure such professional flood risk assessments are independent to all parties by carrying out their professional duties with complete objectivity and impartiality. Their professional advice should be supported by [[professional indemnity insurance]] for such specific professional advice ultimately held with a [[Lloyd's of London]] underwriter.

Professional flood risk assessments can cover single buildings, or whole regions. They can part of a due-diligence process for existing householders or businesses, or can be required in England and Wales to provide independent evidence to a planning application on the flood risk.

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales, the [[Environment Agency]] requires a professional Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to be submitted alongside planning applications in areas that are known to be at risk of flooding (within flood zones 2 or 3) and/ or are greater than 1ha in area, [[planning permission]] is not usually granted until the FRA has been accepted by the Environment Agency.

===PPS 25 – England only===
Flood Risk Assessments are required to be completed according to the National Planning Policy Framework,&lt;ref&gt;National Planning Policy Framework (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf) "National Planning Policy Framework"&lt;/ref&gt; which replaces [[Planning Policy Statement]] PPS 25: Development and Flood Risk. The initial legislation (PPG25) was introduced in 2001 and subsequently revised.&lt;ref&gt;HMSO (2006, Revised 2010) [http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/planningpolicystatement25.pdf ''Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215083945/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/planningpolicystatement25.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}, TSO, London. {{ISBN|978-0-11-754099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PPS 25]] was designed to "strengthen and clarify the key role of the planning system in managing flood risk and contributing to adapting to the impacts of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Angela  Smith  MP (7 December 2006)
[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408000121/http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/corporate/planning-policy-flooding Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 25: Flooding], Written Parliamentary Statement&lt;/ref&gt; and sets out policies for local authorities to ensure flood risk is taken into account during the planning process to prevent inappropriate development in high risk areas and to direct development away from areas at highest risk.

In its introduction, PPS25 states "flooding threatens life and causes substantial damage to property [and that] although [it] cannot be wholly prevented, its impacts can be avoided and reduced through good planning and management".&lt;ref&gt;Communities and Local Government (2006) [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080306200436/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/153740 ''Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk: Full Regulatory Impact Assessment'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition of an FRA===
For a flood risk assessment to be written, information is needed concerning the existing and proposed developments, the Environment Agency modeled flood levels and topographic levels on site. At its most simple (and cheapest) level an FRA can provide an indication of whether a development will be allowed to take place at a site.

An initial idea of the risk of fluvial flooding to a local area can be found on the [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood/ Environment Agency flood map website].

FRAs consist of a detailed analysis of available data to inform the Environment Agency of flood risk at an individual site and also recommend to the developer any mitigation measures. More costly analysis of flood risk can be achieved through detailed flood modelling to challenge the agency's modelled levels and corresponding flood zones.

The FRA takes into account the risk and impact of flooding on the site, and takes into consideration how the development may affect flooding in the local area. It also includes provides recommendations as to how the risk of flooding to the development can be mitigated.

FRAs should also consider flooding from all sources including fluvial, groundwater, surface water runoff and sewer flooding.

==Northern Ireland==
In 2006, the [[Planning Service]], part of [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|The Department of the Environment]], published Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS15): Planning and flood risk.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Environment (2006) [http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/policy_publications/planning_statements/pps15-flood-risk.pdf Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS 15): Planning and Flood Risk], The Planning Service, Belfast&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidelines are precautionary and advise against development in flood plains and areas subject to historical flooding. In exceptional cases a FRA can be completed to justify development in flood risk areas. Advice on flood risk assessment is provided to the Planning Service by the [[Rivers Agency]], which is the statutory drainage and flood defence authority for [[Northern Ireland]].

==Republic of Ireland==
In 2009, the [[Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government|Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] and [[Office of Public Works]] published planning guidelines requiring local authorities to apply a sequential approach to flood risk management.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Ireland (2009) [http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Planning/FileDownLoad,21708,en.pdf The Planning System and Flood Risk Management], The Stationery Office, Dublin {{ISBN|978-1-4064-2467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidelines require that proposed development in flood risk areas must undergo a justification test, consisting of a flood risk assessment.

The '''hybrid difference scheme'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patankar|first=Suhas V.|title=Numerical heat transfer and fluid flow|year=1980|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Bristol, PA|isbn=9780891165224|edition=14. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Versteeg|first=H.K.|title=An introduction to computational fluid dynamics : the finite volume method|year=2007|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|isbn=9780131274983|edition=2nd |author2=Malalasekera, W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method used in the numerical solution for [[Convection–diffusion equation|convection–diffusion]] problems. It was first introduced by [[Brian Spalding|Spalding]] (1970). It is a combination of [[Central differencing scheme|central difference scheme]] and [[Upwind scheme|upwind difference scheme]] as it exploits the favorable properties of both of these schemes.&lt;ref name=Scarborough&gt;Scarborough, J.B.(1958) Numerical Mathematical Analysis, 4th edn, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spalding&gt;Spalding, D.B. (1972). A Novel Finite-difference Formulation for Differential Expression Involving Both First and Second Derivatives, Int. J. Numer. Methods Eng., Vol. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;Pollard, A. and Siu, A. L. W. (1982). The Calculation of Some Laminar Flows Using Various Discretization Schemes, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., Vol. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Hybrid difference scheme is a method used in the numerical solution for convection-diffusion problems. These problems play important roles in [[computational fluid dynamics]]. It can be described by the general partial equation as follows:&lt;ref name=Borris&gt;Borris, J.P. and Brook, D.L. (1976). Solution of the Continuity Equation by the Method of Flux Corrected Transport, J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho\phi)+\nabla (\rho \mathbf{u} \phi)\,= \nabla (\Gamma \cdot \operatorname{grad} \phi)+S_{\phi} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|1}})

Where, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[density]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt;S_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the source term. In this equation property, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be [[temperature]], [[internal energy]] or component of velocity vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; in x, y and z directions.

For one-dimensional analysis of convection-diffusion problem in steady state and without the source the equation reduces to,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\rho u \phi)\,= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\Gamma\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right),\quad       0&lt;x&lt;L\; &lt;/math&gt;       &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|2}})

With boundary conditions, &lt;math&gt;\phi (0)\,= \phi_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi (L)\, = \phi_{L}&lt;/math&gt;, where L is the length, &lt;math&gt;\phi_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{L}&lt;/math&gt; are the given values.

==Grid generation==
Integrating equation {{EquationRef|2}} over the [[control volume]] containing node N, and using [[Divergence theorem|Gauss’ theorem]] i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{CV} \nabla (\rho\mathbf{u}\phi)dV \,= \int_{A} \mathbf{n} \cdot (\rho\mathbf{u}\phi)dA&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|3}})

Yields the following result,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\rho u A \phi \right)_{r} - \left(\rho u A \phi \right)_{l}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\left(\Gamma A \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)_{r} - \left(\Gamma A \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)_{l}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;({{EquationRef|4}})

Where, A is the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] area of the control volume.
The equation must also satisfy the [[continuity equation]], i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\rho u A \right)_{r} - \left(\rho u A \right)_{l}&lt;/math&gt; = 0 &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|5}})

Now let us define variables F and D to represent the '''convection mass flux''' and '''diffusion conductance''' at cell faces,

:&lt;math&gt;F\,= \rho u A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;D\,= \frac{\Gamma A}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|6}})

Hence, equations ({{EquationRef|4}}) and ({{EquationRef|5}}) transform into the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{r} \phi_{r}-F_{l} \phi_{l}\,= D_{r}(\phi_{R}-\phi_{N})-D_{l}(\phi_{N}-\phi_{L})&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|7}})

:&lt;math&gt; F_{r}-F_{l}\,=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|8}})

Where, the lower case letters denote the values at the faces and the upper case letters denote that at the nodes.
We also define a non-dimensional parameter [[Péclet number]] (Pe) as a measure of the relative strengths of convection and diffusion,

:&lt;math&gt; Pe \,= \frac{F}{D} \,= \frac{\rho u}{\Gamma / \delta x}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|9}})

For a low Peclet number (|Pe|&lt;2) the flow is characterized as dominated by diffusion. For large Peclet number the flow is dominated by convection.

==Central and upwind difference scheme&lt;ref name="Scarborough"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roache&gt;Roache, P.J.(1976) Computational Fluid Dynamics, Hermosa, Albuquerque, NM.&lt;/ref&gt;==

[[File:The grid used for discretisation in Central Difference Scheme..png|thumb|400 px|Fig 1: The grid used for discretisation in Central Difference Scheme]]
In the above equations ({{EquationRef|7}}) and ({{EquationRef|8}}), we observe that the values require are at the faces, instead of the nodes. Hence approximations are required to fulfill this.

In the central difference scheme we replace the value at the face with the average of the values at the adjacent nodes,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{r}\,= \frac{\phi_{R} + \phi_{N}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\phi_{l}\,= \frac{\phi_{N} + \phi_{L}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|10}})
[[File:The grid used for discretisation in Upwind Difference Scheme for positive Peclet number (Pe 0)..png|thumb|300 px|Fig 2: The grid used for discretisation in Upwind Difference Scheme for positive Peclet number (Pe&gt;0)]]
[[File:The grid used for discretisation in Upwind Difference Scheme for negative Peclet number (Pe 0)..png|thumb|300 px|Fig 3: The grid used for discretisation in Upwind Difference Scheme for negative Peclet number (Pe&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0)]]

By putting these values in equation ({{EquationRef|7}}) and rearranging we get the following result,

:&lt;math&gt; a_{N} \phi_{N} \,= a_{R} \phi_{R} + a_{L} \phi_{L}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|11}})

where,

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{L} &lt;/math&gt; 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{R} &lt;/math&gt; 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{N} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
:&lt;math&gt; D_{l} + \frac{F_{l}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

| 
:&lt;math&gt;D_{r} - \frac{F_{r}}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
| 
:&lt;math&gt; a_{R} + a_{L} + (F_{r} - F_{l})&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In the Upwind scheme we replace the value at the face with the value at the adjacent upstream node. For example, for the flow to the right (Pe&gt;0)as shown in the diagram, we replace the values as follows;

:&lt;math&gt; \phi_{l}\,= \phi_{L} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \phi_{r}\,= \phi_{N} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|12}})

And for Pe&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0, we put the values as shown in the figure 3,

:&lt;math&gt; \phi_{r}\,= \phi_{R} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \phi_{l}\,= \phi_{N} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; ({{EquationRef|13}})

By putting these values in equation ({{EquationRef|7}}) and rearranging we get the same equation as equation ({{EquationRef|11}}), with the following values of the coefficients:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{L} &lt;/math&gt; 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{R} &lt;/math&gt; 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{N} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
:&lt;math&gt; D_{l} + \max( F_{l} , 0) &lt;/math&gt;

| 
:&lt;math&gt;D_{r} +  \max( - F_{r} , 0)&lt;/math&gt;
| 
:&lt;math&gt; a_{R} + a_{L} + (F_{r} - F_{l})&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Hybrid difference scheme&lt;ref name="Scarborough"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roache"/&gt;==
[[File:Diagram showing the variation of any property (Ø) along the length (L) at different Peclet numbers (Pe)..png|thumb|300 px|Fig 4: Diagram showing the variation of any property (ϕ) along the length (L) at different Peclet numbers (Pe)]]
The hybrid difference scheme of Spalding (1970) is a combination of the central difference scheme and upwind difference scheme. It makes use of the central difference scheme, which is second order accurate, for small Peclet numbers (|Pe|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2). For large Peclet numbers (|Pe|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) it uses the Upwind difference scheme, which first order accurate but takes into account the convection of the fluid.

As it can be seen in figure 4 that for Pe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, it is a linear distribution and for high Pe it takes the upstream value depending on the flow direction. For example, the value at the left face, in different circumstances is,

: &lt;math&gt; \phi_{l}\,= \left [\left (1 + \frac{2}{ Pe_{l} }\right) \frac{\phi_{L}}{2} + \left (1 - \frac{2}{ Pe_{l} }\right) \frac{\phi_{N}}{2}\right ] \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; -2&lt; Pe_{l} &lt;2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|14}})

: &lt;math&gt; \phi_{l}\,= \phi_{L}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; Pe_{l} \text{≥} 2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|15}})

: &lt;math&gt; \phi_{l}\,= \phi_{N}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; Pe_{l} \text{≤} -2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\;&lt;/math&gt;   ({{EquationRef|16}})

Substituting these values in equation ({{EquationRef|7}}) we get the same equation ({{EquationRef|11}}) with the values of the coefficients as follows,

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{L} &lt;/math&gt; 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{R} &lt;/math&gt; 
! scope="col" style="width:200px;"| &lt;math&gt; a_{N} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
:&lt;math&gt; \max \left [ F_{l} , \left ( D_{l} + \frac{ F_{l}}{2} \right ), 0 \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

| 
:&lt;math&gt; \max \left [ -F_{r} , \left ( D_{r} - \frac{ F_{r}}{2} \right ), 0 \right ] &lt;/math&gt;
| 
:&lt;math&gt; a_{r} + a_{l} + (F_{r} - F_{l})&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Advantages and disadvantages==
It exploits the favourable properties of the central difference and upwind scheme. It switches to upwind difference scheme when central difference scheme produces inaccurate results for high Peclet numbers. It produces physically realistic solution and has proved to be helpful in the prediction of practical flows. The only disadvantage associated with hybrid difference scheme is that the accuracy in terms of [[Taylor series]] [[truncation error]] is only first order.

'''Lake Uluabat''' ({{lang-tr|'''Uluabat Gölü'''}} and '''''Apolyont Gölü''''') is the name of a freshwater lake in the vicinity of [[Bursa, Turkey]]. It is a large lake, covering an area of between 135 and 160&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the water level, but very shallow, being only 3 m deep at its deepest point. The lake contains eight islands and one other that is sometimes an island and sometimes a peninsula. The largest island is known as Halilbey Island. In the southwest the lake is fed by the [[Mustafakemalpaşa River]], which has formed a silty delta. Water leaves the lake by way of the Ulubat stream,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} flowing to the west, and reaches the [[Sea of Marmara]] via the [[Susurluk River]].

Most shores of the lake are covered in submerged plants, and it has the most extensive [[white water lily]] beds in [[Turkey]]. Ulubat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered [[pygmy cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax pygmeus''). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 [[night heron]] pairs, 109 [[squacco heron]] pairs, and 48 [[spoonbill]] pairs breeding on Ulubat.

The alternative name Lake ''Apolyont'' comes from the lake's [[greek language|greek]] classical name '''Apolloniatis''' (''Απολλωνιάτις''), from [[Apollonia ad Rhyndacum|Apollonia-on-the-Rhyndacum]] (modern [[Gölyazı]]), an ancient Greek city situated on its banks which had considerable importance since it was on major trade routes.

Modern residential areas by its shores are [[Mustafakemalpaşa]] (formerly [[Kirmasti]]) and [[Karacabey]] (formerly [[Mikalick]]). The area was famous for centuries for its [[silkworm cultivation]], but this industry has died out due to synthetic fabrics. The main industry today is fishing.

==Saint Constantine==
St. Constantine is a small island inside the lake. During the Byzantine era, there was a monastery of St. Constantine on the island. Today the island is uninhabited, but the monastery has survived Ottoman conquest of [[Asia Minor]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodox]] monastery has received attention from scholars
because of its inscribed cross type with apses east and west.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril. "The Monastery of St. Constantine on Lake Apolyont." ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', Vol. 33 (1979), pp. 329-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important Bird Area==
The lake, which is in unprotected status, was declared by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] in 1989 for its [[waterfowl]] species of international character and species, which are globally threatened.&lt;ref name="kv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kasparek-verlag.de/MaxKasparek/PDF/1989%20GrimmetKasparekKilic.pdf |publisher= |title=Important Bird Areas In Turkey: Unprotected And Under Threat æauthors=Grimmett, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="122674">There are 130 [[protected area]]s in the United States known as national monuments. The [[President of the United States]] can establish a [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] by [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|presidential proclamation]], and the [[United States Congress]] can do so by legislation. The president's authority arises from the ''[[Antiquities Act]] of 1906'', which authorizes the president to proclaim "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest" as national monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|16|431}} {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|16|432}}, and {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|16|433}}. ''U.S. Code collection''. Cornell University Law School. Retrieved on 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] ruins and artifacts—collectively termed [[antiquities]]—on western federal lands prompted the legislation. Its purpose was to allow the president to quickly preserve public land without waiting for legislation to pass through an unconcerned Congress. The ultimate goal was to protect all historic and prehistoric sites on U.S. federal lands.&lt;ref name="antiquities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/hisnps/npshistory/righter.htm |title=National Monuments to National Parks:|last=Righter|first=Robert W.|date=March 5, 2005|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the first national monument, [[Devils Tower]] in [[Wyoming]], on September 24, 1906.&lt;ref name=devils/&gt; He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/hisnps/NPSHistory/monuments.htm|title=National Monument Proclamations under the Antiquities Act|date=January 16, 2003|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen presidents have created national monuments since the program began; only [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H.

[[Jimmy Carter]] protected vast parts of [[Alaska]], proclaiming fifteen national monuments, some of which later were promoted to [[national park]]s. President [[Barack Obama]] created or expanded 34 national monuments, the most of any president, with over half a billion acres of public land and water protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/26/obamas-national-monuments-more-than-conservation/82931356/|title=Obama’s national monuments are about more than conservation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|title=In massive expansion of lands legacy, Obama creates three new national monuments|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/10/in-massive-expansion-of-lands-legacy-obama-creates-three-new-national-monuments/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National monuments are located in 32 states as well as in the [[District of Columbia]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands|Minor Outlying Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. [[Arizona]], with 18, has the largest number of national monuments, followed by [[California]] with 17 and [[New Mexico]] with 14. At least 65 national monuments protect places of natural significance, including 12 geological sites, seven marine sites, and five volcanic sites. Twenty-three national monuments have major sites associated with Native Americans, while 34 are other historical sites, including twelve forts.

Many [[:Category:Former National Monuments of the United States|former national monuments]]  have been redesignated as national parks or another status by Congress, while others have been transferred to state control or disbanded.

==Analysis of management by federal agency and department==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
Eight [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] in five [[United States federal executive departments|departments]] manage the 130 current U.S. national monuments. Of these, 116 monuments are managed by a single agency, while 14 are co-managed by two agencies. One of the NPS's national monuments, [[Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument|Grand Canyon-Parashant]], is not an [[List of the United States National Park System official units|official unit]] because it overlaps with [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area]].

This is a list of [[river]]s which are at least partially located in [[Italy]]. They are organized according to what body of water they drain into, with the exceptions of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], which are listed separately. At the bottom all of the rivers are listed alphabetically.

==Draining into the [[North Sea]]==
*[[Reno di Lei]]
:After entering Switzerland, the Reno di Lei drains via the [[Reno di Avers]] and the [[Hinterrhein (river)|Hinterrhein]] into the [[Rhine]].

==Draining into the [[Black Sea]] ==
[[File:Livigno%26LagoDelGallo.JPG|thumb|Acqua Granda (or Spöl)]]
*[[Drava]] (a short section in Italy, continues into Austria, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary)
:The Drava drains into the [[Danube]] on the Croatia–Serbia border.
:*[[Slizza]] (three-quarters in Italy, a quarter in Austria)
::After entering Austria, the Slizza drains via the [[Gail (river)|Gail]] into the Drava.
*[[Spöl|Acqua Granda]] (half in Italy, half in Switzerland)
:After entering Switzerland, the Spöl drains into the [[Inn (river)|Inn]], which meets the Danube in Germany.

==Draining into the [[Adriatic Sea]]==
[[File:Reno a Casalecchio di Reno (BO).jpg|thumb|The [[Reno (river)|Reno]] near [[Casalecchio di Reno|Casalecchio]]]]
For the purposes of this list, the Italian rivers draining into the Adriatic Sea will begin at the coastal border between Italy and [[Slovenia]] and will follow the Adriatic coast of Italy until it reaches [[Santa Maria di Leuca]]. Beyond this point, rivers empty into the Ionian Sea rather than the Adriatic. The rivers are ordered according to how far along the coast the river mouth is from the Italian/Slovenian border, the first river having its mouth the closest to the border and the last being closest to Santa Maria di Leuca.

[[File:GariglianoFoce.jpg|thumb|The [[Garigliano]] near its mouth]]
For the purposes of this list, the Italian rivers draining into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] will begin at the [[Strait of Messina]] in the south and extend north up to San Pietro Point near [[Portovenere]]. Sicilian and Sardinian rivers are excluded from this list because those rivers are in their own sections below. The rivers are ordered according to how far south their mouth is, the first river having the southernmost mouth and the last having the northernmost mouth.

For the purposes of this list, the Italian rivers draining into the Ligurian Sea will begin at San Pietro Point near [[Portovenere]] in the east and will extend to the border with [[France]] near [[Monaco]]. Sardinian rivers are excluded from this list because those rivers are in their own section below. The rivers are ordered according to how close their mouth is to San Pietro Point. The river with its mouth closest to this geographic point is listed first and rivers further away from this point are listed in the order in which their mouth empties into the sea as one proceeds along the coast up to the border with France.

Taking in account his two world circumnavigations and his two trips from [[Europe]] to [[South America]], Loyola was probably the most widely traveled man in History up to the 17th century.

He was a grandnephew of [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and was ordained a priest in [[Alaejos]] in 1572.

==Circumnavigations of the world==
In both of his travels Loyola took advantage of Spain and [[Portugal]] being [[Iberian Union|united under the crown]] of [[Philip II of Spain]].

===First circumnavigation: 1582–1584===
Loyola's first circumnavigation was made in a westerly direction.

Departing [[Cadiz]] on 21 June 1582, he sailed for the [[Canary Islands]], then crossed the Atlantic to [[La Désirade]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Santo Domingo]], to arrive in [[San Juan de Ulúa|San Juan de Lúa]] (modern [[Veracruz]]), in [[México]]. After crossing to the Pacific Ocean coast of Mexico at [[Acapulco]] he sailed once again in a westerly direction, visiting the [[Mariana Islands]], and the [[Philippines]], before eventually reaching the [[Late Imperial China|Empire of China]], where he landed in [[Fujian province]]. There he and his companions were considered to be spies and were sent to [[Guangzhou]]. After a year they were set free and sent to [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;

| work       = International Conference on The Role and Status of Macao in the Propagation of Catholicism in the East
| accessdate = 2011-12-31
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After travelling on to [[Japan]], he departed once again in a westerly direction to return to Europe at [[Lisbon]] via the [[Straits of Malacca]], [[Portuguese India]], the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Saint Helena]].

Loyola's account of his first journey around the world was first published in [[Rome]] in 1585, included in [[Juan González de Mendoza]]'s ''Historia de las cosas más notables, ritos y costumbres del gran reyno dela China''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lach|first=Donald F|title=Asia in the Making of Europe|volume=I:The Century of Discovery|date=1965|publisher=University of Chicago Press|place=Chicago|isbn=|page=562, 569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second circumnavigation: 1585–1589===
Loyola's second circumnavigation was made in an easterly direction.

It is not clear how or when Loyola made his eastward journey to China; in 1587, from [[Macau]], China, Loyola continued eastward across the Pacific Ocean to [[Acapulco]], Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibingka.com/sst/esperanza/chars.htm The characters on the galleon Esperanza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231170349/http://www.bibingka.com/sst/esperanza/chars.htm |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a ship commanded by [[Pedro de Unamuno]]. From there he crossed Mexico to Veracruz, from where he finally set sail across the Atlantic to Spain.

==Other journeys==
In 1595, six years after his second return to Spain, he went to [[Paraguay]], that he reached via [[New Kingdom of Granada|Panama]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], [[Captaincy General of Chile|Chile]], whose Spanish governor by then, Martín García de Loyola, was his cousin, and [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]].

He went back to Spain again in 1600 and returned to Paraguay in 1603, this time as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Asunción|Bishop of Asunción]].&lt;ref name=HierarchiaIV&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft#page/96/mode/2up|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=HIERARCHIA CATHOLICA MEDII ET RECENTIORIS AEVI Vol IV|pages=97|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=Münster|ISBN=}} ''(in Latin)''&lt;/ref&gt; He had been consecrated as such in [[Valladolid]] by [[Juan Bautista Acevedo Muñoz]], [[Bishop of Valladolid]], the year before.&lt;ref name=CathHierMartIgLoyola&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cheney |first=David M.|authorlink=|title=Bishop Martín Ignacio de Loyola |publisher=''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''|date=|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdeloyola.html |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}[[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published sources|{{sup|''self-published''}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mentawai Islands''' are a chain of about seventy islands and islets approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} off the western coast of [[Sumatra]] in [[Indonesia]]. [[Siberut]] at {{convert|4,030|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} is the largest of the islands. The other major islands are [[Sipura]], [[North Pagai]] (''Pagai Utara'') and [[South Pagai]] (''Pagai Selatan''). The islands lie off the Sumatran coast, across the [[Mentawai Strait]]. The indigenous inhabitants of the islands are known as the [[Mentawai people]]. The Mentawai Islands have become a noted destination for [[surfing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surfaidinternational.org|title=SURFAID|author=|date=|website=SURFAID|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mentawai Islands have been administered as a regency within the [[West Sumatra]] (''Sumatera Barat'') province since 1999. The regency seat is [[Tua Pejat]], on the island of [[Sipora]]. [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], the capital of the province, lies on the Sumatran mainland opposite Siberut. The regency is divided into ten [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below from south to north with their 2010 census populations.&lt;ref&gt;Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands have been separated from Sumatra since the [[Pleistocene|mid-Pleistocene]] period, which has allowed at least twenty [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species to develop amongst its flora and fauna. This includes six endemic [[primates]]: the [[Kloss's gibbon]] (''Hylobates klossii''), [[Pagai Island macaque|Mentawai macaque]] (''Macaca pagensis''), Siberut macaque (''Macaca siberu''), [[Mentawai langur]] (''Presbytis potenziani''), Siberut langur (''Presbytis siberu''), and [[pig-tailed langur]] (''Simias concolor''). They are highly endangered due to logging, unsustainable hunting, and conversion of [[rainforest]] to palm oil plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, D. 2006.

[[File:MWP Logo.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Logo Mountain Wave Project]]

The '''Mountain Wave Project''' ('''MWP''') pursues global scientific research of [[gravity wave]]s and associated turbulence. MWP seeks to develop new scientific insights and knowledge through high altitude and record seeking glider flights with the goal of increasing overall flight safety and improving pilot training.

== Corporate history ==
=== Motivation ===
Wind movement over terrain and ground obstacles can create wavelike wind formations which can reach up to the stratosphere. In 1998 the pilots René Heise and [[Klaus Ohlmann]] founded the MWP, a project for global classification, research, and analysis of orographically created wind structures (e.g. Chinook, Foehn, Mistral, Zonda). The MWP is an independent non-profit-project of the Scientific and Meteorological Section of the [[Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile]] (OSTIV) and is supported by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI).&lt;ref&gt;OSTIV-Website, retrieved 2010-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The OSTIV Mountain Wave Project, Soaring Magazine, p.30, June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The MWP was originally focused on achieving better understanding. of the complex [[thermal]] and dynamic air movements in the [[atmosphere]], and using that knowledge to achieve ever greater long distance soaring flights. As MWP gained greater awareness of the power inherent to mountain wave-like structures in the atmosphere, and their strong vertical airflows, it became obvious that they presented great dangers to civil aviation in multiple ways.&lt;ref&gt;Transmission – Magazine of Deutsche Flugsicherung 12/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Through the support of other scientists and cooperation partners the core group became more powerful and gained greater depth of knowledge. The integration of Joerg Hacker from the Airborne Research Australia (ARA) into the core group significantly enhanced the overall depth of knowledge of the group.

=== Airborne measurements ===
In order to learn more about the relevant physical process in the atmosphere, the MWP Team launched two expeditions in the Argentinean Andes in 1999 and 2006. For high altitude flights a modified [[Stemme S10|Stemme S10 VT]] motorglider was used as a platform for airborne data acquisition and measurement. The pilots were assisted with life support equipment and physiological preparations by the renowned flight physicians of the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) and by astronaut [[Ulf Merbold]].&lt;ref&gt;Scientific TV-feature (RBB-Station) „Rodeo in the Sky - Research for greater flight safety“&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the help of qualified scientists and state-of-the-art sensor technology, the MWP achieved its goal to gather and analyze wave structure data with impressive results at the operation in Mendoza in October 2006. Research flights and operations were completed in the region between the [[Tupungato]] (5.700 m) and [[Aconcagua]] (6.900m), which is very well known for its extremely treacherous turbulence.&lt;ref&gt;Meteorological Calendar 2008, European Meteorological Society&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Record flights ===
Between 2000 and 2004 MWP team member Klaus Ohlmann further developed and expanded on the knowledge about wave systems gained in the Andes in 1999, and accumulated a wealth of experience. This educational process allowed him to win the OSTIV Kuettner Prize for the first 2000&amp;nbsp;km straight out wave flight, as well as completing the world's longest recorded soaring flight of 3,008&amp;nbsp;km. He was supported by his MWP teammates in Germany using internet communications to provide specific weather predictions using a new weather forecasting tool. In these flights, he provided crucial in-flight data, which in turn helped to improve subsequent weather predictions by the team in Germany.

Two MWP members participated in the 2006 field research campaign of the Terrain Induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX) which took place in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada (U.S.A.)]]. René Heise served as scientific reviewer for the National Science Foundation and contributed MWP wave forecasts to the data archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/TREX/documents/ASW0403.pdf, ''Air Safety Week'', Vol.20, No.14, April 3, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Wolf-Dietrich Herold documented activities in Boulder/CO and Bishop/CA and produced a TV-report of the project for the German TV station RBB.

== Programming objectives ==
* Detection and determination of physical processes in the atmosphere, and their associated synoptic characteristics, which play the primary role in the generation and development of mountain waves.
* Investigation of rotor bands: determination of their location, spatial extension and classification of associated turbulence
* High resolution measurement of relevant meteorological variables (e.g., potential temperature, turbulence parameters, vertical and horizontal wind, humidity, etc.)
* Visualisation of the rotors/regions of turbulence with a GeoInformationService (GIS).
* Statistical analysis of wave flights (IGC-files of GPS flight loggers) to develop an empirical GIS-based representation of wave and rotor locations
* Verification of mesoscale forecast models and fine tuning of the applied parameterisations
* Application of the acquired data, scientific results, and prediction tools to enhance the safety and effectiveness of air traffic route planning, and improve pilot training. Furthermore, assisting in the development and creation of focused training methodology, tools and simulator scenarios.

== Expeditions ==
* Argentina’99: Base [[San Martín de los Andes]] (Argentina); some flights above 1,000&amp;nbsp;km, a record flight (1,550&amp;nbsp;km) of Klaus Ohlmann up to [[Fireland]] (Rio Grande), the southernmost glider flight in the World

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">In general biology or reproductive physiology the term '''nurse cell''' is defined as a cell which provides food, helps other cells and provides stability to their neighboring cells. The term '''nurse cell''' is used in several unrelated ways in different scientific fields.

==Human physiology==
Nurse cells are specialized [[macrophage]]s residing in the [[bone marrow]] that assist in the development of [[red blood cell]]s. They absorb the nuclei of immature red blood cells and may provide [[growth factor]]s to help the red blood cells mature. In the bone marrow, immature red blood cells ([[erythroblast]]s) can be seen grouped in a cluster around a nurse cell.

The epithelial cell found in the cortex of the Thymus is also called a "nurse cell." These cells produce '''Thymic hormones''' that cause '''T Lymphocytes''' to mature and differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley and O'Loughlin (2008) Human Anatomy. McGraw Hill, Boston MA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasitology==
In parasitology, a nurse cell is an infected cell in the disease [[trichinosis]] discovered by [[Dickson Despommier]].  A trichinella [[larva]] enters a [[cell (biology)|cell]] and develops there, probably as a way of concealing itself from the [[immune system]].  The parasite has evolved a way of stimulating [[blood vessel]] development around the cell, in order to receive the nutrients it needs.  In trichinosis, nurse cells are invariably [[skeletal muscle]] cells; these are the only type of cell that can support the [[parasite]].

==Mycology==
In mycology, a nurse cell is any [[hyphae]] that supplies food material to [[basidiospore|spores]] that have detached from the [[basidia]]; used especially in reference to taxa from the family [[Sclerodermataceae]].

==Cell biology==
[[File:Ribonucleoprotein particles in the Drosophila egg chamber.png|thumb|right|Ribonucleoprotein particles (GFP-Imp) in the Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber, being transported from the nurse cells to the oocyte]]
In respect to [[invertebrate]]s, nurse cells are polytenic germline cells that contribute to the development of the [[oocyte]], producing multiple [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. In fruit flies ''([[Drosophila]]),'' nurse cells surround the developing oocyte and synthesize proteins and RNAs that are to be deposited in it.&lt;ref name=PrinciplesOfDevelopment&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|title=Principles of Development|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199249393|pages=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurse cells are highly polyploid (up to 8000C). They dump their [[cytoplasm]] containing RNAs and proteins into the oocyte via ring canals.

Due to their high metabolic activity, nurse cells likely experience the DNA damaging effect of oxidative free radicals produced as a byproduct of this metabolism.  This damaging effect would otherwise befall the DNA of the egg cells if they were responsible for their own synthesis.  The many genome copies in each nurse cell may provide redundancy of genetic information that would allow the nurse cell to carry out its provisioning function even in the face of considerable oxidative DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C (1993). Sex as a response to oxidative DNA damage. Chapter 10 (see pages 204-205) in “DNA and Free Radicals” (editors: Barry Halliwell, Okezie I Aruoma). Ellis Horwood Limited (publisher), Great Gritain  {{ISBN|0-13-222035-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, C (1998). Sex as a response to oxidative DNA damage. Chapter 4, see pages 112-113.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15306">[[File:Bergsteiger Marathon des Olymp, Siegerehrung.jpg|thumb|Award ceremony of the runners]]
Since 1986, nearly every year, various initiators organize marathons in the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] Mountains in Greece. For these '''Olympus Marathons''' the classic distance of 42.195 kilometers provides a clue to the distance of some of the runs in the Olympus. Starting in 2010, events established that surpass the classic marathon distance. In some races, runners run over distances of 57 km, 70 km or almost 100 km.

At the stations along the route, the runners are provided with drinks and snacks and mostly medical aid. They are offered water, electrolytic drinks, bananas, salty biscuits, sandwiches, chocolates and more. The medical care is provided by rescue services. The fastest runners finishes the race in about four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eosthessalonikis.gr/images/RESULTS_men.pdf|title=Results of the 31th run of the Mountaineer Marathon (ΑΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΜΑΤΑ ΑΝΔΡΩΝ 31ου ΟΜΟ)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Around 1970, inspired by mountain running in the [[Alps]], the first thoughts of a marathon in Olympus came on. Younger members of the Mountaineering Association E.O.S. Thessaloniki implemented the idea; a running track was selected, the paths were cleaned and marked. The first run took place on July 6, 1986. Around 100 Greek runners participated; although starting numbers have been assigned, there are no statistics on the results of this first Olympus Marathon. The new sport was called "Mountaineer Marathon", not only on the Olympus region, but in the whole of [[Greece]], where gradually hill running established. In the first years the number of participants varied greatly, only through the "outdoor movement" found more Greek athletes to this sport.

In order to arouse international interest, the "Olympus Marathon" event was founded in 2003. The first run took place in June 2004 with the help of [[Litochoro]] Municipality and the Litochoro Mountaineering Association. Based on the tradition of the ancient Greeks, who every year, to pay homage to the gods, made a procession from [[Archaeological Park of Dion|Dion]] to the peaks of Mount Olympus, the run starts in Dion - the religious center of the Macedonians (motto: running with the gods). 115 athletes participated in the first race, of which 103 were scored. Seven of them were foreigners.

In 2012 the first "Olympus Mythical Trail" was organized. It is an extreme run over about 100 kilometers which is also run at night. Since 2015, the "Lost Trail", a shortened to 57 kilometers run, offered to let the athletes on lesser known paths explore the Olympus during daylight.

There are other runs in the Olympus over shorter distances, in the snow, as well as mixed competitions, such as a biathlon, where the athletes run and bike.

== Organizer E.O.S. Thessaloniki ==
The first organizer of marathons in Greek mountains was the E.O.S. Thessaloniki ([[Greek language|Greek]] Ελληνικός Ορειβατικός Σύλλογος Θεσσαλονίκης, Greek mountaineering club Thessaloniki).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eosthessalonikis.gr/article/41/istoria-tou-eosth.html|title=Homepage of the E.O.S. Thessaloniki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1986, the marathon (mountaineer marathon of Olympus, Ορειβατικός Μαραθώνιος Ολύμπου) with only one interruption, annually on the first Sunday in September is organized. Patronage of the event has taken over the community Dion Olympou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympos-marathon.gr/article/71/istoriko.html|title=E.O.S Thessaloniki history}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, around 300 runners took part in the competition, of which 249 had finished the race in accordance with the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eosthessalonikis.gr/images/32_RESULTS_all.pdf|title=Results of the 32th run of the Mountaineer Marathon (ΑΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΜΑΤΑ ΑΝΔΡΩΝ 31ου ΟΜΟ)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This run will be started in Prionia (1100 m). The goal is to overcome more than 1000 meters in altitude over a distance of 4.3 kilometers. There are no categories or restrictions for this race, any person over the age of 18 is allowed.

== Organizer Olympus Mythical Trail ==
[[File:Mythical Trail.jpg|thumb|Poster Olympus Mythical Trail]]
The race takes place annually on the first weekend in July and covers a distance of about 100 kilometers, with 6410 meters of altitude to overcome. Until 2017 it started in the park at the church Agios Joannis, above Litochoro. From 2018, the start and finish were moved to Lakko, on the Enipeas River in Litochoro. The offer is aimed at experienced runners; a medical certificate is not required, but proof of the participant's experience of difficult routes. Greek runners must have completed a number of races within the last three years, foreigners must have completed at least one 80 kilometer run during this period. About 90% of the route is forest trails and mountain trails. This extreme run takes place partly on the Thessalian side of the Olympus and is limited to 28 hours. The runners cross the third highest peak of Mount Olympus, the Skolio (2,910 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omt100.com/en/100k-endurance-footrace-mountain-olympus-greece/|title=Short description of the OMT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizer Faethon Olympus Marathon ==
The race is organized by Faethon Olympus Marathon and supported by the mountaineering associations of Elassona, Olympiada (Mytikas), Sparmos (Olympus) and Kalyvion (Christakis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faethonolympusmarathon.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=36|title=Faethon Olympus Marathon About us}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are three different runs available:

* Faethon Marathon over a distance of about 43 kilometers and 3600 m altitude difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faethonolympusmarathon.gr/images/races/faethon_map_lg.jpg|title=Faethon Olympus Marathon map}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Rupicapra semi-marathon over 20 kilometers and 1500 m altitude difference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faethonolympusmarathon.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=162|title=Rules Rupicapra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faethon Trail over 14 kilometers and 400 m difference in altitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faethonolympusmarathon.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=217&amp;Itemid=12|title=Small Faethon Description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the events mentioned above, these runs take place mainly in the Thessalian part of the Olympus. The races are started in Kokkinopilos, the runners are required to carry a certain equipment. Runners starting at the age of 20 years are entitled to start and the runs are divided into different categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faethonolympusmarathon.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=87|title=PARTICIPATION RIGHT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizer does not require a certificate of health status of the athletes.

==== Running track Faethon Olympus Marathon ====
* Start in Kokkinopilos, altitude 1250 m
* 2,3 km, Kiosk, altitude 1360 m
* 4,2 km, Smeos, altitude 2060 m
* 3,7 km, Chotsas, altitude 2520 m
* 3,4 km, Katafigio Anangis, altitude 2350 m

* 6,5 km, Rhoudi, altitude 1800 m
* 1,5 km, Kokkinopilos, altitude 1250 m

== Organizer Almira-X ==
A triathlon will complement the range of extreme sports activities in the Olympus. It includes the classic three triathlon sports; four kilometers of swimming, 182 kilometers of cycling and around 40 kilometers of running. The group of male and female athletes are divided into five age groups. To be admitted to the race, the organizer requires a medical certificate. Each participant needs a companion with his own escort vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almiraman.gr/almirax/ALMIRA_X_RACE_MANUAL_eng.pdf|title=Almira-X Race manual|}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the athletes will manage the triathlon with a minimum of support. So there are only two stations where the runners are supplied for the 40 kilometer run.

=== Swimming ===
From a boat the competition starts, the swimming ends at the beach of Platamonas. The route depends on the wind direction, the athletes are accompanied by boats.

=== Biking === 
From Platamonas, the Olymp is almost completely rounded. The cycle race takes place on paved roads, 4100 vertical meters have to be overcome. Target is the place Vrisopoules.

=== Running ===
From Vrisopoules, the route leads over the second highest peak of the mountains (Skolio, 2911 m) on forest roads down to the river Orlias, which is the destination of the triathlon. There are 2250 vertical meters to overcome.

The composition of Earth's paleoatmosphere can be inferred today from the study of the abundance of [[proxy (climate)|proxy material]]s such as [[iron oxide]]s, [[charcoal]] and the [[stomata]]l density of fossil leaves in geological deposits.  Although today's atmosphere is dominated by [[nitrogen]] (about 78%), [[oxygen]] (about 21%), and [[argon]] (about 1%), the pre-biological atmosphere is thought to have been a highly [[reducing atmosphere]], having virtually no free oxygen, virtually no argon, which is generated by the [[radioactive decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;[[potassium|K]], and to have been dominated by nitrogen, [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]].

Appreciable concentrations of free oxygen were probably not present until about 2,500 million years ago ([[Megaannum|Ma]]).  After the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], quantities of oxygen produced as a by-product of [[photosynthesis]] by [[cyanobacteria]] or blue-green algae began to exceed the quantities of [[redox|chemically reducing materials]], notably dissolved iron. By the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] period 541 Ma, free oxygen concentrations had increased sufficiently to enable the evolution of multicellular organisms. Following the subsequent appearance, rapid evolution and radiation of land plants, which covered much of the Earth's land surface, beginning about 450 Ma, oxygen concentrations reached and later exceeded current values during the early [[Carboniferous]], when atmospheric carbon dioxide was drawn down below current concentrations.&lt;ref name=Berner1998&gt;RA Berner (1998) The carbon cycle and {{chem|CO|2}} over Phanerozoic time: the role of land plants.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 102, 1302–1305.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have contributed to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] during the [[Moscovian (Carboniferous)|Moscovian]] and [[Kasimovian]] ages of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod.

==Indirect measurements==
Geological studies of ancient rock formations can give information on paleoatmospheric composition, pressure, density, etc. at specific points in Earth's history.
 
=== Density and pressure===

A 2012 study looked at the imprints made by falling raindrops onto freshly deposited [[volcanic ash]], laid down in the [[Archean]] Eon 2,700 Ma in the [[Ventersdorp]] Supergroup, South Africa. They linked the [[terminal velocity]] of the raindrops directly to the [[air density]] of the paleoatmosphere and showed that it had less than twice the density of the modern atmosphere, and likely had similar if not lower density.&lt;ref&gt;Som, Sanjoy M., et al. "Air density 2.7 billion years ago limited to less than twice modern levels by fossil raindrop imprints." Nature 484.7394 (2012): 359-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar study in 2016 looked at the size distribution of gas bubbles in basaltic lava flows that solidified at sea level also during the Archean (~2,700 Ma). They found an atmospheric pressure of only 0.23 ± 0.23 [[Bar (unit)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;Som, Sanjoy M., et al. "Earth's air pressure 2.7 billion years ago constrained to less than half of modern levels." Nature Geoscience (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both results contradict theories that suggest the Archean was kept warm during the [[Faint young Sun paradox|Faint Young Sun period]] by extremely high levels of carbon dioxide or nitrogen.

===Oxygen content===

A 2016 study performed [[mass spectrometry]] on air bubbles trapped inside rock salt deposited 813 Myr ago. They detected an oxygen content of 10.9%, much higher than had been expected from indirect measures. This suggested the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] may have happened much earlier than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel J.F.

'''Patch dynamics''' is an ecological perspective that the structure, function, and dynamics of ecological systems can be understood through studying their interactive patches.  Patch dynamics, as a term, may also refer to the spatiotemporal changes within and among patches that make up a landscape.  Patch dynamics is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic systems across organizational levels and spatial scales.  From a patch dynamics perspective, populations, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes may all be studied effectively as mosaics of patches that differ in size, shape, composition, history, and boundary characteristics.  

The idea of patch dynamics dates back to the 1940s when plant ecologists studied the structure and dynamics of vegetation in terms of the interactive patches that it comprises.  A mathematical theory of patch dynamics was developed by Simon Levin and Robert Paine in the 1970s, originally to describe the pattern and dynamics of an intertidal community as a patch mosaic created and maintained by tidal disturbances.  Patch dynamics became a dominant theme in ecology between the late 1970s and the 1990s.  

'''Patch dynamics''' is a conceptual approach to [[ecosystem]] and habitat analysis that emphasizes dynamics of [[heterogeneity]] within a system (i.e. that each area of an ecosystem is made up of a mosaic of small 'sub-ecosystems').&lt;ref name=Pickett1985&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickett|first1=Steward T.A.|last2=White|first2=P.S.|title= The Ecology of Natural Disturbance and Patch Dynamics|publisher= Academic Press|year=1985|isbn=0123960215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diverse patches of habitat created by natural [[disturbance regimes]] are seen as critical to the maintenance of this [[diversity (ecology)]]. A ''habitat patch'' is any discrete area with a definite shape, spatial and configuration used by a species for breeding or obtaining other resources. ''Mosaics'' are the patterns within landscapes that are composed of smaller elements, such as individual forest stands, shrubland patches, highways, farms, or towns.

== Patches and mosaics ==

Historically, due to the short time scale of human observation, mosaic landscapes were perceived to be [[punctuated equilibrium|static]] patterns of human population mosaics.&lt;ref name=Bogin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Barry|title=Patterns of human growth|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521564380|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ScfPjwF3BngC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus centered on the idea that the status of a particular [[population]], [[community]], or [[ecosystem]] could be understood by studying a particular patch within a mosaic. However, this perception ignored the conditions that interact with, and connect patches. In 1979, Bormann and Likens coined the phrase ''shifting mosaic'' to describe the theory that landscapes change and fluctuate, and are in fact dynamic. This is related to the battle of cells that occurs in a [[Petri dish]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

''Patch dynamics'' refers to the concept that [[landscapes]] are dynamic.&lt;ref name=Pickett1985/&gt; There are three states that a patch can exist in: ''potential'', ''active'', and ''degraded''. Patches in the ''potential'' state are transformed into active patches through [[colonization]] of the patch by [[dispersal (ecology)|dispersing species]] arriving from other ''active'' or ''degrading'' patches. Patches are transformed from the ''active'' state to the ''degraded'' state when the patch is abandoned, and patches change from ''degraded'' to ''potential'' through a process of [[recovery (ecology)|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;

|archivedate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logging, fire, farming, and [[afforestation|reforestation]] can all contribute to the process of colonization, and can effectively change the shape of the patch. ''Patch dynamics'' also refers to changes in the structure, function, and composition of individual patches that can, for example, effect the rate of [[nutrient cycling]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Patches are also linked, although separated from other patches, migration occurs from one patch to another{{Vague|date=January 2010}}. This migration maintains the population of some patches, and can be the mechanism by which some plant species spread. This implies that ecological systems within landscapes are open, rather than closed and isolated. (Pickett, 2006)

== Conservation efforts ==
Recognizing the patch dynamics within a system is needed for [[conservation (ecology)]] efforts to succeed. Successful conservation includes understanding how a patch changes and predicting how they will be affected by external forces{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. These externalities include natural effects, such as [[land use]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], [[ecological restoration|restoration]], and [[Ecological succession|succession]], and the effects of human activities. In a sense, conservation is the active maintenance of patch dynamics (Pickett, 2006). The analysis of patch dynamics could be used to predict changes in biodiversity of an ecosystem. When patches of species can be tracked, it has been shown that fluctuations on the biggest patch (the most dominant species) can be used as an early warning of a  [[Biodiversity]] collapse &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saravia|first=Leonardo A.|last2=Momo|first2=Fernando R.|date=2017-07-01|title=Biodiversity collapse and early warning indicators in a spatial phase transition between neutral and niche communities|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/1589/|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/oik.04256|issn=1600-0706|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That means that if external conditions, like [[climate change]] and [[habitat fragmentation]], change the internal dynamics of patches a sharp reduction in biodiversity can be detected before it is produced &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrado|first=Raffaele|date=2014|title=Early warning signals of desertification transitions in semiarid ecosystems|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.062705|journal=Physical Review E|volume=90|issue=6|doi=10.1103/physreve.90.062705}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Pegaeae''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|dʒ|iː|i}}; Πηγαῖαι) were a type of [[naiad]] that lived in [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s. They were often considered great aunts of the river gods ([[Potamoi]]), thus establishing a mythological relationship between a river itself and its springs.

This is the definition in the broadest of terms, albeit with frequency the usage of peneplain is meant to imply the representation of a near-final (or penultimate) stage of [[fluvial]] [[erosion]] during times of extended [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] stability.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Peneplains are sometimes associated with the [[cycle of erosion]] theory of [[William Morris Davis]],&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;{{efn-ua|The term was coined around 1900 by [[William Morris Davis]] who described it as follows: ''Given sufficient time for the action of denuding forces on a mass of land standing fixed with reference to a constant base-level, and it must be worn down so low and so smooth, that it would fully deserve the name of a plain. But it is very unusual for a mass of land to maintain a fixed position as long as is here assumed.... I have therefore elsewhere suggested that an old region, nearly base-levelled, should be called an almost-plain; that is a peneplain.''&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chorley, R.J. (1973).

The distant peaks at the same elevation represent the remnants of a peneplain that was uplifted to form the [[Allegheny Plateau]], which is a [[dissected plateau]] in southwestern [[New York (state)|New York]]. In this area, the sharp relief that is seen on some of the Allegheny Plateau has been rounded by [[continental glacier|glaciation]].]]

==Types of peneplains==
There are various terms for landforms that are either alternatives to classical peneplains, a sub-set of peneplains or partially overlap with the term. The last is the case of planation surfaces that may be peneplains or not, while some peneplains are not planation surfaces.&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt;

In their 2013 work Green, Lidmar-Bergström and co-workers provide the following classication scheme for peneplains:&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt;
#[[Planation surface]]s
##[[Pediplain]]
##[[Inselberg|Inselberg plain]]
##[[Etchplain]]
#Hilly relief
##Etched hilly relief

[[Rhodes Fairbridge]] and Charles Finkl argue that peneplains are often of mixed origin (polygenetic) as they may have been shaped by etchplanation during periods of humid climate and pediplanation during periods of arid and semi-arid climate. The long time spans under which some peneplains evolve ensures varied [[climatic geomorphology|climatic influences]].&lt;ref name=FairFinkl1980/&gt; The same authors do also list [[marine abrasion]]{{efn-ua|Coastal geomorphologist [[Douglas Wilson Johnson]] has proposed to use the term "peneplane" instead of "peneplain" when a [[planation surface]] is thought to be of marine origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=A.A.  |date=1955 |title=The origin of the South Ireland Peneplane |url= |journal=Irish Geography |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=79–86 |doi= 10.1080/00750775509555491|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[glacial erosion]] among processes that can contribute in shaping peneplains.&lt;ref name=FairFinkl1980/&gt;

In addition epigene peneplains can be distinguished from exhumed peneplains.&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt; Epigene are those that have never been buried or covered by sedimentary rock.&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twidale |first1=C.R. |author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |date=1985 |title=Old landsurfaces and their implications for models of landscape evolution |url= |journal=Revue Geomorphologie Dynamique|volume=34 |issue= |pages=131–147  |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhumed peneplains are those that are re-exposed after having been buried in sediments.&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt;

The oldest identifiable peneplain in a region is known as a primary peneplain&lt;ref name=FairFinkl1980/&gt;{{efn-ua|Akin to what in German scientific literature is known as a ''Primärrumpf''.&lt;ref name=FairFinkl1980/&gt;}} An example of a primary peneplain is the [[Sub-Cambrian peneplain]] in southern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lidmar-Bergström |first1= |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date=1988 |title=Denudation surfaces of a shield area in southern Sweden |journal=[[Geografiska Annaler]] |volume=70 A |issue=4 |pages=337–350 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediplains===
The peneplain concept is often juxtaposed to that of [[pediplain]]. However authors like [[Karna Lidmar-Bergström]] classify pediplains as a type of peneplain.&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt; On the contrary [[Lester Charles King]] held them as incompatible landforms arguing that peneplains do not exist. King wrote:&lt;ref name=King1953&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=L.C. |last2= |first2= |date=1953 |title=Canons of landscape evolution |url=http://www.gsapubs.org/gsabulletin/article-abstract/64/7/721/4571/canons-of-landscape-evolution?redirectedFrom=PDF |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=721–752 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1953)64[721:cole]2.0.co;2|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
:''A peneplain in the Davisian sense, resulting from slope reduction and downwearing, does not exist in nature. It should be redefined as "an imaginary landform."''  
According to King pediplains main difference to Davis’ peneplains is in the history and processes behind, and less so in the final shape. A difference in form that may be present is that of residual hills which in Davis’ peneplains are to have gentle slopes while in pediplains they ought to have the same steepness as the slopes in the early stages of erosion leading to pediplanation.&lt;ref name=King1953/&gt; Given that the coalesced [[pediment (geology)|pediments]] of the pediplains form a series of very gentle concave slopes, a difference with Davis' understanding of peneplains may lie in that his idealized peneplains had very gentle convex slopes instead. However, Davis' views on subject are not fully clear.&lt;ref name=King1953/&gt; Contrary to this view [[Rhodes Fairbridge]] and Charles Finkl argue that the precise mechanism of formation (pediplanation, etc.) is irrelevant and that the term peneplain has been used and can be used in a purely descriptive manner. Further, alternation of processes with varying climate, relative [[sea level]] and [[biota (ecology)|biota]] make old surfaces unlikely to be of a single origin.&lt;ref name=FairFinkl1980/&gt;

==Preservation and destruction of peneplains==
Peneplains that are detached from their base level are identified by either hosting an [[sedimentary basin|accumulation of sediments]] that buries it or by being in an uplifted position. Burial preserves the peneplain. Any exposed peneplain detached from its baselevel can be considered a [[paleosurface]] or [[paleoplain]].&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonow2006a&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonow |first1=Johan M. |last2=Lidmar-Bergström |first2=Karna|last3=Japsen |first3=Peter |date=2006 |title=Palaeosurfaces in central West Greenland as reference for identification of tectonic movements and estimation of erosion |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818106000026 |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]] |volume=50 |issue=3–4 |pages=161–183 |doi= 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2005.12.011|access-date= |bibcode=2006GPC....50..161B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uplift of a peneplain commonly results in renewed erosion.  As Davis put it in  1885:&lt;ref name=Orme2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Orme |first1=Anthony R. |date=2007 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Davisian Cycle of Erosion: Prelude, Fugue, Coda, and Sequel |url= |journal=Physical Geography |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=474–506 |doi= 10.2747/0272-3646.28.6.474|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"the decrepit surface must wait either until extinguished by submergence below the sea, or regenerated by elevation into a new cycle of life"

Uplifted peneplains can be preserved as [[relict (geology)|fossil landfoms]] in conditions of extreme [[desert|aridity]] or under non-eroding cold-based [[glacier]] ice.&lt;ref name=Greenetal2013/&gt; Erosion of peneplains by glaciers in [[shield (geology)|shield region]]s is limited.&lt;ref name=Fairbridge1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karna1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date=1997 |title=A long-term perspective on glacial erosion |journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]] |publisher= |volume=22 |issue= |pages=297–306 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Baltic Shield|Fennoscandian Shield]] average glacier erosion during the [[Quaternary]] amounts to tens of meters, albeit this was not evenly distributed.&lt;ref name=Karna1997/&gt; For glacier erosion to be effective in shields a long "preparation period" of [[weathering]] under non-glacial conditions may be a requirement.&lt;ref name=Fairbridge1988/&gt;

[[Duricrust|Silicification]] of peneplain surfaces exposed to [[sub-tropical]] and [[tropical climate]] for long enough time can protect them from erosion.&lt;ref name=Fairbridge1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fairbridge |first1=Rhodes W. |author-link=Rhodes Fairbridge|date=1988 |title=Cyclical patterns of exposure, weathering and burial of cratonic surfaces, with some examples from North America and Australia |journal=[[Geografiska Annaler]] |volume=70 A |issue=4 |pages=277–283 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4206">In [[geology]], the term '''relict''' refers to structures or minerals from a parent [[rock (geology)|rock]] that did not undergo [[metamorphism|metamorphic change]] when the surrounding rock did, or to rock that survived a destructive geologic process.

Some [[Geology#Geological development of an area|geologic process]]es are destructive or transformative of structures or minerals, and when a process is not complete or does not completely destroy certain features, the left-over feature is a relict of what was there before. For example, relict [[permafrost]] is an area of ancient permafrost which remains despite a change in climate which would prohibit new permafrost from forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A relict [[sediment]] is an area of ancient sediment which remains unburied despite changes in the surrounding environment. In [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]], the study of soil formation and classification, ancient soil found in the geologic record is called a [[paleosol]], material formed in the distant past on what was then the surface. A relict paleosol is still found on the surface, and yet is known to have been formed under conditions radically different from the present climate and topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

In [[mineralogy]], a relict mineral is a surviving mineral from a parent rock that underwent a  destructive or transformative process.  For example, [[serpentinite]] is a kind of rock formed in a process called [[serpentinization]], in which a host mineral produces a [[pseudomorph]], and the original mineral is eventually replaced and/or destroyed, but is still present until the process is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

Within [[geomorphology]] a relict landform is a [[landform]] that took form from geomorphic processes that are not active at present.

[[File:Bronze votive shield.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.5|An [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] warrior's [[shield]]–its circular shape and gently sloping surface, with a central raised area, is a shape shared by many shield volcanoes.]]
A '''shield volcano''' is a type of [[volcano]] usually composed almost entirely of fluid [[lava]] flows. It is named for its low profile, resembling a [[Shield|warrior's shield]] lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid (low [[viscosity]]) lava erupted, which travels farther than lava erupted from a [[stratovolcano]], and results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form.

== Etymology ==
Shield volcanoes are built by [[effusive eruption]]s, which flow out in all directions to create a shield like that of a warrior.&lt;ref name="usgs-shield"/&gt; The word "shield" has a long history, and is derived from the Old English ''scield'' or ''scild'', which is in turn taken from the Proto-Germanic ''*skelduz'', and related to the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''skildus'', meaning "to divide, split, or separate". Shield volcano itself is taken from the German term ''Schildvulkan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shield|title=Shield|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|author=Douglas Harper|publisher=Douglas Harper|year=2010|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Shield volcano diagram|right}}

Shield volcanoes are distinguished from the three other major volcanic archetypes&amp;mdash;[[stratovolcano]]es, [[lava dome]]s, and [[cinder cone]]s&amp;mdash;by their structural form, a consequence of their unique magmatic composition. Of these four forms shield volcanoes erupt the least [[viscosity|viscous]] lavas: whereas stratovolcanoes and especially lava domes are the product of highly immotile flows and cinder cones are constructed by [[explosive eruption|explosively eruptive]] [[tephra]], shield volcanoes are the product of gentle [[effusive eruption]]s of highly fluid lavas that produce, over time, a broad, gently sloped eponymous "shield".&lt;ref name=usgs-types&gt;{{cite web|title=Principal Types of Volcanoes|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/types.html|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=30 December 2013|author=John Watson|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hvw-shield /&gt; Although the term is generally ascribed to basaltic shields it has also at times been appended to rarer [[wikt:scutiform|scutiform]] volcanoes of differing magmatic composition&amp;mdash;principally [[pyroclastic shield]]s, formed by the accumulation of fragmental material from particularly powerful explosive eruptions, and rarer [[felsic]] lava shields formed by unusually fluid felsic magmas.

Shield volcanoes feature a gentle (usually 2° to 3°) slope that gradually steepens with elevation (reaching approximately 10°) before eventually flattening near the summit, forming an overall upwardly convex shape. In height they are typically about one twentieth their width.&lt;ref name="hvw-shield"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Volcanoes Work: Shield Volcanoes|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/shieldvolc_page.html|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the general form of a "typical" shield volcano varies little worldwide regional differences exist in their size and morphological characteristics.

[[Rift zone]]s are a prevalent feature on shield volcanoes that is rare on other volcanic types. The large, decentralized shape of Hawaiian volcanoes as compared to their smaller, symmetrical Icelandic cousins{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} can be attributed to rift eruptions. Fissure venting is common in Hawai{{okina}}i; most Hawaiian eruptions begin with a so-called "wall of fire" along a major fissure line before centralizing to a small number of points. This accounts for their asymmetrical shape, whereas Icelandic volcanoes follow a pattern of central eruptions dominated by [[summit caldera]]s, causing the lava to be more evenly distributed or symmetrical.&lt;ref name="usgs-shield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hvw-shield /&gt;&lt;ref name="hvw-hawaiian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Book: U {{·}} V {{·}} 20|publisher=Scott Fetzer|year=2009|pages=438–443|url=http://worldbookonline.com|isbn=978-0-7166-0109-8|accessdate=22 August 2010|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of what is currently known about shield volcanic eruptive character has been gleaned from studies done on the volcanoes of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]], by far the most intensively studied of all shields due to their scientific accessibility;&lt;ref name=epsl-2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=A new model for the growth of basaltic shields based on deformation of Fernandina volcano, Galápagos Islands|journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]|date=September 2013|volume=377–378|pages=358–366|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2013.07.016|author1=Marco Bagnardia |author2=Falk Amelunga |author3=Michael P. Poland |publisher=Elsevier |bibcode=2013E&amp;PSL.377..358B}}&lt;/ref&gt; the island lends its name to the slow-moving, effusive eruptions typical of shield volcanism, known as [[Hawaiian eruption]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford-2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regelous |first1=M. |last2=Hofmann |first2=A.

These lavas travel a far greater distance than those of other eruptive types before solidifying, forming extremely wide but relatively thin magmatic sheets often less than {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="usgs-shield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hvw-shield /&gt;&lt;ref name="hvw-hawaiian"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Volcanoes Work: Hawaiian Eruptions|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Hawaiian.html|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low volumes of such lavas layered over long periods of time are what slowly constructs the characteristically low, broad profile of a mature shield volcano.&lt;ref name="usgs-shield"&gt;{{cite web|last=Topinka|first=Lyn|title=Description: Shield Volcano|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/ShieldVolcano/description_shield_volcano.html|publisher=USGS|accessdate=21 August 2010|date=28 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unlike other eruptive types, Hawaiian eruptions often occur at decentralized [[fissure vent]]s, beginning with large "curtains of fire" that quickly die down and concentrate at specific locations on the volcano's rift zones. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often take the form of large [[lava fountain]]s (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery [[scoria]] fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with [[clast]]s, they cannot cool off fast enough due to the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, accumulating into [[Volcanic cone#Spatter cone|spatter cone]]s. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived; [[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]], a [[cinder cone]] of [[Kīlauea]], has been erupting continuously since 1983.&lt;ref name="hvw-hawaiian"/&gt;

Flows from Hawaiian eruptions can be divided into two types by their structural characteristics: [[pāhoehoe]] lava which is relatively smooth and flows with a ropey texture, and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|ʻaʻā]] flows which are denser, more viscous (and thus slower moving) and blockier. These lava flows can be anywhere between {{convert|2|and|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} thick. {{okina}}A{{okina}}a lava flows move through pressure&amp;mdash;the partially solidified front of the flow steepens due to the mass of flowing lava behind it until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Though the top of the flow quickly cools down, the molten underbelly of the flow is buffered by the solidifying rock above it, and by this mechanism {{okina}}a{{okina}}a flows can sustain movement for long periods of time. Pāhoehoe flows, in contrast, move in more conventional sheets, or by the advancement of lava "toes" in snaking lava columns. Increasing [[viscosity]] on the part of the lava or [[shear (geology)|shear stress]] on the part of local topography can morph a pāhoehoe flow into an a'a one, but the reverse never occurs.&lt;ref name="hvw-basaltic"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Volcanoes Work: Basaltic Lava|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Basaltic_lava.html|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most shield volcanoes are by volume almost entirely Hawaiian and basaltic in origin, they are rarely exclusively so. Some volcanoes, like [[Mount Wrangell]] in Alaska and [[Cofre de Perote]] in Mexico, exhibit large enough swings in their historical magmatic eruptive characteristics to cast strict categorical assignment in doubt; one geological study of de Perote went so far as to suggest the term "compound shield-like volcano" instead.&lt;ref name=jvgr-2010&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evolution and hazards of a long-quiescent compound shield-like volcano: Cofre de Perote, Eastern Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt|journal=[[Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research]]|date=30 November 2010|volume=197|series=1|issue=4|pages=209–224|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2009.08.010|author=Gerardo Carrasco-Núñeza|publisher=Elsevier|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2010JVGR..197..209C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mature shield volcanoes have multiple cinder cones on their flanks, the results of [[tephra]] ejections common during incessant activity and markers of currently and formerly active sites on the volcano.&lt;ref name=volcworld /&gt;&lt;ref name=hvw-hawaiian /&gt; One prominent such parasitic cones is Puʻu ʻŌʻō on Kīlauea&lt;ref name="worldbook"/&gt;&amp;mdash;continuous activity ongoing since 1983 has built up a {{convert|2290|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall cone at the site of one of the longest-lasting rift eruptions in known history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of the Pu`u `Ō `ō-Kupaianaha Eruption, 1983-present|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/summary/|publisher=United States Geological Service - Hawaii Volcano Observatory|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hawaiian shield volcanoes and the Galápagos islands are unique{{Clarify|reason = unique? what about e.g. lord howe island? Isn't it common for seamount chains to be caused by mid-plate hotspots which thus generate numerous shield volcanoes?..|date=May 2015}} in that they are not located near any [[plate tectonics|plate boundaries]]; instead, the two chains are fed by the movement of oceanic plates over an upwelling of magma known as a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. Over millions of years, the tectonic movement that moves continents also creates long volcanic trails across the seafloor. The Hawaiian and Galápagos shields, and other hotspot shields like them, are both constructed of oceanic island basalt. Their lavas are characterized by high levels of [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[aluminium]].&lt;ref name=uoo-galapagos /&gt;

Features common in shield volcanism include [[lava tube]]s.&lt;ref name="vhp-shield"&gt;{{cite web|title=VHP Photo Glossary: Shield volcano|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/images/pglossary/ShieldVolcano.php|publisher=USGS|accessdate=23 August 2010|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lava tubes are cave-like volcanic straights formed by the hardening of overlaying lava. These structures help further the propagation of lava, as the walls of the tube [[Thermal insulation|insulate]]s the lava within.&lt;ref name="usgs-lava tubes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Topinka|first=Lyn|title=Description: Lava Tubes and Lava Tube Caves|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/LavaTubes/description_lava_tubes.html|publisher=USGS|accessdate=23 August 2010|date=18 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lava tubes can account for a large portion of shield volcano activity; for example, an estimated 58% of the lava forming Kīlauea comes from lava tubes.&lt;ref name="vhp-shield"/&gt;

In some shield volcano eruptions, [[basalt]]ic lava pours out of a long [[fissure vent|fissure]] instead of a central vent, and shrouds the countryside with a long band of volcanic material in the form of a broad [[plateau]]. Plateaus of this type exist in [[Iceland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Idaho]]; the most prominent ones are situated along the [[Snake River]] in Idaho and the [[Columbia River]] in Washington and Oregon, where they have been measured to be over {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} in thickness.&lt;ref name="usgs-shield"/&gt;

[[Caldera]]s are a common feature on shield volcanoes. They are formed and reformed over the volcano's lifespan. Long eruptive periods form cinder cones, which then collapse over time to form calderas. The calderas are often filled up by future eruptions, or formed elsewhere, and this cycle of collapse and regeneration takes place throughout the volcano's lifespan.&lt;ref name=volcworld /&gt;

Interactions between water and lava at shield volcanoes can cause some eruptions to become [[hydrovolcanic eruption|hydrovolcanic]]. These [[Explosive eruption|explosive]] eruptions are drastically different from the usual shield volcanic activity,&lt;ref name=volcworld /&gt; and are especially prevalent at the waterbound volcanoes of the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain|Hawaiian Isle]]s.&lt;ref name=hvw-hawaiian /&gt;

{{main|List of shield volcanoes}}
Shield volcanoes are found worldwide. They can form over [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s (points where [[magma]] from below the surface wells up), such as the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]] and the [[Galápagos Islands]], or over more conventional [[rift zone]]s, such as the [[Volcanology of Iceland|Icelandic shield]]s and the shield volcanoes of East Africa. Many shield volcanoes are found in [[ocean basin]]s, such as [[Tamu Massif]], the world's largest, although they can be found inland as well&amp;mdash;East Africa being one example of this.&lt;ref name=bk-2009&gt;{{cite book|title=The changing Earth : exploring geology and evolution|year=2006|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-55480-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFPMa4MxwJkC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=shield+volcanoes+africa#v=onepage&amp;q=shield%20volcanoes%20africa&amp;f=false|author1=James S.

=== Hawaiian islands ===
The largest and most prominent shield volcano chain in the world is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], a [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain|chain]] of [[Hawaii hotspot|hotspot volcanoes]] in the Pacific Ocean. The Hawaiian volcanoes are characterized by frequent [[rift zone|rift eruption]]s, their large size (thousands of km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in volume), and their rough, decentralized shape. [[Rift zone]]s are a prominent feature on these volcanoes, and account for their seemingly random volcanic structure.&lt;ref name=hvw-shield /&gt; They are fueled by the movement of the [[Pacific Plate]] over the [[Hawaii hotspot]], and form a long chain of volcanoes, [[atoll]]s, and [[seamount]]s {{convert|2600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long with a total volume of over {{convert|750000|km3|cumi|0|abbr=on}}. The chain contains at least 43 major volcanoes, and [[Meiji Seamount]] at its terminus near the [[Kuril–Kamchatka Trench]] is 85&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref name="lt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Jim|title=The long trail of the Hawaiian hotspot|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/Hawaiian.html|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=13 February 2011|date=5 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/petrology/44.1.113|last=Regelous|first=M.|author2=Hofmann, A.W.|author3=Abouchami, W.|author4=Galer, S.J.G.|year=2003|title=Geochemistry of Lavas from the Emperor Seamounts, and the Geochemical Evolution of Hawaiian Magmatism from 85 to 42 Ma|journal=[[Journal of Petrology]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=44|issue=1|pages=113–140|url=http://www.gzn.uni-erlangen.de/fileadmin/data/kruste/mitarbeiter/Marcel/JPET2003.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101930/http://www.gzn.uni-erlangen.de/fileadmin/data/kruste/mitarbeiter/Marcel/JPET2003.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=|bibcode=2003JPet...44..113R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcanoes follow a distinct [[Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes|evolutionary pattern]] of growth and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of Hawaiian Volcanoes|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1995/95_09_08.html|publisher=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory - United States Geological Survey|accessdate=28 February 2011|date=8 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chain includes the second largest volcano on Earth, [[Mauna Loa]], which stands {{convert|4170|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level and reaches a further {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} below the waterline and into the crust, approximately {{convert|80000|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of rock.&lt;ref name=vhp-shield /&gt; [[Kīlauea]], meanwhile, is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, with the current ongoing eruption having begun in January 1983.&lt;ref name="usgs-shield"/&gt;

=== Galápagos islands ===
The [[Galápagos Islands]] are an isolated set of volcanoes, consisting of shield volcanoes and [[lava plateau]]s, located {{convert|1200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Ecuador]]. They are driven by the [[Galápagos hotspot]], and are between approximately 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age.&lt;ref name=uoo-galapagos/&gt; The largest island, [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela Island]], consists of six coalesced shield volcanoes, each delineated by a large summit caldera.

[[Cerro Azul (Ecuador volcano)|Blue Hill]] is a shield volcano on the south western part of [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela Island]] in the [[Galápagos Islands]] and is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption between May and June 2008.  The Geophysics Institute at the [[National Polytechnic School (Ecuador)|National Polytechnic School]] in [[Quito]] houses an international team of [[seismology|seismologists]] and [[Volcanology|volcanologists]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igepn.edu.ec/  Institute for Geophysics at National Polytechnic School   ]&lt;/ref&gt; whose responsibility is to monitor [[Ecuador]]s numerous active volcanoes in the Andean Volcanic Belt and the Galapagos Islands.  [[La Cumbre (Galápagos Islands)|La Cumbre]]  is an active shield volcano on [[Fernandina Island]] in the Galapagos that has been erupting since April 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galapagos volcano erupts, could threaten wildlife|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090412/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_ecuador_galapagos_volcano|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415162111/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090412/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_ecuador_galapagos_volcano|archivedate=2009-04-15|date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galápagos islands are geologically young for such a big chain, and the pattern of their [[rift zone]]s follows one of two trends, one north-northwest, and one east–west. The composition of the lavas of the Galápagos shields are strikingly similar to those of the Hawaiian volcanoes. Curiously, they do not form the same volcanic "line" associated with most hotspots. They are not alone in this regard; the [[Cobb–Eickelberg Seamount chain]] in the North Pacific is another example of such a delineated chain. In addition, there is no clear pattern of age between the volcanoes, suggesting a complicated, irregular pattern of creation. How exactly the islands were formed remains a geological mystery, although several theories have been fronted.&lt;ref name=usgs-galapagos&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=K.|title=Potassium-Argon Ages from the Galapagos Islands|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=30 April 1976|volume=192|issue=4238|pages=465–467|doi=10.1126/science.192.4238.465|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/192/4238/465.short|accessdate=25 February 2011|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|bibcode = 1976Sci...192..465B|pmid=17731085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iceland ===
[[File:Skjaldbreidur Herbst 2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Skjaldbreiður]], [[Iceland]], is [[eponymous]] for shield volcanoes.]]

Another major center of shield volcanic activity is [[Iceland]]. Located over the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a [[divergent plate|divergent]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Iceland is the site of about 130 volcanoes of various types.&lt;ref name=worldbook /&gt; Icelandic shield volcanoes are generally of [[Holocene]] age, between 5000 and 10000 years old, except for the island of [[Surtsey]], a [[Surtseyan eruption|Surtseyan shield]]. The volcanoes are also very narrow in distribution, occurring in two bands in the West and North Volcanic Zones. Like Hawaiian volcanoes, their formation initially begins with several eruptive centers before centralizing and concentrating at a single point. The main shield then forms, burying the smaller ones formed by the early eruptions with its lava.&lt;ref name=uog/&gt;

Icelandic shields are mostly small (~{{convert|15|km3|cumi|0|abbr=on}}), symmetrical (although this can affected by surface topography), and characterized by eruptions from [[caldera|summit calderas]].&lt;ref name=uog&gt;{{cite web|title=Holocene shield volcanoes in Iceland|url=http://geoleoedocs.sub.uni-goettingen.de:8080/dspace/bitstream/gledocs-108/1/Andrews%2BGudmundsson.pdf|publisher=University of Göttingen|accessdate=21 February 2011|author1=Ruth Andrews|author2=Agust Gudmundsson|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611035239/http://geoleoedocs.sub.uni-goettingen.de:8080/dspace/bitstream/gledocs-108/1/Andrews%2BGudmundsson.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of either [[Tholeiitic basalt|tholeiitic]] [[olivine]] or [[Picrite basalt|picritic basalt]].

=== East Africa ===

East Africa is the site of volcanic activity generated by the development of the [[East African Rift]], a developing plate boundary in Africa, and from nearby hotspots. Some volcanoes interact with both. Shield volcanoes are found near the rift and off the coast of Africa, although stratovolcanoes are more common. Although sparsely studied, the fact that all of its volcanoes are of Holocene age reflects how young the volcanic center is. One interesting characteristic of East African volcanism is a penchant for the formation of [[lava lake]]s; these semi-permanent lava bodies, extremely rare elsewhere, form in about nine percent of African eruptions.&lt;ref name=usgs-africa&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa Volcanoes and Volcanics|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Africa/description_africa_volcanics.html|publisher=United States Geological Service|accessdate=28 February 2011|author=Lyn Topinka|date=2 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most active shield volcano in Africa is [[Nyamuragira]]. Eruptions at the shield volcano are generally centered within the large summit caldera or on the numerous fissures and cinder cones on the volcano's flanks. Lava flows from the most recent century extend down the flanks more than {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the summit, reaching as far as [[Lake Kivu]]. [[Erta Ale]] in [[Ethiopia]] is another active shield volcano, and one of the few places in the world with a permanent lava lake, which has been active since at least 1967, and possibly since 1906.&lt;ref name=usgs-africa/&gt; Other volcanic centers include [[Menengai]], a massive shield caldera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menengai|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0202-06=|work=[[Global Volcanism Program]]|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mount Marsabit]], near the town of [[Marsabit]].

[[File:Olympus Mons and Hawaii to scale.png|thumb|left|Scaled image showing [[Olympus Mons]], top, and the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian island chain]], bottom. [[Volcanology of Mars|Martian volcanoes]] are far larger than those found on Earth.]]

Volcanoes are not limited to Earth; they can exist on any [[rocky planet]] or [[moon]] large or active enough to have a [[molten]] [[inner core]], and since probes were first launched in the 1960s, volcanoes have been found across the solar system. Shield volcanoes and volcanic vents have been found on [[Mars]], [[Venus]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]]; [[cryovolcano]]es on [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]; and subsurface hotspots on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].&lt;ref name="dk"&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Encyclopedia|year=1999|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=0-7894-4708-8|author1=Heather Couper  |author2=Nigel Henbest |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Volcanology of Mars|volcanoes of Mars]] are very similar to the shield volcanoes on Earth. Both have gently sloping flanks, collapse craters along their central structure, and are built of highly fluid lavas. Volcanic features on Mars were observed long before they were first studied in detail during the 1976–1979 [[Viking program|Viking mission]]. The principal difference between the volcanoes of Mars and those on Earth is in terms of size; Martian volcanoes range in size up to {{convert|14|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|370|mi|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, far larger than the {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|74|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} wide Hawaiian shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/extraterrestrial.html|title=Extraterrestrial Volcanism|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=February 5, 1997|author=Watson, John|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masursky|first1= H.|year=1973|last2=Masursky|first2=Harold|last3=Saunders|first3=R.

In stellar evolution, an '''isochrone''' is a curve on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], representing a population of stars of the same age.&lt;ref name=Frebel2015/&gt;  

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots a star’s luminosity against its temperature, or equivalently, its color. Stars change their positions on the HR diagram throughout their life. Newborn stars of low or intermediate mass are born cold but extremely luminous. They contract and dim along the [[Hayashi track]], decreasing in luminosity but staying at roughly the same temperature, until reaching the [[main sequence]] directly or by passing through the [[Henyey track]]. Stars evolve relatively slowly along the main sequence as they fuse hydrogen, and after the vast majority of their lifespan, all but the least massive stars become giants. They then evolve quickly towards their stellar endpoints: white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.

Isochrones can be used to date [[open clusters]] because their members all have roughly the same age.&lt;ref name=Frebel2015/&gt; If the [[initial mass function]] of the open cluster is known, isochrones can be calculated at any age by taking every star in the initial population, using numerical simulations to evolve it forwards to the desired age, and plotting the star’s luminosity and magnitude on the HR diagram.  The resulting curve is an isochrone, which can be compared against the observational [[color-magnitude diagram]] to determine how well they match. If they match well, the assumed age of the isochrone is close to the actual age of the cluster.

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''thermal efficiency''' (&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm th}&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] performance measure of a device that uses [[thermal energy]], such as an [[internal combustion engine]], a [[steam turbine]] or a [[steam engine]], a [[boiler]], [[furnace]], or a [[refrigerator]] for example. For a [[heat engine]], thermal efficiency is the fraction of the energy added by heat ([[primary energy]]) that is converted to net work output (secondary energy). In the case of a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration or heat pump cycle]], thermal efficiency is the ratio of net heat output for heating, or removal for cooling, to energy input (the coefficient of performance).

==Overview==
[[File:Efficiency diagram by Zureks.svg|thumb|left|Output (mechanical) energy is always lower than input energy]]

In general, [[energy conversion efficiency]] is the [[ratio]] between the useful output of a [[energy conversion machine|device]] and the input, in [[energy]] terms. For thermal efficiency, the input, &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm in}&lt;/math&gt;, to the device is [[heat]], or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed. The desired output is mechanical [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], &lt;math&gt;W_{\rm out}&lt;/math&gt;, or heat, &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm out}&lt;/math&gt;, or possibly both. Because the input heat normally has a real financial cost, a memorable, generic definition of thermal efficiency is&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics'', by Howell and Buckius, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm  th} \equiv \frac{\text{benefit}}{\text{cost}}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the energy output cannot exceed the input (nor can it be equal), so

:&lt;math&gt;0 \le \eta_{\rm th} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

When expressed as a percentage, the thermal efficiency must be between 0% and 100%. Efficiency is typically less than 100% because there are inefficiencies such as friction and heat loss that convert the energy into alternative forms. For example, a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25% efficiency, and a large coal-fuelled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46%, advances in Formula 1 motorsport regulations have pushed teams to develop highly efficient power units which peak around 45–50% thermal efficiency. [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C|The largest diesel engine in the world]] peaks at 51.7%. In a [[combined cycle]] plant, thermal efficiencies are approaching 60%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ge-energy.com/prod_serv/products/gas_turbines_cc/en/h_system/index.htm GE Power’s H Series Turbine]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a real-world value may be used as a [[figure of merit]] for the device.

For engines where a fuel is burned there are two types of thermal efficiency: indicated thermal efficiency and brake thermal efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;The Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice: Vol. 1 - 2nd Edition, Revised, MIT Press, 1985, Charles Fayette Taylor - Equation 1-4, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; This efficiency is only appropriate when comparing similar types or similar devices.

For other systems the specifics of the calculations of efficiency vary but the non dimensional input is still the same. Efficiency = Output energy / input energy

==Heat engines==
Heat engines transform [[thermal energy]], or heat, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; into [[mechanical energy]], or [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], ''W''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. They cannot do this task perfectly, so some of the input heat energy is not converted into work, but is dissipated as [[waste heat]] ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; into the environment

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in} = W_{\rm out} + Q_{\rm out} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The thermal efficiency of a [[heat engine]] is the percentage of heat energy that is transformed into [[work (thermodynamics)|work]]. Thermal efficiency is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{
\rm th} \equiv \frac{W_{\rm out}}{Q_{\rm in}} = \frac{ {Q_{\rm in}} - Q_{\rm out}} {Q_{\rm in}} = 1 - \frac{Q_{\rm out}}{Q_{\rm in}}&lt;/math&gt;

The efficiency of even the best heat engines is low; usually below 50% and often far below. So the energy lost to the environment by heat engines is a major waste of energy resources, Since a large fraction of the fuels produced worldwide go to powering heat engines, perhaps up to half of the useful energy produced worldwide is wasted in engine inefficiency, although modern [[cogeneration]], [[combined cycle]] and [[energy recycling]] schemes are beginning to use this heat for other purposes. This inefficiency can be attributed to three causes. There is an overall theoretical limit to the efficiency of any heat engine due to temperature, called the Carnot efficiency. Second, specific types of engines have lower limits on their efficiency due to the inherent [[irreversibility]] of the [[engine cycle]] they use. Thirdly, the nonideal behavior of real engines, such as mechanical [[friction]] and losses in the [[combustion]] process causes further efficiency losses.

===Carnot efficiency===
{{Main|Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)}}
The [[second law of thermodynamics]] puts a fundamental limit on the thermal efficiency of all heat engines. Even an ideal, frictionless engine can't convert anywhere near 100% of its input heat into work. The limiting factors are the temperature at which the heat enters the engine, &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat, &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C}\,&lt;/math&gt;, measured in an absolute scale, such as the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scale. From [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]], for any engine working between these two temperatures:&lt;ref name="Holman"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Holman
  | first = Jack P.

  | isbn = 0-07-029625-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm  th} \le 1 - \frac{T_{\rm C}}{T_{\rm H}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

This limiting value is called the '''Carnot cycle efficiency''' because it is the efficiency of an unattainable, ideal, [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] engine cycle called the [[Carnot cycle]]. No device converting heat into mechanical energy, regardless of its construction, can exceed this efficiency.

Examples of &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H}\,&lt;/math&gt; are the temperature of hot steam entering the turbine of a [[steam power plant]], or the temperature at which the fuel burns in an [[internal combustion engine]]. &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C}\,&lt;/math&gt; is usually the ambient temperature where the engine is located, or the temperature of a lake or river into which the waste heat is discharged. For example, if an automobile engine burns gasoline at a temperature of &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H} = 816^\circ \text{C} = 1500^\circ \text{F}  = 1089 \text{K}\,&lt;/math&gt; and the ambient temperature is &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C} = 21^\circ \text{C} = 70^\circ \text{F} = 294 \text{K}\,&lt;/math&gt;, then its maximum possible efficiency is:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm  th} \le \left (1 -  \frac{294 K}{1089 K} \right ) 100\% = 73.0\%&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that since &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C}\,&lt;/math&gt; is fixed by the environment, the only way for a designer to increase the Carnot efficiency of an engine is to increase &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the temperature at which the heat is added to the engine. The efficiency of ordinary heat engines also generally increases with [[operating temperature]], and advanced structural materials that allow engines to operate at higher temperatures is an active area of research.

Due to the other causes detailed below, practical engines have efficiencies far below the Carnot limit. For example, the average automobile engine is less than 35% efficient.

Carnot's theorem applies to thermodynamic cycles, where thermal energy is converted to mechanical work. Devices that convert a fuel's chemical energy directly into electrical work, such as [[fuel cells]], can exceed the Carnot efficiency.

===Engine cycle efficiency===
The Carnot cycle is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] and thus represents the upper limit on efficiency of an engine cycle. Practical engine cycles are irreversible and thus have inherently lower efficiency than the Carnot efficiency when operated between the same temperatures &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C}\,&lt;/math&gt;. One of the factors determining efficiency is how heat is added to the working fluid in the cycle, and how it is removed. The Carnot cycle achieves maximum efficiency because all the heat is added to the working fluid at the maximum temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and removed at the minimum temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C}\,&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, in an internal combustion engine, the temperature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder is nowhere near its peak temperature as the fuel starts to burn, and only reaches the peak temperature as all the fuel is consumed, so the average temperature at which heat is added is lower, reducing efficiency.

An important parameter in the efficiency of combustion engines is the [[specific heat ratio]] of the air-fuel mixture, ''γ''. This varies somewhat with the fuel, but is generally close to the air value of 1.4. This standard value is usually used in the engine cycle equations below, and when this approximation is made the cycle is called an ''air-standard cycle''. 

*'''Otto cycle: automobiles''' The [[Otto cycle]] is the name for the cycle used in spark-ignition [[internal combustion engine]]s such as gasoline and [[hydrogen fuel|hydrogen fuell]]ed [[automobile engine]]s. Its theoretical efficiency depends on the [[compression ratio]] ''r'' of the engine and the [[specific heat ratio]] ''γ'' of the gas in the combustion chamber.&lt;ref name="Holman"/&gt;{{rp|558}}
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm th} = 1 - \frac{1}{r^{\gamma-1}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the efficiency increases with the compression ratio. However the compression ratio of Otto cycle engines is limited by the need to prevent the uncontrolled combustion known as [[Engine knocking|knocking]]. Modern engines have compression ratios in the range 8 to 11, resulting in ideal cycle efficiencies of 56% to 61%.
*'''Diesel cycle: trucks and trains''' In the [[Diesel cycle]] used in [[diesel engine|diesel truck and train engines]], the fuel is ignited by compression in the cylinder. The efficiency of the Diesel cycle is dependent on ''r'' and ''γ'' like the Otto cycle, and also by the ''cutoff ratio'', ''r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is the ratio of the cylinder volume at the beginning and end of the combustion process:&lt;ref name="Holman" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm th} = 1-\frac{r^{1-\gamma}(r_{\rm c}^\gamma - 1)}{\gamma(r_{\rm c} - 1)} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:The Diesel cycle is less efficient than the Otto cycle when using the same compression ratio. However, practical Diesel engines are 30% - 35% more efficient than gasoline engines.&lt;ref name="FEG"&gt;{{cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, since the fuel is not introduced to the combustion chamber until it is required for ignition, the compression ratio is not limited by the need to avoid knocking, so higher ratios are used than in spark ignition engines.
*'''Rankine cycle: steam power plants''' The [[Rankine cycle]] is the cycle used in steam turbine power plants. The overwhelming majority of the world's electric power is produced with this cycle. Since the cycle's working fluid, water, changes from liquid to vapor and back during the cycle, their efficiencies depend on the thermodynamic properties of water. The thermal efficiency of modern steam turbine plants with reheat cycles can reach 47%, and in [[combined cycle]] plants, in which a steam turbine is powered by exhaust heat from a gas turbine, it can approach 60%.&lt;ref name="Holman" /&gt;
*'''Brayton cycle: gas turbines and jet engines''' The [[Brayton cycle]] is the cycle used in [[gas turbine]]s and [[jet engine]]s. It consists of a compressor that increases pressure of the incoming air, then fuel is continuously added to the flow and burned, and the hot exhaust gasses are expanded in a turbine. The efficiency depends largely on the ratio of the pressure inside the combustion chamber ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the pressure outside ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref name="Holman" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm th} = 1 - \bigg(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\bigg)^\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma} \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Other inefficiencies===
The above efficiency formulas are based on simple idealized mathematical models of engines, with no friction and working fluids that obey simple thermodynamic rules called the [[ideal gas law]]. Real engines have many departures from ideal behavior that waste energy, reducing actual efficiencies far below the theoretical values given above. Examples are:
*[[friction]] of moving parts
*inefficient combustion
*heat loss from the combustion chamber
*departure of the working fluid from the thermodynamic properties of an [[ideal gas]]
*aerodynamic drag of air moving through the engine
*energy used by auxiliary equipment like oil and water pumps.
*inefficient compressors and turbines
*imperfect valve timing
Another source of inefficiency is that engines must be optimized for other goals besides efficiency, such as low [[pollution]]. The requirements for vehicle engines are particularly stringent: they must be designed for low [[Emissions reduction|emissions]], adequate acceleration, fast starting, light weight, low noise, etc. These require compromises in design (such as altered [[valve timing]] to reduce emissions) that reduce efficiency. The average automobile engine is only about 35% efficient, and must also be kept idling at stoplights, wasting an additional 17% of the energy, resulting in an overall efficiency of 18%.&lt;ref name="FEG" /&gt; Large stationary [[electricity generation|electric generating plants]] have fewer of these competing requirements as well as more efficient Rankine cycles, so they are significantly more efficient than vehicle engines, around 50% Therefore, replacing [[internal combustion]] vehicles with [[electric vehicle]]s, which run on a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] that is charged with electricity generated by burning fuel in a power plant, has the theoretical potential to increase the thermal efficiency of energy use in transportation, thus decreasing the demand for fossil fuels.

When comparing different heat engines as sources of power, such as electric power or the power to run vehicles, the engine efficiency alone is only one factor. To give a meaningful comparison, the overall efficiency of the entire energy supply chain from the fuel source to the consumer must be considered. Although the heat wasted by heat engines is usually the largest source of inefficiency, factors such as the energy cost of fuel refining and transportation, and energy loss in electrical transmission lines to transport it, may offset the advantage of a more efficient heat engine.

==Energy conversion==
For a device that [[Energy transformation|converts energy]] from another form into thermal energy (such as an electric heater, boiler, or furnace), the thermal efficiency is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\rm th} \equiv \frac{Q_{\rm out}}{Q_{\rm in}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; quantities are heat-equivalent values.

So, for a boiler that produces 210&amp;nbsp;kW (or 700,000 BTU/h) output for each 300&amp;nbsp;kW (or 1,000,000 BTU/h) heat-equivalent input, its thermal efficiency is 210/300 = 0.70, or 70%. This means that 30% of the energy is lost to the environment.

An [[electric resistance heater]] has a thermal efficiency close to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12520|title=Energy Saver - Department of Energy|author=|date=|website=www.energysavers.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing heating units, such as a highly efficient electric resistance heater to an 80% efficient natural gas-fuelled furnace, an [[Engineering economics|economic analysis]] is needed to determine the most cost-effective choice.

===Effects of fuel heating value===
{{Main|Heating value}}

The '''heating value''' of a [[fuel]] is the amount of [[heat]] released during an [[exothermic reaction]] (e.g., [[combustion]]) and is a characteristic of each substance. It is measured in units of [[energy]] per unit of the substance, usually [[mass]], such as: kJ/kg, [[joule|J]]/[[mole (unit)|mol]].

The heating value for [[fuel]]s is expressed as the HHV, LHV, or GHV to distinguish treatment of the heat of phase changes:

* '''[[Higher heating value]]''' ('''HHV''') is determined by bringing all the products of combustion back to the original pre-combustion temperature, and in particular condensing any vapor produced. This is the same as the thermodynamic [[heat of combustion]].
* '''[[Lower heating value]]''' ('''LHV''') (or ''net calorific value'') is determined by subtracting the [[heat of vaporization]] of the water vapor from the higher heating value. The energy required to vaporize the water therefore is not realized as heat.
* '''Gross heating value''' accounts for water in the exhaust leaving as vapor, and includes liquid water in the fuel prior to combustion. This value is important for fuels like [[wood]] or [[coal]], which will usually contain some amount of water prior to burning.

Which definition of heating value is being used significantly affects any quoted efficiency. Not stating whether an efficiency is HHV or LHV renders such numbers very misleading.

==Heat pumps and refrigerators==
[[Heat pump]]s, [[refrigerator]]s and [[air conditioner]]s use work to move heat from a colder to a warmer place, so their function is the opposite of a heat engine. The work energy (''W''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;) that is applied to them is converted into heat, and the sum of this energy and the heat energy that is moved from the cold reservoir (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the total heat energy added to the hot reservoir (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm H} = Q_{\rm C} + W_{\rm in} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Their efficiency is measured by a [[coefficient of performance]] (COP). Heat pumps are measured by the efficiency with which they add heat to the hot reservoir, COP&lt;sub&gt;heating&lt;/sub&gt;; refrigerators and air conditioners by the efficiency with which they remove heat from the cold interior, COP&lt;sub&gt;cooling&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{heating}} \equiv \frac{Q_{\rm H}}{W_{\rm in}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{cooling}} \equiv \frac{Q_{\rm C}}{W_{\rm in}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The reason the term "coefficient of performance" is used instead of "efficiency" is that, since these devices are moving heat, not creating it, the amount of heat they move can be greater than the input work, so the COP can be greater than 1 (100%). Therefore, heat pumps can be a more efficient way of heating than simply converting the input work into heat, as in an electric heater or furnace.

Since they are heat engines, these devices are also limited by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]]. The limiting value of the Carnot 'efficiency' for these processes, with the equality theoretically achievable only with an ideal 'reversible' cycle, is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{heating}}  \le \frac{T_{\rm H}}{T_{\rm H} - T_{\rm C}}=\mathrm{COP}_\mathrm{heating,carnot}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{cooling}}  \le \frac{T_{\rm C}}{T_{\rm H} - T_{\rm C}}=\mathrm{COP}_\mathrm{cooling,carnot}&lt;/math&gt;

The same device used between the same temperatures is more efficient when considered as a heat pump than when considered as a refrigerator:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{heating}} - \mathrm{COP}_{\mathrm{cooling}} = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is because when heating, the work used to run the device is converted to heat and adds to the desired effect, whereas if the desired effect is cooling the heat resulting from the input work is just an unwanted by-product. Sometimes, the term efficiency is used for the ratio of the achieved COP to the Carnot COP, which can not exceed 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://industrialheatpumps.nl/en/how_it_works/cop_heat_pump/|title=Coefficient of Performance|last=|first=|date=|website=Industrial Heat Pumps|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
The 'thermal efficiency' is sometimes called the '''energy efficiency'''. In the United States, in everyday usage the [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio|SEER]] is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices, as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode. For energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated, e.g., 'this furnace is 90% efficient', but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the [[Annual fuel utilization efficiency|annual fuel use efficiency]] (AFUE).&lt;ref&gt;HVAC Systems and Equipment volume of the ''ASHRAE Handbook'', [[ASHRAE]], Inc., Atlanta, GA, US, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency of heat exchangers==

A counter flow heat exchanger is the most efficient type of heat exchanger in transferring heat energy from one circuit to the other. However, for a more complete picture of heat exchanger efficiency, exergetic considerations must be taken into account.thermal efficiency in ic engine is higher than ec engine.

[[File:Ulubey Canyon Usak Province Turkey.jpg|thumb|A view of Ulubey Canyon.]]
'''Ulubey Canyon Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Ulubey Kanyonu Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[List of nature parks of Turkey|nature park]] in the [[Ulubey, Uşak|Ulubey]] and [[Karahallı]] districts of [[Uşak Province]], [[Turkey]]. The [[canyon]] is the second longest in the world after the [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States. The park provides suitable habitat for many species of animals and plants and is being developed as a centre for [[ecotourism]].

==Canyon==
Ulubey Canyon covers an area of {{convert|119|ha}}.&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt; It is {{convert|100|-|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|135|-|170|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, with a total length of {{convert|40|-|45|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ub"/&gt; It is considered to be the second longest canyon in the world after the [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="sl1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt; The streams Ulubey Creek and Banaz Creek run through the Ulubey Canyon.&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt; The main canyon along both creeks has tens of big lateral canyons.&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt;  The walls of the canyon are {{convert|10|-|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert| 50|-|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. At least three terraces are visible in the canyon walls. In addition, there are many [[cone|conical]] karstic hills along the canyon.&lt;ref name="ub"/&gt;

==Climate==
Being in a transitional zone between the [[Aegean Region|Aegean]] and [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]] regions, Uşak Province exhibits the climate characteristics of both regions. The summer months are warmer and more arid than in the Aegean region, and the winter season is milder than in the Central Anatolian region. Rain brought by air masses from over the [[Aegean Sea]] generates a more humid climate than in Central Anatolia. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|551|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Monthly or seasonal distribution of precipitation is irregular.&lt;ref name="b5"/&gt;

==Ecology==
===Flora===
Plants growing in the nature park include the Turkish pine (''[[Pinus brutia]]''), rockrose (''[[Cistus]]''), oak (''[[Quercus ithaburensis]]''), Turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]''), salt cedar (''[[Tamarix]]''), [[sumac]] (''Rhus''), hackberry (''[[Celtis]]''), broom (''[[Genista]]''), mullein  (''[[Verbascum]]''), milkvetch (''[[Astragalus]]'') and wild marjoram (''[[Origanum]]'').&lt;ref name="b5"/&gt;

===Fauna===
The nature park provides suitable habitat for mammals such as the [[wild boar]], [[hare]], [[fox]], [[jackal]], [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[Indian porcupine]] (''Hystrix indica''), [[porcupine]] and [[jerboa]], the reptiles [[tortoise]], striped viper (''[[Montivipera xanthina]]''), the bird species [[red-legged partridge]], [[common buzzard]], [[hawk]], [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax''), the fish species [[European chub]] (''Squalius cephalus''), [[catfish]] and the insect species multiple-[[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespotted]] [[Lycaenidae|blue butterfly]].&lt;ref name="b5"/&gt;

==Ecotourism==
The area hosted many civilizations in the past including [[Lydia]], [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Attalid dynasty|Kingdom of Pergamon]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Germiyanids]] and finally [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt;

The canyon system of Banaz-Ulubey has a significant potential for [[ecotourism]] in the country.&lt;ref name="ub"/&gt; In August 2013, the canyon was declared a [[nature park]] by the [[Ministry of Forest and Water Management (Turkey)|Ministry of Forest and Water Management]].&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt; In 2015, a {{convert|135|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} glass-floor [[observation deck]] in the form of a [[bow (ship)|ship bow]], constructed {{convert|131|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the canyon floor,&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; and a cafeteria were opened for tourism purposes.&lt;ref name="ut"/&gt; [[Hiking]],&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt; [[backpacking (wilderness)|trekking]] and [[camping]] using tents are popular outdoor activities in the canyon area.&lt;ref name="ub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ut"/&gt; It was reported in June 2015 that about 40,000 tourists visited the nature park in one month.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; The number of visitors in one month rose to nearly 100,000 by March 2016.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

Notable places in the region are [[Cilandiras Bridge]], Duraklı [[Rock-cut tomb]]s, Hasköy monuments, [[Pepuza]],&lt;ref name="ht1"/&gt; and [[Blaundus]] ancient towns,&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; and Salma Creek.&lt;ref name="trt1"/&gt;

==Access==
The nature park is situated in the districts of Ulubey and Karahallı of Uşak Province on the road Uşak-Karahallı. The nearest town to the nature park is Ulubey at a distance of {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south.&lt;ref name="b5"/&gt; The town Ulubey is located {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Uşak]]. Public transport is available between the two locations throughout the day.&lt;ref name="ut"/&gt;

{{Orphan|date=December 2012}}

A '''vector measuring current meter''' (VMCM) is an instrument used for obtaining measurements of horizontal [[velocity]] in the upper ocean, which exploits two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity.&lt;ref name=weller&gt;Weller, R. A., and R. E. Davis, 1980: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0198014980900412 A vector measuring current meter]. Deep-Sea Research Part A, 27, 565&amp;ndash;582.&lt;/ref&gt;
VMCM was developed in the late 1970s by Drs. Robert Weller and Russ Davis and commercially produced by [[EG&amp;G|EG&amp;G Sealink System]] (currently EdgeTech).
The instrument has the capability of one year long deployment at depths of up to 5000 m. Both laboratory and field test results show that the VMCM is capable of making accurate measurements of horizontal velocity in the upper ocean. The VMCM is the current standard for making high quality velocity measurements in near-surface regions &lt;ref name=way&gt;Way, B. S., D. S. Hosom, J. D. Ware, R. P. Trask, and G. P.

Manov, 2000: [http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0426(2000)017%3C0561%3AAIOCMU%3E2.0.CO%3B2 An Intercomparison of Current Measurements Using a Vector Measuring Current Meter, an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and a Recently Developed Acoustic Current Meter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

The main components of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate [[compass]], which permits to evaluate the direction of [[flux]], providing the angle of the Y axis with respect to the [[magnetic North]].
A [[microprocessor]] rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, at the end of the record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette [[magnetic tape]]. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an outer bearing race, a ball retainer and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or Noryl plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.

Incorporated in the system there is the vector averaging electronics, that uses the pulses from the magnetodiodes and the instrument heading from the flux-gate compass to calculate and record the velocity components. In the 1990s, Way et al.&lt;ref name=way/&gt; upgraded the electronics by redesigning the vector measuring circuitry, data acquisition, and storage components and retaining instead the propeller sensors assembly, which proved to be reliable in the several tests accomplished.&lt;ref name=weller/&gt;&lt;ref name=halpern&gt;Halpern, D., R. A. Weller, M. G. Briscoe, R. E. Davis, and J. R. McCullough, 1981: Intercomparison tests of moored current measurements in the upper ocean,  ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' 86,  No. C1,  pages 419&amp;ndash;428&lt;/ref&gt; A pressure case houses the electronics and the appendage on which the propellers are mounted on.

In its first design of the late 1970s, a VMCM was approximately 2.56 m high and had a mass of 34.5&amp;nbsp;kg in air. The original VMCM is no longer commercially available from [[EG&amp;G]] (currently EdgeTech). The 1970s electronics components are outdated and difficult, if not impossible, to find. Like many of the electronic components the original flux gate compass is no longer available.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

===Propeller sensors===
The innovation brought from VMCM over other current meters results from the choice of the biaxial propeller sensors, developed with accurate cosine response, and the design of the instrument so that flow interference with the instrument body was minimized.&lt;ref name=weller/&gt;

"Cosine response" refers to propellers that only respond to the component of flow parallel to their axis of rotation. Their revolution rate is then proportional to the magnitude of the flow times the cosine of the angle between the axle and the flow vector.
If the angular response function of the propellers is cosinusoidal, then two such sensors at right angles with their axes in the horizontal plane measure orthogonal components of horizontal velocity directly. No computation of components is necessary (though they are rotated from the instrument reference frame into the conventional east-west and north-south components), and summing the components accomplishes the vector averaging.

The advantages of a propeller with cosine response have been widely recognized.&lt;ref name=weller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walrod, R. A., 1970: Propeller current sensor response to off-axis flow, Masters thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 90 pp&lt;/ref&gt; Weller and Davis designed the propeller sensors and their location within the pressure cage in order to obtain a response as close as possible to an ideal cosinusoidal angular response. After having fabricated and testes several families of propellers, they found the best response in a dual propeller (two propellers fixed on an axle) sensor with two five-bladed, 30-degree pitch propellers with diameter of 22&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=weller/&gt; The propellers are hard anodized, epoxy coated on the exterior, and protected by zinc anodes. They have been made from polycarbonate plastic (LEXAN) and, more recently, from Noryl. Propeller sensors make use of [[Cartesian coordinate system]] and provide orthogonal velocity components in the horizontal plane. The measured coordinates need only be rotated in the conventional directions east-west and north-south.

===Pressure cage===

The pressure case houses the electronics and the appendage on which the propellers are mounted on. It is fabricated from 6A1-4V titanium alloy rod (1.27&amp;nbsp;cm diameter), which withstand higher yield strength than steel and has a superior resistance to [[corrosion]] and [[metal fatigue]] in the seawater. Designed in this way, the pressure cage is capable of taking tensions of up to 10,000 pounds &lt;ref name=way/&gt; and hold the electronics and the propeller sensors in isolation of the tension. This permits a safe working until 5,000 m depth.

Early on, the propeller bearings were a source of failure. After considerable testing, the bearings were upgraded from polycarbonate plastic to silicon nitride and, as a result of this change, there have not been any bearing failures.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

===Data logger/controller===

In the early 1990s, Brian S. Way et al.&lt;ref name=way/&gt; developed a new version of the VMCM and greatly improved the electronic system. The new version of the VMCM includes as primary subunits the vector measuring front-end (consisting of rotor and compass hardware interface) and a low-power microcontroller to accomplish the sampling. Initial sampling setup (e.g. sample rate, averaging interval, calibration factors) is set by command from an Onset Computer (Tattletale 8, TT8). However, actual sampling and computation of vector averages are handled in the VMCM front-end subunit. A Microchip Technology PIC microcontroller handles all of these tasks, producing current vector North and East (Vn and Ve) reading at the desired interval.

In standard operation with the new version of VMCM, the PIC microcontroller in the VMCM front-end samples the rotors and compass at the rate set by the TT8 initially. At each sample, rotor and compass readings are accumulated for vector-averaging and, at the chosen sample interval, the vector averages Vn and Ve are relayed to the TT8 for further processing and/or storage.

===User interface / Setup software===

The main setup program gives the user the ability to choose from the following commands: record interval, which parameters to log (it is possible to add measurement of other parameters such as temperature, [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], [[oxygen]], word time updated with each record, tilt, battery voltage), sample intervals for each selected parameter, start time to begin logging end time to stop logger. In the new version of the VMCM, the ease and flexibility for setting up and adding sensors has decreased the time needed for pre-deployment instrument preparation in port.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

==How VMCM computes horizontal velocity==

The two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The flux-gate compass senses the orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic North and permits to evaluate the direction of flux. The microprocessor rotates the coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, at the end of the record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored.
The rotation of the propeller sensors is detected by the magnetodiodes. As a result of the asymmetry in placement of the magnetodiodes, a staggered pair of pulses is produced each quarter revolution; the phase relationship indicates the sense of direction of rotation and the pulse rate indicates the rate of rotation.&lt;ref name=weller/&gt;

In order to calculate and record the velocity components, the vector averaging circuitry is turned on by a rotor count, which is signaled by a proper sequence of changes in the levels of the magnetodiodes. The instrument heading (&lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;) is determined and stored in a register and updated at a 1-Hz rate (once each second). If either propeller rotates sufficiently (the original version of VMCM had a speed threshold of less than one centimeter per second &lt;ref&gt;Henning, B.,  V. Gandelsman, and K. Cope, 1981: [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp;jsessionid=FL1RPHGBWlDfrvrhlHb6nkZQnrLV2TdhGLGPt0tQ3kZy5HG1VfcS!417798303?arnumber=1151664&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications Vector Measuring Current Meter (VMCM)], EG&amp;G Sea-Link Systems, pages 522&amp;ndash;525&lt;/ref&gt;), a pair of pulses is produced by the magnetodiodes of one hub and a count occurs from the rotor. Then, the cosine and sine of the heading (that is currently stored in the heading register) are added to the proper register that stores the &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; velocity components. To accomplish this, at the end of each sampling interval over which the averaging is performed, the following sums are evaluated:

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{u} = \sum_{i=1}^N cos(\theta_i) + \sum_{j=1}^M sin(\theta_j) &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \bar{v} = - \sum_{i=1}^N sin(\theta_i) + \sum_{j=1}^M cos(\theta_j) &lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of quarter revolutions by the sensor oriented east-west when &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; = 0, M is the number of quarter revolutions by the other sensor, and &lt;math&gt; \theta i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \theta j &lt;/math&gt; are the headings of the instrument in the heading register when the ith and jth pairs of pulses were supplied by the two propeller sensors. The velocity components are stored in a 12-bit registers and, at the end of each sampling interval, they are written as 16-bit words (12 bits of data, 4 bits identifying the channel) on a flash drive support (in its original design of the late 1970s, a cassette tape with more limited storage capacity was used).

The instruments typically record average &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;  and average &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; every sample interval and time every hour. Two other channels of information, such as temperature and pressure, can be recorded. Various sample intervals can be selected.
As the vector averaging circuitry is turned on only when a pair of magnetodiode pulses occurs, the current drain is proportional to the flow rate of the water.

==Comparison with other measuring instruments==

Based on the intercomparison of the test data obtained from the VMCM and from other measuring instruments such as Aandera, VACM, electromagnetic current meters, and ACM, it has been experienced that VMCM sensor introduces the least error in relatively small mean flows when high frequency oscillatory fluctuations are also present.&lt;ref name=weller/&gt;&lt;ref name=halpern/&gt; (because of surface waves, mooring motion, or both). This quality, together with the accuracy of the propeller sensors experienced in steady, unsteady flows, and combinations of both,&lt;ref name=weller/&gt; make the VMCM appropriate to make accurate measurements in the upper ocean.

'''Vincent Noel Serventy''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (6 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 8 September 2007) was a noted [[Australia]]n [[author]], [[ornithologist]] and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]].

Born in [[Armadale, Western Australia]], the youngest of eight children of migrant [[Croats|Croatian]] parents, he graduated from the [[University of Western Australia]] in geology and psychology. He was a CSIRO researcher and teacher before beginning a career as a writer, lecturer and film-maker. He joined the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]] (RAOU) in 1942 and served as either its Branch Secretary or State Representative for [[Western Australia]] 1943-1959. In 1946 he became a life member of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia]] and was for many years its President.

In 1956 he bought a movie camera and began making [[documentary films]] which later led to Australia's first television environment program, ''Nature Walkabout'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 he was awarded the [[Australian Natural History Medallion]]. In 1976 he was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Australian Honours|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/Honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=878304&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true|website=It's an honour|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Vincent Serventy assisted the Conservation Council of WA in its unsuccessful campaign to stop a major road being built through the Trigg Regional Open Space.  This public land had been identified by the System 6 Study Report to the Environmental Protection Authority as having important conservation value with the bushland extending from the sea to tuart and banksia woodland, a rarity in the metropolitan area. Vincent spoke publicly of the importance of this land for its vegetation, landforms and habitat for local fauna and migratory birds. 

Vincent Serventy was a younger brother of the eminent Australian ornithologist [[Dominic Louis Serventy|Dom Serventy]].

Serventy wrote numerous articles on natural history and conservation.  Some of his books are:
* ''The Archipelago of the Recherche. Part 2: Birds'' (AGS Report No.1. Australian Geographical Society: Melbourne, 1952)
* ''The Australian Nature Trail'' (Georgian House: Melbourne, 1965)
* ''A Continent in Danger'' (Survival Books. A Survival Special. Andre Deutsch: London, 1966)

&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{Unreferenced|date=February 2013}}

A '''washout''' is the sudden [[erosion]] of soft [[soil]] or other support surfaces by a gush of [[water]], usually occurring during a heavy downpour of [[rain]] (a [[flash flood]]) or other [[stream]] [[flood]]ing. These downpours may occur locally in a [[thunderstorm]] or over a large area, such as following the [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] of a [[tropical cyclone]]. If a washout occurs in a [[pit crater|crater]]-like formation, it is called a [[sinkhole]], and it usually involves a leaking or broken [[water main]] or [[storm drain|sewerage]] [[water pipe|pipe]]s. Other types of sinkholes, such as collapsed [[cave]]s, are not washouts.

Widespread washouts can occur in [[mountain]]ous areas after heavy rains, even in normally dry [[ravine]]s. A severe washout can become a [[landslide]], or cause a [[dam break]] in an [[earthen dam]]. Like other forms of erosion, most washouts can be prevented by [[vegetation]] whose [[root]]s hold the soil and/or slow the flow of surface and [[groundwater|underground]] water. [[Deforestation]] increases the risk of washouts.  [[Retaining wall]]s and [[culvert]]s may be used to try to prevent washouts, although particularly severe washouts may even destroy these if they are not large or strong enough.

==Effect on road and rail transport==
[[Image:Washout on the RGN.jpg|thumb|200px|A washout occurred on the [[Riverside and Great Northern Railway]] in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]], on June 11, 2004.]]

In road and [[rail transport]], a washout is the result of a [[natural disaster]] where the [[roadbed]] is eroded away by flowing water, usually as the result of a [[flood]]. When a washout destroys a railroad's [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]], the [[rail tracks|track]] is sometimes left suspended in midair across the newly formed gap, or it dips down into a ditch. This phenomenon is discussed in more detail under the term ''[[erosion]]''. Bridges may collapse due to [[bridge scour]] around one or more bridge [[abutment]]s or piers.

In 2004, the remnants of [[Hurricane Frances]], and then [[Hurricane Ivan]], caused a large number of washouts in western [[North Carolina]] and other parts of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], closing some roads for days and parts of the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] for months. Other washouts have also caused [[train wreck]]s where tracks have been unknowingly undermined. [[Motorist]]s have also driven into flooded streams at night, unaware of a new washout on the road in front of them until it is too late to [[brake]], sometimes prompting a [[high-water rescue]].

Major washouts can also ruin [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s or undermine [[utility pole]]s or underground lines, interrupting [[public utilities]].

The '''''World Radio TV Handbook''''', also known as '''''WRTH''''', is a [[directory (databases)|directory]] of virtually every [[Radio station|radio]] and [[TV station]] on Earth, published yearly. It was started in 1947 by [[Oluf Lund Johansen]] (1891–1975) as the ''World Radio Handbook'' (WRH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oz6gh.byethost33.com/lund_johansen.htm O. Lund-Johansen], presented by OZ6GH.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "TV" was added to the title in 1965, when [[Jens M. Frost]] (1919–1999) took over as editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dswci.org/specials/membersofhonour/jens_frost.html DSWCI Member of Honour:  Jens M. Frost]&lt;/ref&gt; It had then already included data for [[television broadcasting]] for some years. After the 40th edition in 1986, Frost handed over editorship to [[Andrew G. Sennitt|Andrew G. (Andy) Sennitt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html Andy Sennitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225753/http://www.agsmedia.nl/body_who.html |date=2012-02-08 }}, own presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition that bears an edition number is the 4th edition, published in 1949. The three previous editions appear to have been:
* the 1st edition, marked "Winter Ed. 1947" on the cover and completed in November 1947
* the 2nd edition, marked "1948 (May-November)" on the cover and completed in May 1948
* the 3rd edition, marked "1948-49" on the cover and completed in November 1948.

Summer Supplements appear to have been issued from 1959 through 1971. From 1959 through 1966 they were called the Summer Supplement. From 1967 through 1971 they were called the Summer Edition.

Through the 1969 edition, the WRTH indicated the date on which the manuscript was completed.

Issues with covers in Danish are known to have been available for the years 1948 May-November (2d ed.), 1950-51 (5th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), 1952 (6th ed.; cover and 1st page in Danish, rest in English, most ads in Danish), and probably others. The 1952 English ed., which is completely in English, has an extra page with world times and agents, and ads in English which are sometimes different from the ads in the Danish edition. Also, the 1953 ed. mentions the availability of a German edition.

[[Oluf Lund Johansen]] published, in conjunction with [[Libreria Hispanoamericana]] of [[Barcelona]], Spain, a [[softbound]] Spanish-language version of the 1960 WRTH. The book was printed in Spain and called ''Guia Mundial de Radio y Television'', and carried the WRTH logo at the time as well as all the editorial references contained in the English-language version. 

Hardbound editions are known to have been available for the years 1963 through 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1975-1978, and probably others.

In chemistry, a '''zwitterion''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|s|v|ɪ|t|ə|ˌ|r|aɪ|ə|n}} {{respell|TSVIT|ə|rye|ən}}; {{ety|de|Zwitter ''{{IPA-de|ˈtsvɪtɐ|}}''&lt;nowiki /&gt;|[[hermaphrodite]]}}), formerly called a '''dipolar ion''', is a [[molecule]] with two or more [[Functional group|functional groups]], of which at least one has a positive and one has a negative [[electrical charge]] and the net charge of the entire molecule is zero. Because they contain at least one positive and one negative charge, zwitterions are also sometimes called '''inner salts'''.&lt;ref name=zwitter&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/Z06752.html ''zwitterionic compounds/zwitterions'']&lt;/ref&gt; The charges on the different functional groups balance each other out, and the molecule as a whole is electrically neutral. The [[pH]] where this happens is known as the [[isoelectric point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gx0fZ_DF5BoC&amp;pg=PA54|title=Biochemistry|last=Das|first=Debajyoti|date=1978|publisher=Academic Publishers|year=|isbn=9788187504825|location=|pages=54|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYa45_BxgukC&amp;pg=PA74|title=Biochemistry|last=Campbell|first=Mary|last2=Farrell|first2=Shawn|date=2007-11-20|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=0495390410|location=|pages=74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike simple [[amphoteric]] compounds that may only form ''either'' a cationic or anionic species, a zwitterion simultaneously has both ionic states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicool.com/definition/amphoteric "Definition of amphoteric"] (2014), Chemicool. Retrieved 2016-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Amino acid]]s are the best-known examples of zwitterions. These compounds contain an [[ammonium]] and a carboxylate group, and can be viewed as arising via a kind of intramolecular [[acid–base reaction]]: The [[amine]] group deprotonates the [[carboxylic acid]].

The zwitterionic structure of [[glycine]] in the solid state has been confirmed by [[neutron diffraction]] measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jönsson|first=P.-G.|author2=Kvick, Å. |year=1972|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B |title=Precision neutron diffraction structure determination of protein and nucleic acid components.

In addition to the amino acids, many other compounds that contain both acidic and basic centres [[tautomer]]ize to the zwitterionic form. Examples, such as [[bicine]] and [[tricine]], contain a basic secondary or tertiary amine fragment together with a carboxylic acid fragment. [[Neutron diffraction]] measurements show that solid [[sulfamic acid]] exists as a zwitterion.&lt;ref name="Sass"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = R. L. Sass |date=April 1960 | title = A neutron diffraction study on the crystal structure of sulfamic acid | journal = Acta Crystallogr. | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–324 | doi = 10.1107/S0365110X60000789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[alkaloid]]s, such as [[LSD]] and [[psilocybin]], exist as zwitterions because they contain carboxylates and ammonium centres.

Many zwitterions contain [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s. Since it lacks N–H bonds, the ammonium center cannot participate in [[tautomer]]ization. Zwitterions containing quaternary ammonium centers are common in biology; a common example are the [[betaine]]s, which serve as [[electrolyte]]s in fish. The membrane-forming phospholipids are also commonly zwitterions. The polar head groups in these compounds are zwitterions, resulting from the presence of the anionic phosphate and cationic quaternary ammonium centres.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M.

== Calculation of the isoelectric point ==
The pH value at the isoelectric point can be calculated from the [[Acid dissociation constant|acid dissociation constant]]s of the acidic and basic groups of the zwitterion (except at high dilution):
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{pH}=\frac{\ce pK_\ce{a_1}+\ce pK_\ce{a_2}} {2}&lt;/math&gt;
'''Derivation:'''

The acid dissociation constants are defined as:
: &lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
       K_\ce{a_1}=c\left(\ce{H3O+}\right)\cdot\frac{c(\ce{Zwitterion})}{c(\ce{Cation})}\\[10px]
       K_\ce{a_2}=c\left(\ce{H3O+}\right)\cdot\frac{c(\ce{Anion})}{c(\ce{Zwitterion})}
             \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplication of these two equations eliminates the concentration of the zwitterion:
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_\ce{a_1}\cdot K_\ce{a_2}=c\left(\ce{H3O+}\right)^2 \cdot\frac{c(\ce{Anion})}{c(\ce{Cation})}&lt;/math&gt;
Because the concentrations of the anion and cation are equal at the isoelectric point, the equation simplifies to:
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_\ce{a_1}\cdot K_\ce{a_2} = c\left(\ce{H3O+}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the square root and logarithm on both sides yields:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{pH}=\frac{\ce pK_\ce{a_1}+\ce pK_\ce{a_2}} {2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multiprotic systems ===
In the case of acidic amino acids (e.g. [[aspartic acid]]) or basic amino acids (e.g. [[lysine]]), the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of the two similar groups are taken into consideration: in the case of amino acids with basic side chains, the side chain and the amino group can both take a positive charge at low pH values, and in the case of amino acids with acidic side chains, the two carboxylic acid groups can both take a negative charge at high pH values. The molecule is therefore neutral halfway between these two p''K'' values, when one of the two similar groups is neutral, so the p''K'' values of the two similar groups are substituted into the equation above&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;Reinhard Kuhn: ''Capillary Electrophoresis: Principles and Practice.'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-642-78058-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; and the average is taken,&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Cherng-ju Kim: ''Advanced Pharmaceutics.'' CRC Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-203-49291-8}}, S.&amp;nbsp;86–99.&lt;/ref&gt; for example for lysine: {{sfrac|8.95 + 10.53|2}} = 9.74&lt;ref name="Godbey"&gt;W. T. Godbey: ''An Introduction to Biotechnology.'' Elsevier, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-908-81848-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; and for aspartic acid: {{sfrac|2.09 + 3.86|2}} = 2.98.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;Raymond Chang: ''Physical Chemistry for the Biosciences.''

==Related compounds==
The [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance structures]] that are used to represent the charge delocalization of [[dipolar compound]]s frequently include zwitterions, even when there is not complete separation of charges like with a stable zwitterion.&lt;ref name="dipolar compounds"&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/D01753.html ''dipolar compounds'']&lt;/ref&gt; Zwitterionic compounds, on the other hand, have stable, separated unit electrical charges on atoms.&lt;ref name=zwitter /&gt;

Also related are [[mesoionic]] compounds, which are dipolar heterocyclic compounds in which both the negative and the positive charge are delocalized.
