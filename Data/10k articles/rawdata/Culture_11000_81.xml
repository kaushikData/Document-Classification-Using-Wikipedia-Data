'''''Amadeus''''' is a 1984 American [[historical period drama|period drama film]] directed by [[Miloš Forman]], adapted by [[Peter Shaffer]] from his stage play ''[[Amadeus]]''. The story, set in [[Vienna]], Austria, during the latter half of the 18th century, is a fictionalized biography of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Mozart's music is heard extensively in the soundtrack of the film. The film follows Italian composer [[Antonio Salieri]]'s rivalry with Mozart at the court of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

The film was nominated for 53 awards and received 40, which included eight [[Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), four [[BAFTA Awards]], four [[Golden Globe]]s, and a Directors Guild of America ([[Directors Guild of America|DGA]]) award. {{As of|2017}}, it is the most recent film to have more than one nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] category. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Amadeus'' 53rd on its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]] list.

==Plot==
An elderly [[Antonio Salieri]] confesses to the murder of his former colleague, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and attempts to kill himself by slitting his throat. Two servants take him to a mental asylum where a priest, Father Vogler, implores him to confess.

Salieri recounts how, even in his youth, he desired to be a composer, much to the chagrin of his father. He prays to God that, if he will make Salieri a famous composer, he will in return promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. He is educated in Vienna and becomes court composer to [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

Mozart arrives in Vienna to perform at the request of his employer, [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]]. Salieri attends the performance to meet Mozart and, despite [[Mozart and scatology|Mozart's obscenity]] and immaturity, finds his talent to be transcendent.

The Emperor desires to commission Mozart to write an opera and, despite the reservations of his advisers, summons him to the palace. Mozart happily accepts the job, much to the annoyance of Salieri. Mozart premieres ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' to mixed reviews from the Emperor. Salieri suspects that Mozart has slept with the star, [[Caterina Cavalieri]], despite his engagement to [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze Weber]].

The Emperor desires that Mozart instruct his niece, [[Duchess Elisabeth of Württemberg|Princess Elisabeth]], in music, but Salieri discourages him from doing so. Constanze visits Salieri to persuade him to make the Emperor reconsider, but she is unsuccessful.

Salieri is enraged that God has bestowed upon Mozart the talent he has so desperately desired and vows to destroy Mozart. Mozart, meanwhile, struggles to find work and begins drinking. His father, [[Leopold Mozart]], comes to visit him in Vienna. Constanze and Mozart take Leopold to a masked party (which Salieri also attends), where Mozart entertains the guests with musical antics. Leopold disapproves of his son's hedonism, and the family argues until Leopold leaves town.

Salieri hires a young girl to pose as the Mozarts' maid while spying for him. She takes him to the Mozart residence, where he discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'', which the Emperor has forbidden. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow [[The Marriage of Figaro|his opera]] to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage.

Messengers arrive in Vienna with news of Leopold's death, and in response a grief-stricken Mozart pens ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. Salieri recognizes the dead commander as symbolic of Leopold and hatches a plan. Wearing Leopold's party mask, Salieri visits Mozart and commissions a [[Requiem]] Mass. Salieri plots to kill Mozart once the piece is finished, then premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own.

At a parody of one of Mozart's own operas, [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] asks Mozart to write an opera for his theater. Mozart, desperate for money, obliges, despite Constanze's insistence that he finish the Requiem Mass. The couple fight and Constanze leaves with their young son, [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl]].

Mozart collapses during a performance of his finished work, ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. Salieri takes him home and offers his assistance on the Requiem. Salieri transcribes Mozart's verbal commands, and they work through the night. The next morning, a gravely ill Mozart apologizes to Salieri for his previous behavior. A guilty Constanze returns home and locks [[Requiem (Mozart)|the unfinished Requiem]] away, only to find that Mozart has died from overwork. Mozart is taken out of the city and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave.

Having finished his tale, Salieri asks how a merciful God could destroy his own beloved just to keep a mediocrity like Salieri from sharing in his glory. As he is pushed down the hall in a wheelchair, Salieri declares himself "the patron saint of mediocrities" and mockingly absolves the other patients of their own inadequacies. Mozart's high-pitched laugh is heard as the screen fades to black.

==Production==
In his autobiography ''Beginning'', [[Kenneth Branagh]] says that he was one of the finalists for the role of Mozart, but was dropped from consideration when Forman decided to make the film with an American cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Branagh|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Branagh|title=Beginning|year=1990|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0-393-02862-1|pages=105–109|location=New York|oclc=20669813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulce reportedly used [[John McEnroe]]'s mood swings as a source of inspiration for his portrayal of Mozart's unpredictable genius.&lt;ref name="Amadeus. DVD. Warner Bros Pictures 2001"&gt;''The Making of Amadeus''. DVD. Warner Bros Pictures, 2001. 20 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meg Tilly]] was cast as Mozart's wife Constanze, but she tore a ligament in her leg the day before shooting started.&lt;ref name="Amadeus. DVD. Warner Bros Pictures 2001" /&gt; She was replaced by [[Elizabeth Berridge (actress)|Elizabeth Berridge]]. [[Simon Callow]], who played Mozart in the original London stage production of ''Amadeus'', was cast as [[Emanuel Schikaneder]], the [[libretto|librettist]] of ''The Magic Flute''.

The film was shot on location in [[Prague]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prague.eu/en/articles/prague-in-films-10534 Prague in Films], prague.eu&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kroměříž]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kromeriz.eu/en/page/view/20-The-chateau-and-the-famous-film-Amadeus.html The château and the famous film ''Amadeus''], kromeriz.eu&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Forman was able to shoot scenes in the [[Estates Theatre|Count Nostitz Theatre]] in Prague, where ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' debuted two centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zemefilmu.cz/en/film-locations/26-prague-the-estates-theatre/ Prague – The Estates Theatre], zemefilmu.cz&lt;/ref&gt; Several other scenes were shot at the [[Barrandov Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/a/Amadeus.html ''Amadeus'' film locations], movie-locations.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Forman collaborated with American choreographer [[Twyla Tharp]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/twyla-tharp-recalls-amadeus-gene-828754 "Twyla Tharp Recalls ''Amadeus'', Gene Kelly, Baryshnikov as She Marks 50th Anniversary"] by Jordan Riefe, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Giving the film four-out-of-four stars, [[Roger Ebert]] acknowledged that it was one of the "riskiest gambles a filmmaker has taken in a long time," but added "(here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach," and ultimately concluded that it was a "magnificent film, full and tender and funny and charming."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Amadeus Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1984) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amadeus-1984 |website=www.rogerebert.com |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en |date=September 8, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine said that "Hulce and Abraham share a dual triumph in a film that stands as a provocative and prodigious achievement."&lt;ref name="travers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=Screen |journal=People |date=October 1, 1984 |volume=22 |issue=14 |page=14 |url=https://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-amadeus-vol-22-no-14/ |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' put it on his list of films worth seeing.&lt;ref name="Kauffmann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kauffmann |first1=Stanley |title=FILMS WORTH SEEING |journal=New Republic |date=October 29, 1984 |volume=191 |issue=17 |pages=24–26 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asn&amp;AN=12032100&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one negative review, [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that despite "great material and themes to work with, and such top talent involved," the "stature and power the work possessed onstage have been noticeably diminished" in the film adaptation.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Todd |title=Amadeus |url=https://variety.com/1984/film/reviews/amadeus-1200426332/ |website=Variety |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=5 September 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
In 1985, the film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including the double nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] with Hulce and Abraham each being nominated for their portrayals of Mozart and Salieri, respectively. The film won eight Oscars, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Abraham), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Forman), [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Costume Design]] ([[Theodor Pištěk (costume designer)|Theodor Pištěk]]), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Adapted Screenplay]] (Shaffer), [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Art Direction]] (Karel Černý, Patrizia von Brandenstein), [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. The film was nominated for, but did not win Oscars for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]].

[[Saul Zaentz]] produced both ''Amadeus'' and ''The English Patient''.

The film was nominated for six [[Golden Globe Award]]s (Hulce and Abraham were nominated together) and won four, including awards to [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director – Motion Picture|Forman]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Abraham]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Shaffer]], and Golden Globe Award for Best Picture&amp;nbsp;– Drama. [[Jeffrey Jones]] was nominated for Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Drama. Forman also received the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for his work.

At the end of the Oscar ceremony, [[Laurence Olivier]] came on stage to present the Oscar for Best Picture. As Olivier thanked the Academy for inviting him, he was already opening the envelope. Instead of announcing the nominees, he simply read, "The winner for this is ''Amadeus''." An [[AMPAS]] official quickly went onstage to confirm the winner and signaled that all was well, before Olivier then presented the award to producer [[Saul Zaentz]]. Olivier (in his 78th year) had been ill for many years, and it was because of mild [[dementia]] that he forgot to read the nominees.&lt;ref&gt;''Olivier'', by Terry Coleman, 2005, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; Zaentz then thanked Olivier, saying it was an honour to receive the award from him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/ics-wpd/exec/icswppro.dll?AC=qbe_query&amp;TN=AAtrans&amp;RF=WebReportPermaLink&amp;MF=oscarsmsg.ini&amp;NP=255&amp;BU=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/index.htm&amp;QY=find+acceptorlink+%3d057-17 |title=Academy Awards Acceptance Speeches |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences |date=March 25, 1985 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070925/http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/ics-wpd/exec/icswppro.dll?AC=qbe_query&amp;TN=AAtrans&amp;RF=WebReportPermaLink&amp;MF=oscarsmsg.ini&amp;NP=255&amp;BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2Findex.htm&amp;QY=find+acceptorlink+%3D057-17 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; before mentioning the other nominees in his acceptance speech: ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'', ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[A Soldier's Story]]''.

==Alternative versions==
''Amadeus'' premiered in 1984 as a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-rated]] movie with a running time of 161 minutes. In 2002, director Miloš Forman introduced an R-rated version with nearly 20 minutes of restored footage. This version was released by the studios as a ''Director's Cut''. Forman justified why those scenes were cut in the first place in the 1995 supplemental material for Pioneer's deluxe LaserDisc. However, he explains why the scenes were eventually restored in a subsequent 2002 interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you finish a film, before the first paying audience sees it, you don't have any idea. You don't know if you made a success or a flop, when it comes to the box office. And in the '80s, with MTV on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don't forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, "Well, we don't want to be pushing the audience's patience too far". Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut out. But it was a mutual decision [to limit the running time]. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn't matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long. So why don't we do the version as it was written in the script?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/articles/milos-forman,13764 A.V. Club interview with Miloš Forman], April 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

All tracks on the album were performed specifically for the film. According to the film commentary by Forman and Schaffer, Marriner agreed to score the film if Mozart's music was completely unchanged from the original scores. Marriner did add some notes to Salieri's music that are noticeable in the beginning of the film, as Salieri begins his confession.

The aria "Ruhe sanft" from the opera ''[[Zaide]]'' does not appear in the film.

===''More Music from the Original Soundtrack''===
In 1985 an additional album with the title ''More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus'' was issued containing further selections of music that were not included on the original soundtrack release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Neville Marriner, Academy Of St. Martin-In-The-Fields – Amadeus (More Music From The Original Soundtrack Of The Film)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Sir-Neville-Marriner-Academy-Of-St-Martin-In-The-Fields-Amadeus-More-Music-From-The-Original-Soundtr/release/1625443|publisher=discogs|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Maurerische Trauermusik|Masonic Funeral Music]]'' was originally intended to play over the closing credits, but was replaced in the film by the second movement of the [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor]]&lt;ref&gt;''More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus,'' album liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; (included on the Original Soundtrack Recording).

===Director's Cut soundtrack===
In 2002, to coincide with the release of the Director's Cut of the film, the soundtrack was remastered with [[24-bit audio|24-bit]] encoding and reissued with the title ''Special Edition: The Director's Cut – Newly Remastered Original Soundtrack Recording'' on two 24-karat gold CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Neville Marriner, Academy Of St. Martin-in-the-Fields – Amadeus (Original Soundtrack Recording – Special Edition: The Director's Cut)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Sir-Neville-Marriner-Academy-Of-St-Martin-in-the-Fields-Amadeus-Original-Soundtrack-Recording-Specia/release/7508550|publisher=discogs|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains most of the music from the previous two releases, but with the following differences.

The following pieces were added for this release:
* Salieri's March of Welcome turned into "[[Non più andrai]]" from ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (includes dialogue from the film)
* [[Adagio and Rondo for glass harmonica, flute, oboe, viola and cello|Adagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617]] (from a new 2001 recording)
The following pieces, previously released on ''More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus'', were not included:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">'''Arca Totok Kerot''' or '''Recå Thothokkerot''' IPA: [rətʃɔ ʈɔʈɔʔ kərɔt] is a statue (Jav. ''arcå'' or ''recå'' means "statue") located in Bulusari Village, Pagu District, [[Kediri Regency]], Indonesia; about 2 kilometers north-east of Simpang Lima Gumul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diskominfo.kedirikab.go.id/web/situs-arca-totok-kerot.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915173330/http://diskominfo.kedirikab.go.id/web/situs-arca-totok-kerot.html |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of [[andesite]] stone, depicting a giant with a terrifying face. The style is of a [[dvarapala]]. Based on the style, it is suggested that it was made in the 10th century.

==Physical features==
The face and other ornaments also suggest that it is a representation of a female ''butå''.&lt;ref&gt;ogre, demon, or giant&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual since most dvarapala statues show male characteristics. Arca Totok Kerot is 3 meters tall.

The hair is matted, covering the upper part of the back. A kind of tiara with a glimpse of skull is seen above forehead, covering also the ears. The eyes are protruding, creating a terrifying effect, as if it were angry.

Like many other dvarapala statues, it kneels on one knee. The left knee touches the ground while the right knee is erected, on which the right hand is laid. The left hand is missing, so it is unknown if it originally held a ''gådå'' (mace) like other dvarapala statues. All hands and legs are wearing ''binggêl'' (bracelets).

The nipples are clearly shown on the breast, another indication that it is female. It wears a necklace of skulls, usually worn by worshippers of [[Durga]] or [[Shiva]]. A girdle is encircling its waist, on which some kind of skirt is hanging.

==Discovery and excavation==

The statue was discovered in 1981.

In 2013, due to an imminent plan by the local government to enlarge the road near Arca Totok Kerot, an excavation was hastily carried out searching for other archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;http://surabaya.tribunnews.com/2013/02/17/tak-ada-temuan-benda-purbakala-di-totok-kerot&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was conducted by East Java Hall of Cultural Heritage Preservation (''Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Jawa Timur''). The possibility was considered because [[dvarapala]] statues were usually placed to guard a temple complex or other important sites.

The excavation took place for six days. The team dug with average 1.5 meters into the surrounding ground, in some points even 4 meters. However, no other archaeological remains were found. Eventually the excavation was terminated and the cavities were filled. The road in front of the statue was then enlarged.

==Folklore related to the statue==

Tales were abound surrounding the statue. Some were already documented and many others were still transmitted orally. Some tales related the statue to the legendary character [[Calon Arang]], but such connection was refuted by Timoer (1981). Others were connected to the legendary king [[Jayabaya]] (Santosa, 2005).

'''''Bom-Crioulo: The Black Man and the Cabin Boy''''' ({{lang-pt|Bom-Crioulo}}) is a novel by the Brazilian writer [[Adolfo Caminha]], first published in [[1895 in literature|1895]]. An English translation by E.A. Lacey was published in 1982 by ''Gay Sunshine''.

The novel was the first major literary work on [[homosexuality]] to be published in Brazil, and one of the first to have a [[Black people|black person]] as its hero. The novel caused a stir upon its publication but was almost forgotten in the first half of the 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century, the novel has been republished several times in Brazil and translated into English, Spanish, German, French and Italian.

While many view the novel as a positive example of social progress in Brazil, it is widely regarded as propaganda with a central message declaring "não há lugar para a existência do negro e do homossexual que não o gueto ou a morte", which in English means "there is no place for the existence of the black man nor the homosexual if not the ghetto or in death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=(ufba)|first=Carlos Henrique Lucas Lima|date=2015-06-05|title=Homossociabilidade e antecipação: a estética dos corpos e prazeres de O bom-crioulo|url=http://periodicos.unincor.br/index.php/recorte/article/view/2181|journal=Revista Recorte|language=pt|volume=12|issue=1|issn=1807-8591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breil''' is an Italian luxury company of [[Binda Group]]. Its products include [[watches]], [[jewels]], [[eyewear]], [[fragrances]], and [[leather]] accessories.

==History ==

In 1942 the first Breil wristwatch was introduced; the name is from a Swiss place. Initially, the company made a line of alarm clocks and a few years later, wristwatches too. In 1956, the producer [[Innocente Binda]] made an unusual promotional action: he dropped some watches from his production from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris to show that after a flight of 302 meters, his watches proved to have been fully functional.

==Operations==
In commercials of the early 1990s, the company created a line of wristwatch models, typically used by  men, that were marketed to women; [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Shana (singer)]], [[Carré Otis]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Laura Chiatti]] were the chosen models for this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2001, Breil launched steel jewelry. In 2009, the company made the Bloom collection, the first range of jewels that can be worn together. In 2012, Breil launched the Infinity collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breil.com/it/en_US/about-breil official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221033650/http://www.breil.com/it/en_US/about-breil |date=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Cantrip''''' is a word of [[Scots language|Scots]] origin to mean a [[spell (paranormal)|magical spell]] of any kind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/cantrip Cantrip], ''Dictionary of the Scots Language'' (online edition).&lt;/ref&gt; or one which reads the same forwards and backwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://cours.littlenex.com/y/BookVocabulary/Prince%20Caspian.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be a witch's trick, or a sham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cantrip |title=cantrip - definition of cantrip by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possibly derived from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''[[canntaireachd]]'', a [[bagpipes|piper's]] mnemonic chant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/snds1635 Cantrip], ''Dictionary of the Scots Language'' (online edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], it is a type of minor [[Spells of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|spell]] that generally is the simplest and weakest kind available to learn. ("Most cantrips are simple little spells of no great effect, so... knowledge and information pertaining to these small magics are discarded in favor of the more powerful spells when available.")&lt;ref&gt;Gygax, Gary. ''Unearthed Arcana''. TSR, 1987, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences, in terms of game mechanics, between cantrips and more powerful spells have changed from edition to edition.

In the trading card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', a cantrip is player jargon to refer to a spell that, in addition to any other effect, makes you draw a card.&lt;ref&gt;[https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/magic%E2%80%99s-zero-level-spells-2006-08-04 Magic’s Zero-Level Spells], Forsythe, Aaron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">One of the most common ways for [[chess historian]]s to trace when the [[board game]] [[chess]] entered a country is to look at the literature of that country. Although due to the names associated with chess sometimes being used for more than one game (for instance [[Xiang-qi]] in [[China]] and [[Tables (board games)|Tables]] in England), the only certain reference to chess is often several hundred years later than uncertain earlier references. The following list contains the earliest references to chess or chess-like games.

==Byzantium==

a. 923 - [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|at-Tabari]]'s '''''Kitab akhbar ar-rusul wal-muluk'''''
(note the work is an Arabic work, no early Greek works are known)

==China==

79 BC - 8 BC - lifetime of Liu Xiang 劉 向, who wrote ''Shuo yuan'', a compilation of early Confucian anecdotes:  "''Do you still feel like playing xiangqi and dancing?''"  However, "[[xiangqi]]", apart from being the name of the [[chess variant]] played in China, has also been the name of two other unrelated games. (Sources: [http://www.yutopian.com/chinesechess/stories/meng.html ''Meng Changjun Played Xiangqi and Danced with Lady Zheng''], [http://www.yutopian.com/chinesechess/history.html ''The History of Xiangqi''] and [http://www.princeton.edu/~classbib/07books.htm '''Reference Guide to Classical Book Titles:''''' ''(3) Sinological Indexes:  Other Indices:  '''Shuo yuan.'''''])

c. 900 AD - '''''Huan Kwai Lu''''' (''Book of Marvels'')
Describes the rules of xiangqi.

==England==

c. 1180 - [[Alexander Neckam]]'s  '''''De Natura Rerum'''''
(note that it is thought that Neckam may have learnt of chess in Italy, not in England)

==France==

a. 1127 - A song of [[Guilhem IX]] Count of Poitiers and Duke of Aquitaine.

==Germany==

c. 1070 - '''''[[Ruodlieb]]''''' (IV 184-188) thought to be written by a monk near [[Tegernsee]].

==India==
c. 500 AD - Subandhu's '''''[[Vasavadatta]]'''''
:''The time of the rains played its game with frogs for chessmen which yellow and green in color, as if mottled by lac, leapt up on the black field squares.''

c. 625 - [[Banabhatta]]'s '''''[[Harsha Charitha]]'''''
:''Under this king only bees quarrel in collecting dews, the only feet cut off are those in meter, only chess boards teach the positions of the [[chaturanga]].''

c. 1030 - [[Al-Biruni]]'s '''''India''''' describes the game of [[chaturaji]].

1148 - Kalhana's '''''Rajatarangini''''' (translated by MA Stein, 1900)
:''The King, though he had taken two kings (Lothana and Vigraharaja) was helpless and perplexed about the attack on the remaining one, just as a player of chess (who has taken two Kings and is perplexed about taking a third).''
:(Note: This refers to the game of chaturaji.)

==Italy==
c. 1061 or 1062 - Letter from [[Pietro Damiani|Petrus Damiani]] (Cardinal Bishop of Ostia) to the Pope-elect [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] and the [[Pope Gregory VII|Archdeacon Hildebrand]]. This letter is dated by the reference to Alexander as "Pope-elect".

==Persia==

c. 600 - '''''Karnamak-i-Artakhshatr-i-Papakan'''''
:''Artakhshir did this, and by God's help he became doughtier and more skilled than them all in ball-play, in horsemanship, in chess, in hunting and in all other accomplishments.''
(It is fairly certain chess is meant due to the word [[shatranj]] being used).

==Russia==

13th century - '''Kormchaya Kniga''', a set of church laws.

==Spain==

c. 1009 - castrensian will of [[Ermengaud I]] (Count of Urgel)
:''I order you, my executors, to give . . . these my chessmen to the convent of St. Giles, for the work of the church.''

==Sumatra==

c. 1620 - '''''Sejarah Malayu'''''
: ''Now this Tan Bahra was a very skillful chessplayer, and one that was unequalled at the game in that age, and he played at chess with the men of Malacca.''

==Switzerland==

c. 997 - [[Versus de scachis]] in manuscript 319 at Stiftsbibliothek [[Einsiedeln abbey|Einsiedeln]].&lt;ref&gt;Helena M. Gamer: "The Earliest Evidence of Chess in Western Literature: The Einsiedeln Verses", ''Speculum'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (1954), pp. 734-750&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cippus Perusinus''' is a stone tablet discovered on the hill of San Marco, near [[Perugia]], Italy, in 1822. The tablet bears 46 lines of incised [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] text. The cippus is assumed to be a text dedicating a legal contract between the Etruscan families of Velthina (from Perugia) and Afuna (from [[Chiusi]]), regarding the sharing or use of a property upon which there was a tomb belonging to the noble Velthinas.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it/index.php?en/93/the-cippus-of-perugia|title=National Archaeological Museum of Perugia - The Cippus of Perugia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNews05.pdf|title=The first Chapter of the Cortona inscription|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613161433/http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNews05.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of the inscription is considered to be 3rd or 2nd century BC. The Cippus is conserved in the [[National Archeological Museum of Perugia]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12858">The geographically close [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] languages share considerable similarity in [[linguistic typology|typological]] features of their syntax and morphology while having a small number of lexical resemblances and different [[writing system|native scripts]] (although they both use the [[Chinese characters]], called [[hanja]] in Korea and [[kanji]] in Japan; see "Writing" section).

''The Altaic Problem and the Origins of the Japanese Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg et al. 1999:72, 74&lt;/ref&gt; though these studies either lack conclusive evidence or were subsets of theories that have suffered large discredit (like versions of the well-known [[Altaic hypothesis]] that mainly attempted to group the Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic languages together).&lt;ref&gt;"While 'Altaic' is repeated in encyclopedias and handbooks most specialists in these languages no longer believe that the three traditional supposed Altaic groups, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic, are related." Lyle Campbell &amp; Mauricio J. Mixco, A Glossary of Historical Linguistics (2007, University of Utah Press), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When cognates proved not to be valid, Altaic was abandoned, and the received view now is that Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic are unrelated." Johanna Nichols, Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time (1992, Chicago), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Careful examination indicates that the established families, Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic, form a linguistic area (called Altaic)...Sufficient criteria have not been given that would justify talking of a genetic relationship here." R.M.W. Dixon, The Rise and Fall of Languages (1997, Cambridge), pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...[T]his selection of features does not provide good evidence for common descent" and "we can observe convergence rather than divergence between Turkic and Mongolic languages--a pattern than is easily explainable by borrowing and diffusion rather than common descent", Asya Pereltsvaig, Languages of the World, An Introduction (2012, Cambridge) has a good discussion of the Altaic hypothesis (pp. 211-216).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of a sufficient reconstruction of [[Japonic languages|Proto-Japonic]] and [[History of Korean|Proto-Korean]], any relation between the languages that may have existed may never be conclusively proven (see: [[Classification of the Japonic languages|Japonic migration from Korea hypothesis]] and [[Gaya language]]).

==Grammar==
Japanese and Korean both have an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative morphology]] in which verbs may function as prefixes&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Comrie: "Introduction", p. 7 and 9 in Comrie (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) typology.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tomlin, Russell. Surveyed in the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MWbrvUiYzSkC&amp;pg=PA36 Introducing English Linguistics International Student Edition by Charles F. Meyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell Tomlin, "Basic Word Order: Functional Principles", Croom Helm, London, 1986, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; They are both [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]], [[null-subject language]]s. Both languages rely heavily on turning nouns into verbs utilizing "to do" (する and 하다).

Modern Korean and Japanese share a similar system of demonstrative pronouns: i~ (이), geu~ (그) and jeo~ (저) for Korean corresponding to the Japanese ko~ (こ), so~ (そ) and a~ (あ)(“this”, “that” and “that over there”). They both lack a compulsory distinction of plurality (for example "an apple" vs "apples" is usually not specifically distinguished).

Japanese and Korean also share the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] system. Korean and the Japonic languages are two of only four extant languages in the world with [[Topic marker|topic markers]]. This allows words of different parts of speech to be placed in exactly the same order if some sentences are translated from one language to another. Such direct word for word swapping cannot be so easily done with any other languages, showing that Japanese and Korean are grammatically quite similar.

There are some differences, however. Japanese utilizes passive grammar more frequently than Korean, and has four common verb conjugations to express "if" (〜ならば、〜ば、〜たら、〜と), while Korean has one (-면). Korean also has distinct future tenses (-ㄹ것이다,-겠다) while Japanese often relies on context rather than directly indicating the future nature of a sentence.

==Vocabulary==
The two languages have previously been thought to not share any [[cognate]]s (other than [[loanword]]s),&lt;ref name="Samuel Martin" /&gt; for their vocabularies do not phonetically resemble each other. However, a recent 2016 paper proposing a common lineage between Korean and Japanese traces around 500 core words thought to share a common origin. &lt;ref&gt;https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ETD_SUBID:113782&lt;/ref&gt;

Some previous linguists have listed a tiny amount of translations which may be perceived as phonetic parallels. This is exemplified in the following table:

In addition to the above, there may be a relation between the words for morning (朝, asa; 아침, achim). A historical variant in Korean may have been pronounced "asa" (see: [[Asadal]]).

Korean particles and polite grammatical ending conjugations also share a superficial similarity with Japanese. The sentence ending particle ね (ne) has the exact same some sound and function as the Korean counterpart 네 (ne). The Japanese particle が (ga) corresponds with the particle 가 (ga) in function and sound. The honorific ending for questions in Japanese is か (ka), similar to ~까 (gga) in Korean. The informal noun ending in Korean 야 (ya) is similar to the dialectal informal noun ending や (ya) in Japanese (corresponding to だ in standardized Japanese).

Functionally, some peculiar aspects of particles and particle usage are also the same in both languages. For example, the particles も (*mo*) and 도 (*do*) not only share an inclusive function (similar to "too" in English), they also both function to emphasize sheer lack in negative sentences, or sheer intensity in positive sentences. へ and 에 (e) have the same sound and share a similar function. Particles are also used in the same way to form basic vocabulary words. I.e., も (mo) and 도 (do) in the words for *noone* (아무도, 誰も), the similar sounding か (ka) and 가 (ga) particle adding an unknown/questioning element to a word to form the equivalent meaning to English *some*, (i.e. in 뭔가 and 何か, meaning *something*).

However, some percentage of vocabulary in any language may be expected to resemble vocabulary in any other language to a certain extent through random coincidence. The likelihood that a word in one language will be perceived as resembling a word in another language is inversely correlated with the number of phonemes in the word (''i.e.'' the shorter a word is, the more likely it will randomly resemble a short word in another language) and positively correlated with the degree of overlap in the languages' phonological systems (''i.e.'' the more similar the sound systems of the two languages, the more likely it is that any word from one language will be perceived as sounding similar to a word from the other language).

==Writing==
Both languages use, to some extent, a combination of native scripts and [[Chinese character]]s.

Korean is mostly written in the [[Hangul|Korean featural alphabet]] (known as Hangul in South Korea and Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea). The traditional [[hanja]] (Chinese characters adapted for Korean) are sometimes used in South Korea, but only for specific purposes like linguistic or historic study, artistic expression, legal documents, and newspapers.  Native Korean words do not use hanja anymore. In North Korea, the hanja have been largely surpressed in an attempt to remove Sinic influence, although they are still used in some cases and the number of hanja taught in North Korean schools is greater than that of South Korean schools.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas 1997: 68. "Although North Korea has removed Chinese characters from its written materials, it has, paradoxically, ended up with an educational program that teachers more characters than either South Korea or Japan, as Table 2 shows."&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese is written with a combination of [[kanji]] (Chinese characters adapted for Japanese) and [[kana]] (two writing systems representing the same sounds, composed primarily of syllables, each used for different purposes).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BDisMH0IpFcC&amp;pg=PA28 Advances in Psychology Research]. Google Books. Books.google.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FkBdWFwh-MEC&amp;pg=PR12 Learning Japanese in the Network Society]. Google Books. Books.google.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Korean Hanja, however, Kanji can be used to write both Sino-Japanese words and Native Japanese words. 

Historically, both Japanese and Korean were written solely with Chinese characters, with the writing experiencing a gradual mutation through centuries into its modern form.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Korean Linguistics By Jaehoon Yeon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other features==
===Honorifics===
Both languages have similar elaborate, multilevel systems of [[honorifics]]. They are cited as the two most elaborate honorific systems, perhaps unrivaled by any other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 41913346|title = Contrasts Between Korean and Japanese Honorifics|journal = Rivista Degli Studi Orientali|volume = 81|issue = 1/4|pages = 369–385|last1 = Brown|first1 = Lucien|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that certain honorific words share a common origin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237116691_Grammaticalization_in_Sentence-Final_Politeness_Marking_in_Korean_and_Japanese&lt;/ref&gt; Uniquely, the honorifics rely heavily on changing verb conjugations rather than only using [[t-v distinction]] or other common methods of signifying honorifics. See [[Japanese honorifics]] and [[Korean honorifics]].

'''''Eleftheria i thanatos''''' ({{lang-el|Ελευθερία ή θάνατος}}, pronounced {{IPA-el|elefθeˈria ˈi ˈθanatos|}}, "freedom or death") is the [[motto]] of [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The International Flag Book in Color|last=Pedersen|first=Christian Fogd |year=1971 |publisher=Morrow|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Complete Guide to Flags |last=Crampton|first=William|year=1991 |publisher=Gallery Books |location= |isbn=0-8317-1605-3|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The motto arose during the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, where it was a war cry for the [[Greece|Greeks]] who rebelled against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1436276/Greek-Independence-Day|title=Greek Independence Day.|publisher= www.britannica.com |accessdate=2009-09-09|last=|first=|quote= The Greek revolt was precipitated on March 25, 1821, when Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the flag of revolution over the Monastery of Agia Lavra in the Peloponnese. The cry “Freedom or Death” became the motto of the revolution. The Greeks experienced early successes on the battlefield, including the capture of Athens in June 1822, but infighting ensued.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted after the [[Greek War of Independence]]. It is still in use today, and is a popular theory regarding the use of 9 stripes (for the nine syllables of the motto) in the [[Greek flag]], the five blue stripes for the syllables "Έλευθερία" and the four white stripes "ή Θάνατος".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=War: A Cruel Necessity?: the Bases of Institutionalized Violence|last1=Hinde|first1=Robert A.|last2=Watson|first2=Helen|year=1995|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=1-85043-824-2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flag Lore of All Nations|first=Whitney|last=Smith|year=2001|publisher=Milbrook Press|isbn=0-7613-1753-8|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto symbolized and still symbolizes the resolve of the people of Greece against tyranny and oppression.

The [[Filiki Eteria]] at its emblem had the letters "ΗΕΑ" and "ΗΘΣ". These are the letters of the words "Ή ΕλευθερίΑ" "Ή ΘάνατοΣ", which means "Either Freedom, or Death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=PERIGRAFH_EMBLIMATOS_IVMP&amp;la=1 Greek Army website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/12/en/general/gallery/001.html FHW-Membership card of the Philiki Etaireia ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, this is the motto of the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]] of the [[Greek Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=PERIGRAFH_EMBLIMATOS_IVMP&amp;la=1 Greek Army website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMV GV 116 t.jpg|thumb|right|A '''G.V. Series''' (G.V.116) recording of the 1941 songs "El estagiario / Mi refugio" by Argentine [[Carlos Di Sarli]] y su [[Orquesta típica]]. Thousands of such records were sent to colonial Africa in the 1940s, sparking the creation of new musical styles across the continent.]]
The '''G.V. Series''' (perhaps for ''Grabación Victor'')&lt;ref&gt;White 2002 and Stewart 2004 offer several variations on G. V.'s real and perceived meanings, which include "Grabación Victor" ("Victor Recording" in Spanish), "Grabado en Venezuela" (recorded in Venezuela), "Gramophone Victor", and a popular Congolese nickname "Grands Vocalistes" (great singers). White (2002) also reports it may only be an [[EMI]] records code which lies between G.U. and G.W.&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of 10&amp;nbsp;inch [[78 rpm]] [[Gramophone record]]s produced in Europe and the United States from 1933 to 1958, and exported (or repressed on site) to colonial Tropical Africa. They are credited with introducing [[Afro-Cuban music]] into modern African popular culture. The resulting re-interpretations influenced the creation of several genres of African popular music.

==The Series==
Over 250 titles (double sided records) were produced in the G.V. Series. The records were launched by the British [[EMI]] company's [[His Master's Voice]] label in 1933, in part because of shrinking demand during the [[Great Depression]]. In the 1940s, HMV reached agreement with other companies, such as [[RCA Victor]] to share the royalties of their artists in the production of G.V. Series recordings. Thereafter local distributors were able to request, or press themselves, any of the back catalog of these companies for relatively low cost in Africa, making the records affordable to African listeners for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;White (2002) describes this process, citing Gronow, P. The Recording Industry: An Ethnomusicological Approach. Tampere, Finland: University of Tampere Press (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time in West Africa (what became [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]], specifically) EMI was recording and releasing [[Sakara music|Sakara]], [[Juju]] and [[Apala]] music on 78rpm discs in the ''[[Parlophone]] B'', ''HMV JL'', ''HMV JZ'' and ''[[Decca Records|Decca]] WA/GWA/NGA'' series (1947–52), as well as HMV owned local labels, such as Ghana's [[Taymani Special]].&lt;ref&gt;see Chapter Twenty (pp.149–156) of John Collins. Musicmakers of West Africa. Lynne Rienner Publishers (1985) {{ISBN|0-89410-075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there were also domestic record producers beginning to appear in Anglophone West Africa, Francophone Central African music was based on the twin poles of small domestic labels of the 1940s and 50s, and the Latin music supplied by the G.V. Series records and later competitors from [[Pathé Marconi]] and Decca.&lt;ref&gt;For the impact of the G.V. Series vs. these series of domestic music on Ghanaian and Nigerian music see: John Low. 'A History of Kenyan Guitar Music: 1945–1980', African Music, VI, 2,1982, pp.23–24&lt;br&gt;
Christopher Waterman. Juju: A Social History and Ethnography of an African Popular Music, Chicago, University of Chicago Press (1990), pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglophone West Africa also had twin advantages of having had access to domestic recording and the distribution across West Africa of these recordings by the HMV owned [[Zonophone]] label of African music from 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon. Savannaphone. FolkRoots No.122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuban music in Africa==
While the G.V. Series drew on a wide back catalogue of music, they are best known as the first exposure many Africans had to [[Afro-Cuban]] music (specifically [[Son Cubano|Son]] and [[Son montuno]]). Some musicians of the era still refer to these songs not by the Spanish language titles but by the G.V. numbers of their records.&lt;ref&gt;"The influence that they had may be measured in part by older musicians recalling Cuban tunes by the HMV catalogue number rather than the proper title." – Paul Vernon. [http://www.bolingo.org/audio/texts/fr145eastafrica.html Feast of East].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine initial G.V. records were released in 1933, drawn from EMI's back catalogue of '"''general ethnic''" or "''Spanish''" recordings, with G.V. 1 being "''[[The Peanut Vendor]]''" by [[Don Azpiazu &amp; his Havana Casino Orchestra]], recorded New York City, 13 May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;John Cowley. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/ubunca.htm uBungca (Oxford Bags): Recordings in London of African and West Indian music in the 1920s and 1930s]. Musical Traditions No 12, Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note were Cuban artists such as Son combo [[Sexteto Habanero]], [[Trio Matamoros]], [[Don Azpiazú]], [[Abelardo Valdés]], [[Antonio Machin]], as well as big band leader [[Xavier Cugat]], originally recorded in the United States for the American market.

These records spawned some of the most successful modern musical styles West Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa. The most notable of these styles is [[African Rumba|Congolese Rumba]] ("''Soukous''") which developed in [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], Belgian Congo (modern Kinshasa, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) in the 1940s and 50s. The guitar styles of [[Highlife music]] in British colonial West Africa were also highly influenced by these records, as were the stylings of the Dakar sound in Senegal.  African guitar playing in general, and the electric guitar in particular, was popularised in part by the music distributed in the G.V. Series records. The music of East Africa was also influenced by the G.V. series, sold through East African Music Stores in [[Nairobi]] as its agents in [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] and [[Dar-es-Salaam]]. But here too, the Cuban musics of the G.V. series quickly had to complete with domestic music produced by EMI and specialist labels like [[Odeon Swahili]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Vernon.

'''Girls Gone Wild ''' ('''GGW''') is an [[exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] entertainment franchise created by [[Joe Francis]] in 1997,&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/04/style/the-very-long-legs-of-girls-gone-wild.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Very Long Legs of 'Girls Gone Wild' |author=Mireya Navarro |date=4 April 2004 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who occasionally appears as the host of the videos.

The eponymous company "Girls Gone Wild" was known for its early use of [[direct-response marketing]] techniques, including its late-night [[infomercials]] that began airing in 1997.&lt;ref name="VT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117876991 |title= 'Wild' infomercial struts its stuff |author=Michael Schneider |date=8 December 2002 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos typically involve camera crews at [[party]] locations engaging young college-aged women who expose their bodies or act [[Female promiscuity|"wild"]], especially during [[Spring break]].&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt; Since 2008, the Girls Gone Wild products have been sold primarily through their website as streaming videos, downloads, and DVDs.

In February 2013, the company filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name=chap11&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Girls Gone Wild’ Files Bankruptcy to Fight Vegas Debt|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-28/-girls-gone-wild-files-bankruptcy-to-fight-vegas-debt.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The first Girls Gone Wild film was released in 1997.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/la-tm-gonewild32aug06,0,6367343.story |title= Joe Francis: 'Baby, give me a kiss' |author=Claire Hoffman |date=6 August 2006 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the company sold 4.5 million videos and DVDs.&lt;ref name = "VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/features/2004/dispatches_from_girls_gone_wild/girls_get_naked_for_tshirts_and_trucker_hats.html |title=Dispatches from Girls Gone Wild |author=Ariel Levy |date=22 March 2004 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2002, the company had produced 83 different titles and had begun airing 30-minute infomercials on [[E!]] Entertainment Television, [[Fox Sports]] Net, [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Tech TV]], [[Style (TV network)|Style]], and all other major U.S. networks.&lt;ref name = "VT"/&gt; The infomercials targeted a late-night channel-surfing demographic that Joe Francis had identified in the late 90s.&lt;ref name = "VT"/&gt; According to [[TNS Media Intelligence]], Girls Gone Wild spent more than $21 million in advertising in 2003, becoming the largest advertiser for programs on the [[E!]] channel. In 2008, Francis' net worth was approximately $150 million.&lt;ref name="VI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2012/sep/24/wynn-sets-precedent/ |title=Wynn sets the precedent|author=Bruce Spotleson|date=24 September 2012 |publisher= Vegas Inc|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances of Girls Gone Wild in popular culture include the appearance of [[Eminem]] and [[Snoop Lion|Snoop Dogg]] in the company's videos,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VT"/&gt; [[MGM]]’s announcement in 2002 that it would release a feature-length film based on the Girls Gone Wild concept,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/oct/03/news1 |title= MGM plans Girls Gone Wild Film |date=2 October 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various references and parodies of the show in popular television series and movies. In Season 4, Episode 8 of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" Wandering Bear, aired 29 Feb 2004, Larry and Jeff decide to buy a "Girls Gone Wild" video tape, and that lands them both in the hot seat with Larry's secretary and Jeff's wife after the dog leaves the house during the viewing of the tape.

===Content===
Most Girls Gone Wild videos follow a common formula in which a film crew interacts with a large crowd of people either at a [[party]], club, or other event.&lt;ref name = "SE"/&gt; Women willingly take off their clothes, engage in sexual activities, or participate in [[wet T-shirt contest]]s.&lt;ref name ="VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SE"/&gt; Compensation for taking part in a Girls Gone Wild video often consists of a free hat, T-shirt, or money.&lt;ref name ="SE"/&gt; Occasionally, participants are invited to be filmed on a Girls Gone Wild tour bus.&lt;ref name ="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GIRLS+GONE+WILD+IN+IRELAND%3B+US+sex+show+eyes+up+Irish+venues+for+tour.-a0258654156 |title=Girls Gone Wild in Ireland; US sex show eyes up Irish venues for tour |author=Keith Falkiner |date=12 June 2011 |publisher= Sunday Mirror (London)|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution channels===
At its inception, Girls Gone Wild marketed its product, namely videos, through direct-distribution channels such as [[infomercials]], [[pay-per-view]], and [[video on demand]].&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PRW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-176036373.html |title=Media: Analysis- Girls Gone Wild tries tamer approach |date=3 March 2008 |publisher= PR Week (US)|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2003/09/29/this-guy-s-gone-wild.html |title=This Guy's Gone Wild |date=28 September 2003 |publisher= Newsweek|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution was followed in 2008 by the launch of a Girls Gone Wild magazine, a clothing line, and a compilation record released on [[Jive Records]].&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SE"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "PRW"/&gt;

==Girls Gone Wild for Katrina==
In September 2005, Girls Gone Wild announced that it would donate all proceeds of [[Mardi Gras]]–themed DVDs and videos to the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/20/news/katrina_girls_gone_wild/|title='Girls Gone Wild' for Katrina |date=20 September 2005 |publisher= CNN Money|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from the video sales, which included a title featuring [[Snoop Dogg]], were intended to help the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name = "CNN"/&gt;

==Guys Gone Wild==
In 2004, Girls Gone Wild began soliciting men for participation in their videos.&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt; ''Guys Gone Wild'' was a video series and male analogue of ''Girls Gone Wild'' targeted at young women.&lt;ref name="CHRON"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/default/article/OK-girls-now-it-s-your-turn-for-a-Wild-video-1478576.php |title=Ok, girls, now it's your turn for a 'Wild' video |author=Daniel J. Vargas |date=12 July 2004 |publisher= The Houston Chronicle|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These [[video tape]]s and [[DVD]]s featured much the same content as the ''Girls'' equivalent, only instead showing young men performing for the  camera—e.g., in the shower, playing football naked, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swaim |first=Michael |title=Guys Gone Wild: A Comparative Study for the Well Versed Pornographist |url=http://www.collegehumor.com/article/1410034/guys-gone-wild-a-comparative-study-for-the-well-versed-pornographist |publisher=College Humor |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304110200/http://www.collegehumor.com/article/1410034/guys-gone-wild-a-comparative-study-for-the-well-versed-pornographist |archivedate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/07/03/2003177572|title=The world's gone mad for wild guys and girls|publisher=|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Horn, spokesman for [[Mantra Entertainment]] which produced the videos, notes a [[gender]]-related [[double standard]] in these videos. In the ''Girls Gone Wild'' series, sometimes the young women kiss, while the guys' series does not have that feature. Horn explains: "Let's face it, there's a double standard when it comes to guy-on-guy as opposed to [[girl-on-girl]]. It's sexy to see two girls [[making out]]. It's not considered sexy to see two guys making out. That's just the reality, and, we were there to capture the reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Guys Go Wild" in New Video Series|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,124478,00.html|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hour-long ''Guys Gone Wild'' productions featured women camera operators who encouraged men to get naked and perform strip teases.&lt;ref name="CHRON"/&gt;

==Legal==
In 2003, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a complaint against Girls Gone Wild alleging that the company failed to notify customers when they purchased subscriptions under a continuity program, rather than single DVDs.&lt;ref name="FTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/12/girlsgonewild.shtm |title=Sellers of ‘Girls Gone Wild’ Videos Charged with Deceptive Practices |date=17 December 2003 |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214015818/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/12/girlsgonewild.shtm |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, GGW settled for $1.1 million and agreed to disclose all terms and get consent for recurring charges.&lt;ref name="FTC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/girlsgonewild.shtm |title=Sellers of ‘Girls Gone Wild’ Videos to Pay $1.1 Million to Settle Charges of Unauthorized Shipping and Billing |date=30 July 2004 |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728095620/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/girlsgonewild.shtm |archivedate=28 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Girls Gone Wild marketer [[Marketing Research Association|MRA Holdings]] pleaded guilty to charges for failing to record filmed subject's ages in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="FINDLAW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/pornlaw/dfrprosmra91206.html |title=Deferred Prosecution Agreement, Stipulation of Fact, Public Statement of Joseph Francis, and Films Subject to the Agreement |date=12 September 2006 |publisher= FindLaw|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties agreed to pay $2.1 million in restitution and fines.&lt;ref name = "FINDLAW"/&gt;

In 2008, [[Ashley Dupré]] filed against Joe Francis and other defendants claiming that they filmed her without consent.&lt;ref name="TMZ"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tmz.com/2008/03/19/ashley-dupre-gone-wild-legal-or-jailbait/ |title=Ashley Dupre Gone "Wild" -- Legal or Jailbait? |date=19 March 2008 |publisher= TMZ|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FINDLAW2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/spitzer/dupreggw42808cmp.html |title=Ashley Alexandra Dupre, the Former Prostitute Who Had a Paid Liaison With Ex-N.Y.

Dupré dropped the suit after Francis released footage of her consent.&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call girl in Spitzer case drops "Gone Wild" suit|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/07/03/people-dupre-lawsuit-dc-idUKN0327672620080703|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Missouri woman claimed that she was filmed without consent when a Girls Gone Wild contractor removed her [[halter top]] at a St. Louis bar.&lt;ref name="FINDLAW3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/apnews/9ba575eb243348c684dbb49c89d58b69 |title=Mo. woman wins $5.8M in 'Girls Gone Wild' case |author =Jim Salter | date=27 April 2012 |publisher= FindLaw|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury found that she consented. On re-trial, a judge awarded the woman $5.77 million after the defense failed to show at court.&lt;ref name="STL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/girls-gone-wild-ordered-to-pay-million-to-woman-filmed/article_0bbb7adf-757b-53cb-90ce-124a459dd28d.html |title='Girls Gone Wild' ordered to pay $5.77 million to woman filmed in St. Louis |author =Robert Patrick | date=26 April 2012 |publisher= The St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the judge upheld the verdict.&lt;ref name="MOLAW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://molawyersmedia.com/blog/2012/06/20/5-77m-judgment-stands-in-girls-gone-wild-case/ |title=$5.77M judgment stands in Girls Gone Wild case |author =Donna Walter | date=20 June 2012 |publisher= Missouri Lawyers Media|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, four women claimed that they suffered emotional distress by being shown in Girls Gone Wild film.&lt;ref name="MIAMI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/04/07/all-female-jury-throws-out-girls-gone-wild-lawsuit/ |title=All-Female Jury Throws Out "Girls Gone Wild" Lawsuit | date=7 April 2011 |publisher= CBS Miami|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, an all-female jury declined to award damages to the plaintiffs.&lt;ref name = "MIAMI"/&gt;

[[File:Grant of Arms for Henry Draper of Colnbrook 1571.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Grant by [[Clarenceux King of Arms]] [[Robert Cooke (officer of arms)|Robert Cooke]] to Henry Draper of Colnbrook giving him the right to use the arms illustrated; dated 14th October 1571.  Source:  The National Archives UK]]
A '''grant of arms''' or a governmental issuance of arms, are actions by a lawful authority such as an [[officer of arms]] or State Herald, conferring on a person and his or her descendants the right to bear a particular [[coat of arms]] or armorial bearings. It is one of the ways in which a person may lawfully bear arms in a jurisdiction regulating [[heraldry]], another being by birth, through [[inheritance]]. 

Historically a grant of arms is distinguished from both a confirmation of arms and a private registration of arms. A grant of arms confers a new right, whereas a confirmation of arms confirms an existing right; and a private registration of arms is a record which does not purport to create or confirm any legal right. However a governmental registration of arms by an official government agency, (e.g., Bureau of Heraldry in South Africa) does create and confirm new legal rights. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The College of Arms issues “letters patent” the Bureau of Heraldry issues “certificates of registration”. For all intents and purposes it’s the same thing. The College of Arms “grants” in the name of the monarch and in South Africa under the Heraldry Act (1962) the certificate is “issued”. In both cases the heraldic representation so issued and recorded affords the applicant sole ownership of the unique design. 
&lt;poem&gt;
Marcel van Rossum, OMBB
Deputy Director
Bureau Of Heraldry
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A grant of arms or government registration of arms are typically contained in [[letters patent]] which provide self-contained proof, upon production of the letters patent, of the right conferred.  A modern English grant of arms, for example, from officers of the [[College of Arms]] in London, will begin with the words "''To all and singular to whom these presents shall come...''", thereby showing that it is addressed to anyone in the world to whom it may be presented.

'''Helena Rubinstein''' (born '''Chaja Rubinstein'''; December 25, 1870&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhead|first1=Lindy|title=War Paint|date=2004|publisher=Wiley|location=UK|isbn=0471487783|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; – April 1, 1965) was a [[Polish-American]] businesswoman, art collector, and philanthropist. A [[cosmetics]] entrepreneur, and was the founder and [[eponym]] of '''Helena Rubinstein Incorporated''' cosmetics company, which made her one of the world's richest women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898634-1,00.html |title=The Beauty Merchant |date=1965-04-09 |work=Time |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[Image:Tenement, 15 Szeroka street, Kazimierz, Krakow, Poland.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Helena Rubinstein's birth house (green) in [[Kraków]]'s [[Kazimierz]] district]]
Rubinstein was the eldest of eight daughters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/fashion-beauty/384696/Helena-Rubinstein-the-penniless-refugee-who-built-a-cosmetics-empire ''Daily Express'': "Helena Rubinstein, the penniless refugee who built a cosmetics empire" By Cheryl Stonehouse] March 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; born to  [[Polish Jews]], Augusta – Gitte (Gitel) Shaindel Rubinstein née Silberfeld and Horace – Naftoli Hertz Rubinstein; who was a shopkeeper in the city of [[Kraków]] in [[Lesser Poland]], which became part of [[Austria-Hungary]] following the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century. The existentialist philosopher [[Martin Buber]] was her cousin. She was also the cousin of [[Ruth Rappaport]]'s mother.&lt;ref name="ushmm1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn42274|title=Oral history interview with Ruth Rappaport – USHMM Collections Search|publisher=collections.ushmm.org|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Australia==
Diminutive at 4&amp;nbsp;ft. 10&amp;nbsp;in. (147&amp;nbsp;cm), Rubinstein emigrated from Poland to Australia in 1902, with no money and little English.  Her stylish clothes and milky complexion did not pass unnoticed among the town's ladies, however, and she soon found enthusiastic buyers for the jars of beauty cream in her luggage. She spotted a market where she began to make her own. A key ingredient of the cream, [[lanolin]], was readily at hand.

[[Coleraine, Victoria|Coleraine]], in the Western Victoria region, where her uncle was a shopkeeper, might have been an "awful place" but was home to some 75 million [[sheep]] that secreted abundant quantities of wool grease or wool wax, chemically known as [[lanolin]]. These sheep were the wealth of the nation and the Western District's vast mobs of merinos produced the finest wool in the land. To disguise the lanolin's pungent odour, Rubinstein experimented with [[lavender]], [[pine]] bark and [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].

Rubinstein had a falling out with her uncle, but after a stint as a bush governess began waitressing at the Winter Garden tearooms in [[Melbourne]]. There, she found an admirer willing to stump up the funds to launch her Crème Valaze, supposedly including herbs imported "from the [[Carpathian Mountains]]". Costing ten pence and selling for six shillings, it walked off the shelves as fast as she could pack it in pots. Known to her customers only as Helena, Rubinstein could soon afford to open a salon in fashionable [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], selling glamour as a science to clients whose skin was "diagnosed" and a suitable treatment "prescribed".

Sydney was next, and within five years Australian operations were profitable enough to finance a Salon de Beauté Valaze in [[London]]. As such, Rubinstein formed one of the world's first cosmetic companies. Her business enterprise proved immensely successful and later in life, she used her enormous wealth to support charitable institutions in the fields of education, art and health.

Rubinstein rapidly expanded her operation. In 1908, her sister Ceska assumed the Melbourne shop's operation, when, with $100,000, Rubinstein moved to London and began what was to become an international enterprise. (Women at this time could not obtain bank loans, so the money was her own.)

==Marriage and children==

In 1908, she married the Polish-born American journalist Edward William Titus in London. They had two sons, Roy Valentine Titus (London, December 12, 1909–New York, June 18, 1989) and Horace Titus (London, April 23, 1912–New York, May 18, 1958). They eventually moved to Paris where she opened a salon in 1912. Her husband helped with writing the [[publicity]] and set up a small publishing house, published ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and hired [[Samuel Putnam]] to translate famous model [[Alice Prin|Kiki]]'s memoirs.

Rubinstein threw lavish dinner parties and became known for apocryphal quips, such as when an intoxicated French ambassador expressed vitriol toward [[Edith Sitwell]] and her brother [[Sacheverell Sitwell|Sacheverell]]: "Vos ancêtres ont brûlé Jeanne d'Arc!" Rubinstein, who knew little French, asked a guest what the ambassador had said. "He said, 'Your ancestors burned [[Joan of Arc]].'" Rubinstein replied, "Well, someone had to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Higgins|first=Patrick |title=''Madame: An Intimate Biography of Helena Rubinstein''|publisher=Viking Press|year=1971|pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At another ''fête'', [[Marcel Proust]] asked her what makeup a duchess might wear. She summarily dismissed him because "he smelt of mothballs." Rubinstein recollected later, "How was I to know he was going to be famous?"&lt;ref name=city-journal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/14_3_urbanities-czarinas.html|title=''The Czarinas of Beauty''|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan |publisher=city-journal.org|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to the United States==
[[File:Helena Rubinstein by Paul César Helleu (1859-1927) cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Helena Rubinstein by [[Paul César Helleu]] (1908)]]
[[File:Helena Rubinstein Tel Aviv Museum 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Helena Rubinstein 1959 [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], she and Titus moved to [[New York City]], where she opened a cosmetics salon in 1915, the forerunner of a chain throughout the country. This was the beginning of her vicious rivalry with the other great lady of the cosmetics industry, [[Elizabeth Arden]]. Both Rubinstein and Arden, who died within 18 months of each other, were social climbers. And they were both keenly aware of effective marketing and luxurious packaging, the attraction of beauticians in neat uniforms, the value of celebrity endorsements, the perceived [[Value-based pricing|value of overpricing]] and the promotion of the [[pseudoscience]] of skincare.

From 1917, Rubinstein took on the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of her products. The "Day of Beauty" in the various salons became a great success. The purported portrait of Rubinstein in her advertising was of a middle-age mannequin with a [[Gentile]] appearance.

In 1928, she sold the American business to [[Lehman Brothers]] for $7.3 million, ($88 million in 2007). After the arrival of the [[Great Depression]], she bought back the nearly worthless stock for less than $1 million and eventually turned the shares into values of multimillion dollars, establishing salons and outlets in almost a dozen U.S. cities. Her subsequent spa at 715 Fifth Avenue included a restaurant, a gymnasium and rugs by painter [[Joan Miró]]. She commissioned artist [[Salvador Dalí]] to design a powder compact as well a portrait of herself.

===Divorce and remarriage===

Freed of her former marriage vows, in 1938 Helena readily married Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia (1895–1955), whose somewhat clouded matrilinear claim to [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nobility, as that of Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia (sometimes spelled Courielli-Tchkonia; born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], February 18, 1895, died in [[New York City]] November 21, 1955), stemmed from his having been born a member of the untitled noble Tchkonia family of [[Guria]], enticing the ambitious young man to appropriate the genuine title of his grandmother, born Princess Gourielli.

Self-styled Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia was 23 years younger than Rubinstein. Eager for a regal title to call her own, Rubinstein pursued the handsome youth avidly, coming to name a male cosmetics line after her youthful prized catch. Some have claimed that the marriage was a marketing ploy, including Rubinstein's being able to pass herself off as Helena Princess Gourielli.&lt;ref&gt;''Mrs. Astor and the Gilded Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

A multimillionaire of contrasts, Rubinstein took a bag lunch to work and was very frugal in many matters, but bought top-fashion clothing and valuable fine art and furniture. Concerning art, she founded the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion of Contemporary Art in [[Tel Aviv]] and in 1957 she established the Helena Rubinstein travelling art scholarship in Australia.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110484b.htm|title=Rubinstein, Helena (1870–1965)|last=Poynter|first=J. R.|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, she established the philanthropic Helena Rubinstein Foundation to provide funds to organizations specializing in health, medical research and rehabilitation as well as to the [[America Israel Cultural Foundation]] and scholarships to Israelis.

In 1959, Rubinstein represented the U.S. cosmetics industry at the American National Exhibition in [[Moscow]].

Beginning in 1958 a £300 annual Rubinstein Prize was awarded for portraits by Australian artists. Prizewinners included [[Frank Hodgkinson]] 1958; [[Charles Blackman]] 1960; [[William Boissevain]] 1961; [[Margaret Olley]] 1962; [[Vladas Meskenas]] 1963; [[Judy Cassab]] 1964, 1965; [[Jack Carington Smith]] 1966.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch, Alan ''Encyclopedia of Australian Art'' Hutchinson of London 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Called "[[Madame]]" by her employees, she eschewed idle chatter, continued to be active in the corporation throughout her life, even from her sick bed, and staffed the company with her relatives.

==Death and legacy==
Rubinstein died April 1, 1965 from natural causes and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in [[Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=OUsYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=helena+rubinstein+mount+olivet&amp;dq=helena+rubinstein+mount+olivet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4jfr4mbzeAhUEIjQIHTswAwcQ6AEIKjAA ''Project Remember'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her estate, including African and fine art, [[Lucite]] furniture, and overwrought Victorian furniture upholstered in purple, was auctioned in 1966 at the Park-Bernet Galleries in New York City.

One of Rubinstein's numerous sayings was: "There are no ugly women, only lazy ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EED8133BF936A25751C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Rivals|last=Green |first=Penelope |date=2004-02-15 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarly study of her exclusive beauty salons and how they blurred and influenced the conceptual boundaries at the time among fashion, art galleries, the domestic interior and versions of modernism is explored by Marie J. Clifford (''Winterthur Portfolio'', vol. 38). A feature-length [[documentary film]], ''The Powder and the Glory'' (2009) by Ann Carol Grossman and Arnie Reisman, details the rivalry between Rubinstein and [[Elizabeth Arden]].

Her methodology has been described thus:

: She was "the first self-made female millionaire, an accomplishment she owed primarily to publicity savvy. She knew how to advertise—using 'fear copy with a bit of blah-blah'— and introduced the concept of 'problem' skin types. She also pioneered the use of pseudo-science in marketing, donning a lab coat in many advertisements, despite the fact that her only training had been a two-month tour of European skin-care facilities. She knew how to manipulate consumers' status anxiety, as well: If a product faltered initially, she would hike the price to raise the perceived value."&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;Ruth Graham, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704754304576096532209518142?mod=googlenews_wsj "More Than Skin Deep]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' February 5, 2011. From a review of the book ''Ugly Beauty: Helena Rubinstein, L'Oréal, and the Blemished History of Looking Good'' by [[Ruth Brandon]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the company Helena Rubinstein, Inc. was sold to [[Colgate Palmolive]], and is now owned by [[L'Oréal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/06/archives/colgate-acquires-cosmetics-maker-helena-rubinstein-holders-back.html Colgate Acquires Cosmetics Maker Helena Rubinstein, ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/business/l-oreal-buys-rubinstein-in-shrouded-deal.html L'Oreal buys Rubinstein in shrouded deal, ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

She was mentioned by the [[Austropop]]/comedy band [[Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung]] in [[1. Allgemeine Verunsicherung|their debut album]] in 1978, in the song "Pustel Gunkel".

The [[Helena Rubinstein portrait prize]], also known as "Boans – Helena Rubinstein portrait prize", was an annual prize of £300 for portraiture by an Australian artist, awarded by the Helena Rubinstein Foundation (disbanded 2011), and mostly staged at the Claude Hotchin Gallery in Western Australia.

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] are also known as the Helena Rubinstein Women in Science Awards.

The Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which had been established in 1953, operated through 2011, ultimately distributing nearly $130 million over the course of six decades, primarily to education, arts and community-based organizations in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/helena-rubinstein-foundation-to-close-at-year-s-end|title=Helena Rubinstein Foundation to Close at Year's End|first=Foundation|last=Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was a longtime supporter of children's programming for New York City's [[PBS]] affiliate [[WNET]].

The Manhattan [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]]’s exhibition “Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power,” the first museum show devoted to Rubinstein, was held from October 31, 2014 until March 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/arts/design/celebrating-helena-rubinstein-at-the-jewish-museum.html|title=Celebrating Helena Rubinstein at the Jewish Museum|first=Karen|last=Rosenberg|date=October 30, 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/helena-rubinstein-beauty-is-power|title=Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The musical ''[[War Paint (musical)|War Paint]]'' dramatizes her rivalry with competitor [[Elizabeth Arden]]. After a wildly successful out of town tryout at Chicago's [[Goodman Theater]], the show opened on Broadway at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] on April 6, 2017,  earning four Tony Award nominations, including Best Actress in a Leading Role for [[Patti LuPone]]'s portrayal of Rubinstein as well as for [[Christine Ebersole]] in the same category for her role as rival, Arden.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.broadway.com/buzz/awards/tony-awards/nominees/812/patti-lupone/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.broadway.com/buzz/awards/tony-awards/nominees/811/christine-ebersole/&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedy ''Lip Service'' by the Australian dramatist [[John Misto]] chronicles the life and career of Rubinstein and her rivalry with [[Elizabeth Arden]] and [[Revlon]]. ''Lip Service'' premiered on 26 April 2017 at the [[Park Theatre (London)|Park Theatre]], London, under the title ''Madame Rubinstein'', before opening at Sydney's [[Ensemble Theatre]] in August of the same year.

The '''Imperial Seal of the Mongols''' is a [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] ([[tamgha]]-тамга) that was used by the [[Mongols]]. The imperial seals had inscriptions in [[Mongolian script]] or other scripts that used in various Mongol regimes such as the [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]]. 
[[File:Guyuk khan's Stamp 1246.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Seal (East Asia)|Seal]] of [[Güyük Khan]] using the classical [[Mongolian script]], as found in a letter sent to the Roman Pope Innocent IV. It reads: ''{{lang|mn-Latn|Möngke ṭngri-yin küčündür. Yeke Mongγol ulus-un dalai-in qanu ǰrlγ. Il bulγa irgen-dür kürbesü, büsiretügüi azatuγai}}''.]]
According to [[Plano Carpini]], the [[Russians|Russian]] [[handicrafts]]man, Kozma, made a seal for [[Güyük Khan]]. This seal might have been a seal used to stamp the letter to [[Pope Innocent IV]].

[[File:OljeituLetterToPhilippeLeBel1305.jpg|250px|thumb|Translation of Oljeitu's message by [[Buscarello de Ghizolfi]], on the back of the letter (visible here).]]

The [[Poles|Polish]] scholar, Cyrill Koralevsky, shot a photo of the seal in 1920. The prominent [[French people|French]] Mongolist, [[Paul Pelliot|P. Pelliot]], translated the Mongolian scripts on the seal later. However, the Mongolists believe that Kozma made only one of the imperial seals and a seal on the letter is [[Genghis Khan]]'s, which was inherited by his successors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.mn/printpdf/285 Их Монгол төрийн Хас эрдэнийн тамга]&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Yuan dynasty]], which ruled the whole of [[China]], there were several seals. [[Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara|Ayushridar]] had an imperial seal with the script "[[Northern Yuan|Great Yuan]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In the 16th century, the Mongols used a square-shaped seal. [[Ejei Khan]] gave one of those seals to the Manchus in 1635, who in turn established the [[Qing dynasty]].

[[File:Imperial Seal of Bogd Khan.jpg|250px|thumb|Imperial seal of [[Bogd Khan]] in 1911. From left to right: in [[Soyombo alphabet|Soyombo]], [[Mongolian script|Classical Mongolian]] and [[Phags-pa script|Phags-pa]]]]

[[Bogd Jivzundamba]], ruler of the [[Mongolia (1911–24)|Bogd Khaganate]] had a tamgha (seal) with the inscription "Holiness - Bogd Khaan who holds religion and authority" in the 20th century.

'''India Pride Project''' ('''IPP''') is a group of art enthusiasts who uses social media to identify stolen religious artefacts from Indian temples and secure their return. Co-founded in 2014 by two Singapore-based art enthusiasts, S. Vijay Kumar and Anuraag Saxena, it now has activists from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anuraag Saxena: Returning stolen art to India|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq6b07Ln0Pc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook sleuths bring home India's stolen idols|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/life-culture/facebook-sleuths-bring-home-indias-stolen-idols|website=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-05|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=S Vijay|last=Kumar|title=India Pride Project - How Smuggled Indian Art Is Brought Back Home|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/how-smuggled-indian-art-brought-home|website=swarajyamag.com|accessdate=2017-01-05|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nirmala|last=Ganapathy|title=Recovering India's stolen art pieces|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/recovering-indias-stolen-art-pieces|website=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=11 November 2018|date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recoveries==

'''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]''': In 2014, it helped to secure the return of a US$5 million bronze statue of the Hindu god Shiva from the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Named ''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]'', the statue was stolen from a Tamil Nadu temple and trafficked by [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]], a former Manhattan art dealer who was later under the United States federal investigation known as Operation Hidden Idol. When the gallery denied the statue was stolen, IPP used the social media to publicize and compare the images of the stolen idol with the one on gallery's display. Since the arrest of Kapoor in 2012, United States has returned to India many artefacts recovered under Operation Hidden Idol.

Ms Donna Yates, a lecturer on antiquities trafficking at the [[University of Glasgow]], believes "the grassroots work of the IPP in documenting cases of theft and bringing them to public attention is crucial - and unmatched anywhere in the world."

'''[[Nalanda]]'s 12th century Buddha''': This  six-and-a-half-inch bronze (with traces of silver inlay) of the Buddha seated in the bhumisparsha mudra,  was stolen along with  13 other  statues  1961 from the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) site museum in Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Politics/CQMHtZkX51woQKhGLHlmEO/On-Independence-Day-India-gets-back-its-12th-century-stolen.html On Independence Day, India gets back its 12th century stolen Buddha statue, Aditi Khanna, PTI, LiveMint, Aug 15 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was noticed at a at a London auction. Fortunately a photographic record of the statue was saved by Sachindra S. Biswas, a retired director general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

'''''Inspector Gadget''''' is a [[media franchise]] that began in 1983 with the [[DIC Entertainment]] animated television series ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]''. Since the original series, there have been many spin-offs based on the show, including additional animated series, video games and films.

The franchise follows the adventures of a powerful but dimwitted [[cyborg]] police inspector named Gadget as he investigates the criminal schemes of [[Dr. Claw]] and his organization, MAD, as they fruitlessly attempt to stop him. However, neither side is aware that it is Gadget's niece, Penny, and her dog, Brain, who are truly responsible for thwarting MAD.

==Main characters==
===Inspector Gadget===
The main protagonist and titular character of the franchise. Gadget is a cyborg (part man, part machine) with thousands of high-tech gadgets installed in his body. Gadget is very powerful and loyal to his career as a lawman, but he is also very dim-witted, clueless, incompetent, oblivious, and gullible, but also lovable, caring, and protective. His attire and personality resembles that of [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' movies. While Penny and Brain secretly do all the real detective work, Gadget has a knack of inadvertently saving the day, usually without realizing he is doing so. Gadget loves his family more than anything and would do anything to keep them from harm, especially Penny. He was voiced by [[Don Adams]] in the original series and ''Inspector Gadget's Field Trip'' until Adams' retirement from voicing Gadget in 1999, [[Gary Owens]] and later [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] in the original series' pilot episode, and [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the ''Super Mario Bros. Super Show'', ''Gadget and the Gadgetinis'', the direct-to-video animated films, and various [[DIC Kids Network]] bumpers. For the 2015 series, the voice of Gadget is provided by [[Ivan Sherry]]. In Disney's live-action films, Gadget's real name is John Brown. He is portrayed by [[Matthew Broderick]] in the first film and [[French Stewart]] in the sequel.

===Dr. Claw===
Dr. Claw is the main antagonist of the franchise. He is the leader of an evil crime syndicate called MAD. Only his arms are shown, wearing silver gauntlets with golden spiked wrist bands. A parody of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] from the James Bond franchise, his face is never seen at all (except in the live action film) with only his hands and pet cat visible. On a Dr. Claw action figure, the face was covered by a sticker on the box, which meant the toy had to be bought for his face to be seen. He is ruthless, murderous, sinister, dark, sadistic, and greedy, and will do anything to rule the world and destroy Gadget. In ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'', he reveals that he thinks Gadget's idiocy is an act to taunt him. In the 2015 series, he is noticeably less competent and malicious and the crimes he commits are a lot more petty. He has been voiced by [[Frank Welker]], [[Brian Drummond]], and Martin Roach. In the first live action film, where he is portrayed by [[Rupert Everett]], his name is revealed to be Sanford Scolex. [[Tony Martin (Australian actor)|Tony Martin]] subsequently took over the role of Dr. Claw in the sequel.

===Penny===
Penny is Gadget's intelligent niece and the one who really stops Claw's evil schemes. She uses many high tech devices to help her secretly solve the cases and stop the bad guys such as; a computer book, a video watch, a laptop, and a holographic tablet. However, her meddling often leads to her getting captured by the bad guys, which leaves Brain to rescue her. She is 10 in the original series, 12 in ''Gadget and the Gadgetinis'', 16 in ''Biggest Caper Ever'', and 14 and 15 in the 2015 series. Penny loves her uncle more than anything, which is why she is always ready to help him behind his back, but on a few occasions she gets annoyed by his stupidity. In ''Biggest Caper Ever'', she is notably more selfish and unlike any other incarnation, she doesn't try to help her uncle at all. In the 2015 series, she has become an agent in training and is more physically active than in previous incarnations and she has a crush on Claw's nephew, Talon.
For the original series, her voice was portrayed by [[Mona Marshall]] in the pilot episode, [[Cree Summer]] in the first season, and Holly Berger in the second season. Erica Horn provided her voice in ''[[Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas]]''. From 2001 to 2005, she was voiced by [[Tegan Moss]]. [[Tara Strong]] voices her in the 2015 series. For the live action film, she was portrayed by [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], and [[Caitlin Wachs]] in the sequel.

===Brain===
Brain is Penny's pet dog and adopted brother. He is the only one who knows that Penny is the one who really saves the world. Brain usually has the job of keeping Gadget safe on his missions while Penny investigates M.A.D's crimes. He usually disguises himself when following Gadget, which often causes Gadget to think he's a M.A.D Agent. He is absent in ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'' and only shows up in pictures. The reason given for why he is absent is because after all the years of secretly helping Gadget, he has become phobic of gadgets, the Inspector, and the word itself. He ran away to a riverside shack to get away from Gadget. He returned in the episode, ''No Brainer'', where Penny made him a translation collar in order to help find Gadget. However, he does return in later spinoffs.
His voice was played in the original series by [[Frank Welker]], [[Maurice LaMarche]] in ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'', and [[Scott McCord]] in the 2015 series. [[Lee Tockar]] voiced him in ''Biggest Caper Ever''. In the live action films, he was first voiced by [[Don Adams]], Inspector Gadget's original voice actor, and then by [[Jeff Bennett]] in the sequel.

===Chief Quimby===
Chief Quimby is Gadget's boss and the chief of police. He usually pops up near the beginning of each episode to give Gadget a sheet of paper describing his mission. Once Gadget finishes reading them, the paper self-destructs and blows up in Quimby's face in a parody of [[Mission: Impossible]]. He appears at the end to congratulate Gadget and give him full credit for stopping Claw. He never knows that Penny did all the work, even though she always calls him. In ''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'', he has become an agent for the CIA. In the 2015 series, he is given glasses, and his hair is blonde instead of brown.
His voice in the original series was provided by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] in the pilot, [[Dan Hennessey]] in the first season, and [[Maurice LaMarche]] for the remainder of the series. [[Jim Byrnes (actor)|Jim Byrnes]] voiced him in ''Inspector Gadget's Last Case''. He is voiced by [[Derek McGrath]] in the 2015 series. In the live action films, he was first portrayed by [[Dabney Coleman]], and [[Mark Mitchell (actor)|Mark Mitchell]] in the sequel.

===''Inspector Gadget (1983)''===
{{main|Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)}}
The original [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] in the franchise, ''Inspector Gadget'', debuted in 1983 and introduced audiences to the adventures of a clumsy, simple-witted [[Bionics|bionic]] [[detective]] named Inspector Gadget – a human being with various bionic gadgets built into his body. Gadget's nemesis is [[Doctor Claw]], the leader of an evil organization, known as "M.A.D."&lt;ref name=CookieJar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhxmedia.com/shows/animation/inspectorgadget.html|title=Inspector Gadget|work=[[DHX Media]]|accessdate=2013-06-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502050958/http://www.dhxmedia.com/shows/animation/inspectorgadget.html|archivedate=2013-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inspector Gadget'' was the first cartoon show from DiC Entertainment to be produced directly for syndication. Its two seasons originally ran from 1983 to 1986 and remained in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] into the late 1990s. It continues to air successfully in reruns around the world.

===''Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas''===
{{main|Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas}}
In 1992, DiC produced an animated Christmas special based on the series, ''[[Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas]].'' In the special, Dr. Claw has locked up [[Santa Claus]] at the North Pole and hypnotized his elves, forcing them to break all toys that are being produced. Inspector Gadget, Penny, and Brain travel to the North Pole in an attempt to stop Dr. Claw and save Christmas. This special was nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]. [[Don Adams]], [[Frank Welker]], Erica Horn and [[Maurice LaMarche]] provide the voices for the characters.

===''Gadget Boy &amp; Heather''===
{{main|Gadget Boy &amp; Heather}}
The 1995 ''Gadget Boy and Heather'' series was a spin off from the original show. The series is about a [[Younger and junior versions of cartoon characters|younger version]] of Gadget, "Gadget Boy" (also voiced by Don Adams). Instead of Penny and Brain the Dog, Gadget Boy was assisted by the resourceful Heather (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]). Just as maladroit as his adult self is, Gadget Boy was usually bailed out of situations by the more practical Heather, though he was also helped greatly by his myriad high-tech gadgets and extendable arms and legs. In this series, traditional nemesis Dr. Claw was replaced by the villainess Spydra. In addition, the chief, Strombolli had a "fax tie" that exploded after the mission was read, continuing the [[running gag]] from the original series in which Chief Quimby would get blown up by an exploding message.

===''Gadget Boy's Adventures in History''===
Two years later, in 1997, ''Gadget Boy &amp; Heather'' spawned an educational spinoff, ''[[Gadget Boy's Adventures in History]]'', which aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. This series marked the last time Don Adams would perform a voice role for an animated Gadget series two years before his retirement from voicing an animated Gadget in 1999 and eight years before his death in 2005.

===''Inspector Gadget's Field Trip''===
{{main|Inspector Gadget's Field Trip}}

In 1996, Gadget took students around the world in this series of 50 field trips, mainly created to market to stations to fulfill the FCC [[E/I]] requirements. The show put an animated Inspector Gadget on top of live-action filming of the locations that Gadget guided viewers through. Don Adams returned as Gadget's voice while Penny, Brain, Chief Quimby, Capeman and Dr. Claw are entirely absent.

===''Gadget and the Gadgetinis''===
{{main|Gadget and the Gadgetinis}}
In 2002, the French studio SIP Animation (Saban International Paris), in cooperation with DiC, produced 52 episodes of the new TV series ''Gadget and the Gadgetinis.'' The series debuted on the French channel M6 in September 2002 and was aired on Fox Kids channels across Europe from 2003. It has never been broadcast or released in the United States.

Inspector Gadget (again voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is now a member of an organization called "WOMP" (World Organization of Mega Powers) and is now, Lieutenant Gadget. He is still aided in his work by Penny (who is now twelve years old), as well as the new robot characters Digit and Fidget, the titular Gadgetinis invented by Penny, due to Brain running away. It follows the same plot as the original series, with the dim witted Gadget attempting to fight crime on his own, while Penny and her helpers secretly do all the work. Doctor Claw, now with the first name George, returns as the main villain, with his relatives introduced in some episodes. In some stories, he is replaced by other villains.

The production values of this series were higher than any of the previous revivals and spinoff series. Also, the original creators of ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' were all involved: [[Andy Heyward]] was one of the executive producers; [[Jean Chalopin]] wrote or co-wrote all the episodes, in addition to being credited as the new show's creator; whereas [[Bruno Bianchi (cartoonist)|Bruno Bianchi]] directed and produced the series.

===''Inspector Gadget (2015)''===
{{Main|Inspector Gadget (2015 TV series)}}
A new CGI-animated ''[[Inspector Gadget (2015 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' TV series has been in development since at least the start of 2012, possibly earlier. It was commissioned by [[Teletoon|Teletoon Canada]], which will air the show, and put into preproduction by [[The Cookie Jar Company]]. In January 2012, the in-development show was mentioned by Ray Sharma, the CEO of [[XMG Studio]], which produced the hit mobile game "Inspector Gadget: M.A.D. Dash". Sharma described how the success of the game had resulted in a new TV series being in the making: "We did 1 million downloads in a week, and it's reinvigorated the TV brand with a new TV series in production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/XMG+Studio+news/news.asp?c=37301&amp;srch |title=MGF 2012: XMG's Sharma on the potential for transmedia and kickstarting augmented reality gaming with Ghostbusters &amp;#124; news &amp;#124; XMG Studio news |publisher=PocketGamer.biz |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Cookie Jar issued a short press release about the upcoming series, as part of the advertising for it during the MIPCOM market that October, stating: "Cookie Jar Entertainment is celebrating Inspector Gadget’s 30th anniversary with the launch of a brand-new series with its Canadian broadcast partner TELETOON. The series will again revolve around the iconic bionic bumbling detective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexttime-gadget.blogspot.no/2012/11/the-new-inspector-gadget-tv-series-is.html |title=Next Time, Gadget!...

Criminals, beware! Bystanders … take cover! Inspector Gadget is back to battle Dr. Claw with all-new gadgets – and all-new gadget-related chaos. But the loveable, bumbling, accidentally-destructive Inspector is not alone in the fight to take down MAD. His ever trusty police-dog, Brain, is still by his side and he's getting extra crime-fighting help from his new partner, Inspector-in-training Penny (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]). With MAD more powerful than ever and with the arrival of Dr. Claw's evil-genius (and totally crush-worthy) nephew, Penny and Brain will need to use every ounce of their training to keep the world safe from Dr. Claw … and Gadget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletoonmedia.com/en/index.php/teletoon/press_release/category/teletoon_banff_release |title=The Press Room « Teletoon « Press Release « Inspector Gadget Reboot Tops Off TELETOON Canada’s Latest Original Production Slate |publisher=Teletoonmedia.com |date=2013-06-09 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other shows, Penny is more of the protagonist and Dr. Claw is as incompetent and useless as Gadget (if not more so). The series is being produced by [[DHX Media]], which purchased Cookie Jar in 2012. According to a DHX Media distribution catalogue released as a PDF on January 15, 2014, the show premiered in 2015 on Netflix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/distribution/DHX_MEDIA_CATALOGUE_low_res.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305040458/http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/distribution/DHX_MEDIA_CATALOGUE_low_res.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/distribution/|title=DHX Distribution|publisher=DHX Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2014, it was announced that the series has 26 episodes and that it would air on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]'s international channels in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2014/12/boomerang-acquires-inspector-gadget-emea-latin-america-asia-pacific/|title=Boomerang Acquires ‘Inspector Gadget’ For EMEA, Latin America &amp; Asia Pacific|last=Munn|first=Patrick|work=TV Wise|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on [[Boomerang (Australia and New Zealand)|Boomerang]] in Australia on January 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Blog/NEW-THIS-WEEK-Grimm-Pretty-Little-Liars-The-100-America-s-Next/ba-p/40390|title=NEW THIS WEEK: Grimm, Pretty Little Liars, The 100, America’s Next Top Model, People’s Choice Awards, Hello Ladies: The Movie, 2015 AFC Asian Cup and live sport|last=Higgins|first=D|date=January 5, 2015|work=Foxtel|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live action===
{{main|Inspector Gadget (film)|Inspector Gadget 2}}
''Inspector Gadget'' was [[Film adaptation|adapted]] into [[Inspector Gadget (film)|a 1999 live-action film]] by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], starring [[Matthew Broderick]] as the title character and [[Rupert Everett]] as Doctor Claw. As opposed to the animated series, where Gadget is bumbling and clueless and Claw's face is never shown, Gadget appears to be more reliable and competent in detective work and Claw's face appears many times in the film.

A second film, ''[[Inspector Gadget 2]]'' featured many changes from the first one, such as Doctor Bradford no longer assisting Gadget or being his romantic interest, instead being replaced by a well-meaning and upbeat scientist named Baxter. Being a year later in the movie's timeline, Gadget had begun displaying his cartoon namesake's glitches by receiving the wrong gadget when he calls out a specific device. He falls in love with his intended replacement: the fully robotic G2. Furthermore, none of the cast from the first film returned to their roles except [[D.L. Hughley]].

Disney and [[Dan Lin|Lin Pictures]] are making a third movie with [[Dan Lin]] producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/inspector-gadget-live-action-reboot-in-the-works-115052500963_1.html|title='Inspector Gadget' live-action reboot in the works|first=|last=|date=25 May 2015|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets===

Released on VHS in 1999 to coincide with [[Inspector Gadget (film)|Disney's live-action theatrical film]], ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets]]'' takes the format of a [[clip show]] in which Gadget has a flashback to his past adventures in the original TV series, using footage from the episodes "The Capeman Cometh", "Prince of the Gypsies", and "Gadget's Gadgets"; as well as some stock footage from ''Inspector Gadget's Field Trip'' for the present-day segments. Maurice LaMarche did Inspector Gadget's voice in the modern segments, marking his first cartoon voice appearance as Gadget, who had previously been voiced by [[Don Adams]]. Original series actors [[Cree Summer]] and [[Frank Welker]] voiced Penny and Dr Claw in the modern segments.

===Inspector Gadget's Last Case===
In 2002, DiC released a full-length animated feature film called ''Inspector Gadget's Last Case'', directed by Michael Maliani. It premiered on television on ''[[Nickelodeon Sunday Movie Toons]]'' and was released on DVD and VHS shortly afterward by [[MGM Home Entertainment]]. The film is about Lt. Gadget giving up his beloved but aging Gadgetmobile, while his archenemy Dr. Claw uses a competing crime fighter to discredit Gadget and cost him his badge. Penny and Brain make appearances as minor supporting characters. In this, Gadget is more competent, yet he is still bumbling, similar to his persona in the pilot episode and his Mathew Broderick counterpart. This film uses the same character designs as the concurrent ''Gadget &amp; The Gadgetinis'' TV series, which debuted on the French channel M6 and the UK's Channel 5 in the fall of 2002. Maurice LaMarche reprised the role of Gadget in this film and [[Jaleel White]] voiced Gadgetmobile. In Germany, the film aired on [[Cartoon Network (Germany)|Cartoon Network]].

===Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever===
2005's ''Inspector Gadget's Biggest Caper Ever'' was the first ''Inspector Gadget'' animated production to be completely rendered using [[computer animation|3D computer animation]]. It returned Gadget to his familiar trenchcoat from the original series. Brain is also back in his old role, while Penny is now 16 years old. Gadget is again voiced by Maurice LaMarche and Penny and Claw are once again voiced by Tegan Moss and Brian Drummond, while [[Bernie Mac]] voices the Gadgetmobile. The plot features Dr. Claw breaking out of jail with the help of a specially hired Scottish agent named Bombaboy. He and Bombaboy seek out a pterodactyl to get revenge on his captors and launch yet another scheme to conquer the world. It was originally intended to be the first in a series of several animated ''Inspector Gadget'' movies, but apparently due to weak sales, no subsequent films were released.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Video games==
The first game developed based on the series was ''[[Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear]]'' developed by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Beam Software]] and scheduled for release by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]] in the UK in 1987 for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. It resembled the arcade title [[Metro-Cross]] and was a left-to-right scrolling racing/jumping game with a quasi-isometric forced 3d perspective. Although the game was completed, and preview copies were reviewed (unfavourably) in the computing press, it was scrapped on the verge of release. The game featured a cameo by the titular character from the [[Horace series]] of games. An [[adventure game]] based on the series, ''[[Inspector Gadget: Mission 1 – Global Terror!|Inspector Gadget: Mission 1 - Global Terror!]]'' was eventually released on the PC in 1990 by a company called Azeroth.

An LCD Electronic ''Inspector Gadget'' developed by Bandai was released in 1984.

An [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game was planned for release by [[Hudson Soft]], but was quietly cancelled. Instead, Hudson released an [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game in 1993 simply called ''[[Inspector Gadget (video game)|Inspector Gadget]]''. The game features a rare glimpse of Dr. Claw's face.

Years later, [[Ubisoft]] released ''[[Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Crazy Maze]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and ''[[Inspector Gadget: Operation Madkactus]]'', for the [[Game Boy Color]]. DreamCatcher Interactive and Magic Pockets released another game, ''[[Inspector Gadget: Advance Mission]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]].

Light and Shadow Productions also released ''[[Inspector Gadget: Mad Robots Invasion]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and ''Inspector Gadget Racers'', a racing game for the Game Boy Advance.

''[[Gadget and the Gadgetinis (video game)|Gadget and the Gadgetinis]]'' was the first game based on one of the animated spin-offs and was released for the PlayStation 2 and [[Personal computer|PC]] in Europe.

''Inspector Gadget's MAD Dash'' was released for iOS devices, [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]], by [[XMG Studio]] in 2010. It features Shuki Levy's original theme music and also includes original voices from the show.  In the same game, Doctor Claw reveals his face and is once again given the first name George.

==Music==
Several early rap records sampling the ''Inspector Gadget'' theme song were released in 1985. The Kartoon Krew also released "Inspector Gadget" on [[ZYX Music]], which contains vocal samples and quotes from the popular cartoon series reenacted by the Rap Group for the song. Brownsville rap group Bad Boys &amp; K-Love released a record on Starlite Records called "Bad Boys" that was featured on the UK hip hop compilation ''[[Street Sounds Electro 9]]''. Following the trend, [[Slick Rick]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]] used samples from the ''Inspector Gadget'' theme song on their single "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]". The theme song has been heavily sampled in the years since then.

==Books==
A new ''Inspector Gadget'' comic book, based on the original 1983 TV series, was launched in the U.S. by [[Viper Comics]] in 2011. A preview issue was published as part of the [[Free Comic Book Day]] on May 7, 2011; the entire story was then released officially in August as a 48-page comic book titled "Inspector Gadget: Gadget on the Orient Express". The comic book was written by Dale Mettam and illustrated by José Cobá. No follow-up issues have been released to date.

==Other appearances==
On a 1989 episode of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', another DiC production, a live action bumper segment titled ''"Defective Gadgetry"'' had a guest appearance by [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]], in which he came to the Mario Bros. for help in repairing him. This was his first live-action appearance predating the 1999 live-action film ten years later. Maurice LaMarche (who would assume the voice role in ''"Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Greatest Gadgets"'' ten years later) plays Gadget in this segment. A second live-action segment, ''"Treasure of the Sierra Brooklyn"'' had Gadget returning to help the Mario Bros. find a lost treasure.

The ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "[[Adoption's an Option]]" featured a sketch featuring the ''Inspector Gadget'' characters in a parody of ''[[The Terminator]]''. In this sketch, Gadget replaces a faulty part with a Cyberdyne part, only to be turned into an unstoppable killing machine when [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] goes online. The sketch goes on to revolve around Penny and Brain trying to avoid being killed by the now-evil Gadget, eventually killing him in a factory. Meanwhile, Mad Cat dies of [[leukemia]]; at the end of the show, Dr. Claw blames Gadget for Mad Cat's death.  Ironically, Dr. Claw claims that he somehow found out it was Penny and Brain who were behind all of Gadget's successful missions, and planned to gain control of Inspector Gadget via Skynet, and use him to kill them using the Cyberdyne technology that gained control of him. (Penny is voiced by [[Cree Summer]] and Brain &amp; Dr. Claw by [[Frank Welker]], who were the original voice actors for the characters).

{{Audio|Ja, vi elsker dette landet (anthem).ogg|"'''Ja, vi elsker dette landet'''"}} (In [[English language|English]]: "Yes, we love this country"), also known by the title "'''Song For Norway'''", is a [[patriotism|patriotic]] anthem, which has been commonly regarded as the ''de facto'' [[national anthem of Norway]] since early 20th century, after being used alongside {{lang|no|[[Sønner av Norge]]}} since the 1860s. The lyrics were written by [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] between 1859 and 1868, and the melody was written by his cousin [[Rikard Nordraak]] sometime during the winter of 1863-1864. It was first performed publicly on 17 May 1864 in connection with the 50th anniversary of the [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]]. Usually only the first and the last two verses are sung.

==As a national anthem==
{{Main|National anthem of Norway}}

Until the mid-1860s, the older anthems ''[[Sønner av Norge]]'' and ''[[Norges Skaal]]'' were commonly regarded as the Norwegian national anthems, with ''Sønner av Norge'' being most recognised. ''Ja, vi elsker dette landet'' gradually came to be recognised as a national anthem from the mid-1860s. Until the early 20th century, however, both ''Sønner av Norge'' and ''Ja, vi elsker'' were used alongside, with ''Sønner av Norge'' being preferred in official situations. In 2011, the song ''[[Mitt lille land]]'' featured prominently in all the memorial ceremonies following the [[2011 Norway attacks]] and was described by the media as "a new national anthem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Verdig-tilstandsrapport-fra-nasjonalartistene-2546839.html Verdig tilstandsrapport fra nasjonalartistene] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229051142/http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Verdig-tilstandsrapport-fra-nasjonalartistene-2546839.html |date=December 29, 2013 }}, BT.no&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Norwegian Constitution Day]] in 2012, the [[NRK]] broadcast was opened with "Mitt lille land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindahl |first=Björn |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/utrikes/norsk-festyra-fick-ny-dimension_7209020.svd |title=Norsk festyra fick ny dimension |language=Swedish |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics and literal translation==

Bjørnson wrote in a modified version of the Danish language current in Norway at the time. Written [[Bokmål]] has since then been altered in a series of orthographic reforms intended to distinguish it from Danish and bring it closer to spoken Norwegian. The text below, and commonly in use today, is identical to Bjørnson's original in using the same words, but with modernised spelling and punctuation. The most sung verses, 1, 7 and 8, have been modernised most and have several variations in existence. For example, Bjørnson originally wrote «drømme på vor jord», which some sources today write as «drømme på v''å''r jord», while others write «drømme''r'' på v''å''r jord».

{{wikisourcelang|no|Ja, vi ælsker dette landet|Ja, vi elsker dette landet}}

In each verse the last two lines are sung twice, and one or two words are repeated an extra time when the lines are sung the second time (for example "senker" in the first verse). These words are written in ''italics'' in the Norwegian lyrics below. The first verse is written down in full as an example.

==Poetic translation and metric version==

The three commonly used stanzas of ''Ja, vi elsker'' were translated into English long ago. The name of the translator is seldom mentioned in printed versions of the English text. It has so far not been possible to identify the person responsible or to ascertain when it was translated. But the following versions of stanzas 1, 7, and 8 are well known and often sung by descendants of Norwegian immigrants to the [[United States]]. Its popularity and familiarity among Norwegian-Americans seems to indicate that it has been around for a long time, certainly since before the middle of the 20th century, and possibly much earlier. This translation may be regarded as the "official" version in English.

Yes, we love with fond devotion
This our land that looms
Rugged, storm-scarred o'er the ocean
With her thousand homes.
Love her, in our love recalling
Those who gave us birth.
And old tales which night, in falling,
Brings as dreams to earth.

Thank thy God whose power
willed and wrought the land's salvation
In her darkest hour.
All our mothers sought with weeping
And our sires in fight,
God has fashioned in His keeping
Till we gained our right.

Yes, we love with fond devotion
This our land that looms
Rugged, storm-scarred o'er the ocean
With her thousand homes.
And, as warrior sires have made her
Wealth and fame increase,
At the call  we too  will aid her
Armed to guard her peace.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Metrical versions===

Two alternative metrical version are also in existence. The second version follows the original closely, and was learnt by heart by a Norwegian&lt;ref&gt;Torolv Hustad, born around 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; who did not know the name of the translator. It has been published (without the name of the translator) in a collection of ''Sange og digte paa dansk og engelsk''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sange og digte paa dansk og engelsk|last = |first = |publisher = "Nordlysets" forlag|year = 1903|isbn = |location = New York Public Library, digitized by Google|pages = 30–31|editor-last = Volk|editor-first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; [''Songs and Poems in Danish and English'']. Two small changes in this text has been done in the version, which is presented here. Verse 2, which is seldom sung, has been omitted, and the last two lines in each verse are repeated, in the same way as we sing it in Norwegian.

&lt;poem&gt;
Norway, thine is our devotion,
Land of hearth and home,
Rising storm-scarr'd from the ocean,
Where the breakers foam.
Oft to thee our thoughts are wending,
Land that gave us birth,
And to saga nights still sending
Dreams upon our earth,
And to saga nights still sending
Dreams upon us on our earth

Men of Norway, be your dwelling
Cottage, house or farm,
Praise the Lord who all compelling
Sav'd our land from harm.
Not the valour of a father
On the battlefield
Nor a mother's tears, but rather
God our vict'ry sealed,
Nor a mother's tears, but rather
God for us our vict'ry sealed.

Norway, thine is our devotion,
Land of hearth and home,
Rising storm-scarr'd from the ocean,
Where the breakers foam.
As our fathers' vict'ry gave it
Peace for one and all,
We shall rally, too, to save it
When we hear the call,
We shall rally, too, to save it
When we hear, we hear the call.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Yes, we love this land arising
Stormbeat o'er the sea

With its thousand homes, enticing,

Rugged though it be.

Love it, love it, not forgetting

Those we owe our birth,

Nor that night of saga letting

Down its dreams to earth,

Nor that night of saga letting

Down its dreams, its dreams, to earth.

Norseman, where thou dwellest, render

Praise and thanks to Him,

Who has been this land's defender,

When its hopes looked dim.

Wars our fathers' aims unfolded,

Tears our mothers shed,

Roads of them for us He molded,

To our rights they led.

Roads of them for us He molded,

To our rights, our rights, they led.

Yes, we love this land arising

Stormbeat o'er the sea

With its thousand homes, enticing,

Rugged though it be.

Like our fathers who succeeded,

Warring for release,

So will we, whenever needed,

Rally for its peace.

So will we, whenever needed,

Rally for its peace, its peace.

==Deleted verse a tribute to King Charles IV==
A verse hailing [[Charles XV of Sweden|Charles IV]] who had succeeded his father as king of Norway in July 1859 was included in the original version of "Ja, vi elsker". However, following the divisive international events of the spring of 1864 where the [[Scandinavism|ideal of a unified Scandinavia]] was coldly shattered, Bjørnson went from being a monarchist to republicanism, and the tribute to the reigning sovereign was stricken from the song.

The lyrics that were taken out were:

:Kongen selv står stærk og åpen
:som vår Grænsevagt
:og hans allerbedste Våpen
:er vår Broderpagt.

In English this reads:

:The King himself stands strong and open
:As our border guard
:and his most powerful weapon
:is our brethren pact.

The "brethren pact" which the text is referring to was a military treaty between Norway, Sweden and Denmark to come to the assistance should one of the nations come under military assault. This happened when German troops [[Second Schleswig War|invaded]] [[Duchy of Schleswig|South Jutland]] in February 1864. None of the alliance partners came to the rescue of Denmark. This perceived treason of the "brethren pact" once and for all shattered many people's dreams of unification of the three countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bomann-Larsen |first1= Tor |authorlink1= Tor Bomann-Larsen |title= Kongstanken |trans-title=|edition= |series= Haakon &amp; Maud |volume= 1 |year= 2002 |month= |origyear= |publisher= [[J.W.

==Controversies==
[[Image:Postcard-Norway-flag-1905.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A postcard from around the time of the [[Norwegian union dissolution referendum, 1905]].]]
In 1905 the [[Union between Sweden and Norway]] was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|dissolved]] after many years of Norwegian struggle for equality between the two states, as stipulated in the 1815 Act of Union. The unilateral declaration by the Norwegian [[Storting]] of the union's dissolution 7 June provoked strong Swedish reactions, bringing the two nations to the brink of war in the autumn. In Sweden, pro-war conservatives were opposed by the Social Democrats, whose leaders [[Hjalmar Branting]] and [[Zeth Höglund]] spoke out
for reconciliation and a peaceful settlement with Norway. Swedish socialists sang ''Ja, vi elsker dette landet'' to demonstrate their support for the Norwegian people’s right to secede from the union.

During [[World War II]], the anthem was used both by the Norwegian resistance and the [[Nazi]] collaborators, the latter group mainly for propaganda reasons. Eventually, the German occupiers officially forbade any use of the anthem.

In May 2006, the multicultural newspaper ''[[Utrop]]'' proposed that the national anthem be translated into [[Urdu]], the native language of the most numerous group of recent immigrants to Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web3.aftenbladet.no/kultur/article291023.ece Vil ha «Ja vi elsker» på urdu&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511044404/http://web3.aftenbladet.no/kultur/article291023.ece |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor's idea was that people from other ethnic groups should be able to honour their adopted country with devotion, even if they were not fluent in Norwegian. This proposal was referred to by other more widely read papers, and a member of the [[Storting]] called the proposal "[[Racial integration|integration]] in reverse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1318660.ece Fr.p. sier nei til "Ja vi elsker" på urdu&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521014338/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1318660.ece |date=May 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proponent of translating the anthem received batches of hate-mail calling her a traitor and threatening her with decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oslopuls.no/nyheter/article1324897.ece  |accessdate=2006-12-30 |df= }}{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JapaneseGraveyardTokyo.jpg|thumb|A graveyard in Tokyo]]

A '''Japanese funeral''' (葬儀 ''sōgi'' or 葬式 ''sōshiki'') includes a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], the [[cremation]] of the deceased, a burial in a family [[Grave (burial)|grave]], and a periodic memorial service. According to 2007 statistics, 99.81% of deceased Japanese are cremated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc5/Stats/Interntl/2007/StatsIF.html Cremation Society of G.B. - International Cremation Statistics 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern funerals==

===After death===
Although Japan has become a more secular society (see [[Religion in Japan]]), 91% of funerals are conducted as Buddhist ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funerals in Japan|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/features/jg00039/|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after a death (or, in earlier days, just before the expected death), relatives moisten the dying or deceased person's lips with water, a practice known as {{Nihongo|''water of the last moment''|末期の水|matsugo-no-mizu}}. Most Japanese homes maintain Buddhist altars, or {{nihongo|''butsudan''|仏壇}}, for use in Buddhist ceremonies; and many also have [[Shinto]] shrines, or {{nihongo|''kamidana''|神棚}}.  When a death occurs, the shrine is closed and covered with white paper to keep out the impure spirits of the dead, a custom called {{nihongo|''kamidana-fūji''|神棚封じ}}. A small table decorated with flowers, [[incense]], and a candle is placed next to the deceased's bed.

The relatives and authorities are informed, and a death certificate is issued. Funeral arrangements typically are made by the eldest son and are begun by contacting a temple to schedule the event. Some days are more auspicious than others, based on an old Chinese six-day lunar cycle; in particular, the second day, called {{nihongo|''tomobiki''|友引}}, is superstitiously understood to mean "pulling your friends along with you" (''tomo'' = friends; ''hiku'' = pull, although the original significance was different) and is therefore considered a terrible day for a funeral but a good day for a wedding.

The body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. An "encoffining" ritual (called a ''nōkan'') is sometimes performed, in which professional [[nōkansha]] ({{nihongo|納棺者}}) ritually dress and prepare the body and place it in the coffin (this is portrayed in the 2008 film ''[[Departures (2008 film)|Departures]]''). The ceremony is now rarely performed, and may be limited to rural areas where older traditions are maintained.  Whether or not the encoffining ceremony is performed, a deceased female is dressed in a white [[kimono]], and a deceased male is dressed in a suit or a kimono. Makeup may be applied. The body is put on [[dry ice]] in a [[coffin|casket]]. Items—such as a white kimono, a pair of sandals, six coins for crossing the [[Sanzu River|River of Three Crossings]], and burnable items of which the deceased was fond (for example, cigarettes and candy) are placed in the casket, which is then put on an altar for the wake. The body is placed with its head toward the north or, as a second choice, toward the west. In Buddhism, the western orientation reflects the western realm of [[Amitabha|Amida Buddha]].

During life, both men and women cross the front of a [[kimono]] or [[yukata]] with the left side over the right.  On those occasions in which the corpse is clothed in a traditional kimono, the kimono is crossed right over left.

===Wake===
[[File:JapaneseFuneralEnvelope.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional design of the envelope for condolence money]]

[[File:The altar of the Japanese Buddhism-style funeral,saidan,japan.jpg|thumb|Funeral arrangement, with flower arrangements, a portrait of the deceased, and an ''[[ihai]]'', a spirit tablet. For privacy reasons, the name of the dead person, as well as the face on the portrait are censored out via pixellation.]]

Held as soon as possible after death, a Japanese wake is called {{nihongo|''tsuya''|通夜}}, lit. "passing the night".  All funeral guests wear black: men wear black suits with white shirts and black ties, and women wear either black dresses or black kimonos.  If the deceased was an adherent to [[Buddhism]], a set of [[Buddhist prayer beads|prayer beads]] called {{nihongo|''[[juzu]]''|数珠}} may be carried by the guests, who will also bring condolence money in special black-and-silver envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;Gordenker, Alice, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20110621wh.html Kinpū]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 June 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the relationship to the deceased and the wealth of the guest, the amount may be equivalent to between 3,000 and 30,000 [[yen]]. The guests are seated, with immediate relatives seated closest to the front. The Buddhist priest then chants a section from a [[sutra]]. The family members will each offer incense three times to the incense urn in front of the deceased.  At the same time, the assembled guests will perform the same ritual at another location behind the family members' seats.  The wake ends once the priest has completed the sutra. Each departing guest is given a gift, which has a value of about half or one quarter of the condolence money received from this guest. The closest relatives may stay and keep [[vigil]] with the deceased overnight in the same room.

===Funeral===

The funeral proper, called {{nihongo|''kokubetsu-shiki''|告別式}}, is usually on the day after the wake. The procedure is similar to the wake, and incense is offered while a priest chants a sutra.  The ceremony differs slightly as the deceased receives a new Buddhist name (戒名, ''kaimyō''; lit. "precept name") written in Kanji. This name is said to prevent the return of the deceased if their name is called. The length of the name depends also on either the virtue of the person's lifespan or more commonly, the size of the donation of the relatives to the temple, which may range from a generally common name to the most elaborate names for 1 million yen or more. The high prices charged by the temples are a controversial issue in Japan, especially since [[Simony|some temples put pressure on families to buy a more expensive name]]. The [[kanji]] for these ''kaimyō'' are usually very ancient, and sometimes with esoteric meanings.

At the end of the funeral ceremony, the guests and family may place flowers in the casket around the deceased's head and shoulders before the casket is sealed and carried to the elaborately decorated [[hearse]] and transported to the crematorium. In some regions of Japan, the coffin is nailed shut by the mourners using a stone.

===Cremation===
[[File:Cremation in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Cremation in Japan, illustration from 1867]]
[[File:Collecting the ashes after the funeral -J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Picking the bones from the ashes, illustration from 1867]][[File:Kotsuage.JPG|thumb|Bone-picking ceremony]]

The coffin is placed on a tray in the crematorium. The family witnesses the sliding of the body into the cremation chamber.  A [[cremation]] usually takes about two hours, and the family returns at a scheduled time when the cremation has been completed. According to the Yamaguchi Saijo Funeral Parlor and Crematorium in Sapporo, it takes about an hour and a half to cremate an adult body, 45 minutes for a child, 15 minutes for a stillborn child.

The relatives [[excarnation|pick]] the [[bone]]s out of the ashes and transfer them to the urn using large [[chopsticks]] or metal picks, two relatives sometimes holding the same bone at the same time with their chopsticks (or, according to some sources, passing the bones from chopsticks to chopsticks).  Known as {{nihongo|''kotsuage''|骨揚げ}}, this is the only time in Japan when it is proper for two people to hold the same item at the same time with chopsticks. At all other times, holding anything with chopsticks by two people at the same time, or passing an item from chopsticks to chopsticks, is considered to be a major social ''faux pas'' as this will remind bystanders of the funeral of a close relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals | author= Sari Edelstein |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning | date = 2009 | page = 299 | isbn = 9780763759650}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bones of the feet are picked up first, and the bones of the head are picked up last. This is to ensure that the deceased is not upside down in the urn. The [[hyoid bone]], which is located in the neck, is the most significant bone to be placed in the urn.

In some cases, the ashes may be divided among more than one urn. For example, some ashes go to a family grave, and some go to the temple or even to a company grave or to a [[space burial|burial in space]]. Depending upon the local custom, the urn may stay at the family home for a period or may be directly taken to the graveyard.

In the [[Ryukyu Islands]], the traditional burial was somewhat different from that in the mainland Japan. Instead of cremation, the body would be temporarily interred in the family tomb (a large [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]], often of the [[Turtle-back tombs|turtle-back variety]]); after a few years, once the flesh had decomposed, the bones would be washed and put into the funerary urn, to be permanently stored elsewhere in the tomb.&lt;ref name=kabira&gt;{{citation|title=The Culture of Kabira, Southern Ryūkyū Islands|author= Allan H. Smith|journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=104|issue=2 |date=Apr 19, 1960|pages=134–171}} {{JSTOR|985656}} (pp. 170-171).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grave===

[[File:JapaneseGravestoneWithRedInkName.jpg|thumb|The name of a living spouse written in red]]
A typical Japanese grave is usually a {{nihongo|family grave|墓|haka}} consisting of a stone monument, with a place for flowers, incense, and water in front of the monument and a chamber or crypt underneath for the ashes.
[[File:JapaneseGraveTokyo.jpg|thumb|left|A typical Japanese grave]]

The date of the erection of the grave and the name of the person who purchased it may be engraved on the side of the monument. The names of the deceased are often but not always engraved on the front of the monument. When a married person dies before his or her spouse, the name of the spouse may also be engraved on the stone, with the letters painted red. After the death and the burial of the spouse, the red ink is removed from the stone. This is usually done for financial reasons, as it is cheaper to engrave two names at the same time than to engrave the second name when the second spouse dies. It can also be seen as a sign that they are waiting to follow their spouse into the grave. However, this practice is less frequent nowadays. The names of the deceased may also be engraved on the left side, or on a separate stone in front of the grave. Often, the name is also written on a [[sotoba]], a separate wooden board on a stand behind or next to the grave. These sotoba may be erected shortly after death, and new ones may be added at certain memorial services.

Some graves may also have a box for business cards, where friends and relatives visiting the grave can drop their business card, informing the caretakers of the grave of the respects the visitors have paid to the deceased.

The high prices of funeral plots, costing on average 2 million yen, have led to a new service of {{nihongo|''Grave Apartments''|お墓のマンション|ohaka no manshon}}, where a locker-sized grave can be purchased for about 400,000 yen. Some of these may even include a [[touch screen]] showing a picture of the deceased, messages, a family tree, and other information. Due to the cost of land, a graveyard in Tokyo has recently been opened by a temple in floors 3 to 8 of a nine-story building, where the lower floors are for funeral ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

There are a number of cases where the ashes of deceased persons have been stolen from graves. The ashes of famous cartoonist [[Machiko Hasegawa]] and of the wife of real estate chairman [[Takichi Hayasaka]] were stolen for ransom. The ashes of famous novelist [[Yukio Mishima]] (1925–1970) were stolen in 1971 and the ashes of novelist [[Naoya Shiga]] were stolen in 1980. The ashes of the wife of the baseball player [[Sadaharu Oh]] went missing in December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/04/sports/sp-oh4?pg=4 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Home run king and gentleman | first=Bruce | last=Wallace | date=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mourning and memorial services===

Memorial services depend on local customs. Usually, there are a number of memorial services following the death - for example, daily for the first seven days, or a number of services within the first 49 days, or on the 7th, 49th and 100th day, depending on the local custom.   Most commonly observed are the Buddhist service on the seventh day after death, {{nihongo|''shonanoka''|初七日}}, and the 49th day, {{nihongo|''shijūkunichi''|四十九日}}.  In many traditions, the urn containing the ashes is interred in a ceremony called {{nihongo|''nōkotsu''|納骨}} on the 49th day, and the family stays in mourning until this.

After that, there is a memorial service on the [[Obon]] festival in honor of the dead. The festival may be held in the 1st year, sometimes in the 3rd and 5th, 7th and 13th years, and a number of times afterwards up to either the 39th or the 50th year. One popular sequence follows the days of the [[Thirteen Buddhas]].

A picture of the deceased is also placed at or near the family altar in the household. Also, in the first year after death, no traditional [[Japanese New Year|New Year's Day Postcard]] is sent or received. The friends and relatives have to be informed of this beforehand so as not to send a card.

==Japanese funeral industry==
The average cost of a Japanese funeral is about 2.31 million yen (USD 25,000) according to a 2008 study by the Japan Consumer's Association. This cost includes services such as 401,000 yen for catering to attendants and 549,000 yen for services of the priest.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090728i1.html|title=Japan's funerals deep-rooted mix of ritual, form|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the industry has a revenue of about 1.5 trillion yen with about 45,000 funeral homes. In 2004, 1.1 million Japanese died (2003: 1.0 million), a number that is expected to rise in the future due to the increase of the average age in Japan; see [[demographics of Japan]]. Funeral Business Monthly estimates that there will be 1.7 million deaths by 2035, and revenue of 2 trillion yen in 2040.

Recently there have been some changes in the funeral industry, and some{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} funeral homes offer more competitive and transparent pricing than a standard funeral provider. These offer funerals starting at about 200,000 yen, a fraction of the regular overpriced services, and lists the different options and prices to choose from ''a la carte''. Many of these new funeral homes are started by non-Japanese nationals. Also, recently hotels with a decreasing income due to a decrease in [[wedding]]s have started to offer funeral services.  Overall, the level of competition is increasing. To stay competitive, the prices of regular funeral homes are also decreasing over time. Another recent introduction are services where a person can choose his or her funeral service before death and pays a monthly fee (e.g. 10,000 yen) to cover all costs of the funeral.

==History==
[[File:Asuka Ishibutai Kofun side.jpg|thumb|The [[Ishibutai Kofun]] in [[Asuka, Nara]], a partially uncovered Kofun]]
Throughout Japanese history, famous leaders have often been buried in tombs. The oldest known burial chamber was built between 220 and 230 [[Common Era|CE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20000328a6.html|title=Burial chamber may be oldest in Japan |date=2000-03-28|publisher=The Japan Times|accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sakurai, Nara|Sakurai]], [[Nara Prefecture]], and called the ''Hokenoyama tomb''. The tomb is 80 m long, and the chamber is 7 m long and 2.7 m wide, and contained a coffin 5 m long and 1 m wide. It is not known exactly who is buried there, but it is presumed to be a powerful local leader.

Around 300, the use of burial mounds for important leaders became more frequent. Japan developed its unique keyhole-shaped burial mounds, which are called ''Kofun'' (古墳 - the word is used for burial mounds of all shapes), and the period from 250 to 538 is called the [[Kofun]] period. Although 50 years ago it was believed that these mounds had initially been influenced by burial mounds in China via the Korean peninsula, [[Yayoi]]-period mounds are generally regarded as their predecessors. It is now believed that burial mounds of Korea built in the 5th and 6th centuries may have been influenced by the ''kofun'' of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hankyoreh]] 2001.9.6 [http://www.hani.co.kr/section-009000000/2001/09/009000000200109062248001.html](in Korean) "일본식 닮은 영산강가 5~6세기 고분" ([[Yeongsan River|Yeongsan River (영산강)]] kofuns were made in 5th and 6th centuries are similar to the Japanese style Kofun&lt;/ref&gt;)

There are numerous burial mounds within the geographical range of ancient Yamato-culture, most of which have keyhole-shaped outlines and which measure up to 400 m. The largest is the tomb of [[Emperor Nintoku]] in [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]] near [[Osaka]], with a length of 486 m. and covering an area of 300,000 square meters. They are usually surrounded by [[moat]]s, unless they are constructed on hills. The round halves of these burial mounds contain burial chambers. In the 6th century, round and square burial mounds came into use. The use of burial mounds is believed to have gradually stopped either with the introduction of [[Buddhism]] in Japan in the sixth century AD or with the establishment of the capital in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] by [[Empress Genmei]] in 710. Instead, family tombs were constructed with passages that allow additional burials of relatives. Traditionally, the handling of deceased was considered unclean business and was usually done by [[Burakumin]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Medieval Sōtō Zen funerals===
[[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] funerals, which make up the vast majority of Japanese funerals today, are generally performed in what was historically the [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] style, although today the Sōtō funerary rites have come to define the standard funeral format by most of the other Japanese Buddhist schools. Japanese Zen funeral rites came directly from Chinese Chan funeral rites, which were detailed in the ''[[Chanyuan Qinggui]]'' (禪院清規, “the pure regulations of the Zen monastery”). The major difference between the earlier Chinese Chan funerals and Japanese Sōtō Zen funerals was that early Japanese monks made no distinction between a monastic funeral for an abbot and the funeral service for a layperson. The first Japanese laypeople to receive Zen funerals were among the ruling elite who sponsored the activities of Zen institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William M. Bodiford]], "Zen in the Art of Funerals: Ritual Salvation in Japanese Buddhism," ''History of Religions'' 32, no. 2 (1992): 152.&lt;/ref&gt; One early example of this is the Regent [[Hōjō Tokimune]], who received monastic funeral rites in 1284 at the hands of Chinese monk Wuxue Zuyan.&lt;ref&gt;Bodiford, "Zen in the Art of Funerals," 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Zen historian Martin Collcutt asserts that “one means by which Zen monks extended their influence in society was by the conduct of funeral services for important patrons.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Collcutt, ''Five Mountains: The Rinzai Zen Monastic Institution in Medieval Japan'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval Sōtō period, only a small percentage of the funeral sermons recorded were delivered for members of the monastic order.&lt;ref&gt;William M Bodiford, ''Sōtō Zen in Medieval Japan'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The progressive changes in Sōtō Zen funeral rites were not enacted by its founder, [[Dōgen]], but came about years later when Zen master [[Keizan]] encouraged Zen monks to go out into the countryside and perform funeral services for the laity. Although Dōgen was the first to implement many aspects of Chinese Chan monastic codes in Japan, his ''gogoku'' doesn’t contain any funeral sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Bodiford, ''Soto Zen in Medieval Japan'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in [[History of Japan|Japanese history]], different schools of Zen were in competition for followers, and they were “more conscious than ever before of the necessity of making available to the laity such rites as funeral services and ancestor worship.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nara | first1 = Yasuaki | year = 1995 | title = May the Deceased Get Enlightenment! An Aspect of the Enculturation of Buddhism in Japan | url = | journal = Buddhist-Christian Studies | volume = 15 | issue = | page = 25 | doi=10.2307/1390033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keizan’s inclusive attitudes toward funerals resulted in the building of many temples in rural areas and the gradual expansion of the Sōtō order throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Nara, "May the Deceased Get Enlightenment!", 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral service that became popular for the Japanese laity in the medieval period was essentially the Chinese Chan service specified for the ordinary monk. The most important phases of this type of Zen funeral were: posthumous [[ordination]], the sermon at the side of the corpse, the circumambulation of the coffin around the [[cremation]] ground, and the lighting of the funeral pyre.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Faure, ''The Rhetoric of Immediacy: A Cultural Critique of Chan/Zen Buddhism'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991), 193.&lt;/ref&gt; For a layperson, the posthumous ordination part of the ritual was the most vital, because without ordaining the deceased as a Zen monk, the other funeral rites could not be performed, since Zen funeral rites did not previously exist for laypeople, but only for monks. Once posthumous ordination of the laity was accepted by the Sōtō school, lay funeral practices became possible; today, death rituals mark the central practice at Sōtō Zen parish temples.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Ryuken Williams, ''The Other Side of Zen: A Social History of Soto Zen Buddhism in Tokugawa Japan'' (Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was one of the first few elements of Sōtō Zen that was standardized by the early [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Side of Zen'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the popularization of Sōtō Zen in medieval Japan, Sōtō Zen funeral practices have been a significant point of contact between the monks and laity, and continue to play an important role in lay religious life today.

===Today===
Until the early 20th century most bodies were buried and cremation was limited to the wealthy. Cremation became more common after [[World War II]] due to its efficiency and cleanliness; in fiscal 2009, 99.9% of Japanese bodies were cremated, and some local governments ban burials.&lt;ref name="wsj20110322"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703858404576214361499201024 | title=After Flood, Deaths Overpower Ritual | accessdate=March 27, 2011 |author1=Wakabayashi, Daisuke |author2=Sekiguchi, Toko | date=2011-03-22 | publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a break of tradition from the early [[Edo period]] to align with modernity, it has been decided that [[Emperor Akihito]] and [[Empress Michiko]] will be cremated after their death instead of ritual burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/11/14/national/emperor-empress-plan-to-be-cremated/#.Uo2fuJGPHAY|title=Emperor, Empress plan to be cremated|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Lady Rokujō'''|六条御息所|Rokujō no Miyasundokoro}} is a fictional character in ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (''Genji Monogatari''). She is the widow of Prince Zembo and a longtime mistress of [[Hikaru Genji|Genji]]. She is named after her residence, which was located on the Sixth Street (''Rokujō'') of the capital city [[Heian-kyō]]. She has great pride, and her jealousy is so strong that subconsciously her ''[[ikiryō]]'' (wandering spirit) kills Yugao and [[Aoi no Ue|Lady Aoi]], and attacks [[Murasaki]].

{{Political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Legal anthropology''', also known as the '''anthropology of laws''', is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] which specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenhouse, Carol J. |title=Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell UP |year=1986 |pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questions that Legal Anthropologists seek to answer concern how is [[law]] present in cultures? How does it manifest? How may anthropologists contribute to understandings of law?

Earlier legal anthropological research focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.  [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s 1926 work, ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'', explored law, order, crime, and punishment among the [[Trobriand Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw 1985[1926] Crime and Custom in Savage Society. Totowa, New Jersey:  Rowman &amp; Allanheld.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English lawyer Sir [[Henry Maine]] is often credited with founding the study of Legal Anthropology through his book ''[[Ancient Law]]'' (1861), and although his evolutionary stance has been widely discredited within the discipline, his questions raised have shaped the subsequent discourse of the study. This ethno-centric evolutionary perspective was pre-eminent in early Anthropological discourse on law, evident through terms applied such as ‘pre-law’ or ‘proto-law’ and applied by so-called armchair anthropologists. However, a turning point was presented in the 1926 publication of ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'' by [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] based upon his time with the Trobriand Islanders. Through emphasizing the order present in acephelous societies, Malinowski proposed the cross-cultural examining of law through its established functions as opposed to a discrete entity. This has led to multiple researchers and ethnographies examining such aspects as order, dispute, conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation, in addition (and often antagonistically) to law-centred studies, with small-societal studies leading to insightful self-reflections and better understanding of the founding concept of law.

Legal anthropology remains a lively discipline with modern and recent applications including issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]], [[Islamophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=John R. |title=A New Anthropology of Islam |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world |year=2006 |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

==What is law?==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
Legal Anthropology provides a definition of law which differs from that found within modern legal systems. Hoebel (1954) offered the following definition of law: ''“A social norm is legal if its neglect or infraction is regularly met, in threat or in fact, by the application of physical force by an individual or group possessing the socially recognized privilege of so acting”''

Maine argued that human societies passing through three basic stages of legal development, from a group presided over by a senior agnate, through stages of territorial development and culminating in an elite forming normative laws of society, stating that ''“what the juristical oligarchy now claims is to monopolize the knowledge of the laws, to have the exclusive possession of the principles by which quarrels are decided”''

This [[evolutionary approach]], as has been stated, was subsequently replaced within the anthropological discourse by the need to examine the manifestations of law’s societal function. As according to [[Hoebel]], law has four functions:

1)	to identify socially acceptable lines of behaviour for inclusion in the culture. 
2)	To allocate authority and who may legitimately apply force.
3)	To settle trouble cases.
4)	To redefine relationships as the concepts of life change.

Legal theorist H. L. A. Hart, however, stated that law is a body of rules, and is a union of two sets of rules: 
# rules on conduct ("primary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
# rules about recognizing, changing, applying, and adjudicating on rules on conduct ("secondary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within modern English Theory, law is a discrete and specialized topic. Predominantly positivist in character, it is closely linked to notions of a rule-making body, the judiciary and enforcement agencies. The centralized state organisation and isolates are essentials to the attributes of rules, courts and sanctions. To learn more on this view, see Hobbes. 1651 Leviathan, part 2, chapter 26  or Salmond, J. 1902 Jurisprudence.

However, this view of law is not applicable everywhere. There are many acephelous societies around the world where the above control mechanisms are absent. There are no conceptualized and isolated set of normative rules – these are instead embodied in everyday life. Even when there may be a discrete set of legal norms, these are not treated similarly to the English Legal System’s unequivocal power and unchallenged pre-eminence. Shamans, fighting and supernatural means are all mechanisms of superimposing rules within other societies. For example, within [[Rasmussen]]’s work of Across Arctic America (1927) he recounts [[Eskimo]] nith-songs being used as a public reprimand by expressing the wrongdoing of someone guilty.

Thus, instead of focusing upon the explicit manifestations of law, legal anthropologists have taken to examining the functions of law and how it is expressed. A view expressed by Leopold Pospisil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pospisil, Leopold |title=The Anthropology of Laws: A Comparative Theory  |year=1974|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encapsulated by Bronislaw Malinowski:

''“In such primitive communities I personally believe that law ought to be defined by function and not by form, that is we ought to see what are the arrangements, the sociological realities, the cultural mechanisms which act for the enforcement of law”''&lt;ref&gt;(1934: Introduction to Hogbin, Law and Order in Polynesia).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, law has been studied in ways that may be categorized by as:

1) prescriptive rules
2) observable regularities
3) Instances of dispute.

==Processual paradigm: order and conflict==

Order and regulatory behaviour are required if social life is to be maintained. The scale and shade of this behaviour depends on the values and beliefs held by a society deriving from implicit understandings of the norm developed through socialization. There are socially constructed norms with varying degrees of explicitness and levels of order. Conflict may not be interpreted as an extreme pathological event but as a regulatory acting force.

This processual understanding of conflict and dispute became apparent and subsequently heavily theorized upon by the anthropological discipline within the latter half of the nineteenth century as a gateway to the law and order of a society. Disputes have become to be recognised as necessary and constructive over pathological whilst the stated rules of law only explain some aspects of control and compliance. The context and interactions of a dispute are more informative about a culture than the rules.

Classic studies deriving theories of order from disputes include Evans-Pritchard work Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande which focused upon functional disputes surrounding sorcery and witchcraft practices, or Comaroff and Roberts (1981) work among the Tswana which examine the hierarchy of disputes, the patterns of contact and the effect norms affect the course of dispute as norms important to dispute are rarely ''“especially organised for jural purpose”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1957:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:

[[Edmund Leach|Leach]], 1954. Political Systems of Highland Burma.
[[Fredrik Barth|Barth]], 1959. Political Leadership among Swat Pathans.

==Case study approach==

Within the history of Legal Anthropology there have been various methods of data gathering adopted; ranging from literature review of traveller/missionary accounts, consulting informants and lengthy participant observation.

Furthermore, when evaluating any research it is appropriate to have a robust methodology capable of scientifically analysing the topic at hand.

The broad method of study by legal anthropologists prevails upon the Case Study Approach first developed by Llewellyn and Hoebel in The Cheyenne Way (1941) not as ''“a philosophy but a technology”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Pospisil, 1973: 541).&lt;/ref&gt;

This methodology is applied to situations of cross-cultural conflict and the correlating resolution, which can have sets of legal notions and jural regularities extracted from them &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1965: pp. 41; Pospisil, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

This method may be safe-guarded against accusations of imposing western ideological structures as it is often an emic sentiment: for example,

''“The Tiv drove me to the case method…what they were interested in. They put a lot of time and effort into cases”''
&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1989: vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues of terminology and ethnology==

Regarding law, in Anthropology’s characteristically self-conscious manner, the comparative analysis inherent to Legal Anthropology has been speculated upon and most famously debated by [[Paul Bohannan]] and [[Max Gluckman]]. The discourse highlights one of the primary differences between British and American Anthropology regarding fieldwork approaches and concerns the imposition of Western terminology as ethnological categories of differing societies.&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each author’s uses the Case Study Approach, however, the data’s presentation in terms of achieving comparativeness is a point of contention between them.

Paul Bohannan promotes the use of native terminology presented with ethnographic meaning as opposed to any Universal categories, which act as barriers to understanding the true nature of a culture’s legal system.

Advocating that it is better to appreciate native terms in their own medium, Bohannan critiques Gluckman’s work for its inherent [[bias]].

Gluckman has argued that Bohannan’s excessive use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested that in order to further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of dispute facts and interrelations &lt;ref&gt;(Gluckman, 1965: 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison.

==Processes==

As disputes and order began to be recognised as categories worthy of study, interest in the inherent aspects of conflicts emerged within legal anthropology. The processes and actors involved within the events became an object of study for ethnographers as they embraced conflict as a data-rich source.

One example of such an interest is expressed by [[Philip Gulliver]], 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important. He examines the patterns of alliance between actors of a dispute and the strategies that develop as a result, the roles of mediators and the typologies for intervention.

==Key questions in legal anthropology==

*'''Issues of Legal Pluralism'''.
See ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15129292 Lyon, 2002] Local arbitration and conflict deferment in Punjab, Pakistan'' or ''Engel, D. 1980. Legal pluralism in an American community: perspectives on a civil trial court.''

*'''The legitimacy of Universal Human Rights'''.
Political anthropologists have had much to say about the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Original critiques, most notably by the AAA(American Anthropological Association), argued that cultural ideas of rights and entitlement differ between societies. They warned that any attempt to endorse one set of values above all others amounted to a new western imperialism, and would be counter to ideas of cultural relativism. Most anthropologists now agree that universal human rights have a useful place in today's world. Zechenter (1997) argues there are practices, such as Indian 'sati' (the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) that can be said to be wrong, despite justifications of tradition. This is because such practices are about much more than a culturally established world view, and frequently develop or revive as a result of socio-economic conditions and the balance of power within a community. As culture is not bounded and unchanging, there are multiple discourses and moral viewpoints within any community and among the various actors in such events (Merry 2003). Cultural relativists risk supporting the most powerfully asserted position at the expense of those who are subjugated under it.

More recent contributions to the question of universal human rights include analysis of their use in practice, and how global discourses are translated into local contexts (Merry 2003). Anthropologists such as Merry (2006) note how the legal framework of the UNDHR is not static but is actively used by communities around the globe to construct meaning. As much as the document is a product of western Enlightenment thinking, communities have the capacity to shape its meaning to suit their own agendas, incorporating its principles in ways that empower them to tackle their own local and national discontents.

Female genital cutting (FGC), also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation remains a hotly debated, controversial issue contested particularly among legal anthropologists and human rights activists. Through her ethnography (1989) on the practice of pharonic circumcision among the Hofriyat of Sudan (1989) Boddy maintains that understanding local cultural norms is of crucial importance when considering intervention to prevent the practice. Human rights activists attempting to eradicate FGC using the legal framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) as their justification, run the risk of imposing a set of ideological principles, alien to the culture attempting to be helped, potentially facing hostile reactions. Moreover, the UNDHR as a legal document, is contested by some as being restrictive in its prescription of what is and is not deemed a violation of a human right (Ross 2003) and  overlooks local customary justifications which operate outside of an international legalistic framework (Ross 2003). Increasingly (FGC) is becoming a global issue due to increased mobility. What was once deemed a largely African practice has seen a steady increase in European countries such as Britain. Although made illegal in 1985 there have as yet been no convictions and girls as old as nine continue to have the procedure. Legislation has now also been passed in Sweden, the United States and France where there have been convictions. Black, J. A. and Debelle, G. D. (1995) "Female Genital Mutilation in Britain" ''British Medical Journal''.

==Further information==
There are a number of useful introductions to the field of legal anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Moore, Sally Falk, ''Law and Anthropology: A Reader'', (edited), Blackwell, 2004, pp. 20-25, {{ISBN|1-4051-0228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Falk Moore]], a leading legal anthropologist, held both a law degree and a PhD in anthropology. An increasing number of legal anthropologists hold both [[juris doctor|JD]]s and advanced degrees in anthropology, and some teach in [[law school]]s while maintaining scholarly connections within the field of legal anthropology; examples include Rebecca French, John Conley, [[Elizabeth Mertz]], and [[Annelise Riles]]. Such combined expertise has also been turned to more [[applied anthropology|applied anthropological]] pursuits such as tribal advocacy and [[forensic anthropology|forensic ethnography]] by practitioners. There is a growing interest in the intersection of legal and [[linguistic anthropology]].

The '''''Madonna della Vittoria''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea Mantegna]]; the painting was executed in 1496.

==History==
On 6 July 1495 the French army of [[Charles VIII of France]], retreating from Italy after the [[Italian War of 1494–98|French Invasion of 1494-1498]], fought the Italic League at the [[Battle of Fornovo]].  The League, commanded by [[Francesco II Gonzaga]], Marquess of Mantua, was made up of numerous nation-states determined to prevent French dominance in Italy, and included the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Venice, Milan, and the Papal States controlled by [[Pope Alexander VI]].  Though the League lost more soldiers, they had also captured more soldiers than had the French; they also recovered nearly all of the plunder the French had taken over the course of their four-year invasion.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Particularly valued items included the helmet, sword, and seal of Charles VIII, as well as a book containing portraits of the ladies whose favors he had enjoyed during the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cesare Borgia|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|publisher=Macmillan|year=1976|isbn=0025144006|location=New York|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Francesco's absence from Mantua, Daniele da Norsa, a Jewish banker, had purchased a house in the city's San Simone quarter and replaced the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] which decorated its façade with his own coat of arms. The regent, [[Sigismondo Gonzaga]], ordered him to restore the depiction. Although Daniele agreed to do so, the populace, inflamed by anti-semitic feeling, destroyed his house.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Mantegna, madonna della vittoria, dettaglio 03, francesco Gonzaga.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Detail of Francesco Gonzaga]]
When Francesco returned, he forced Daniele to fund a chapel and a devotional painting. The painting was to be executed by the Mantuan court painter, Mantegna, and was inaugurated in 1496 on the anniversary of the duke's victory at Fornovo. The work was placed in the church of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria (Mantua)|Santa Maria della Vittoria]], which had been constructed over the ruins of Daniele da Norsa's house.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The painting was one of the works looted by the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic invasion of Italy]], and by 1798 was being exhibited in the [[Louvre]]. The painting was never returned; the given excuse was that its large size made the transport difficult. The presence of a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] in the painting is being investigated by historians as it may have implications on our understanding of 15th-century trading networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.melbourne.edu/news/aussie-bird-renaissance-artwork-forces-history-rethink "Aussie bird in Renaissance artwork forces history rethink"], melbourne.edu, 19 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
The altarpiece shows Francesco Gonzaga paying homage to Mary, who sits on a high throne decorated with marbles [[intarsia]]s and [[bas-relief]]s. The base of the throne, with lion paws, has, within a medallion, the inscription "{{Lang|la|REGINA/CELI LET./ALLELVIA}}" (Queen of Heaven, rejoice, Alleluia); it lies on a circular basement with a bas-relief of the "[[Original Sin]]" and other stories from the [[Book of Genesis]] which are partly obscured by the praying figures. The throne's back has a large solar disc, decorated with weavings and [[Wikt:vitreous|vitreous]] pearls.

The child Jesus, who holds two red flowers (symbols of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]) and Mary look at Francesco Gonzaga, who is kneeling and has a grateful and smiling expression while receiving their blessing. The protection given to Gonzaga during the battle is also symbolized by Mary's mantle, which partially covers his head. Opposite to the donor are [[St. John the Baptist]] with a cross featuring the usual [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] saying "{{Lang|la|ECCE/[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|AGNVS/DEI]] ECCE/Q[VI] TOLL/IT P[ECCATA] M[VNDI]}}" (Behold the [[Lamb of God]], which takes away the sins of the world), and his mother, [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|St. Elizabeth]], protector of [[Isabella d'Este]], wife of Francesco Gonzaga. The choice of St. Elizabeth in the place of a patron may have been chosen as a message of judgement to the Norsa who were made to pay for the work as a penalty for removing an image of the Madonna from their home.  Unlike the Norsa, St. Elizabeth who is represented as a Jewess in a yellow turban, was said to be the first to recognize the sanctity of Mary.&lt;ref name="The Yellow Turban: Unraveling Andrea Mantegna's Enigmatic Representation of the Jewish Woman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yarmo|first1=Leslie|title=Associate Professor|url=https://www.academia.edu/24345342/The_Yellow_Turban_Unraveling_Andrea_Mantegnas_Enigmatic_Representation_of_the_Jewish_Woman|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Casa Editrice La Giuntina.|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the sides are two couples of standing saints: in the foreground are two military saints, the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]] with a sword and [[St. Longinus]] with a broken spear, donning richly decorated armors; behind them are [[St. Andrew]], patron saint of Mantua, with a long stick with the cross and [[St. George]], another military saint, with a helmet and a long red lance.

The scene is set in an [[apse]] formed by a [[pergola]] of leaves, flowers and fruits, with several birds; the pergola's frame has at the top a shell (an attribute of the Virgin as new [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), from which hang threads of [[coral]] pearls and [[rock crystal]], as well as a large piece of red coral, another hint to the Passion of Jesus. The [[parrot]] is a comment on the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Lajos Kalmár: "Der intellektuelle Hintergrund der Vogeldarstellungen der [[Victorinus]]-[[Corvina]].

'''Mani stones''' are stone plates, rocks and/or pebbles, inscribed with the six syllabled [[mantra]] of [[Avalokiteshvara]]&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/mani-stone.htm Mani Stone]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Om mani padme hum]], hence the name "Mani stone"), as a form of [[prayer]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The term Mani stone may also be used in a loose sense to refer to stones on which any mantra or devotional designs (such as [[ashtamangala]]) are inscribed. Mani stones are intentionally placed along the roadsides and rivers&lt;ref name="travel"/&gt; or placed together to form mounds&lt;ref name="travel"/&gt; or [[cairn]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/m/mani_stone.aspx Mani stone at the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes long walls, as an offering to spirits of place or ''[[genius loci]]''. Creating and carving mani stones as devotional or intentional [[process art]] is a traditional [[sadhana]] of piety to [[yidam]]. Mani stones are a form of devotional [[cintamani]].

==Mani walls==
Along the paths of regions under the influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the traveller is often confronted with Mani walls.&lt;ref name="trip"&gt;[http://www.tibettrip.com/features/religion/mani_stone.htm Tibet Trip]&lt;/ref&gt; These stone structures are a compilation intricately carved stone tablets, most with the inscription "[[Om Mani Padme Hum]]"&lt;ref name="trip"/&gt; which loosely translates to "Hail to the jewel in the lotus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/meaning-of-om-mani-padme-hung.htm Dharma-Haven]&lt;/ref&gt; These walls should be passed or circumvented from the left side, the clockwise direction in which the earth and the universe revolve, according to [[Buddhist]] doctrine.

They are sometimes close to a temple or [[chorten]], sometimes completely isolated and range from a few metres to a kilometre long and one to two metres high. They are built of rubble and sand and faced with mani stones engraved in the elegant Tibetan script.&lt;ref&gt;Rizvi, Janet. 1998. ''Ladakh, Crossroads of High Asia''. Oxford University Press. 1st edition 1963. 2nd revised edition 1996. Oxford India Paperbacks 1998. 3rd impression 2001.  pg. 205. {{ISBN|0-19-564546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepal==
[[File:Prayer stones Nepal.jpg|thumb|Prayer stones, [[Nepal]].]]
The same type of Mani stones can be seen in neighbouring [[Nepal]], where Buddhism is also widely practised. Large examples of Mani stones resembling tablets carved out of the sides of rock formations are in locations throughout the Nepali areas of the Himalayas, such as [[Namche Bazar]]. Mani stone walls are most numerous in the high country of the [[Khumbu]]. The [[mantra]] of [[Avalokiteshvara]] is also a common design on [[prayer wheels]] and [[prayer flags]] in Nepal.

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2017}}

===Journalism===
Moore dropped out of the [[University of Michigan–Flint]] following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper ''[[The Michigan Times]]''). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine ''The Flint Voice'', which soon changed its name to ''The Michigan Voice'' as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar [[Harry Chapin]] is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin's dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Chapin ended subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVAfCMpets |title=Michael Moore on how Harry Chapin helped found the magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1986, when Moore became the editor of [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']], a liberal political magazine, ''The Michigan Voice'' was shut down by the investors and he moved to California.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Michael Moore 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) color.jpg|thumb|Moore at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2009]]
After four months at ''Mother Jones'', Moore was fired. [[Matt Labash]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported this was for refusing to print an article by [[Paul Berman]] that was critical of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] human rights record in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Emily |title=Michael Moore: a biography |year=2005 |publisher=ECW Press |location=47–54 |isbn=1-55022-699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. "The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, Alexander. "Beat The Devil: Michael meets Mr. Jones", ''[[The Nation]]'', September 13, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore believes that ''Mother Jones'' fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of [[Flint, Michigan]]. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker [[Ben Hamper]] (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Labash |first1=Matt |title=Michael Moore, One-Trick Phony |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/michael-moore-one-trick-phony/article/5507 |website=The Weekly Standard |accessdate=October 7, 2018 |date=June 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing, producing and screenwriting===
====''Roger &amp; Me''====
The 1989 film, ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]'', was Moore's first documentary about what happened to [[Flint, Michigan]], after [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico, where the workers were paid much less. Since then Moore has become known as a critic of the [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] view of [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} "Roger" is [[Roger Smith (executive)|Roger B. Smith]], former CEO and President of General Motors. [[Harlan Jacobson]], editor of ''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in ''Roger &amp; Me'' to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Critic [[Roger Ebert]] defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Attacks on 'Roger &amp; Me' completely miss the point of the film |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=February 11, 1990 |publisher=Sun Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900211/COMMENTARY/22010306 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint''====
Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, ''[[Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint]]'', that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on ''Roger &amp; Me''. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan, resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Roger and Me' Revisited |author=Diane Katz |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=September 20, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Canadian Bacon''====
Moore's 1995 satirical film, ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'', features a fictional U.S. president (played by [[Alan Alda]]) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. It is noted for containing a number of Canadian and American stereotypes, and for being Moore's only non-documentary film. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor [[John Candy]] and also features a number of cameos by other Canadian actors. In the film, several potential enemies for America's next great campaign are discussed by the president and his cabinet. (The scene was strongly influenced by the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]].''{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}) The president comments that declaring war on Canada was as ridiculous as declaring war on international terrorism. His military advisor (played by [[Rip Torn]]) quickly rejects this idea, saying that no one would care about "a bunch of guys driving around blowing up rent-a-cars."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====''The Big One''====
Moore's 1997 film, ''[[The Big One (film)|The Big One]]'', documents the tour publicizing Moore's book ''[[Downsize This!]] Random Threats from an Unarmed American'', in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for outsourcing shoe production to [[Indonesia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====''Bowling for Columbine''====
Documentary ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' released in 2002 probes the culture of [[Gun violence in the United States|guns and violence in the United States]], taking as a starting point the [[Columbine High School massacre]] of 1999.

In the United States, it won the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Documentary Feature]].

====''Fahrenheit 9/11''====
Moore's next film, ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of [[George W. Bush]] and [[bin Laden family|Osama bin Laden]]. ''Fahrenheit'' was awarded the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'',&lt;ref name="cannes-2004.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4201423/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Fahrenheit 9/11 |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118184523/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4201423/year/2004.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top honor at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]]; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Moore later announced that ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' would not be in consideration for the 2005 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], but instead for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcast prior to Election Day. According to Moore, "Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/why-i-will-not-seek-a-best-documentary-oscar-im-giving-it-up-in-the-hopes-more-voters-can-see-fahrenheit-911 |title=Why I Will Not Seek a Best Documentary Oscar (I'm giving it up in the hopes more voters can see "Fahrenheit 9/11") |author=Michael Moore |date=September 6, 2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514042536/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/why-i-will-not-seek-a-best-documentary-oscar-im-giving-it-up-in-the-hopes-more-voters-can-see-fahrenheit-911 |archivedate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, ''Fahrenheit'' did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at {{convert|451|°F|°C}}. The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: "The temperature at which freedom burns."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

As of August 2012, ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=mojorank /&gt; In February 2011, Moore sued producers [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used "Hollywood accounting tricks" to avoid paying him the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12402807 |title=Film-maker Michael Moore sues Weinstein brothers |publisher=BBC |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/michael-moore-harvey-weinstein-fahrenheit-911-lawsuit-291581 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Matthew |last=Belloni |title=Michael Moore, Harvey Weinstein Settle 'Fahrenheit 9/11' Lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Moore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. ''[[Stupid White Men]]'' (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also "a book of political humor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110003233 Opinion Journal from ''The Wall Street Journal'':] Unmoored from Reality.

===Acting===
Moore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in ''[[Lucky Numbers]]'' (2000) playing the cousin of [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by [[John Travolta]]'s character. He also had a cameo in his ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in ''[[The Fever (2004 film)|The Fever]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Moore |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601619/ |website=IMDb |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the [[BBC]] television series ''[[TV Nation]]'', which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on [[NBC]] in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

His other major series was ''[[The Awful Truth (TV series)|The Awful Truth]]'', which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on [[Channel 4]] in the UK, and the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the [[Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award]] in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of ''The Awful Truth'', where he was also described as "muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Another 1999 series, ''[[Michael Moore Live]]'', was aired in the UK only on [[Channel 4]], though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to ''The Awful Truth'', but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Moore is slated to return to network television on Turner/TNT in February 2018 with a program called "Michael Moore Live from the Apocalypse".&lt;ref name="democracynow.org" /&gt;

Moore has directed several music videos, including two for [[Rage Against the Machine]] for songs from ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'': "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]" and "[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of "Sleep Now in the Fire", which was filmed on [[Wall Street]]; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rage-against-wall-street Green Left Weekly:] Rage against Wall Street.

Although Moore has been noted for his political activism,&lt;ref name=detnews /&gt; he rejects the label as redundant in a democracy: "I and you and everyone else has to be a political activist.

Moore was a high-profile guest at both the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] and the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], chronicling his impressions in ''[[USA Today]]''. He was criticized in a speech by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[John McCain]] as "a disingenuous film-maker". Moore laughed and waved as Republican attendees jeered, later chanting "four more years".

Despite having supported [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Moore urged Nader not to run in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] so as not to split the left vote. On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Moore and [[Bill Maher]] knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33257-2004Aug1.html |title=Bill Maher: Back for More |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=August 2, 2004 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term "deserter" to describe then president [[George W. Bush]] while introducing Retired Army Gen. [[Wesley K. Clark]] at a Democratic Presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, "I know what you're thinking. I want to see that debate" between Clark and Bush – "the general versus the deserter". Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including ''The Boston Globe'' which had reported that "there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/george-w-bush-awol#article2 |title=George W.

Moore's 2011 claims that "Four hundred obscenely wealthy individuals, 400 little [[Mubarak]]s – most of whom benefited in some way from the multi-trillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of 2008 – now have more cash, stock and property than the assets of 155 million Americans combined" and that these 400 Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined" was found to be true by [[PolitiFact]] and others.&lt;ref name="PF-20110311"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kertscher |first1=Tom |last2=Borowski |first2=Greg |title=The Truth-O-Meter Says: '''True''' – Michael Moore says 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined |url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/10/michael-moore/michael-moore-says-400-americans-have-more-wealth-/ |date=March 10, 2011 |work=[[PolitiFact]] |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP-20110306"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Michael |title=America Is Not Broke |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/america-is-not-broke_b_832006.html |date=March 6, 2011 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MM-20110307"&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Moore |title=The Forbes 400 vs. Everybody Else |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/forbes-400-vs-everybody-else |date=March 7, 2011 |work=michaelmoore.com |deadurl=yes |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309211959/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/forbes-400-vs-everybody-else}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-20100922"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pepitone |first=Julianne |title=Forbes 400: The super-rich get richer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/22/news/companies/forbes_400/index.htm |date=September 22, 2010 |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chávez]]'s death in March 2013, Moore praised him for "eliminating 75 percent of extreme poverty" while "[providing] free health and education for all."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/06/hugo-chavez-hollywood-tribute Sean Penn, Michael Moore and Oliver Stone pay tribute to Hugo Chávez]".

In an op-ed piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on December 31, 2013, Moore assessed the [[Affordable Care Act]], calling it "awful" and adding that, "Obamacare's rocky start ... is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go." Despite his strong critique, however, Moore wrote that he still considers the plan a "godsend" because it provides a start "to get what we deserve: universal quality health care."&lt;ref name="NYT-20131231"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Michael |title=The Obamacare We Deserve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/opinion/moore-the-obamacare-we-deserve.html |date=December 31, 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNR-20140105"&gt;{{cite news |author=Noam Schieber |title=How Obamacare Actually Paves the Way Toward Single Payer |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116105/obamacare-will-lead-single-payer-michael-moore |date=January 5, 2014 |work=[[The New Republic]] |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Moore criticized [[Julian Assange]] and [[WikiLeaks]] for publishing [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|leaks from the DNC's emails]], saying: "I think WikiLeaks and I think Assange, they're essentially anarchists and they know, just like a lot of people voting for Trump know, that he's their human Molotov cocktail and they want to blow up the system.

Moore started the website TrumpiLeaks in May 2017, to encourage [[whistleblower]]s to provide information about [[Donald Trump]].

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''minoritized language''' is a language that is marginalized, persecuted or banned.&lt;ref name="LSE" &gt;[http://www.farocnse.com/documentos/planificacionLSE.pdf Planificación lingüística de la lengua de los signos español (LSE). Pág 63]&lt;/ref&gt; Language minoritization stems from the desire of large nations to establish a common language for commerce and government, or to establish homogeneity for ideological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Michael|year=2012|title=The End of Minority Languages?

Speakers of minoritized languages face various consequences, including reduced educational achievement and [[language shift]] in favor of the dominant language.

==Minority vs. minoritized==
A minoritized language differs from a [[minority language]], which means a language used by a small number of speakers,&lt;ref name="LSE"/&gt; or alternately to a language with lesser numerical or political power in a given context.&lt;ref name=spo&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spolsky |first1=Bernard |last2=Hult |first2=Francis M. |title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics |date=2010|p=266 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781444331042 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=minoritized+language#v=onepage&amp;q=minoritized%20language&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases in which a language is minoritized while being spoken by a majority of the population, such as some [[indigenous languages]] during the colonization of Africa, when colonial languages were favored.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061110222938/http://www.uzei.com/Modulos/UsuariosFtp/Conexion/archivos26A.pdf Anna Aguilar-Amat Castillo, Mohammed Pathé Sidibé, Joan Vilarnau Dalmaula.

=="Western language ideology"==
{{further|Linguistic imperialism}}
[[Nancy Dorian]], Kathryn A. Davis, and Prem Phyak have argued that there is a "Western language ideology" which applies [[social Darwinism]] to linguistics. This ideology allegedly idealizes [[monolingualism]], denies the [[benefits of multilingualism]], and disdains [[non-standard language varieties]]. Because such non-standard varieties are labeled deficient, a hierarchy of languages is created.{{efn|The prevailing view among contemporary linguists is that regardless of perceptions that a dialect or language is "better" or "worse" than its counterparts, when dialects and languages are assessed "on purely [[linguistics|linguistic]] grounds, all languages—and all dialects—have equal merit".&lt;ref name="on_language"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-12-99-on-language-dialects.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/F/Fox,%20Margalit|title=The Way We Live Now: 9-12-99: On Language; Dialects|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=12 September 1999|work=The New York Times|ref=harv|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=O'Grady |first1=William|last2=Archibald |first2=John |last3=Aronoff |first3=Mark |last4=Rees-Miller |first4=Janie |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=9780312247386|location=Boston|ref=harv|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|last1=Fasold|first1=Ralph W.|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|location=Cambridge|ref=harv|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some authors have drawn a connection between [[anti-immigration sentiment]], especially [[anti-German sentiment]], and [[English-only education]] in the US.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

In Europe, the process of minoritization, for example of the [[Celtic languages]] in Britain and [[Languages of France|minority languages in France]], was connected to the emergence of [[nationalist]] movements calling for the establishment of [[monolingual]], [[monocultural]] [[nation-states]] in the nineteenth century. The process of minoritization then led to [[language shift]] towards English and French.&lt;ref name=Hinton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hinton |first1=Leanne |last2=Huss |first2=Leena |last3=Roche |first3=Gerald |title=The Routledge Handbook of Language Revitalization |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317200857 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5zpODwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT375&amp;lpg=PT375&amp;dq=language+death+%22minoritization%22#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20death%20%22minoritization%22&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of minoritization==
The defining characteristic of minoritization is the existence of a power imbalance between it and the dominant language. One sign that a language is minoritized is if its speakers develop [[one-way bilingualism]]—they learn the [[dominant language]], but speakers of the dominant language do not learn the minoritized language. Another frequent symptom of minoritization is the restriction of the language to a limited range of [[language domains|domains]]. A language excluded from use in government and formal education might only be used at home and social situations. Because of the above, speakers of the minoritized language became a subset of speakers of the dominant language;&lt;ref name=Calaforra&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calaforra |first1=Guillem |title=Lengua y poder en las situaciones de minorización lingüística |url=http://www.uv.es/calaforr/CursColonia.pdf |publisher=Universidad Jagellónica (Cracovia) |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, all speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]] are also speakers of English, but most English speakers in Scotland do not speak Gaelic.&lt;ref name=MacAulay1992&gt;{{cite book |last=MacAulay |first=Donald|authorlink=Donald MacAulay |title=The Celtic Languages |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521231275  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3kIq1DYAkMC&amp;pg=PA141|p=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, speakers of a dominant language can carry out all functions of daily life using their native language.&lt;ref name="Calaforra" /&gt; 

Speakers of the dominant language typically use the greater [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] of the dominant language to prevent speakers of the minoritized language from changing the situation to one more favorable to the minoritized language. They use "[[amnesia (sociology)|amnesia]]" and "[[normalization (sociology)|normalization]]" to confuse the reality with what should be, and therefore legitimize the situation in which some languages are minoritized. For example, many "liberal" criticisms of [[language planning]] for minoritized language communities assert that intervention in favor of minoritized languages is equivalent to the policies that caused the language to become minoritized in the first place, such as linguistic legislation, elitism, exclusion of minoritized languages from formal education, and even [[forced population transfer]].&lt;ref name="Calaforra" /&gt;

==Consequences==
In ''Engaged Language Policy and Practices'', the authors cite three studies that have shown that students' academic achievement suffers if policies are implemented that minoritize their native language. [[Nancy Dorian]] has argued that the "Western language ideology" favoring monolingualism has fostered an "ideology of contempt" for minoritized languages.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Kathryn A.|p=19 |last2=Phyak |first2=Prem |title=Engaged Language Policy and Practices |date=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9781317442493 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nTQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22minoritized%22+invented#v=onepage&amp;q=%22minoritized%22%20invented&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of minoritization can lead to language shift in favor of the dominant language.&lt;ref name="Hinton" /&gt;

==Examples==
* In Spain, minority languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Euskera|Basque]] were persecuted during the [[Francoism|dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], due to a desire to eradicate them. The persecution was somewhat counterproductive, because it actually raised their prestige in [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque country]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aulaintercultural.org/article.php3?id_article=1922 |title=Lenguas en guerra |trans-title=Languages in War |first=Irene |last=Lozano |author-link=Irene Lozano |publisher=Aulaintercultural |language=Spanish |date=28 November 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012230845/http://www.aulaintercultural.org/article.php3?id_article=1922 |archive-date=12 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Russia, speakers of [[Ös language|Ös]] and [[Tofa language|Tofa]], were, respectively, ridiculed for or banned from speaking the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Languages Die|last=Harrison|first=David K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0195372069|location=|pages=20–21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Guarani language]] of [[Paraguay]], although spoken by a majority of nationals, is seen as a clear example of minoritized language, due to the socioeconomic and political prevalence of Spanish. Organisations such as [[Yvy Marãe'ỹ]] are advocating against this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanlorenzomuni.gov.py/application/files/3715/2829/5960/Minuta_que_declara_interes_Cultural_Municipal_el_Seminario_Internacional_de_Traduccion..pdf |title=International Seminar on Translation, Terminology and Minoritized Languages |publisher=Municipality of [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay]] |date=30 May 2018}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mocho’''' or '''Motozintleco''' is a moribund [[Mayan language]] spoken by the [[Motozintleco]] people of [[Chiapas]], Mexico. It is part of the western branch of Mayan languages. Mocho' speakers refer to their own language as ''qatô:k'' (spelled "Cotoque" in some older sources), which means 'our language'.&lt;ref name="Palosaari" /&gt; The closely related language Tuzanteco is often considered a dialect, but stands as a separate language.

Mocho' is considered a moribund language, with fewer than 30 currently recorded speakers, and no focus on passing down the language to children. Most speakers are bilingual in modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which is effectively displacing the Mocho' language in southern Mexico.

==Demographics==
Mocho is a moribund language with less than 30 fluent speakers as of 2011. All speakers are over the age of 70. As of 2009, there are fewer than 5 speakers of Tuzanteco, a closely related language variety.

The two dialects of Mocho' are spoken in two different villages: the Tuzantec dialect in [[Tuzantán]] (a town near [[Huixtla]], Chiapas), and the Motozintlec dialect in [[Motozintla]] de Mendoza. Historically, the two groups descend from a single population living in the region of [[Belisario Dominguez]] about 500 years ago. According to local legend, the split and migration was caused by a plague of bats. Speakers have also been reported in the nearby towns of Tolimán, Buenos Aires, and Campana. Palosaari (2011) describes the Motozintlec dialect.&lt;ref name="Palosaari" /&gt;

==Phonology==
Unlike most Mayan languages, Mocho' is [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]. Stress is regular and at the last syllable.

*Short vowels have level or rising pitch.
*Long vowels have tonal contrast, with falling pitch found only in stressed syllables. Stressed plain long vowels have a rising pitch or a level high pitch.

In Mocho', Proto-Mayan *j [x] and *h [h] have merged to /j/ in Motozintleco, while Tuzanteco preserves this distinction. Tuzanteco, however, has lost vowel length.

It is worth noting that pronunciation rules change compared to modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as ñ becomes an "ng" sound like in sing, and [[glottalization]] becomes important for many consonants.

'''Mormons''' are a [[Religious denomination|religious]] and cultural group related to [[Mormonism]], the principal branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] of [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] [[Christianity]], initiated by [[Joseph Smith]] in [[upstate New York]] during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844, the Mormons followed [[Brigham Young]] to what would become the [[Utah Territory]]. Today, most Mormons are understood to be members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Some Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in [[Utah]], and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States.

Mormons have developed a strong sense of commonality that stems from their doctrine and history. During the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location, and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced [[plural marriage]], a form of religious polygamy. Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church, and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]]. Mormons have [[Word of Wisdom|a health code]] which eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, coffee, tea, and other addictive [[Substance dependence|substances]]. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]] together beyond death. Mormons also have a strict [[law of chastity]], requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage.

Mormons self-identify as Christian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/01/Mormons-in-America.pdf Mormons in America: Certain in Their Beliefs, Uncertain of Their Place in Society], Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life 2012, p.10: Mormons are nearly unanimous in describing Mormonism as a Christian religion, with 97% expressing this point of view&lt;/ref&gt; although some non-Mormons consider Mormons non-Christian&lt;ref&gt;Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry (CARM), [https://carm.org/is-mormonism-christian Is Mormonism Christian?], accessed February 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and some of their [[Mormonism and Christianity|beliefs differ from mainstream Christianity]]. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the [[Book of Mormon]]. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], and accepting his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] through [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] such as baptism. They believe that Christ's church was [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restored]] through Joseph Smith and is guided by living [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets]] and [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]]. Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers.

Due to their high birth and conversion rates, the Mormon population has grown significantly in recent decades. The number of members in 1971 was 3,090,953&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.lds.org/ensign/1972/07/the-annual-report-of-the-church?lang=eng |title = The Annual Report of the Church – Ensign July 1972 – ensign |website = www.lds.org |access-date = April 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2018, there are 16,118,169 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="Statistics2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Statistics 2015"&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2015-statistical-report-april-2016-general-conference "2015 Statistical Report for 2016 April General Conference"], ''Mormon Newsroom'', April 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/22/mormons-more-likely-to-marry-have-more-children-than-other-u-s-religious-groups/ |title = Mormons more likely to marry, have more children than other U.S. religious groups |author =  |date = May 22, 2015 |website = Pew Research Center |accessdate = September 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[Mormon (word)|"Mormons"]] most often refers to members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) because of their belief in the [[Book of Mormon]], though members often refer to themselves as ''Latter-day Saints'' or sometimes just ''Saints''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/05/touchstone-of-truth?lang=eng |title = Touchstone of Truth |website = Ensign |date = May 1974 |author = John H.

The word "Mormon" is often associated with [[polygamy]] (or [[plural marriage]]),&lt;ref&gt;For many people, the mention of Mormons conjures up an assortment of contradictory images &amp;nbsp;.... The charge of practicing polygamy annoys many Mormons because it is so far out of date. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was a distinguishing practice of many early Mormons; however, it was renounced by the LDS Church in 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=2}}; {{cite web |url = http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1 |title = Official Declaration 1 |publisher = lds.org }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and commonality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=75,119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, Mormons have tried to establish what they call "[[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]", a utopian society of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;A Mormon scripture describing the ancient city of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] became a model for the Saints. Enoch's city was a Zion "because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there were no poor among them" {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=36–38}}; ([http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18?lang=eng#17 {{nowrap|Book of Moses 7:18}}]).&lt;/ref&gt;
Mormon history can be divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith]], (2) a "pioneer era" under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century. In the first period, Smith had tried literally to build a city called Zion, in which converts could gather. During the pioneer era, Zion became a "landscape of villages" in Utah. In modern times, Zion is still an ideal, though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than a central geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;"In Missouri and Illinois, Zion had been a city; in Utah, it was a landscape of villages; in the urban diaspora, it was the ward with its extensive programs." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|left|thumb|A stained glass window of [[Joseph Smith]]'s [[First Vision]]]]

Mormons trace their origins to the visions that [[Joseph Smith]] reported he had in the early 1820s while living in upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=1, 9}}; {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=9}}; {{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zx9qOay304C&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon |first = David |last = Persuitte |page = 30 |publisher = McFarland |date = October 2000 |accessdate = January 25, 2012 |isbn = 9780786484034 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Smith said [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] directed him to a buried book written on [[golden plates]] containing the religious history of an ancient people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith published what he said was a translation of these plates in March 1830 as the [[Book of Mormon]], named after [[Mormon (Book of Mormon)|Mormon]], the ancient prophet–historian who compiled the book. On April 6, 1830, Smith founded the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholars and eye-witnesses disagree as to whether the church was organized in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]] at the Smith log home, or in [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer Sr.]]. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=109}}; {{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23}} (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements).&lt;/ref&gt; The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to proselytize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=41}} (by the next spring the church had 1,000 members).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, the church moved to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] where missionaries had made a large number of converts&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=97}} (citing letter by Smith to Kirtland converts, quoted in {{Harvtxt|Howe|1833|p=111}});  {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith began establishing an outpost in [[Jackson County, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=154}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=162}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where he planned to eventually build the city of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]] (or the [[New Jerusalem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith said in 1831 that God intended the Mormons to "retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years." ([[Doctrine and Covenants]] 64:21); {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833, Missouri settlers, alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons, expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], where local residents were more welcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=222–27}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=137}} (noting that the brutality of the Jackson Countians aroused sympathy for the Mormons and was almost universally deplored by the media); {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=43–45}} (The Mormons were forced out in a November gale, and were taken in by Clay County residents, who earned from non-Mormons the derogative title of "Jack Mormons").&lt;/ref&gt;
After Smith led a mission, known as [[Zion's Camp]], to recover the land,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=141, 146–59}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he began building [[Kirtland Temple]] in [[Lake County, Ohio]], where the church flourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=101}}; {{Harvtxt|Arrington|1992|p=21}} (by summer of 1835, there were 1500 to 2000 Saints in Kirtland); Desert Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' p. 655 (from 1831 to 1838, church membership grew from 680 to 17,881); {{Harv|Bushman|2005|pp=310–19}} (The Kirtland Temple was viewed as the site of a new [[Pentecost]]); {{Harv|Brodie|1971|p=178}}. Smith also published several new [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] during the Kirtland era.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Missouri Mormons were later asked to leave Clay County in 1836, they secured land in what would become [[Caldwell County, Missouri|Caldwell County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=45}} (In December 1836, the Missouri legislature granted the Mormons the right to organize Caldwell County).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after the failure of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|church-sponsored anti-bank]] caused widespread defections,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=328–38}}; {{Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|p=221}} ("Ultimately, the rituals and visions dedicating the Kirtland temple were not sufficient to hold the church together in the face of a mounting series of internal disputes.")&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith regrouped with the remaining church in [[Far West, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1905|p=24}} (referring to the Far West church as the "church in Zion"); {{Harv|Bushman|2005|p=345}} (The revelation calling Far West "Zion" had the effect of "implying that Far West was to take the place of Independence.")&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall of 1838, tensions escalated into the [[1838 Mormon War|Mormon War]] with the old Missouri settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=357–64}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=227–30}}; {{Harvtxt|Remini|2002|p=134}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=97–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, the [[Lilburn Boggs|governor]] of Missouri [[Missouri Executive Order 44|ordered]] that the Mormons "must be treated as enemies" and be exterminated or driven from the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bushman|2005|p=367}} (Boggs' executive order stated that the Mormon community had "made war upon the people of this State" and that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace").  {{Harv|Bushman|2005|p=398}} (In 1976, [[Missouri]] issued a formal apology for this order) {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between November and April, some eight thousand displaced Mormons migrated east into [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=47}} ("the Saints, after being ravaged by troops, robbed by neighbors, and insulted by public officials from February to April, crossed over into Illinois").&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Preaching to the Indians by C.C.A. Christensen.png|thumb|Joseph Smith preaching to the [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox Indians]] who visited Nauvoo on August 12, 1841]]

In 1839, the Mormons purchased the small town of Commerce, converted swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River, and renamed the area [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=383–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and began construction of the [[Nauvoo Temple]]. The city became the church's new headquarters and gathering place, and it grew rapidly, fueled in part by converts immigrating from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=409}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=258, 264–65}}; {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=51}} (noting the city growth and missionary success in England).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Smith introduced temple ceremonies meant to [[Sealing (Mormonism)|seal]] families together for eternity, as well as the doctrines of eternal progression or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119}} (Smith taught that faithful Mormons may progress until they become co-equal with God); {{Harvtxt|Roberts|1909|pp=502–03}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=497–98}} (the [[second anointing]] provided a guarantee that participants would be exalted even if they sinned).&lt;/ref&gt; and plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Initially, Smith introduced plural marriage only to his closest associates.{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=334–36}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=437, 644}} The practice was acknowledged publicly in 1852 by [[Brigham Young]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith created a service organization for women called the [[Relief Society]], as well as an organization called the [[Council of Fifty]], representing a future [[theodemocracy|theodemocratic]] "Kingdom of God" on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quinn|1980|pp=120–122, 165}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=519–21}} (describing the Council of Fifty).&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith also published the story of his [[First Vision]], in which the [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Jesus|Son]] appeared to him while he was about 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=30}} The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, "[[Manuscript History of the Church]]" (1839); the first published account is [[Orson Pratt]], ''An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records'' (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's [[Wentworth letter|letter to John Wentworth]] in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', '''3''' (March 1842), 706–08.

Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suppression resulted in Smith being arrested, tried, and acquitted for "inciting a riot". On June 25, Smith let himself be arrested and tried for the riot charges again, this time in Carthage, the county seat, where he was incarcerated without bail on a new charge of treason. {{citation |contribution-url = http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4208 |contribution = Smith, Joseph: Legal Trials of Joseph Smith |first = Joseph I. |last = Bentley |authorlink =  |pages = 1346–1348 |editor1-last = Ludlow |editor1-first = Daniel H |editor1-link = Daniel H.

For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war, [[Brigham Young]] led the [[Mormon pioneers]] (constituting most of the Latter Day Saints) to a temporary [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|winter quarters]] in Nebraska and then, eventually (beginning in 1847), to what became the [[Utah Territory]].&lt;ref name="emigration-religious-freedom"&gt;In 2004, the State of Illinois recognized the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints as the "largest forced migration in American history" and stated in the adopted resolution that, "WHEREAS, The biases and prejudices of a less enlightened age in the history of the State of Illinois caused unmeasurable hardship and trauma for the community of Latter-day Saints by the distrust, violence, and inhospitable actions of a dark time in our past; therefore, be it RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NINETY-THIRD GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that we acknowledge the disparity of those past actions and suspicions, regretting the expulsion of the community of Latter-day Saints, a people of faith and hard work." {{cite web |url = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=3&amp;SessionID=3&amp;GA=93&amp;DocTypeID=HR&amp;DocNum=0793&amp;LegID=12984&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |title = Official House Resolution HR0793 (LRB093 21726 KEF 49525 r) |author = Illinois General Assembly |date = April 1, 2004 |website =  |publisher = }}; "The great Mormon migration of 1846–1847 was but one step in the Mormons' quest for religious freedom and growth." {{citation |url = http://www.nps.gov/mopi/historyculture/index.htm |title = Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail: History &amp; Culture |work = NPS.gov |publisher = [[National Park Service]] |accessdate = July 9, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Mormons began to construct a society in isolation, based on their beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=86}} ("Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Latter-day Saints found in the Great Basin the isolation that would enable them to establish a distinctive community based upon their own beliefs and values").&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative ethic that Mormons had developed over the last decade and a half became important as settlers branched out and colonized a large desert region now known as the [[Mormon Corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=84}} (From 1847 to 1857 ninety-five Mormon communities were established, most of them clustering around Salt Lake City); {{Cite journal |journal = Pacific Historical Review |volume = 8 |issue = 2 |title = The Mormon Corridor |last = Hunter |first = Milton |date = June 1939 |jstor = 3633392 |pages = 179–200 |ref = harv }}; {{Harvtxt|Shipps|1957|pp=83–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonizing efforts were seen as religious duties, and the new villages were governed by the Mormon [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] (local lay religious leaders).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=86–89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mormons viewed land as commonwealth, devising and maintaining a co-operative system of irrigation that allowed them to build a farming community in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=87–91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1849 to 1852, the Mormons greatly expanded their missionary efforts, establishing several [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]] in Europe, Latin America, and the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="ODea91"&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Converts were expected to "gather" to Zion, and during Young's presidency (1847–77) over seventy thousand Mormon converts immigrated to America.&lt;ref name=ODea91 /&gt; Many of the converts came from England and [[Scandinavia]], and were quickly assimilated into the Mormon community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=91–92}}; {{citation |url = http://welshmormon.byu.edu/ |title = Welsh Mormon History |work = WelshMormon.BYU.edu |publisher = [[BYU Research Institutes|Center for Family History and Genealogy]], [[Brigham Young University]] }} During the 1840s and 1850s many thousands of Welsh Mormon converts immigrated to America, and today, it is estimated that around 20 percent of the population of [[Utah]] is of Welsh descent.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these immigrants crossed the [[Great Plains]] in wagons drawn by oxen, while some later groups pulled their possessions in small handcarts.

In 1852, church leaders publicized the previously secret practice of [[plural marriage]], a form of [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=88}} (Plural marriage originated in a revelation that Joseph Smith apparently received in 1831 and wrote down in 1843.

By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the [[theocratic]] rule of the Utah Territory by Brigham Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Tullidge |first = Edward |authorlink = Edward Tullidge |title = History of Salt Lake City |url = https://archive.org/details/historyofsaltlak00tull |contribution-url = https://archive.org/stream/historyofsaltlak00tull#page/n155/mode/2up |contribution = Resignation of Judge Drummond |pages = 132–35 |place = Salt Lake City |publisher = Star Printing Company |year = 1886 |oclc = 13941646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] sent an army to Utah, which Mormons interpreted as open aggression against them. Fearing a repeat of Missouri and Illinois, the Mormons prepared to defend themselves, determined to torch their own homes in the case that they were invaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=101–02}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively peaceful [[Utah War]] ensued from 1857 to 1858, in which the most notable instance of violence was the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], when leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the killing of a civilian emigrant party that was traveling through Utah during the escalating tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=96–97}} (calling the Mountain Meadows massacre the greatest tragedy in Mormon history).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, Young agreed to step down from his position as governor and was replaced by a non-Mormon, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].&lt;ref&gt;To combat the notion that rank-and-file Mormons were unhappy under Young's leadership, Cumming noted that he had offered to help any to leave the territory if they desired. Of the 50,000 inhabitants of the state of Utah, the underwhelming response—56 men, 33 women, and 71 children, most of whom stated they left for economic reasons—impressed Cumming, as did the fact that Mormon leaders contributed supplies to the emigrants.

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other [[List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church presidents]], who resisted efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages.&lt;ref name="Bushman97"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' that religious duty was not a suitable defense for practicing polygamy, and many Mormon polygamists went into hiding; later, Congress began seizing church assets.&lt;ref name=Bushman97 /&gt; In September 1890, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice of polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{LDS|Official Declaration|od|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before Congress and issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]" calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] members found practicing polygamy, and today seeks actively to distance itself from "[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]" groups that continue the practice.&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word ''Mormon'' in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy: {{citation |url = http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/style-guide |title = Style Guide – The Name of the Church: Topics and Background |work = MormonNewsroom.org |publisher = LDS Church |accessdate = July 9, 2014 }}.

=== Modern times ===
{{Further|Mormonism as a world religion}}

During the early 20th century, Mormons began to reintegrate into the American mainstream. In 1929, the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio, becoming an asset for public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry, rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=22}}. "With the consistent encouragement of church leaders, Mormons became models of patriotic, law-abiding citizenship, sometimes seeming to "out-American" all other Americans. Their participation in the full spectrum of national, social, political, economic, and cultural life has been thorough and sincere".&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1920s and 1930s, Mormons began migrating out of Utah, a trend hurried by the [[Great Depression]], as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Mormons spread out, church leaders created programs that would help preserve the tight-knit community feel of Mormon culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to weekly worship services, Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]], a [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women organization]], church-sponsored dances, ward basketball, camping trips, plays, and [[LDS Seminaries|religious education programs]] for youth and college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Great Depression, the church started a [[LDS Humanitarian Services|welfare program]] to meet the needs of poor members, which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mtchoirandorchestra ConferenceCenter.jpg|left|thumb|The 360-member, all-volunteer [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]]]

During the later half of the 20th century, there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative, attempting to regain their status as a "peculiar people".&lt;ref&gt;The term ''peculiar people'' is consciously borrowed from [http://lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9?lang=eng#8 1 Peter 2:9], and can be interpreted as "special" or "different", though Mormons have certainly been viewed as "peculiar" in the modern sense as well. {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the 1960s and 1970s brought changes such as [[Women's Liberation]] and the [[civil rights movement]], Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values, the [[sexual revolution]], the widespread use of recreational drugs, [[moral relativism]], and other forces they saw as damaging to the family.&lt;ref&gt;"Developments mitigating traditional racial, ethnic, and gender inequality and bigotry were regarded in hindsight by most Americans (and most Mormons) as desirable &amp;nbsp;.... On the other hand, Mormons (and many others) have watched with increasing alarm the spread throughout society of 'liberating' innovations such as the normalization of non-marital sexual behavior, the rise in abortion, illegitimacy, divorce, and child neglect or abuse, recreational drugs, crime, etc." {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Partly to counter this, Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life, religious education, and missionary work, becoming more conservative in the process. As a result, Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he church appears to have arrested, if not reversed, the erosion of distinctive Mormon ways that might have been anticipated in the 60s." {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=140}}. "However, in partial contradiction to their public image, Mormons stand mostly on the liberal side of the continuum on certain other social and political issues, notably on civil rights, and even on women's rights, except where these seem to conflict with child-rearing roles." {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[black people]] have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith's time, before 1978, black membership was small. From 1852 to 1978, the LDS Church enforced [[black people and Mormonism|a policy]] that restricted men of black African descent from being ordained to the church's lay [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = All Abraham's Children: Changing Mormon Conceptions of Race and Lineage |first = Armand L. |last = Mauss |pages = 213–215 |publisher = University of Illinois Press |year = 2003 |isbn = 978-0-252-02803-8 |ref = harv }}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=111–12}} ("The origins of this policy are not altogether clear.

Mormon converts are urged to undergo lifestyle changes, repent of sins, and adopt sometimes atypical standards of conduct.&lt;ref name=Bushman47 /&gt; Practices common to Mormons include studying [[Religious text|scriptures]], praying daily, [[fasting]] regularly, attending Sunday worship services, participating in church programs and activities on weekdays, and refraining from work on Sundays when possible. The most important part of the church services is considered to be the [[Lord's Supper]] (commonly called [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]]), in which church members renew covenants made at [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lds.org/topics/sacrament |publisher = lds.org |title = Sacrament }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons also emphasize standards they believe were taught by [[Jesus Christ]], including personal honesty, integrity, obedience to law, chastity outside marriage and fidelity within marriage.&lt;ref name="StrengthofYouth"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lds.org/manual/for-the-strength-of-youth-fulfilling-our-duty-to-god |title = For the Strength of Youth: Fulfilling Our Duty to God |publisher = LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, around 13–14 percent of Mormons lived in Utah, the center of cultural influence for Mormonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://newsroom.lds.org/country/usa-utah |title = USA–Utah |author =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = LDS Newsroom |accessdate = November 11, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion in Utah|Utah Mormons]] (as well as Mormons living in the [[Intermountain West]]) are on average more culturally and/or politically conservative than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss often compares [[Salt Lake City]] Mormons to California Mormons from San Francisco and [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]]. The Utah Mormons were generally more orthodox and conservative. {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|pp=40, 128}}; {{Cite journal |url = http://pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/A-Portrait-of-Mormons-in-the-US--Social-and-Political-Views.aspx |title = A Portrait of Mormons in the U.S.: III.

(Nonetheless, whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U.S., Mormons tend to be more culturally and/or politically conservative than members of other U.S. religious groups.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/125021/mormons-conservative-major-religious-group.aspx |date = January 11, 2010 |title = Mormons Most Conservative Major Religious Group in U.S.: Six out of 10 Mormons are politically conservative |publisher = [[Gallup poll]] |first = Frank |last = Newport }}; {{Cite journal |url = http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1292/mormon-religion-demographics-beliefs-practices-politics |publisher = [[Pew Research Center]] |title = A Portrait of Mormons in the U.S |first = Allison |last = Pond |date = July 24, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Utah Mormons often place a greater emphasis on [[Mormon pioneer|pioneer]] heritage than international Mormons who generally are not descendants of the [[Mormon pioneers]].&lt;ref name="Thomas W.

Mormons have a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history.&lt;ref&gt;Early Mormons had practiced the [[law of consecration]] in Missouri for two years, in an attempt to eliminate poverty. Families would return their surplus "income" to the bishop, who would then redistribute it among the saints. Though initial efforts at "consecration" failed, consecration has become a more general attitude that underlies Mormon charitable works. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=36–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; LDS Church members have a responsibility to dedicate their time and talents to helping the poor and building the church. The church is divided by locality into congregations called "[[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]]", with several wards or branches to create a "[[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=53}} (The name "stake" comes from a passage in Isaiah that compares Zion to a tent that will enlarge as new stakes are planted); ''See [http://lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/33.20?lang=eng#19 {{nowrap|Isaiah 33:20}}] and [http://lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/54.2?lang=eng#1 {{nowrap|Isaiah 54:2}}]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of church leadership positions are [[Laity|lay]] positions, and church leaders may work 10 to 15 hours a week in unpaid church service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=35, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observant Mormons also contribute 10 percent of their income to the church as [[tithe|tithing]], and are often involved in [[LDS Humanitarian Services|humanitarian efforts]]. Many LDS young men, women and elderly couples choose to serve a [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]], during which they dedicate all of their time to the church, without pay.&lt;ref&gt;A full-time mission is looked upon as important character training for a young man. {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons adhere to the [[Word of Wisdom]], a health law or code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = Peggy Fletcher Stack |last = Stack |first = Peggy Fletcher |url = https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-08-31/national/35492011_1_drink-caffeine-lds-leaders-mormons |title = It's Official: Coke and Pepsi are OK for Mormons |agency = ([[Religion News Service]]) |newspaper = [[Washington Post]] |date = August 31, 2012 |accessdate = September 20, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; while encouraging the use of herbs, grains, fruits, and a moderate consumption of meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/89 |title = Doctrine and Covenants, section 89 |author =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Word of Wisdom is also understood to forbid other harmful and addictive substances and practices, such as the use of illegal drugs and abuse of prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/word-of-wisdom |title = Word of Wisdom |author =  |year = 2004 |website = True to the Faith |publisher =  |pages = 186–88 |accessdate = November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons are encouraged to keep a year's supplies that include a food supply and a financial reserve.&lt;ref&gt;February 2007 [http://www.providentliving.org/content/display/0,11666,7585-1-4081-1,00.html All Is Safely Gathered In: Family Home Storage] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons also oppose behaviors such as viewing pornography and gambling.&lt;ref name=StrengthofYouth /&gt;

The concept of a united family that lives and progresses forever is at the core of Latter-day Saint doctrine, and Mormons place a high importance on family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=59}} (In the temple, husbands and wives are [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]] to each other for eternity.

Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] typically name and [[baby blessing|bless their children]] shortly after birth to formally give the child a name. Mormon parents hope and pray that their children will gain testimonies of the "gospel"{{vague|What is a "testimony of the 'gospel' and how does one "gain" it?|date=May 2018}} so they can grow up and marry in temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=30–31}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons have a strict [[law of chastity]], requiring abstention from sexual relations outside opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage. All sexual activity (heterosexual and homosexual) outside marriage is considered a serious sin, with marriage recognized as only between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Chastity |website = True to the Faith |year = 2004 |url = http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/chastity |pages = 29–33 }}; {{Cite journal |url = http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/mormons-in-america-executive-summary.aspx |title = Mormons in America |publisher = Pew Research Center |date = January 2012 }} (79% of Mormons in the US say that sex between unmarried adults is morally wrong, far higher than the 35% of the general public who hold the same view).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage]]s are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Church members are encouraged to marry and have children, and Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. Mormons are opposed to abortion, except in some exceptional circumstances, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, or when the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lds.org/study/topics/abortion |publisher = lds.org |title = Topic: Abortion }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many practicing adult Mormons wear [[Temple garment|religious undergarments]] that remind them of [[covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] and encourage them to dress modestly. Latter-day Saints are counseled not to partake of any form of media that is obscene or pornographic in any way, including media that depicts graphic representations of sex or violence. Tattoos and [[body piercing]]s are also discouraged, with the exception of a single pair of earrings for LDS women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lds.org/manual/for-the-strength-of-youth-fulfilling-our-duty-to-god/dress-and-appearance |title = Dress and Appearance |website = For the Strength of the Youth |publisher = LDS Church |year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homosexual Mormons|LGBT Mormons]], or Mormons who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from homosexual relations and obey the law of chastity.&lt;ref&gt;Homosexual acts (as well as other sexual acts outside the bonds of marriage) are prohibited by the [[law of chastity]]. Violating the law of chastity may result in [[excommunication]]. {{cite web |url = http://www.lds.org/ensign/1998/11/what-are-people-asking-about-us |title = What Are People Asking about Us? |author = Gordon B.

Note that the categories below are not necessary mutually exclusive.

=== Latter-day Saints (the "LDS") ===
{{Anchor|LDS}}

Members of the [[LDS Church]], also known as Latter-day Saints, constitute over 95 percent of Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church claims a membership of over 15 million ({{cite web |url = http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2015-statistical-report-april-2016-general-conference |title = 2015 Statistical Report for 2016 April General Conference }}). Most other [[Brighamite|Brigham Young–lineage sects]] number in the tens of thousands. Historically, the [[Latter Day Saint  movement]] has dominated by the LDS Church, with over 95 percent of adherents. One denomination dominates the [[Prairie Saints|non-LDS Church section of the movement]]: [[Community of Christ]], which has about 250,000 members.)&lt;br /&gt;Also note the use of the lower case ''d'' and hyphen in "Latter-day Saints", as opposed to the larger "Latter Day Saint movement."&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of [[general authority|LDS Church leaders]]. However, several smaller groups substantially differ from "mainstream" Mormonism in various ways.

LDS Church members who do not actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called "[[Less-active Mormon|less-active]]" or "inactive" (akin to the qualifying expressions ''non-observant'' or ''non-practicing'' used in relation to members of other religious groups).&lt;ref name="Stack 2011-09-23"&gt;{{cite news |last = Stack |first = Peggy Fletcher |authorlink = Peggy Fletcher Stack |date = September 23, 2011 |title = Active, inactive – do Mormon labels work or wound? |url = http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/52631643-80/mormon-church-lds-says.html.csp |newspaper = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |accessdate = September 20, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity, but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services.&lt;ref&gt;Member activity rates are estimated from missionary reports, seminary and institute enrollment, and ratio of members per congregation – {{cite web |url = http://ldschurchgrowth.blogspot.com/2011/07/countries-of-world-by-estimated-member.html |title = Countries of the World by Estimated Member Activity Rate |author =  |date = July 11, 2011 |website = LDS Church Growth |publisher =  |accessdate = November 11, 2011 }}; See also: {{cite web |url = http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/latter-day-saint-social-life-social-research-lds-church-and-its-members/8-consequential-dim |title = The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity |author = Stan L.

=== Fundamentalist Mormons ===

Members of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]]; these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of [[plural marriage]]. There are thought to be between 20,000 and 60,000 members of fundamentalist sects, (0.1–0.4 percent of Mormons), with roughly half of them practicing polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Sonntag Bradley, "Polygamy-Practicing Mormons" in [[J. Gordon Melton]] and Martin Baumann (eds.) (2002).

In addition to plural marriage, some of these groups also practice a form of Christian [[communalism]] known as the [[law of consecration]] or the [[United Order]]. The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from all such polygamous groups, excommunicating their members if discovered practicing or teaching it,&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word ''Mormon'' in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy {{cite web |url = http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide |title = Style Guide |author =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = LDS Newsroom |accessdate = November 11, 2011 }}; The church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered – {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91}}; {{cite web |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25396937/ns/us_news-faith/t/mormons-seek-distance-polygamist-sects/ |title = Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year = 2008 |publisher = msnbc.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and today a majority of Mormon fundamentalists have never been members of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal = Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |url = https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V31N02_19.pdf |author = Quinn, Michael D. |issue = 2 |date = Summer 1998 |title = Plural Marriage and Mormon Fundamentalism |page = 7 |volume = 31 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal Mormons ===
{{anchor|Liberal Mormon}}

Liberal Mormons, also known as Progressive Mormons, take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture.&lt;ref name="Stack 2011-09-23" /&gt; They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance, but may not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true. For liberal Mormons, revelation is a process through which God gradually brings fallible human beings to greater understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.liberalmormon.net/501whl.shtml |title = LiberalMormon.net |accessdate = October 27, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Mormons place doing good and loving fellow human beings above the importance of believing correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://latterdaymainstreet.com/2010/09/21/bringing-back-liberal-mormonism/ |title = Bringing back Liberal Mormonism |author = Chris H |date = September 21, 2010 |publisher = Main Street Plaza |accessdate = October 27, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate context, members of small [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement#Liberal Mormon|progressive breakaway groups]] have also adopted the label.

=== Cultural Mormons ===

[[Cultural Mormon]]s are individuals who may not believe in certain doctrines or practices of the institutional [[LDS Church]] yet identify as member of the Mormon ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Thomas W. |date=1999 |title=From Racist Stereotype to Ethnic Identity: Instrumental Uses of Mormon Racial Doctrine |journal=Ethnohistory - Duke University Press |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=451–480|jstor=483199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stack 2011-09-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/886644501 |title=Mormons and American politics : seeking the promised land: Part I - Mormons as an Ethno-Religious Group |last=Campbell |first=David E. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2014 |isbn=9781139227247 |location=New York, NY |pages=1–2 |oclc=886644501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this is a result of having been raised in the LDS faith, or as having converted and spent a large portion of one's life as an active member of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.newordermormon.org/essays/faithful-unbelievers.php |title = New Order Mormon Essays: The Paradox of the Faithful Unbeliever |first = Peggy |last = Rogers |work = New Order Mormon, NewOrderMormon.org |publisher = Publisher is anonymous |accessdate = September 20, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the LDS church. In some cases they may not be members of the LDS Church.

== Beliefs ==
{{Main|Mormonism|Mormon cosmology}}

Mormons have [[Standard Works|a scriptural canon]] consisting of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the [[Book of Mormon]], and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]].  Mormons, however, have a relatively [[Continuous revelation|open]] definition of [[Religious text|scripture]]. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]], while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url = http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4172 |contribution = Scriptures: Authority of Scripture |pages = 1280–1281 |last = Jackson |first = Kent P. |authorlink = Kent P.

The [[Book of Mormon]] is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets, and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith's successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against, and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christus statue temple square salt lake city.jpg|thumb|Mormons see {{nowrap|[[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]]}} as the premier figure of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=8}} ("As the name of the church &amp;nbsp;... suggests, Jesus Christ is the premier figure.

The most common response from those surveyed was "Christian" or "Christ-centered".&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mormons believe in "a friendly universe", governed by a God whose aim it is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons have a unique perspective on the [[Plurality of gods|nature of God]], the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God,&lt;ref name="PMGpos"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Plan of Salvation |journal = True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference |year = 2004 |url = http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/plan-of-salvation |page = 115 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that God presented a [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a "fulness of joy".&lt;ref name=PMGpos /&gt; The most important part of the plan involved [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], the eldest of God's children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God, to conquer sin and death so that God's other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various [[Degrees of glory|kingdoms of glory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] such as [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptism]] and the [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|laying on of hands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=78}}; In Mormonism, an ordinance is a formal act, in which people enter into [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] with God. For example, covenants associated with baptism and the [[Eucharist]] involve taking the name of the Son upon themselves, always remembering him, and keeping his commandments; {{Cite journal |title = Atonement of Jesus Christ |journal = True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference |year = 2004 |url = http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/atonement-of-jesus-christ |page = 14 |ref = harv }};  {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=60–61}} Because Mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved, Mormons perform vicarious ordinances such as [[baptism for the dead]] on behalf of deceased persons. Mormons believe that the deceased may accept or reject the offered ordinance in the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mormons, a deviation from the original principles of Christianity, known as the [[Great Apostasy#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Great Apostasy]], began not long after the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name = PMG35&gt;{{Cite book |author = Missionary Department of the LDS Church |authorlink = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |title = Preach My Gospel |publisher = [[LDS Church]], Inc |year = 2004 |page = 35 |url = http://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/lesson-1-the-message-of-the-restoration-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ |isbn = 978-0-402-36617-1 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and other philosophies,&lt;ref name = GA2&gt;{{Cite book |last = Talmage |first = James E. |authorlink = James E.

Mormons believe that God [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restored]] the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that [[Angel#Latter Day Saints|angels]] such as [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Moses]], and [[Elijah]] appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the "only true and living church" because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Mormonism in America |url = http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/mormons-in-america-executive-summary.aspx |publisher = Pew Research Center |date = January 2012 }} (Mormons are nearly unanimous in describing Mormonism as a Christian religion, with 97% expressing this point of view); {{citation |author = Robinson, Stephen E. |date = May 1998 |url = http://www.lds.org/new-era/1998/05/are-mormons-christians |title = Are Mormons Christians? |publisher = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints |work = [[New Era (magazine)|New Era]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Romney's Mormon Faith Likely a Factor in Primaries, Not in a General Election |publisher = Pew Research Center |url = http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Romneys-Mormon-Faith-Likely-a-Factor-in-Primaries-Not-in-a-General-Election.aspx }} (About a third of Americans and half of evangelical Protestants view Mormonism as a non-Christian religion).&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth, doing good works, and having genuine value.&lt;ref&gt;"Have the Presbyterians any truth?

Though the LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president–prophet dictating revelations for the whole church, there is a bottom-up aspect as well. Ordinary Mormons have access to the same inspiration that is thought to guide their prophets, and are encouraged to seek their own [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons see Joseph Smith's [[First Vision]] as proof that the heavens are open, and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on "asking God" to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith's in response to prayers, but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the [[Holy Ghost]]. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=15, 35–35}} (Outside observers sometimes react to Mormonism as "nice people, wacky beliefs." Mormons insist that the "wacky" beliefs pull them together as a people and give them the strength and the know-how to succeed in the modern world).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''State Anthem of the Russian Federation'''" ({{lang-rus|Госуда́рственный гимн Росси́йской Федера́ции|r=Gosudárstvennyj gimn Rossíjskoj Federácii|p=ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnɨj ˈɡʲimn rɐˈsʲijskəj fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨj}})  is the name of the official [[national anthem]] of [[Russia]]. It uses the same music as the "[[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]]", composed by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexander Alexandrov]], and new lyrics by [[Sergey Mikhalkov]], who had collaborated with [[Gabriel El-Registan]] on the original anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/russia-national-anthem-of-the-russian-federation/ | title=Russia&amp;nbsp;— National Anthem of the Russian Federation | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=November 23, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721054654/http://www.nationalanthems.me/russia-national-anthem-of-the-russian-federation/ | archive-date=July 21, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1944, that earliest version replaced "[[The Internationale]]", as a new, more Soviet-centric, and Russia-centric Soviet anthem.  The same melody, but without lyrics mentioning dead [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] by name, was used after 1956. A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]] and more on the victory of [[communism]].

The [[Russian SFSR]] was the only constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] without its own [[National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics|regional anthem]]. The lyric-free "[[Patrioticheskaya Pesnya]]", composed by [[Mikhail Glinka]], was officially adopted in 1990 by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]]&lt;ref name="pravo.levonevsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr0606.htm |title=On the National Anthem of the Russian SFSR |work=Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR |date=November 23, 1990 |publisher=pravo.levonevsky.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512162358/http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr0606.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopravo.by.ru/fed1993/ch01/akt10443.shtm|title=On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation|work=Ukase of the President of the Russian Federation|date=December 11, 1993|publisher=infopravo.by.ru}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], by the [[President of the Russian Federation]], [[Boris Yeltsin]]. This anthem proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions.&lt;ref name="gbrussia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrussia.org/reviews.php?id=163|title=The Russian National Anthem and the problem of National Identity in the 21st Century|work=The Great Britain - Russia Society|publisher=gbrussia.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923021434/http://www.gbrussia.org/reviews.php?id=163|archivedate=September 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem, but none of the entries were adopted.

Glinka's anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, [[Vladimir Putin]], first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union]], with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics, eventually settling upon a new composition by Mikhalkov; according to the government, the lyrics were selected to evoke and eulogize the history and traditions of Russia.&lt;ref name="gbrussia"/&gt; Yeltsin criticized Putin for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem even though opinion polls showed that many Russians favored this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1059784.stm |title=EUROPE – Yeltsin attacks Putin over anthem |date=December 7, 2000 |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |location=England, United Kingdom |accessdate=September 30, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930215212/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1059784.stm |archivedate=September 30, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public perception of the anthem is mixed among Russians. A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the national anthem, and that 25% liked it.&lt;ref name='vciom09' /&gt;

==Historic anthems==
Before "[[The Prayer of Russians|The Prayer of the Russians]]" ({{Lang-rus|Моли́тва ру́сских|r=Molítva rússkikh}}) was chosen as the national anthem of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in 1816,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Голованова|Шергин|2003|pp=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; various church hymns and military marches were used to honor the country and the Tsars. Songs used include "[[Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble! (anthem)|Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!]]" ({{Lang-rus|Гром побе́ды, раздава́йся!|r=Grom pobédy, pazdaváysya!}}) and "How Glorious is our Lord" ({{Lang-rus|Коль сла́вен|r=Kolj sláven}}). "The Prayer of the Russians" was adopted around 1816, and used lyrics by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] set to the music of the [[United Kingdom|British]] anthem, "[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bohlman|2004|pp=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's anthem was also influenced by the anthems of France and the Netherlands, and by the British patriotic song "[[Rule, Britannia!]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Голованова|Шергин|2003|pp=127–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, Zhukovsky was asked to set lyrics to a musical composition by Prince [[Alexei Lvov]] called "The Russian People's Prayer", known more commonly as "[[God Save the Tsar!]]" ({{Lang-rus|Бо́же, Царя́ храни́!|r=Bóže, Carjá hraní!}}). It was well received by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], who chose the song to be the next anthem of Imperial Russia. The song resembled a hymn, and its musical style was similar to that of other anthems used by European monarchs. "God Save the Tsar!" was performed for the first time on 8 December 1833, at the [[Bolshoi Theater]] in [[Moscow]]. It was later played at the Winter Palace on Christmas Day, by order of Nicholas I. Public singing of the anthem began at opera houses in 1834, but it was not widely known across the Russian Empire until 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wortman|2006|pp=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[God Save the Tsar!]] was used until the [[February Revolution]], when the Russian monarchy was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Studwell|1996|pp=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the overthrow, in March 1917, the "[[Worker's Marseillaise]]" ({{Lang-rus|Рабо́чая Марселье́за|r=Rabóčaja Marseljéza}}), [[Pyotr Lavrov]]'s modification of the French anthem "[[La Marseillaise]]", was used as an unofficial anthem by the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. The modifications Lavrov made to "La Marseillaise" included a change in meter from 2/2 to 4/4 and music harmonization to make it sound more Russian. It was used at governmental meetings, welcoming ceremonies for diplomats and state funerals.&lt;ref name='Stites'&gt;{{Harvnb|Stites|1991|pp=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government in the [[1917 October Revolution]], the anthem of international revolutionary socialism, "L'Internationale" (usually known as "[[The Internationale]]" in English), was adopted as the new anthem. The lyrics had been written by [[Eugène Pottier]], and [[Pierre Degeyter]] had composed the music in 1871 to honor the creation of the [[Second Socialist International]] organization; in 1902, Arkadij Jakovlevich Kots translated Pottier's lyrics into Russian. Kots also changed the grammatical tense of the song, to make it more decisive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gasparov|2005|pp=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major use of the song was at the funeral of victims of the February Revolution in Petrograd. Lenin also wanted "The Internationale" to be played more often because it was more socialist, and could not be confused with the French anthem;&lt;ref name='Stites'/&gt; other persons in the new Soviet government believed "La Marseillaise" to be too bourgeois.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Figes|Kolonitskii|1999|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Internationale" was used as the state anthem of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] from 1918, adopted by the newly created [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in 1922, and was used until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volkov|2008|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the national anthem, created by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexander Alexandrov]], had previously been incorporated in several hymns and compositions. The music was first used in the Hymn of the [[Bolshevik]] Party, created in 1939. When the [[Comintern]] was dissolved in 1943, the government argued that "The Internationale", which was historically associated with the Comintern, should be replaced as the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union]]. Alexandrov's music was chosen as the new anthem by the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] after a contest in 1943. Stalin praised the song for fulfilling what a national anthem should be, though he criticized the song's orchestration.&lt;ref name='Fey'&gt;{{Harvnb|Fey|2005|pp=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Alexandrov blamed the problems on Viktor Knushevitsky, who was responsible for orchestrating the entries for the final contest rounds.&lt;ref name='Fey'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Shostakovich'&gt;{{Harvnb|Shostakovich|Volkov|2002|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; When writing the Bolshevik party anthem, Alexandrov incorporated pieces from the song "[[Life has become better#Song|Life Has Become Better]]" ({{Lang-rus|Жить Ста́ло Лу́чше|r=Žitj Stálo Lúčše}}), a musical comedy that he composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2003|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comedy was based on a slogan Stalin first used in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kubik|1994|pp=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 entries were submitted for the anthem contest, including some by famous Soviet composers [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Aram Khachaturian]] and [[Iona Tuskiya]].&lt;ref name='Shostakovich'/&gt; Later, the rejected joint entry by Khachaturian and Shostakovich became ''Song of the Red Army'',&lt;ref name='Shostakovich'/&gt; and Khachaturian went on to compose the [[Anthem of the Armenian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khachaturian.am/eng/works/music.htm|title=List of Works|accessdate=2009-12-18|work=Virtual Museum of Aram Khachaturian|publisher="Aram Khachaturian" International Enlightenment-Cultural Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandved|1963|pp=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an entry from [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov|Boris Alexandrov]], the son of Alexander. His rejected entry, "Long Live Our State" (Да здравствует наша держава), became a popular patriotic song and was adopted as the [[anthem of Transnistria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = С. | last = Константинов | title = Гимн&amp;nbsp;— дело серьёзное | date = 2001-06-30 | work = [[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]] | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pridnestrovie.net/nationalanthem.html | title = National Anthem | accessdate = 2010-07-18 | publisher = Government of the Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Respublica | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100802163942/http://pridnestrovie.net/nationalanthem.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate = 2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000 debate on the anthem, [[Boris Gryzlov]], the leader of the [[Unity (political party, Russia)|Unity faction]] in the Duma, noted that the music which Alexandrov wrote for the Soviet anthem was similar to [[Vasily Kalinnikov]]'s 1892 overture, "[[Bylina]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Гимн СССР написан в XIX веке Василием Калинниковым и Робертом Шуманом|date=2000-12-08|publisher=Rambler Media Group|url=http://lenta.ru/russia/2000/12/08/shuman/|work=Лента.Ру|accessdate=2009-12-18|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826065540/http://lenta.ru/russia/2000/12/08/shuman/|archivedate=August 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of the Soviet anthem mentioned this in the various debates held in the [[Duma]] on the change of anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referendym.narod.ru/gryzlov.htm|script-title=ru:Выступление Бориса Грызлова при обсуждении законопроекта о государственной символике Российской Федерации|accessdate=2009-12-18|last=Резепов|first=Олег|date=2000-12-08|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no evidence that Alexandrov consciously used parts of "Bylina" in his composition.

Another musical work has also been discovered, with identical or near-identical music, that long predates Alexandrov's 1943 involvement with the Anthem of the USSR. A Ukrainian Scouting (Plast) anthem from {{Circa|1912}}, with music composed by Yury Pyasetsky ({{lang|uk|Юрій Пясецький}}, ''Jurij Piasećkyj'') known as "Plastovy Obit" ({{Lang-uk|Пластовий Обіт|lit=The Plast Oath}}), to lyrics by Plast founder Oleksander Tysovsky ({{lang|uk|Олександр Тисовський}}, ''Oleksandr Tysovśkyj) has been noted by Plast members to bear an extremely close or identical resemblance to the later Russian/Soviet anthem. The music and words are found in various Plast handbooks and songbooks, and a performance of this song in 2012 can be viewed on YouTube. The first line reads: "V požežach vsesvitnych, u lunach kryvavych" ({{Lang-uk|В пожежах всесвітних, у лунах кривавих|lit=In the fires of the world, in the moon of the bloody}}). The Piasetsky-Tysovsky anthem actually glorifies the Ukrainian independence movement, which had the support of the Plast organization.&lt;ref&gt;Д-р О. Тисовський "Життя в Пласті" ("Life in Plast", handbook), various editions, 1961 and others; "Пластові пісні" ("Plast Songs"), various editions. A video of the song being performed is "100th Anniversary of the First Plast Obit celebrated in Montreal", which was posted on YouTube by Nestor Lewyckyj in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After selecting the music by Alexandrov for the national anthem, Stalin needed new lyrics. He thought that the song was short and, because of the [[Great Patriotic War]], that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] by the [[Red Army]]. The poets [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] and [[Gabriel El-Registan]] were called to Moscow by one of Stalin's staffers, and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov's music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but to find a way to change the refrains which described "a Country of Soviets". Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight. After a few minor changes to emphasize the Russian Motherland, Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montefiore|2005|pp=460–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Solomon|last=Volkov|title=Stalin's Best Tune|date=December 16, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/16/opinion/16VOLK.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a line about Stalin "inspir[ing] us to keep the faith with the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keep|Litvin|2004|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January&amp;nbsp;1, 1944 and became official on March&amp;nbsp;15, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=USSR Information Bulletin|journal=Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|year=1944|volume=4|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o_8qAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Soviet+anthem+1944&amp;dq=Soviet+anthem+1944&amp;cd=7|accessdate=December 18, 2009|publisher=Embassy of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics|author1=Soviet Union.

After Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet government examined his legacy. The government began the [[de-Stalinization]] process, which included downplaying the role of Stalin and moving his corpse from [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] to the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2000|pp=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the anthem lyrics composed by Mikhalkov and El-Registan were officially scrapped by the Soviet government in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wesson|1978|pp=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthem was still used by the Soviet government, but without any official lyrics. In private, this anthem became known the "Song Without Words".&lt;ref name='scl36'&gt;{{Harvnb|Ioffe|1988|pp=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhalkov wrote a new set of lyrics in 1970, but they were not submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet until May&amp;nbsp;27, 1977. The new lyrics, which eliminated any mention of Stalin, were approved on 1 September, and were made official with the printing of the new [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Soviet Constitution]] in October 1977.&lt;ref name="Golovanova150"/&gt; In the credits for the 1977 lyrics, Mikhalkov was mentioned, but references to El-Registan, who died in 1945, were dropped for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name='scl36'/&gt;

=="Patrioticheskaya Pesnya"==
{{Main|Patrioticheskaya Pesnya}}

With the [[fall of the Soviet Union|impending collapse of the Soviet Union]] in early 1990, a new national anthem was needed to help define the reorganized nation and to reject the Soviet past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kuhlmann|2003|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mike | last = Eckel | title = Yeltsin Laid To Rest In Elite Moscow Cemetery | date = 2007-04-26 | publisher = Associated Press | url = http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=117795 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130127215701/http://www.ksdk.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=117795 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-01-27 | work = KSDK NBC | accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], was advised to revive "God Save The Tsar" with modifications to the lyrics. However, he instead selected a piece composed by [[Mikhail Glinka]]. The piece, known as "[[Patrioticheskaya Pesnya|Patriotícheskaya Pésnya]]" ({{Lang-rus|Патриоти́ческая пе́сня|t=The Patriotic Song}}), was a wordless piano composition discovered after Glinka's death. "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya" was performed in front of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR on November&amp;nbsp;23, 1990.&lt;ref name='Service'&gt;{{Harvnb|Service|2006|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was decreed by the Supreme Soviet to be the new Russian anthem that same day.&lt;ref name="pravo.levonevsky" /&gt; This anthem was intended to be permanent, which can be seen from the parliamentary draft of the Constitution, approved and drafted by Supreme Soviet, Congress of People's Deputies and its Constitutional Commission (with latter formally headed by [[President of Russia]]). The draft, among other things, reads that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The National Anthem of the Russian Federation is the Patriotic Song composed by Mikhail Glinka. The text of the National Anthem of the Russian Federation shall be endorsed by the federal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL(1992)052-e|title=Draft Constitution of the Russian Federation|publisher=[[Venice Commission]]|format=PDF|date=13 November 1992|postscript=(as CDL(92)52). Article 130 (3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But conflict between President and Congress made passage of that draft less likely: the Congress shifted onto more and more rewriting of the [[1978 Russian Constitution]], while President pushed forward with new draft Constitution, which doesn't define state symbols. After [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] and just one day before the [[Russian constitutional referendum, 1993|constitutional referendum]] (i.e. on December&amp;nbsp;11, 1993) Yeltsin, then [[President of the Russian Federation]], issued a [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] on December&amp;nbsp;11, 1993, retaining "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya" the official anthem for Russia.,&lt;ref name="Golovanova150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Указ Президента Российской Федерации от 11.12.93 N 2127}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this decree was provisional, since the draft Constitution (which was passed a day later) explicitly referred this matter to legislation, enacted by parliament. According to Article 70 of the [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]], state symbols (which are an anthem, [[flag of Russia|flag]] and [[coat of arms of Russia|coat of arms]]) required further definition by future legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.gov.ru/eng/gov/base/54.html|title=Constitution of the Russian Federation|accessdate=2010-03-31|date=1993-12-12|publisher=Government of the Russian Federation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050854/http://www.government.gov.ru/eng/gov/base/54.html|archivedate=July 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was a constitutional matter, it had to be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Duma.&lt;ref name='cnnholycountry'&gt;{{cite news|title=Russians to hail their 'holy country' |date=2000-12-30 |publisher=CNN |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/12/30/russia.anthem/ |work=CNN.com |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203175534/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/12/30/russia.anthem/ |archivedate=February 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 1999, many votes were called for in the [[State Duma]] to retain "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya" as the official anthem of Russia. However, it faced stiff opposition from members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], who wanted the Soviet anthem restored.&lt;ref name='Service'/&gt; Because any anthem had to be approved by a two-thirds [[supermajority]], this disagreement between Duma factions for nearly a decade prevented passage of an anthem.

===Call for lyrics===
When "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya" was used as the national anthem, it never had official lyrics.&lt;ref name='franklin116'&gt;{{Harvnb|Franklin|Widdis|Jahn|Cross|2004|pp=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthem struck a positive chord for some people because it did not contain elements from the Soviet past, and because the public considered Glinka to be a patriot and a true Russian.&lt;ref name='Service'/&gt; However, the lack of lyrics doomed "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya".&lt;ref name='Sakwa'&gt;{{harvnb|Sakwa|2008|pp=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts were made to compose lyrics for the anthem, including a contest that allowed any Russian citizen to participate. A committee set up by the government looked at over 6000 entries, and 20 were recorded by an orchestra for a final vote.&lt;ref name='rianovosti'/&gt;

The eventual winner was Viktor Radugin's ''"Be glorious, Russia!"'' ({{Lang-ru|Сла́вься, Росси́я!|translit=Slávjsja, Rossíja!|italic=yes}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Бориса|last=Владимирова|title=Неудавшийся гимн: Имя страны&amp;nbsp;– Россия!|trans-title=Unsuccessful Anthem: Our State&amp;nbsp;— Russia!|date=2002-01-23|url=http://www.hymn.ru/anthem-russia-1991-proj-slavsya-russia.html|work=Московской правде|accessdate=2009-12-20|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601214931/http://www.hymn.ru/anthem-russia-1991-proj-slavsya-russia.html|archivedate=June 1, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the lyrics were officially adopted by Yeltsin or the Russian government. One of the reasons that partially explained the lack of lyrics was the original use of Glinka's composition: the praise of the Tsar and of the Russian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graubard|1998|pp=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other complaints raised about the song were that it was hard to remember, uninspiring, and musically complicated.&lt;ref name='zolotov'/&gt; It was one of the few national anthems that lacked official lyrics during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waxman|Ginor|Ginor|1998|pp=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only other wordless national anthems in the period from 1990 to 2000 were "[[My Belarusy]]" of [[Belarus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Korosteleva|Lawson|Marsh|2002|pp=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; (until 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.by/press15629.html|title=Указ № 350 ад 2 ліпеня 2002 г.

Before the official adoption of the lyrics, the Kremlin released a section of the anthem, which made a reference to the flag and coat of arms:

Yeltsin argued that Putin should not have changed the anthem merely to "follow blindly the mood of the people".&lt;ref name='BBC'/&gt; Yeltsin also felt that the restoration of the Soviet anthem was part of a move to reject post-communist reforms that had taken place since Russian independence and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name='Sakwa'/&gt; This was one of Yeltsin's few public criticisms of Putin.&lt;ref name='blomfield'/&gt;

The liberal political party [[Yabloko]] stated that the re-adoption of the Soviet anthem "deepened the schism in [Russian] society".&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news|title=Duma approves Soviet anthem|date=2000-12-08|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1060975.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet anthem was supported by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] and by Putin himself. The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990, the white-blue-red flag and the double-headed eagle coat of arms, were also given legal approval by Putin in December, thus ending the debate over the national symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bova|2003|pp=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all of the symbols were adopted, Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia's past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia's history. He also stated that, while Russia's march towards democracy would not be stopped,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|2001|pp=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the lives of their mothers and fathers bereft of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|2004|pp=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem's lyrics; athletes were only able to hum along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name='Sakwa'/&gt;

==Public perception==
[[File:Anthem-russia-2000-postage stamp 2001.jpg|thumb|alt=A postage stamp showing Cyrillic characters.|A 2001 stamp released by [[Russian Post]] with the lyrics of the new anthem]]
The Russian national anthem is set to the melody of the Soviet anthem (used since 1944). As a result, there have been several controversies related to its use. For instance, some—including cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]—have vowed not to stand during the anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yeltsin "Categorically Against" Restoring Soviet Anthem|journal=Monitor|date=2000-12-07|authors=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|volume=6|issue=228|url= http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=22623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Banerji'/&gt; Russian cultural figures and government officials were also troubled by Putin's restoration of the Soviet anthem, even with different lyrics. A former adviser to both Yeltsin and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the last [[President of the Soviet Union]], stated that, when "Stalin's hymn" was used as the national anthem of the Soviet Union, horrific crimes took place.&lt;ref name='Banerji'&gt;{{harvnb|Banerji|2008|pp=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 funeral of Yeltsin, the Russian state anthem was played as his coffin was laid to rest at the [[Novodevichy cemetery]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name='blomfield'&gt;{{cite news|first=Adrian|last=Blomfield|title=In death, Yeltsin scorns symbols of Soviet era|date=2007-04-26|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549789/In-death-Yeltsin-scorns-symbols-of-Soviet-era.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was common to hear the state anthem during state funerals for Soviet civil and military officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Last Honors Paid Marshal Shaposhnikov|journal=USSR Information Bulletin|year=1945|author=Embassy of the USSR|volume=5|issue=|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OAErAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Soviet+funeral+anthem&amp;dq=Soviet+funeral+anthem&amp;cd=6|accessdate=2009-12-19|publisher=Embassy of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics}}&lt;/ref&gt; honored citizens of the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Condee|1995|pp=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet leaders, as was the case for [[Alexei Kosygin]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scoon|2003|pp=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuri Andropov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andropov Is Buried at the Kremlin Wall|journal=The Current Digest of the Soviet Press|year=1984|volume=36|issue=7|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKWyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=funeral+anthem+Andropov&amp;dq=funeral+anthem+Andropov&amp;cd=1|accessdate=2009-12-19|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies|author1=Studies, Joint Committee on Slavic|author2=Societies, American Council of Learned|author3=), Social Science Research Council (U.S.)|author4=Studies, American Association for the Advancement of Slavic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Konstantin Chernenko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soviets: Ending an Era of Drift|date=1985-03-25|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964112-2,00.html|work=Time|page=2|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] felt that playing the anthem at Yeltsin's funeral "abused the man who brought freedom" to the Russian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Boris|last=Berezovsky|title=Why modern Russia is a state of denial|date=2007-05-15|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3639898/Why-modern-Russia-is-a-state-of-denial.html|work =Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government states that the "solemn music and poetic work" of the anthem, despite its history, is a symbol of unity for the Russian people. Mikhalkov's words evoke "feelings of patriotism, respect for the history of the country and its system of government."&lt;ref name='primorsky'/&gt;

In a 2009 poll conducted by the [[Russian Public Opinion Research Center]] and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall the words of the first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.&lt;ref name='vciom09'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wciom.com/index.php?id=61&amp;uid=323 | title = RUSSIAN STATE SYMBOLS: KNOWLEDGE &amp; FEELINGS | accessdate = 2015-01-27 | date = 2009-08-20 | publisher = Russian Public Opinion Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the previous year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center found out that 56% of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew the first words of the anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words.&lt;ref name="vciom09"/&gt;

In September 2009, a line from the lyrics used during Stalin's rule reappeared at the [[Moscow Metro]] station [[Kurskaya-Koltsevaya]]: "We were raised by Stalin to be true to the people, inspiring us to feats of labour and heroism." While groups have threatened legal action to reverse the re-addition of this phrase on a stone banner at the vestibule's rotunda, it was part of the original design of Kurskaya station and had been removed during de-Stalinization. Most of the commentary surrounding this event focused on the [[Government of Russia|Kremlin's]] attempt to "rehabilitate the image" of Stalin by using symbolism sympathetic to or created by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Osborn|title=Josef Stalin 'returns' to Moscow metro|date=2009-09-05|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/6140394/Josef-Stalin-returns-to-Moscow-metro.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist Party strongly supported the restoration of Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, [[Boris Kashin]], a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated for the removal of any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by [[Alexander Nikonov]], a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state.&lt;ref name="interfax-religion1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Notorious journalist backs up the idea to take out word "God" from Russian anthem|date=2010-03-30|publisher=Interfax|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=7085|work=Interfax-Religion|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000&amp;nbsp;[[rubles]]. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God Beats Communists in Russian National Anthem|date=2010-03-30|publisher=PRAVDA.Ru|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/kremlin/31-03-2010/112797-russia_anthem-0|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikonov asked the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.&lt;ref name="interfax-religion1"/&gt;

==Regulations==
[[File:Federal Constitutional Law - On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation.djvu|alt=A djvu file containing the Federal law of 25 December 2000 on the national anthem of Russia|thumb|right|Federal law of 25 December 2000 on the national anthem of Russia]]
Regulations for the performance of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000. While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] parade in Moscow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia marks Victory Day with parade on Red Square|date=2005-05-09|publisher=People's Daily Online|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200505/09/eng20050509_184145.html|work=People's Daily|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures. When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)#List of Ministers of Defence|Defense Minister]] [[Anatoliy Serdyukov]] stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square, only an orchestra would be used because voices would be swallowed by the echo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defence Minister Commands 'Onwards to Victory!'|date=2009-05-07|url=http://government.gov.ru/eng/smi/press/381/|work=Rossiiskaya Gazeta|accessdate=2010-03-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817104925/http://government.gov.ru/eng/smi/press/381/|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthem is mandatory at the swearing-in of the [[President of Russia]], for opening and closing sessions of the Duma and the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio at the beginning and end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 [[24-hour clock|hours]] and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on [[New Year's Eve]] after the [[New Year Address]] by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played ''officially'', everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.&lt;ref name='anthemlaw'&gt;{{harvnb|Federal Constitutional Law on the National Anthem of the Russian Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthem is performed in 4/4 ([[Time signature|common time]]) or in 2/4 (half time) in the key of [[C major]], and has a [[tempo]] of 76 beats per minute. Using either time signature, the anthem must be played in a solemn and singing manner (Russian: ''Торжественно and Распевно''). The government has released different notations for orchestras, brass bands and wind bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.kremlin.ru/gimn/|script-title=ru:Гимн Российской Федерации|accessdate=2010-01-18|year=2009|publisher=Official Site of the President of Russia|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ru/main/symbols/gsrf4_2.html|script-title=ru:Музыкальная редакция: Государственного гимна Российской Федерации|trans-title=Musical Notation&amp;nbsp;— National Anthem of the Russian Federation|accessdate=2010-01-18|year=2000|publisher=Government of the Russian Federation|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Russian [[s:Russian Federation. Law on Copyright and Neighboring Rights|copyright law]], state symbols and signs are not protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Part IV of Civil Code No. 230-FZ of the Russian Federation. Article 1259. Objects of Copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the anthem's music and lyrics may be used and modified freely. Although the law calls for the anthem to be performed respectfully and for performers to avoid causing offence, it does not define what constitutes offensive acts or penalties.&lt;ref name='anthemlaw'/&gt; Standing for the anthem is required by law but the law does not specify a penalty for refusing to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shevtsova|2005|pp=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Могучая воля, великая слава –
Твоё достоянье на все времена!

Припев:
:Славься, Отечество наше свободное,
:Братских народов союз вековой,
:Предками данная мудрость народная!
:Славься, страна! Мы гордимся тобой!

От южных морей до полярного края
Раскинулись наши леса и поля.
Одна ты на свете! Одна ты такая –
Хранимая Богом родная земля!

''Припев''

Широкий простор для мечты и для жизни
Грядущие нам открывают года.
Нам силу даёт наша верность Отчизне.
Так было, так есть и так будет всегда!

:''Bratskih narodov sojuz vekovoj,''
:''Predkami dannaja mudrostj narodnaja!''
:''Slavjsja, strana! My gordimsja toboj!''

Ot južnyh morej do poljarnovo kraja
Raskinulisj naši lesa i polja.
Odna ty na svete! Odna ty takaja –
Hranimaja Bogom rodnaja zemlja!

''Pripev''

Širokij prostor dlja mečty i dlja žizni.
Grjadušcije nam otkryvajut goda.
Nam silu dajot naša vernostj Otčizne.
Tak bylo, tak jestj i tak budet vsegda!

Wide spaces for dreams and for living
Are opened for us by the coming years
Our loyalty to our Fatherland gives us strength.
Thus it was, thus it is and always will be!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13377">The '''national colours of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Couleurs nationales du Canada}}) were declared by King [[George V]] in 1921 to be red and white{{sfn|Canadian Heritage:Official symbols of Canada|2009}} and are most prominently evident on the [[Flag of Canada|country's national flag]]. Red is [[Color symbolism|symbolic]] of England and white of France, the colours having been used representatively by those countries in the past.{{sfn|Canadian Heritage: National Colours - Red and White|2009}} The [[maple]] is one of the [[National symbols of Canada|national symbols]] and red is the first leaf colour after spring budding &amp; also the autumn colour of [[Maple leaf|maple leaves]].{{sfn|Canadian Heritage: The arms of Canada|2009}}

Canada's national colours can trace their history to the [[First Crusade]] of the 11th century, during which [[Normans|Norman]] nobleman [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] distributed red crosses to the crusaders he led, so that they could affix them to their clothing "as a distinguishing mark".{{sfn|Canadian Heritage:Official symbols of Canada|2009}} Thereafter, nations were identified by the colour of their cross, and in particular, England used a white cross on a red background and France a red cross on white.{{sfn|Canadian Heritage:Official symbols of Canada|2009}} Eventually, France and England agreed to exchange their colours{{fact|date=June 2018}}, and [[St George's Cross]] was adopted as an emblem of England. This was the flag used by [[John Cabot]] when he landed on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] on his second voyage in 1497 under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]].{{sfn|Canadian Heritage: You were asking...|2009}} The two nations would eventually explore [[North America]], where each claimed territory.

As a result of the [[proclamation]] of the [[Arms of Canada]] by King [[George V]] on 21 November 1921, red and white became Canada's official colours.{{sfn|Canadian Heritage:Official symbols of Canada|2009}} The proclamation stated "''a Royal helmet mantled argent doubled gules''" and "''a wreath of the colours argent and gules''",{{sfn|Canadian Heritage: The arms of Canada|2009}} in which ''[[argent]]'' refers to the colour white or silver, and ''[[gules]]'' to red, [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] used to [[Blazon|emblazon]] a [[coat of arms]].{{sfn|McCreery|2005|p=73}} In 1957, the Arms of Canada were modified—the maple leaves on the shield were changed from green to red "in recognition of Canada's official colours".{{sfn|Canadian Heritage: National Colours - Red and White|2009}} The proclamation accepts both colours for the maple leaves, stating "''three maple leaves conjoined on one stem proper''",{{sfn|Canadian Heritage: The arms of Canada|2009}} in which "proper" refers to the natural colour of the leaves, which is green in spring and summer, and red in autumn.

It was not until 1961, with the creation of [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|The Queen's Personal Canadian Flag]], that red and white became entrenched as the national colours.{{sfn|Tidridge|2011|p=222}}

==Reproduction==
For the [[Federal Identity Program]] operated by the [[Treasury Board Secretariat]] of the [[Government of Canada]], official and signage colours are specified in [[Specification (technical standard)|technical specification]] T-145.{{sfn|Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat: Colour Values|2012}}

The red colour is named ''FIP red'' and represented by the [[Web colors#Hex triplet|hexadecimal triplet]] ''FF0000'', the 8-bit per [[Channel (digital image)|channel]] [[RGB color model#Numeric representations|RGB value]] ''(255,0,0)'', the [[CMYK color model|CMYK color]] (0,100,100,0), or the [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone Color Matching System]] colour Pantone 032.{{sfn|Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat: Colour Values|2012}}{{sfn|Industry Canada|2009}}

A second red colour, known as ''safety red'', is also specified but not used for official symbols; it is represented by the hexadecimal triplet E8112D, RGB value (230,15,45), CMYK colour (0,90,75,0), or Pantone colour 185.{{sfn|Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat: Colour Values|2012}}

White is represented by CMYK colour white, and the de facto national colour black is represented as CMYK colour black; six more colours are defined for use by the government.{{sfn|Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat: Colour Values|2012}}

==Uses==

===National flag of Canada===
[[File:Flag of Canada.svg|thumb|right|alt=Two solid red vertical bars on the left and right, each one quarter of the width of the flag. The middle half is white, with an 11-point maple leaf at its centre, approximately 80% of the height of the flag stem to tip, and 80% of the width of the white background on which it rests.|The [[Flag of Canada]] consists of elements using only the national colours.]]
The national flag uses the national colours.{{sfn|Canadian Heritage:Official symbols of Canada|2009}} Its red-white-red pattern is derived from the flag of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]]{{sfn|Montgomery|2013}} and the [[Canada General Service Medal]] of 1899.{{sfn|Canadian Heritage:Official symbols of Canada|2009}}

===Federal government branding===
The national colours are used in federal government branding as part of the Federal Identity Program. This includes the use of the Canadian flag in the [[Federal Identity Program#Canada wordmark|Canada wordmark]], the "global identifier of the Government of Canada" specified in technical specification T-130.{{sfn|Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat: Canada Wordmark|2012}}

===Decorations===
The [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] ribbon consists of four red bars separated by equally spaced thin white lines.{{sfn|Department of National Defence|2004}} The [[Canada Medal]] instituted on 14 October 1943 was specified to have a ribbon in the national colours,{{sfn|McCreery|2005|p=73}} which was the same ribbon used for the Canada General Service Medal.{{sfn|Veterans Affairs Canada|2013}} The ill-fated medal was never awarded, and was abolished in 1966 with the introduction of the [[Order of Canada]],{{sfn|McCreery|2008}} which also has a red and white ribbon.

===Sport===
The [[Toronto Blue Jays]], a franchise in [[Major League Baseball]], honour [[Canada Day]] by wearing an [[Third jersey|alternate jersey]] instead of the team's usual [[Major League Baseball uniforms|uniform]].{{sfn|Creamer}} In the 1990s, the team would wear red [[baseball cap]]s,{{sfn|CNN Sports Illustrated|1999}} or a red uniform.{{sfn|Creamer|2005}} In 2012, the team wore a red uniform with white lettering.{{sfn|Creamer|2012}}

The Canadian national colours, and the de facto third colour black, are used prominently by [[ice hockey]] teams representing the nation, including the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|men's ice hockey team]], [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|men's junior ice hockey team]], [[Canada men's national under-18 ice hockey team|men's under-18 ice hockey team]], [[Canada men's national ice sledge hockey team|men's ice sledge hockey team]], [[Canada men's national inline hockey team|men's inline hockey team]], [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|women's ice hockey team]], and [[Canada women's national under-18 ice hockey team|women's under-18 ice hockey team]]. The logo of [[Hockey Canada]], the national governing body for ice hockey in Canada, is red, white, and black, though their specifications are different from those of the national colours.{{sfn|Hockey Canada}}

{{IPA notice}}

The sound system of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] resembles that of [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. There is considerable variation among the dialects, and all pronunciations are considered by official policy to be equally correct - there is no official spoken standard, although it can be said that Bokmål has an unofficial spoken standard, called '''[[Urban East Norwegian]]''' or '''Standard East Norwegian''' ({{lang-no|Standard Østnorsk}}), loosely based on the speech of the literate classes of the [[Oslo]] area. This variant is the most common one taught to foreign students.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=6–7}}

Despite there being no official standard variety of Norwegian, Urban East Norwegian has traditionally been used in public venues such as theatre and TV, although today local dialects are used extensively in spoken and visual media.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=7}}

The background for this lack of agreement is that after the dissolution of [[Denmark–Norway]] in 1814, the upper classes would speak in what was perceived as the [[Danish language]], which with the rise of [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] gradually fell out of favour. In addition, [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], not Oslo, was the larger and more influential city in Norway until the 19th century. See the article on the [[Norwegian language conflict]] for further information.

Unless noted otherwise, this article describes the phonology of '''Urban East Norwegian'''.

* {{IPA|/n, t, d/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] {{IPA|[n̻, t̻, d̻]}}, either [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n}}, {{IPA link|t}}, {{IPA link|d}}]}} or [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}]}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=22}}
* {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are aspirated fully voiceless {{IPA|[{{IPA link|p}}ʰ, {{IPA link|t}}ʰ, {{IPA link|k}}ʰ]}}, whereas {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} are unaspirated, either fully voiceless {{IPA|[{{IPA link|p}}˭, {{IPA link|t}}˭, {{IPA link|k}}˭]}} or partially voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b|b̥}}˭, {{IPA link|d|d̥}}˭, {{IPA link|ɡ|ɡ̊}}˭]}}. After {{IPA|/s/}} within the same syllable, only unaspirated voiceless stops occur.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=22}}
* {{IPA|/s/}} is dentalized laminal alveolar {{IPAblink|s̪}} or (uncommonly) non-retracted apical alveolar {{IPAblink|s̺}}.{{sfnp|Skaug|2003|pp=130–131}}
* {{IPA|/ʂ/}} is pronounced with protruded lips {{IPA|[ʂʷ]}}. The degree of protrusion depends on the rounding of the following vowel.{{sfnp|Popperwell|2010|p=58}}
* {{IPA|/h/}} is a (usually voiceless) fricative. The friction is normally glottal {{IPAblink|h}}, but sometimes it is dorsal: palatal {{IPAblink|ç}} when near front vowels, velar {{IPAblink|x}} near back vowels. It can be voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɦ}} ~ {{IPA link|ʝ}} ~ {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}} between two voiced sounds.{{sfnp|Vanvik|1979|p=40}}
* {{IPA|/ʋ, l, j, ɾ/}} are partially voiced or fully voiceless {{IPA|[{{IPA link|f}}, {{IPA link|l̥}}, {{IPA link|ç}}, {{IPA link|ɾ̥}}]}} when they occur after {{IPA|/p, t, k, f/}} (but not when {{IPA|/s/}} precedes within the same syllable). The flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} is also partially voiced or fully voiceless when it occurs postvocalically before {{IPA|/p, k, f/}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=75–76, 79}}
* The approximants {{IPA|/ʋ, j/}} may be realized as fricatives {{IPA|[{{IPA link|v}}, {{IPA link|ʝ}}]}}:{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=74}}{{sfnp|Vanvik|1979|p=41}}
** {{IPA|/ʋ/}} is sometimes a fricative, especially before a pause and in emphatic pronunciation.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=74}}{{sfnp|Vanvik|1979|p=41}}
** There is not an agreement about the frequency of occurrence of the fricative allophone of {{IPA|/j/}}:
*** {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} states that {{IPA|/j/}} is sometimes a fricative.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=74}}
*** {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}} states that the fricative variant of {{IPA|/j/}} occurs often, especially before and after close vowels and in energetic pronunciation.{{sfnp|Vanvik|1979|p=41}}
* {{IPA|/l/}} is in process of changing from laminal denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|l̪}} to [[Apical consonant|apical]] alveolar {{IPAblink|l|l̺}}, which leads to neutralization with the retroflex allophone {{IPA|[ɭ]}}. Laminal realization is still possible before vowels, after front and close vowels and after consonants that are not [[Coronal consonant|coronal]], and is obligatory after {{IPA|/n, t, d/}}. A velarized laminal {{IPAblink|ɫ|ɫ̪}} occurs after mid back vowels {{IPA|/ɔ, oː/}}, open back vowels {{IPA|/ɑ, ɑː/}}, and sometimes also after the close back vowels {{IPA|/ʊ, uː/}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=24–25}} However, {{Harvcoltxt|Endresen|1990}} states that at least in Oslo, the laminal variant is not velarized, and the difference is only between an apical and a laminal realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Endresen|1990|p=177}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɾ/}} is an voiced apical alveolar [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ|ɾ̺}}. It is occasionally trilled {{IPAblink|r}}, e.g. in emphatic speech.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=24}}
* Retroflex allophones {{IPA|[ɳ, ʈ, ɖ]}} have been variously described as apical alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n|n̺}}, {{IPA link|t|t̺}}, {{IPA link|d|d̺}}]}} and apical [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɲ|n̠}}, {{IPA link|t̠}}, {{IPA link|d̠}}]}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=22}}
* {{IPA|/ɽ/}} alternates with {{IPA|/ɾ/}} in many words, but there is a small number of words in which only {{IPA|/ɽ/}} occurs.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=24}}
* {{IPA|/ŋ, k, ɡ/}} are [[Velar consonant|velar]], whereas {{IPA|/j/}} is [[Palatal consonant|palatal]].{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=22}} 
* {{IPA|/ç/}} may be palatal {{IPAblink|ç}}, but is often [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] {{IPAblink|ɕ}} instead. It is unstable in many dialects, and younger speakers in Bergen, Stavanger and Oslo merge {{IPA|/ç/}} with {{IPA|/ʂ/}} into {{IPAblink|ʂ}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=23}}
* Glottal stop {{IPAblink|ʔ}} may be inserted before word-initial vowels. In very emphatic speech, it can also be inserted word-medially in stressed syllables beginning with a vowel.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=22–23}}

Most of the [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] (and [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]]) consonants are mutations of {{IPA|[ɾ]}}+any other [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]/[[dental consonant]]; rn {{IPA|/ɾn/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɳ]}}, rt {{IPA|/ɾt/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʈ]}}, rl {{IPA|/ɾl/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɭ]}}, rs {{IPA|/ɾs/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʂ]}}, etc. {{IPA|/ɾd/}} across word boundaries ([[sandhi]]), in loanwords and in a group of primarily literary words may be pronounced {{IPA|[ɾd]}}, ''e.g.'', {{lang|no|verden}} {{IPA|[ˈʋæɾdn̩]}}, but it may also be pronounced {{IPA|[ɖ]}} in some dialects. Most of the dialects in Eastern, Central and Northern Norway use the retroflex consonants. Most Southern and Western dialects do not have these retroflex sounds, because in these areas a [[guttural]] realization of the {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme is commonplace, and seems to be expanding. Depending on phonetic context [[voiceless uvular fricative|voiceless]] ({{IPA|[χ]}}) or [[voiced uvular fricative]]s ({{IPA|[ʁ]}}) are used. (See map at right.) Other possible pronunciations include a [[uvular approximant]] {{IPA|[ʁ̞]}} or, more rarely, a [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}. There is, however, a small number of dialects that use both the uvular {{IPA|/r/}} ''and'' the retroflex allophones.

The [[retroflex flap]], {{IPA|[ɽ]}}, colloquially known to Norwegians as ''tjukk l'' ('thick l'), is a Central Scandinavian innovation that exists in Eastern Norwegian (including ''[[Trøndersk]]''), the southmost Northern dialects, and the most eastern Western Norwegian dialects. It is supposedly non-existent in most Western and Northern dialects. Today there is doubtlessly distinctive opposition between {{IPA|/ɽ/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} in the dialects that do have {{IPA|/ɽ/}}, e.g. ''gard'' {{IPA|/ɡɑːɽ/}} 'farm' and ''gal'' {{IPA|/ɡɑːl/}} 'crazy' in many Eastern Norwegian dialects.  Although  traditionally an Eastern Norwegian dialect phenomenon, it was considered vulgar, and for a long time it was avoided. Nowadays it is considered standard in the Eastern and Central Norwegian dialects,{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=6–11}} but is still clearly avoided in high-prestige sociolects or standardized speech. This avoidance calls into question the status of {{IPA|/ɽ/}} as a phoneme in certain sociolects.

According to [[Nina Grønnum]], ''tjukk l'' in Trøndersk is actually a postalveolar ''lateral'' flap {{IPAblink|ɺ|ɺ̠}}.{{sfnp|Grønnum|2005|p=155}}

* Unless preceding another vowel within the same word, all unstressed vowels are short.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=19}}
* In unstressed syllables, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} tends to reduce to a simple schwa {{IPAblink|ə}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=20-21}}
* The phonemic status of {{IPAblink|æ}} and {{IPAblink|æː}} in Urban East Norwegian is unclear since these pattern as [[allophone]]s of, respectively, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} before the flaps {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and {{IPA|/ɽ/}}. However, there also are words in which {{IPA|/eː/}} is realized as {{IPAblink|eː}} despite the following flap, such as ''Per'' {{IPA|[peːɾ]}} 'Peter'. {{IPAblink|æ}} also occurs in the diphthongs {{IPA|[æɪ]}} and {{IPA|[æʉ]}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=14, 106}}
* Urban East Norwegian also features a few non-phonemic diphthongs, which are {{IPA|[œʏ, ɔʏ, æɪ, æʉ, ɑɪ]}}. {{IPA|[œʏ, ɔʏ, æɪ, ɑɪ]}} can be analyzed as sequences of {{IPA|/œ, ɔ, ɛ, ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} which is allophonically labialized to {{IPAblink|ɥ}} after rounded vowels. {{IPA|[æʉ]}} can be analyzed as a sequence of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} (which corresponds to the central {{IPAblink|ʉ̞|ʉ}}, not back {{IPAblink|ʊ͍|ʊ}}).{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=16–17, 19, 25}}{{sfnp|Vanvik|1979|p=22}}
** The second element of {{IPA|/ɛw/}} is often realized as labiodental {{IPAblink|ʋ}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=19}}
** Some speakers have an additional diphthong {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}} in their inventory which, like {{IPA|[ɔʏ]}} and {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}}, is restricted to loanwords. For such speakers, {{IPA|[æɪ]}} is best analyzed as {{IPA|/æ/}} + {{IPA|/j/}}, whereas {{IPA|/ɛj/}} is the phonemic representation of the marginal {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=19}}
** Another (very rare) diphthong is {{IPA|[ʉɪ]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/ʉj/}}), which appears only in the word ''hui'' ('haste').{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=19}}

The following sections describe each monophthong in detail.

====Symbols====
* The vowels {{IPA|/iː, yː, ʉː, eː, ɔ, æ, æː/}} as well as the {{IPAblink|ə}} allophone of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} are invariably transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|iː, yː, ʉː, eː, ɔ, æ, æː}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ə}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} or {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/uː, øː/}} are most often transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|uː, øː}}}},&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Krech et al.|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but {{IPA|/uː/}} may be transcribed with an obsolete {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɷː}}}} by older sources.&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} uses both {{angle bracket|{{IPA|øː}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɵː}}}} for {{IPA|/øː/}}. This article transcribes those vowels with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|uː, øː}}}}.
* {{IPA|/oː/}} is most often transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɔː}}}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Krech et al.|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet this article uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|oː}}}}, following {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}}.&lt;ref&gt;This article uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|oː}}}} because other mid vowels (that is, {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/øː/}}) are also transcribed with ''close-mid'' symbols. Urban East Norwegian {{IPA|/oː/}} is also never as open as {{IPAblink|ɔː}} as it has been variously described as mid {{IPAblink|o̞ː}} ({{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979|pp=13, 17}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005|p=4}}) and close-mid back {{IPAblink|oː}} ({{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=16–17}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The open back {{IPA|/ɑ, ɑː/}} are most often transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɑ, ɑː}}}},&lt;ref&gt;For example by {{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Krech et al.|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}} transcribes them with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|a, aː}}}}. This article uses the former set.
* The short close vowels {{IPA|/ɪ, ʏ, ʉ, ʊ/}} are transcribed with either {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɪ, ʏ, ʉ, ʊ}}}} or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|i, y, ʉ, u}}}}. The short {{IPA|/ʉ/}} is occasionally transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʉ̞}}}} or a non-IPA symbol {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ᵿ}}}} instead, whereas {{IPA|/ʊ/}} is transcribed with an obsolete symbol {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɷ}}}} in some older sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sources that use {{angle bracket|{{IPA|i, y, u}}}} include {{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} also uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|i, y, u}}}}, but admits that {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɪ, ʏ, ʊ}}}} is just as correct a transcription (see p. 11). Sources that use {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɪ, ʏ, ʊ}}}} include {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005}}. Some sources mix these sets, e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Krech et al.|2009}} uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|i, ʏ, u}}}}. The short close central vowel is transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʉ}}}} by most sources, but {{Harvcoltxt|Krech et al.|2009}} use a non-IPA symbol {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ᵿ}}}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} also mentions {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʉ̞}}}} as a possible transcription. Sources that use {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɷ}}}} for {{IPA|/ʊ/}} include {{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɪ, ʏ, ʉ, ʊ}}}}.
* The short mid front vowels {{IPA|/ɛ, œ/}} are transcribed with either {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɛ, œ}}}} or {{angle bracket|{{IPA|e, ø}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sources that use {{angle bracket|{{IPA|e, ø}}}} include {{Harvcoltxt|Vanvik|1979}}. Sources that use {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɛ, œ}}}} include {{Harvcoltxt|Kristoffersen|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Kvifte|Gude-Husken|2005}}. Some sources mix these sets, e.g. {{Harvcoltxt|Haugen|1974}} uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɛ, ø}}}} whereas {{Harvcoltxt|Krech et al.|2009}} uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|e, œ}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ɛ, œ}}}}.

====Phonetic realization====
* {{IPA|/ɪ, iː, ɛ, eː, æ, æː, ɑ, ɑː/}} are unrounded, whereas {{IPA|/ʏ, yː, ʉ, ʉː, ʊ, uː, œ, øː, ɔ, oː/}} are rounded:

==Accent==
[[Image:Map of the major tonal dialects of Norwegian and Swedish.png|frame|right|Map of the major tonal dialects of Norwegian and Swedish, from {{Harvcoltxt|Riad|2014}}.&lt;br /&gt;• Dark areas have a low tone in accent 2, whereas the light areas have a high tone in accent 2.&lt;br /&gt;• The isogloss marks the boundary between connective and non-connective dialects. East and north of it, all of the compounds get accent 2, whereas west and south of the isogloss, compounds vary in accent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that contrary to the information in the map, the dialects of [[Rogaland]], [[Aust-Agder]] and [[Trøndelag]] are not traditionally classified as East Norwegian, but as [[Vestlandsk|West Norwegian]], South Norwegian and [[Trøndersk]], respectively.]]

Norwegian is a [[pitch accent]] language with two distinct pitch patterns. They are used to differentiate polysyllabic words with otherwise identical pronunciation. Although difference in spelling occasionally allows the words to be distinguished in the written language (such as ''bønner''/''bønder''), in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike. For example, in most Norwegian dialects, the word {{lang|no|uttale}} ('pronounce') is pronounced using tone 1 ({{IPA|[ˈʉːttɑːlə]}}), while {{lang|no|uttale}} ('pronunciation') uses tone 2 ({{IPA|[²ʉːttɑːlə]}}).

There are significant variations in the realization of the pitch accent between dialects. In most of Eastern Norway, including the capital Oslo, the so-called low pitch dialects are spoken. In these dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]al nature (phrase accent), the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis/focus and which corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack [[tone (linguistics)|lexical tone]], such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the fall to utterance-final low pitch that is so common in most languages{{sfnp|Gussenhoven|2004|p=89}} is either very small or absent.

On the other hand, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The two tones can be transcribed on the first vowel as {{IPA|/ɑ̀/}} for accent 1 and {{IPA|/ɑ̂/}} for accent 2; the modern reading of the IPA (low and falling) corresponds to eastern Norway, whereas an older tradition of using diacritics to represent the shape of the pitch trace (falling and rising-falling) corresponds to western Norway.

Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in [[Old Norse]], and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.

=== Tonal accents and morphology ===
In many dialects, the accents take on a significant role in marking grammatical categories. Thus, the ending ''(T1)—en'' implies determinate form of a masculine monosyllabic noun ({{lang|no|båten}} 'boat', {{lang|no|bilen}}, 'car'), whereas ''(T2)-en'' denotes either determinate form of a masculine bisyllabic noun or an adjectivised noun/verb ({{lang|no|moden}} 'mature'). Similarly, the ending ''(T1)—a'' denotes feminine singular determinate monosyllabic nouns ({{lang|no|boka}} 'book', {{lang|no|rota}} 'root') or neuter plural determinate nouns ({{lang|no|husa}} 'houses', {{lang|no|lysa}} 'lights'), whereas the ending ''(T2)—a'' denotes the [[preterite]] of weak verbs ({{lang|no|rota}} 'made a mess', {{lang|no|husa}} 'housed'), feminine singular determinate bisyllabic nouns ({{lang|no|bøtta}} 'bucket', {{lang|no|ruta}} 'square').

In Eastern Norwegian the tone difference may also be applied to groups of words, with different meaning as a result. ''Gro igjen'' for example, means 'grow anew' when pronounced with tone 1 {{IPA|[ˈɡɾùː‿ɪjə́n]}}, but 'grow over' when pronounced with tone 2 {{IPA|[ˈɡɾûː‿ɪjə́n]}}. In other parts of Norway, this difference is achieved instead by the shift of stress ('''''gro''' igjen'' {{IPA|[ˈɡɾuː ɪjən]}} vs. ''gro i'''gjen''''' {{IPA|[ɡɾuː ˈɪjən]}}).

=== In compound words ===
In a compound word, the pitch accent is lost on one of the elements of the compound (the one with weaker or [[secondary stress]]), but the erstwhile tonic syllable retains the full length (long vowel or geminate consonant) of a stressed syllable.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=184}}

=== Monosyllabic tonal accents ===
In some dialects of Norwegian, mainly those from [[Nordmøre]] and [[Trøndelag]] to [[Lofoten]], there may also be tonal opposition in monosyllables, as in {{IPA|[bîːl]}} ('car') ''vs.'' {{IPA|[bìːl]}} ('axe'). In a few dialects, mainly in and near [[Nordmøre]], the monosyllabic tonal opposition is also represented in final syllables with secondary stress, as well as double tone designated to single syllables of primary stress in polysyllabic words. In practice, this means that one gets minimal pairs like: {{IPA|[hɑ̀ːnɪɲː]}} ('the rooster') ''vs.'' {{IPA|[hɑ̀ːnɪ̂ɲː]}} ('get him inside'); {{IPA|[brʏ̂ɲːɑ]}} ('in the well') ''vs.'' {{IPA|[brʏ̂ɲːɑ̂]}} ('her well'); {{IPA|[læ̂nsmɑɲː]}} ('sheriff') ''vs.'' {{IPA|[læ̂nsmɑ̂ɲː]}} ('the sheriff'). Amongst the various views on how to interpret this situation, the most promising one may be that the words displaying these complex tones have an extra [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]. This mora may have little or no effect on duration and dynamic stress, but is represented as a tonal dip.

Other dialects with tonal opposition in monosyllabic words have done away with vowel length opposition. Thus, the words {{IPA|[vɔ̀ːɡ]}} ('dare') ''vs.'' {{IPA|[vɔ̀ɡː]}} ('cradle') have merged into {{IPA|[vɔ̀ːɡ]}} in the dialect of [[Oppdal]].

=== Loss of tonal accents ===
Some forms of Norwegian have lost the tonal accent opposition. This includes mainly parts of the area around (but not including) Bergen; the [[Brønnøysund]] area; to some extent, the dialect of [[Bodø]]; and, also to various degrees, many dialects between [[Tromsø]] and the [[Russia]]n border. [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which have their main historical origin in [[Old Norse]], also show no tonal opposition. It is, however, not clear whether these languages lost the tonal accent or whether the tonal accent was not yet there when these languages started their separate development. Standard Danish, Rigsdansk, replaces tonal accents with the stød, whilst some southern, insular dialects of Danish preserve the tonal accent to different degrees. The Finland Swedish dialects also lack a tonal accent, as no such phenomenon exists in Finnish.

=== Pulmonic ingressive ===
The words {{lang|no|ja}} ('yes') and {{lang|no|nei}} ('nei') are sometimes pronounced with inhaled breath ([[pulmonic ingressive]]) in Norwegian—and this can be rather confusing for foreigners. The same phenomenon occurs across the other Scandinavian languages, and can also be found in German, French, Finnish and Japanese, to name a few.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17201">'''Oppositional culture''', also known as the ‘’blocked opportunities framework’’ or the “caste theory of education”, is a term most commonly used in studying the [[sociology of education]] to explain [[racial achievement gap in the United States|racial disparities in educational achievement]], particularly between white and black Americans. However, the term refers to any subculture's rejection of conformity to prevailing norms and values, not just nonconformity within the educational system. Thus many criminal [[gang]]s and religious [[cult]]s could also be considered oppositional cultures.

==Background==
This theory relates to a larger generalized topic of [[race and intelligence]]. According to this theory, minority students underachieve intentionally in school and in standardized testing due to a fear of being stereotyped as [[acting white]].&lt;ref name ="Macombe"&gt;Mocombe, Paul, and Carol Tomlin. The Oppositional Culture Theory. Lanham, MD: University of America, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting white refers to activities and attitudes associated with white middle-class Americans. Adherence to white norms in African American communities represents a betrayal of black normative culture. Spurred by the pre-existing theories including the [[culture of poverty]] and the effects of [[urban decay]], oppositional culture emerged in the late 1970s as a theory to explain the education gap.  The principal researcher of this idea, anthropologist John Ogbu, details the principal mechanisms and causes for oppositional culture in his book, “Black Students in an Affluent Suburb, and Minority Status, Oppositional Culture, and Schooling”.

==Historical context==
Racial disparities in education stem from the historical foundations of America, from the époque of slavery into the 20th and 21st centuries. Slave owners in the American South by and large prevented their slaves from becoming literate, fearing that literacy and education would strengthen slave resistance and empower the slaves to revolt against their masters. While African-Americans in the North fared better, black schools struggled to keep their doors open.&lt;ref&gt;The Slave Experience: Education, Arts, and Culture." PBS. PBS, 2004. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/history2.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1896 landmark court case, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' also helped to define education policies in the United States for years to come. The court case ultimately decided that race was an acceptable categorization by which to divide individuals.  Additionally the case determined that separation of these individuals was permissible provided that the condition of both facilities was equal.&lt;ref&gt;"Plessy v. Ferguson." Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School, 18 Apr. 1896. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0163_0537_ZO.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case helped to promote segregationist practices that prevented African American children from attending white schools.  African-American schools had fewer resources leading to greater racial gaps in educational achievement.

In 1954, the Supreme Court decided that the concept of separate but equal was unconstitutional in its landmark decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education'' 347 U.S. 483]].  The court also ruled that segregation inherently caused harm to the cognitive development of black children, and officially recognized the importance of educational equality as a compelling interest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Brown v. Board of Education." Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School. Web. 02 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0347_0483_ZS.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this ruling, Southern school districts began to publish findings of racial gaps in academics as a justification to oppose [[desegregation]].  As a result, the United States adopted compensatory education in order to equalize educational opportunities for all students.&lt;ref name="ogbu"&gt;Ogbu, John U. Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement. Mahwah, NJ: L. Erlbaum Associates, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these efforts, the education gap continues to persist in SAT scores and college acceptance rates.  In the 1980s, a researcher named [[John Ogbu]] suggested that equal opportunity was not enough to diminish the racial disparities gap in education and that additional factors needed to be addressed in order to reduce the racial disparities gap.

==Racial disparities in education today==

Racial disparities continue to persist in the realm of education even today.  A study by George Farkas in 2002 identifies several areas where racial gaps and disparities continue to exist. His research findings show that even in early primary education in pre-school and kindergarten, African American children show lower oral language, pre-reading, and pre-mathematics skills in addition to behavior less suited to school environments.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, George. RACIAL DISPARITIES AND DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION: WHAT DO WE KNOW, HOW DO WE KNOW IT, AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW? Department of Sociology and Population Research Institute, 1 July 2002. Web. 16 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In high schools, measures of academic achievement such as grades and class rank also show an under-representation of African American and Hispanics. Additionally, African American and Latino students consistently perform lower on the SAT than their white counterparts thereby affecting their acceptance rates into universities. Even when accounting for differences in socioeconomic status and single parent households this racial disparity, although reduced, continues to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Nichelle. Cultural Disparities of SAT Scores and the Influence on Higher Education Opportunities for African American and Latino Students. Education Resources Information Center. Dominican University of California, 1 Dec. 2007. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED499158.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These trends have become the basis for sociological theories, including oppositional culture that explain these continuing racial gaps in education achievement.

==Contributions of John Ogbu==
John Ogbu’s primary goal in his research was to explain “academic performance of racial and ethnic minorities with reference to broader societal structures and historical processes &lt;ref name="massey"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. The Source of the River: The Social Origins of Freshmen at America's Selective Colleges and Universities. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;” John Ogbu used case studies, the most famous of which examined the affluent neighborhood of Shaker Heights, Ohio, to research variables that represented oppositional culture. These variables included several explanations of academic disengagement based on African Americans’ self-perception of their work load, their own and white people’s academic efforts, and their own explanations for their disengagement.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt; From this case study and other research, Ogbu formulated his theory of oppositional culture.

===Voluntary vs involuntary minorities===
As part of Ogbu’s analysis, he defines the position of voluntary minorities versus the position of involuntary minorities.  Voluntary minorities in the United States include immigrant minorities such as Chinese and Korean immigrants as well as autonomous minorities such as Mormons and Jews.  Involuntary minorities comprise largely of [[African Americans]], Native Americans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans who were incorporated into American society against their will through colonization, slavery, and conquest.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt; While voluntary minorities view cultural differences as obstacles to be overcome, involuntary minorities view participation in dominant cultural practices as a betrayal of their group loyalty and a threat to their identity.

Ogbu argues that in African American cultures, a collective identity is created from a young age in which cultural frames of reference indicate behaviors that belong culturally and those that do not. According to self-reports of African American students, “[[African American Vernacular English|talking proper]]”, playing sports dominated by white students, and having white friends all show that a person is acting white. Ogbu states that these cultural frames of reference create instances of peer pressure and discourage students from schoolwork.  While black students did not necessarily see getting good grades as acting white, they did disengage from academic work because they perceived certain attitudes and behaviors that were conducive to making good grades as acting white.  These behaviors include the use of [[Standard English]], enrollment in honors and AP classes and acting “smart” in class.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt;  Additionally, students in the same sample felt that black individuals gave up some of their cultural background by succeeding in white institutions.

===Policy implications===
Based on his findings, Obgu has proposed certain policy changes to help decrease the gap in racial educational achievement. Ogbu argues that encouraging members of the black community to take proactive roles in increasing academic orientation, effort and performance will greatly affect their children’s academic performance.  Ogbu states that educational efforts are concurrent with cultural practices.  Additionally, he suggests supplementary education programs and increased visibility of successful black role models as helpful solutions.  Obgu also encouraged the development of effective parental educational strategies to combat his findings of little parental involvement in black communities, along with improvements in teacher’s expectations of Black students.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt;

==Critical responses to Ogbu’s findings==
Many sociologists and sources have praised his studies as a valuable addition to the theories explaining the gap in educational achievement among different races.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, Dorinda J. "Editor's Review of John U. Ogbu's Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement." Harvard Educational Review. Harvard University, Winter 2004. Web. 18 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://www.hepg.org/her/abstract/38&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, his research has spurred similar ethno-cultural case studies around the world that have linked gaps in achievement to communities.  One example is a case study done in the UK in 2006 by two researchers, Tomlin and Olusola, that sought to discover factors and conditions that affect the achievement levels of high-achieving black students in two urban secondary schools.  The study found that [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean]] students reported obstacles similar to those faced by African Americans in their attempts to achieve at the levels of their white peers.,&lt;ref name="Macombe"/&gt; Studies that seek to explain overall achievement gaps between blacks and whites have also looked at Ogbu’s criteria from his case studies in education.

However, other sociologists have argued against the validity of his claims.  His findings are most often criticized for overgeneralizing the experience of the black community.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;  A study by Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey found that black students are significantly more likely to believe that education increases the chances of finding a job, and that smart African American students are held in higher esteem by their peers for high academic achievement. These findings all contradict the oppositional culture model proposed by Ogbu.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth-Darnell, James W., and Douglas B. Downey. "Assessing the Oppositional Culture Explanation for Racial/Ethnic Differences in School Performance." American Sociological Review 63.4 (1998): 536-53. Jstor. Web. 16 Mar. 2012. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657266?seq=10&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Cook and Ludwig found that after controlling for socioeconomic status, on average black students were no less alienated from school than white students and were no less popular for being good students.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;  These studies show that inconsistencies regarding the existence of oppositional cultures in black communities persist.

==Alternative explanations==
While oppositional culture offers one explanation for the gap in racial educational achievement, there are alternative explanations for this phenomenon.

==Prudence Carter==
Prudence Carter, a sociologist at Stanford University, published findings that directly contradicted Ogbu’s research that African Americans viewed educational attainment as acting white. She showed in her research, published in her book “Keepin’ it Real: School Success Beyond Black and White”, that the majority of minority students shared 'white' [[norm (social)|normative values]] about the roles of work and success.  Carter argues that the possession of capital and upper [[socioeconomic status]] did not guarantee more interactions with one race over another and that upwardly mobile minorities are more inclined to associate with individuals from their same class over their same racial identification.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Prudence L. Keepin' It Real: School Success beyond Black and White. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter states that a focus on racialized communities is not enough- a holistic acknowledgement of the relevance and depth of students’ general attitudes and beliefs and how these affect schooling will help improve education policies. Studies of these attitudes should rely less on racial lines and focus more on ethno-cultural identities of the individual.

This work is supported by a study by Charles ''et al.'' that surveyed the cultural backgrounds of black students in elite universities in the United States.  The study found that even though immigrants of African heritage from Africa and the Caribbean represent less than ten percent of the total black population in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NISF), half of them went to l0 of the most selective NISF schools. More than one third of [[multiracial]] black and other race individuals, who are only 11 percent of the population, also attend the top 10 NISF schools. Multiracial individuals and African immigrants typically are advantaged in socioeconomic status and pre-college preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Charles A. "Black like Who?" Racism in Post-race America: New Theories, New Directions. Chapel Hill, NC: Social Forces, University of North Carolina, 2008. 247-63. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This work shows that race may not be the primary determinant of racial educational achievement and that other factors including socioeconomic status play larger roles in determining educational outcome.

==Stereotype Threat Assumption==
[[Stereotype threat|Stereotype Threat Assumption]] is another explanation for the racial gap in educational achievement.  According to this theory, African Americans endure stereotypes of intellectual inferiority. Fearing that they would meet these expectations of underperformance, they make the decision to disengage from academics. Additionally, studies have shown that stereotypes themselves divert mental resources away from the area of concentration and can worsen classroom performance, comfort interacting with teachers, and other areas of scholastic life.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Claude. Whistling Vivaldi: And Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings of anxiety combined with the stigmatization acts as an inherent obstacle for African American educational achievement. Some African Americans choose to disengage from academics altogether to avoid meeting the expectations of failure and underachievement. This disengagement in academics demonstrates a perceived devaluation in African American culture.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;

==Capital deficiency==
The capital deficiency theory is heavily related to [[Racial inequality in the United States]], specifically the racial wealth gap. Wealthier families with higher [[economic capital]] can afford to provide additional resources for their children to combat any learning difficulties they may face naturally.  A related form of capital, [[human capital]], or the skills, abilities, and knowledge possessed by an individual are passed down in families with higher accumulation of human capital.  Parents with higher human capital are also better prepared to supervise their children's acquisition of it. [[Social capital]] and [[cultural capital]] also provide the means for increased support in educational outcomes. Social and cultural capital help to expose children into beneficial social institutions through bonds of kinship and friendship with the skills to navigate these social spheres fluidly.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;

"'''Out of Mind, Out of Sight'''", also known as "'''Invisible Girl'''",&lt;ref name = "BBC episode guide"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/outofmind/trivia.shtml BBC episode guide]&lt;/ref&gt; is the 11th episode of Season One of the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the episode, an invisible force is attacking people at the local school and [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] may be in danger. The relationship between [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and Cordelia grows closer.

==Plot==
After her English class, [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] arranges to meet with the teacher the next day to talk about her paper. In the boys' locker room, Cordelia's boyfriend is attacked by an invisible assailant with a baseball bat and taken to hospital. [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] enters the boys' locker room and finds the word "LOOK" spray-painted on the lockers. As Buffy approaches her, Harmony is pushed down the stairs by an invisible force and injures her ankle. The invisible thing bumps into Buffy before escaping.

As the Scooby Gang disperse, Buffy follows the sound of a flute. Looking over Willow's list of missing children, Buffy suspects Marcie when she sees she played the flute. Buffy finds Marcie's hideout. While Buffy is looking at Marcie's yearbook, Marcie{{mdash}}who is invisible{{mdash}}is standing behind her with a knife. Marcie then finds Mrs. Miller, Cordelia's English teacher, and suffocates her with a plastic bag. Cordelia arrives a short while afterwards and saves Mrs. Miller. An invisible hand writes "LISTEN" on the blackboard.

In a flashback, Marcie is sitting in her literature class as she attempts to answer a question posed by the teacher and is looked over in favor of her classmates, even though she had her hand up. Her hand then starts to fade away. Giles realizes that Marcie did not willingly become invisible, but was ''made'' invisible due to people never noticing her existence. As the Scoobies think back to Harmony and Mitch, and flick through Marcie's yearbook, they find Cordelia's picture, horribly defaced. They realize that Marcie is after Cordelia, whom she resented for constantly being the center of attention; suddenly the latter walks into the library asking Buffy for protection. They explain to Cordelia who is following her and decide to use her as bait and to have Buffy bodyguard her.

Using recorded flute music, Marcie lures Willow, Xander and Giles into the boiler room where she closes the door and opens the gas, then grabs Cordelia as she is changing. Buffy follows Cordelia and finds her unconscious. Marcie injects Buffy with a sedative and renders her unconscious

Buffy and Cordelia wake up; they are tied to some chairs. They see the word "LEARN" written on a curtain, and Marcie says that Cordelia is the lesson{{mdash}}or will be after Marcie surgically disfigures her face. Buffy kicks the instrument tray at Marcie and frees herself from the ropes. In the boiler room, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] rescues the Scooby Gang and closes the gas valve. Buffy realizes that she must use her other senses to fight an invisible enemy; she concentrates, listening to Marcie, and knocks her into a curtain before knocking her out. After Buffy frees Cordelia, two mysterious FBI agents arrive to haul Marcie away.

Marcie is taken by the FBI to a school of invisible students. She sits down in class and opens her textbook, called ''Assassination and Infiltration'', of which she approves.

==Writing==
The scene in which Marcie watches her hand fade away was inspired by a vivid dream that show creator [[Joss Whedon]] had as a child.&lt;ref name="BBC episode guide"/&gt;

==Broadcast and reception==
"Out of Mind, Out of Sight" was first broadcast on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]].

People who [[cross-dress]] as [[male]] may also "pack".&lt;ref name="WinksSemans2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winks|first1=Cathy|last2=Semans|first2=Anne|title=The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex: The Most Complete Sex Manual Ever Written|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naD9GP_sWMwC&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=2002-12-01|publisher=Cleis Press|isbn=9781573441582|pages=199–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Packers==
The object used for packing, sometimes called a ''packer'', may take the form of only a penis shape or may also incorporate a false [[scrotum]] and [[testicle]]s.  Packers may be used to make male clothing hang and move correctly.  If a packer is not used, the shape of the clothing is sometimes visibly "empty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftmguide.org/packing.html FTM Guide - Packing]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Soft packing===
The phrase "soft packing" refers to packing with a device that cannot be used for [[sexual penetration]].&lt;ref name="TaylorSharkey2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Emma|last2=Sharkey|first2=Lorelei|title=Em &amp; Lo's Sex Toy: An A-Z Guide to Bedside Accessories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qz6vkhcJq_wC&amp;pg=PT180|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=2006-07-20|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=9780811852838|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homemade packers may be very low-tech and consist of rolled-up socks or condoms filled with liquids or gel.  There are many commercially available packers, which more realistically emulate the size, shape, color and texture of the male genitals. All soft packers are made of soft, flexible material and simulate a flaccid penis. The term ''packer'' most frequently describes the soft models not used for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].  A few packers can be used as [[stand-to-pee device|stand-to-pee devices (STP)]]. These incorporate a receptacle that is inserted under and against the wearer's [[urethra]]. The packer has a tube from the receptacle to the tip, which allows the wearer to [[urinate]] through the prosthetic.&lt;ref name="M.D.2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=M.D.|first=Harvey J. Makadon,|title=The Fenway Guide To Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsRwtwb-He8C&amp;pg=PA350|accessdate=26 November 2012|year=2008|publisher=ACP Press|isbn=9781930513952|pages=350–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===For sex===
{{Main|Pegging (sexual practice)}}
''Packing hard'' refers to packing with a device that may be used for sexual penetration. Some such packers are made of firmer material such as [[silicone]], and are flexible enough for packing but firm enough for sexual penetration.  Still others are made of even firmer material, and feature either an internal rod that stays in the shape in which it is bent, or an internal hinge at the base.  These types allowing the packer to simulate a flaccid position (if not a flaccid feel), as well as a very firm, erect position. Another term for packers which may be used for sex is ''packing dildo''.  A colloquial expression for the usage of these is ''pack and play''.

==Slang==
A slang term related to packing is ''packing heat''.  This slang term originally meant ''carrying a firearm'', but later was used to describe an FTM trans person who has a penis. Like many terms in many communities, this phrase may be used [[affection]]ately or jokingly among friends, as a way of [[reclaiming]] a phrase that is used as a [[pejorative]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">[[File:Les funérailles d Étienne Chevalier.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession arriving at the church. The coffin is covered with an elaborate red pall. ''[[Heures d'Étienne Chevalier]]'' ([[Musée Condé]], [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]])]]

A '''pall''' (also called '''mortcloth''') is a cloth that covers a [[coffin|casket or coffin]] at funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the Latin ''pallium'' (cloak), through [[Old English]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pall pall - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a stiffened square card covered with white linen, usually embroidered with a cross or some other appropriate symbol. The purpose of the pall is to keep dust and insects from falling into the Eucharistic elements in a [[chalice]]. The derivation is the same: the cloth is named after the presumed cloth that covered Jesus.

The use of a rich cloth pall to cover the casket or coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black, and later still white.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for [[vestment]]s or other decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p. 151, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The rules for the pall's colour and use vary depending on [[religion|religious]] and [[culture|cultural]] [[tradition]]s.  Commonly today palls are pure white, to symbolize the white clothes worn during [[baptism]] and the joyful triumph over death brought about by the [[Resurrection]]. The colour is not fixed, though, and may vary with the [[liturgical year|liturgical season]].  Traditionally, it is common for the pall, as well as the vestments of the clergy to be black.  The pall will often be decorated with a cross, often running the whole length of the cloth from end to end in all four directions, signifying the sovereignty of Christ's triumph over sin and death on the cross. 

[[File:Funeral of Patriarch Alexy II-3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Christian burial|funeral]] of [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow]]. The patriarchal [[mandyas]] is draped over his casket as a pall.]]

The pall is placed on the casket or coffin as soon as it arrives at the church and will remain on the coffin during all of proceedings in the church. If the family members wish to view the deceased, this would normally be done previously at the [[funeral home]] before the casket or coffin is brought to the church; but customs will vary from denomination to denomination.  The pall will be removed at the graveside, just before the casket or coffin is lowered into the ground. If the remains are to be [[cremation|cremated]], the pall-covered casket or coffin will go through a curtain, and the pall will be removed.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the pall often bears a depiction of the cross and [[instruments of the Passion]] as well as the text of the [[Trisagion]] hymn. Since Orthodox funerals are normally open casket, the pall comes up only to the chest of the deceased. When an Orthodox [[bishop]] dies, his [[mandyas]] (mantle) is used as a pall.
[[File:HuseeHearseCloth VintnersCompany.jpg|thumb|200px|Hearse-cloth presented in 1539 to the [[Worshipful Company of Vintners]] in the [[City of London]]  by its master John Husee]]
[[Military]] [[funeral]]s often use the nation's [[flag]] as a pall. In the [[United Kingdom]], members of the [[Royal Family]] or the [[peerage]] may use a flag bearing their [[coat of arms|arms]] as a pall. The [[City of London]] [[Livery Companies]] have collections of often magnificently embroidered "hearse-cloths", which were from the 16th century traditionally donated by prominent members for use in covering distinguished members' coffins. An exhibition of such palls was made in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4538">A school '''period''' is a block of time allocated for lessons, classes in schools.&lt;ref name="Definition htof Class Period"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/class+period | title=Definition of Class Period by The Free Dictionary | publisher=Farlex | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically last between 40 and 60 minutes, with around 3-8 periods per school day. However, especially in higher education, there can be many more. Educators determine the number and length of these periods, and may even regulate how each period will be used. One common example of this practice is to designate at least one compulsory period a day for physical education.&lt;ref name="Proposed Compulsory Sports Period"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gill-wants-a-compulsory-sports-period-in-schools/articleshow/5854061.cms#ixzz0yHgn7YRb | title=The Times of India: Gill wants a compulsory sports period in schools | accessdate=July 22, 2011 | work=The Times Of India | date=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free period==
One special example of a [[high school]] period is the free period. These typically involve having 15 minutes of mostly unsupervised activities. A free period (also called "free" "spare" or "unstructured") is generally found in most high schools and [[college]]s. During a free period, a student can either:
* Walk around the [[campus]] freely until the next period. Some high schools permit students to leave the campus and go home, visit shops or areas nearby that are outside the school grounds.
* Stay in a designated [[common room|study room]] or [[classroom]] and either talk or work on [[homework]]
* Use it as an opportunity to meet up with [[teacher]]s and ask about missed work or another question.
* Study for any upcoming tests/exams.
* In some schools, [[lunch]] is also consumed during a student's free period.

Some schools have an extended lunch period and that could be used as a free period as well. Lunch periods in high school could be up to 60 minutes long.

A free period in a [[college]] is a time period that a student is not enrolled in a class. During the free period, students are completely free of adult supervision and could do whatever they want that complies to the campus rules and the law.

==Study period==
Another special example of a middle school and high school period is the study period. In school or college, a study period is a period in a student's timetable where a student may undertake self-directed learning activities, rather than having lessons being taught by a teacher.

While study periods are normally intended for study activities, such as set exercises, problem solving, or homework, students often consider these periods of the school day as free periods and may use the time to socialize rather than study. For this reason, study periods may often be supervised by a teacher being present in the study room. In some instances, the teacher may even tutor the students, and the study period may become a tutorial, although this is not normally the case.
Study periods often occur because of scheduling conflicts in the school timetable, when there is a mismatch between available students, teachers, subjects and classrooms.

Study periods are generally monitored by teachers or teacher's aides, who often encourage students to use this time to complete homework, catch up on missing assignments, or study for tests or quizzes. Sometimes, students also use periods to converse, make phone calls, text message, play video games, or otherwise socialize or pursue non-academic topics, though this is sometimes discouraged or forbidden. Periods in which such things are allowed are occasionally differentiated from study periods by the name "free period". Some students even eat lunch during a study period due to long lines and short lunch periods at their schools.

Study periods are often used by students to visit with teachers, who have a "prep period", in order to discuss work or assignments. A study period can be a period to utilize school resources or otherwise request teacher assistance in any subject not understood by the student.

Many academics feel that study period is an inefficient allocation of time which is often underutilized, but others say it is a positive addition to a regular schedule because it creates a good environment for completing homework or large projects.

The outfit includes the [[Patiala salwar]] and the [[Saraiki shalwar suits]] of the [[Punjab region]].

==Punjabi suit==
The term Punjabi suit refers to the three piece ensemble comprising the head scarf, kameez and the salwar. However, the term also encompasses the older variety of the Punjabi suthan suit which is made up of the head scarf, kurta/kurti and Punjabi suthan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Sidhu Brard, Gurnam Singh  (2007) East of Indus: My Memories of Old Punjab [https://books.google.com/books?id=UUdYFH9skIkC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=punjab+sutthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M4-aVaWkFceuU5zwmZAD&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=punjab%20sutthan&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punjabi suthan and kurta suit===

====Etymology====
The word suthan is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word svasthana,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; which means tight fitting trousers which in turn is derived from the Central Asian word Samstamni.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Archaeological Congress and Seminar Papers: Papers Presented at the 4th Annual Congress of the Indian Archaeological Society and the Seminars Held at Nagpur on the 10th, 11th, and 12th Nov. 1970, Volume 4, Part 1970 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_xJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=svasthana+trousers&amp;dq=svasthana+trousers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nwSFVfuFBseOU76WqIgL&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTgK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subbarayappa, B.

Indo-Soviet Seminar on Scientific and Technological Exchanges Between India and Soviet Central Asia in Medieval Period, Bombay, November 7–12, 1981: Proceedings [https://books.google.com/books?id=IerQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=svasthana+trousers&amp;dq=svasthana+trousers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nwSFVfuFBseOU76WqIgL&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK]&lt;/ref&gt; The suthan are trousers cut straight and tight, as opposed to the salwar, which is baggy and can be full of folds.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O'Brien (of the Indian Civil Service ) (1881) Glossary of the Multani Language Compared with Punjábi and Sindhi [https://books.google.com/books?id=u10IAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=multani+suthan&amp;dq=multani+suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gG-NVc3zNaHT7QbWq4CoBw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; The tight suthan is loose to the knees but the loose Punjabi suthan is loose to the lower legs and very tight at the ankles. The salwar ends in a band which is loose fitting. Despite this difference, people use the word suthan and salwar interchangeably to describe loose suthans and salwars,&lt;ref&gt;John, A (2009) Two dialects one region: A sociolinguistic approach to dialects as identity markers.&lt;/ref&gt; with the loose suthan resembling the salwar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yCRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=sutthan+punjab&amp;dq=sutthan+punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=64uaVYOKNMf4UuDPjng&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBDgK Dhavalikar, Madhukar Keshav  (2003) Archaeology of western India]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the use of the term pajama, the term suthan was used. Therefore, the woollen pajamas of Gilgit&lt;ref&gt;Knight, E.F.

The churidar pajama was also referred to as the suthan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ALpHAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=churidar+pyjama+known+as+suthan&amp;dq=churidar+pyjama+known+as+suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C0-UVa77A4P6yASey6vYCQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ Census of India, 1981: Himachal Pradesh. Series 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word suthana was also used in [[Hindi]], to describe pajamas.&lt;ref&gt;The University (1982)Panjab University Research Bulletin: Arts, Volume 13, Issue 1 - Volume 14, Issue 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nvE7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=suthan+19th+century&amp;dq=suthan+19th+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l_yEVY_FGIGoUrGIgZgN&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Types=====
The Punjabi suthan is of two types: loose to above the ankles and tight at the ankles, or loose to the knees, and then cut straight and tight to the ankles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=qR6LVbiwLJOp7AbF7YHYBw&amp;id=NcRFAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=suthan+punjabi&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=shalwar Punjab District Gazetteers: pt. 1 Muzaffargarh district, 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Loose Punjabi suthan=====
It was noted by Alberuni in the 11th century C.E. that the local drawers are of gigantic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Raj (2008) Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8o5HyC0-FUC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=sindh+kurta+dress+medieval+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o9OKVYimMYjlUdWJhKgG&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sindh%20kurta%20dress%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This could point to the loose Punjabi suthan which, unlike the Punjabi salwar, has multiple pleats and is very baggy with many folds. The suthan can also be arranged in plaits.&lt;ref&gt;Wace, E.G. (1874) Report on the land revenue settlement of the Hazara District of the Punjab : 1868 - 1874 [https://books.google.com/books?ei=UPeUVeT9MMi9UbX_i4AJ&amp;id=bMPTuskHAqUC&amp;dq=hazara+kurta&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ending+above]&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 20 yards of cloth can be used which hangs in innumerable folds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s-Y2AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=punjab++suthan&amp;dq=punjab++suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cYFnVarhJ8mS7AaE6oPYCQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ Punjab District Gazetteers (1932)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some varieties, such as those of [[Chakwal]], can use between 30 and 40 yards of cloth which are made with overhanging pleats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eOtAAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sutthan+punjabi&amp;dq=sutthan+punjabi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4eSaVY_JLsSP7Aa15byAAw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ Punjab District Gazetteers 1907 Jhelum District ..]&lt;/ref&gt;

(1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Punjabi suthan is gathered midway between the knees and the ankles to fit closely to the leg and end in a tight band at the ankles which is what distinguishes the two lower garments.&lt;ref name="Mohinder Singh Randhawa 1960"/&gt; The tight band of the suthan is a remnant of the ancient svasthana trousers which were tight fitting to the thighs. The use of loose material is a local development. The pleats of the suthan either gather in circles resembling bangles, or fall vertically to the ankles. As the distinction between the loose Punjabi suthan and the baggy salwar rests on the ankle band, some view the loose Punjabi suthan as another version of the salwar,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-jZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=punjabi+suthan&amp;dq=punjabi+suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P96LVfe6AsGqUZGIgvgM&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ Singh, Daljit (2004) Punjab Socio-Economic Condition (1501-1700 A.D.)]&lt;/ref&gt; with the definition of suthan being reserved for the tight Punjabi suthan.

The [[Punjabi ghagra]] has its origins in the candataka which continued as a popular female dress in the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Uma Prasad Thapliyal (1978) Foreign elements in ancient Indian society, 2nd century BC to 7th century AD [https://books.google.com/books?id=9X4BAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=candataka+dress&amp;dq=candataka+dress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MGqGVbOqNoGyU_HYgfAM&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the svasthana was also popular in this period. However, the candataka ended at the thighs and the svasthana may have been used to cover the lower legs thus giving rise to the tradition of wearing the ghagra and the suthan together.

Older Punjabi women wore churidar pajamma and long kurta. These different styles were popular during the 1960s in [[Punjab, India|East Punjab]].&lt;ref name="Mohinder Singh Randhawa 1960"&gt;Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain members of the Punjabi community however, were wearing the suthan and kurti on its own without the [[Punjabi Ghagra]], a tradition documented in the Gazetter of Hoshiarpur District 1883-84&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of the Hoshiarpur District: 1883-84. Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2001.[https://books.google.com/books?ei=kPuHVZKVNIHaUbXipJgO&amp;id=eIpuAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=punjab+ghagra+suthan&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+suthan]&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the 1915 Hissar Gazetteer&lt;ref name="revenueharyana.gov.in"&gt;http://revenueharyana.gov.in/html/gazeteers/hissar%201915.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Punjabi women (and men) also wore the ghutanna, a type of pajamma which was shorter than the full length pajamma, and was tight and ended at the calf.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Paintings and lifestyles of Jammu Region: 17th to 19th Century A.D Raj Kumar [https://books.google.com/books?id=f-1XyQ2eIG8C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=punjabi+suthan+kameez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8nBGZ6-YoE&amp;sig=ogpJUiErn2LLs9ReDFnx_NXnW-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lbR0VM74KMWE7gbA3IDwBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=punjabi%20suthan%20kameez&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of the Suthan subsequently spread to the [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] area of the [[Punjab region]],&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; [[Sindh]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=PGBxVeXsAsvkUpzTgsgF&amp;id=ql87AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=sindhi+never+wore++suthan&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=paro S.

====Punjabi suthan suit revival====
In recent years, the Punjabi suthan suit has been revived. However, the pleats fall in a variet of ways and the ankle band is not as tight as the traditional Punjabi suthan.

===Punjabi salwar suit===

====Punjabi salwar====
In its strictest sense, the salwar is baggy and loose straight down the legs, and gathered loosely at the ankles. During the medieval period, people adopted the Iraqi style of salwar in [[Multan]] and neighbouring [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kumar, Raj (2008) Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8o5HyC0-FUC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=sindh+kurta+dress+medieval+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o9OKVYimMYjlUdWJhKgG&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sindh%20kurta%20dress%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6xMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=salwar+iraq+sindh+makran&amp;dq=salwar+iraq+sindh+makran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Th6OVe6fMdDY7AbjvoTgAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ Said,Hakim Mohammad  (1990) Road to Pakistan. 1. 712 - 1858]&lt;/ref&gt; This type of salwar is traditionally very baggy and gathered at the ankles. It is still worn by the Kurdish community in [[Iraq]]. The presence of the baggy salwar was noted by Alberuni in the 11th century A.D.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and continued to be envogue between the 16th and 18th centuries C.E. in [[Multan]]&lt;ref&gt;Dasti, Humaira Faiz  (1998) Multan, a province of the Mughal Empire, 1525-1751 [https://books.google.com/books?ei=RLWLVf_yBMmjU7D4g5gH&amp;id=kH3jAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=multan+shalwar&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+shalwar]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Multani salwar is similar to the loose Punjabi suthan. Therefore, the distinction between the loose Punjabi suthan and the loose Multani salwar is fine and centres on the tight ankle band in the suthan, and on the suthan beginning to fit closer to the legs below the knees.

The original Punjabi loose salwar was not as baggy as the Multani style but was wide, with the gathering at the ankles being wide enough to cover the feet. Originally, up to ten yards of cloth was used to make Punjabi salwars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdP_sSKIxf0C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=salwar+punjab++afghan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nsSLVaeaOMnvUtvpuOgF&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=salwar%20punjab%20%20afghan&amp;f=false Yarwood, Doreen (2011) Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Costume]&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Punjabi salwar was also not as baggy as other forms of the salwar, such as the type worn in [[Afghanistan]] ([[Khet partug|partug]])), the Balochi salwar,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=NUyOVZPdHMGd7AbqkoPYDw&amp;id=P8JFAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=bahawalpur+shalwar&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=discarded Punjab district gazetteers, Volume 7, Part 1 (1923)]&lt;/ref&gt; or the loose Punjabi suthan, and gathers more quickly below the knees and ends in a tight band. Eventually the modern Punjabi salwar came into being which is slim fitting and does not have wide ends as before.

Another style of salwar is the Pothohari salwar of the [[Pothohar]] area of the [[Punjab region]].&lt;ref name="Mohinder Singh Randhawa 1960"/&gt; The Pothohari salwar retains the wideness of the Punjabi suthan. The kameez is also wide. The chunni is a remnant of the large [[Chador|chadar]] popular in [[Punjab, Pakistan|West Punjab]] known as salari&lt;ref&gt;Kehal, Harkesh Singh (2011) Alop ho riha Punjabi virsa Lokgeet Parkashan {{ISBN|978-93-5017-532-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the large [[Phulkari]] worn in various areas of the [[Punjab region]]. However, the Pothohari salwar suit did not attain universal acceptance. The Bahawalpuri salwar is also wide and baggy&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=28RCAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bahawalpur+wide+trouser&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=wide+trousers Current Opinion, Volume 25 (1899)]&lt;/ref&gt; with many folds. The material traditionally used for the Bahawalpuri shalwar and suthan is known as Sufi which is a mixture of cotton warp mixed with silk weft and gold threads running down the material.&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from the District &amp; States Gazetteers of the Punjab, Pakistan, Volume 2 (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2RluAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bahawalpur+suththan&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=sufi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wgEwAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=bahawalpur+shalwar&amp;dq=bahawalpur+shalwar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ok2OVbvYLsqy7Qai6rKoDQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw The Pakistan gazetteer, Volume 5 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Female dress: Punjabi salwar suit=====
The [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] salwar Suit is worn in the Punjab in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. It consists of the chunni (head scarf), jhagga(kameez) and the salwar when worn by women. The chunni can be of varying lengths. The jhagga (kameez) is made up of two rectangular pieces sewn together with side slits, similar to a [[tunic]]. A kurta is also worn.

The salwar is similar to pajamas or pants, wide at the top and tightened loosely around the ankles with hard material, called paunchay. In the Punjab, the salwar kameez is also known as the chunni jhagga salwar suit.

===Early history===

====Salwar====
Salwar is the generic term used to describe the lower garment developed in different regions. The earliest form of the salwar originated in [[Central Asia]] and its use was spread to [[Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], the [[Arab]] world,  [[Turkey]] and wherever the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] established their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Jirousek, Charlotte. “Islamic Clothing.” In Encyclopedia of Islam. New York: Macmillan Pub. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottomans]] spread the use of the salwar  throughout its empire.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Lynch, Mitchell D. Strauss (2014) Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia [https://books.google.com/books?id=tiEvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=chalvar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgeahUKEwjDubCPyOzGAhXIsxQKHR20Dt4#v=onepage&amp;q=chalvar&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the salwar in the [[Punjab region]] has been the result of influences from the Middle East, Central Asian Turks&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Richard C.  (2004) Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World: A-L, Volume 1  [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVcUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=sirwal+central+asia&amp;dq=sirwal+central+asia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QCCgVeuuCsTB7ga635_gBg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, the Afghans.

In India, the term salwar includes the [[Sindhi dress|Sindhi suthan]], [[Punjab]]i suthan,&lt;ref&gt;Dr Singh, Daljit (2004) Punjab Socio-Economic Condition (1501-1700 A.D.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6-jZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=punjab+kurta+suthan&amp;dq=punjab+kurta+suthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pn1nVaGAGLOM7AaB8YOQBQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jammu dress|Dogri pajamma]] and the [[churidar]]. The term salwar kameez also includes the Kashmiri [[Phiran|Phiran/suthan outfit]].

In the [[Punjab region]], the salwar was made using a large amount of material but had no pleats or folds. The large salwar eventually gave rise to the Punjabi salwar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Paintings and Lifestyles of Jammu Region: From 17th to 19th Century A.D Raj Kumar [https://books.google.com/books?id=f-1XyQ2eIG8C&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=Paintings+and+Lifestyles+of+Jammu+Region:+From+17th+to+19th+Century+A.D.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8nBHQb20ox&amp;sig=hehEhqbYaQ_NVTmqKdoksvPYpcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xQt3VPu1Ms6V7AbByYHwBQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=punjab&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jhagga (kameez)====
In Turkic Central Asian culture, the salwar is accompanied by a tunic, forming the upper garment.&lt;ref&gt;Aryan, K.C (1983) The Cultural Heritage of Punjab, 3000 B.C. to 1947 A.D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCtuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=multan++salwar&amp;dq=multan++salwar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwiI-7Ss1pHGAhVJsxQKHbL5AE8]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Punjab region]], the upper garment is the jhagga (kameez). The [[Ghaznavid]] Turks popularised the salwar/tunic attire in Afghanistan and Northern India,&lt;ref&gt;Jirousek, Charlotte. “Islamic Clothing.” In Encyclopedia of Islam. New York: Macmillan Pub. (2004)[http://char.txa.cornell.edu/islamicclothes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Finbarr Barry  (2009) Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval "Hindu-Muslim" Encounter [https://books.google.com/books?id=OLNE_li8C10C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=kurta+sind+iraq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qwCLVZ7COeHd7gawvoNo&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBg#v=snippet&amp;q=trousers&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the [[Punjab region]].

==Other areas==
The use of the suthan or the salwar has been adopted in other areas. People in [[Jammu]] have changed the traditional attire from the peshwaj (flowing to the ankles) &lt;ref&gt;Textiles,  Costumes and Ornaments of the Western Himalayas O Handa&lt;/ref&gt; to the kurta and Dogri suthan.  In addition to the traditional lengha choli, women in [[Sindh]] wear the cholo (kameez) and suthan.&lt;ref&gt;I am a Sindhi: The Glorious Sindhi Heritage and Culture and Folklore of Sindh J P Vaswami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sindh and The Races That Inhabit the Valley of the Indus Richard F Burton&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjabi salwar suit is also worn by many people. The [[Phiran]] in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Paintings and lifestyles of Jammu Region: 17th to 19th Century A.D Raj Kumar&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally flowed to the ankles, is now of varying lengths and is worn with a loose suthan. [[Kashyap Bandhu]] is regarded as the person responsible for spreading the use of the suthan with the phiran amongst the communities that resisted to adopt its use, eventually leading to the use of the salwar.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Heritage of India- Kashmiri Pandit Contribution. The Publication of Kashmir Sabha, Calcutta (1999-2000) [http://koausa.org/vitasta/pdf/Vitasta1999-2000.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the traditional Kashmiri suthan is loose, similar to the styles worn in [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref&gt;Asoke Kumar Bhattacharyya, Pradip Kumar Sengupta Foundations of Indian Musicology: Perspectives in the Philosophy of Art and Culture (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8EJw6O4VFFsC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=ghagra+in+himachal+pradesh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=igRuVbfNO-n5ywPdsoOoCg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=pheran&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; with some wearing styles similar to the Dogri suthan. The Punjabi salwar suit has also become popular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=x510VZv8Ece0UfCIgeAL&amp;id=PwM7AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=shalwar+kameez+kashmir&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=shalwar+kameez Dhar, Somnath  (1986) Jammu and Kashmir folklore]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], Muslim communities have traditionally worn the style of salwar worn by the [[Mughals]] combining them with [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] upper garments such as the jamma. However, the Punjabi salwar suit is now worn by members of various communities in India&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iY4bVR9--XAC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=punjab+kurta+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gph0VfTWNMPpUovugOgJ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=punjab%20kurta%20history&amp;f=false Subba, J.R (2008) History, Culture and Customs of Sikkim]&lt;/ref&gt; and Pakistan.

The traditional male dress in Bangladesh is the lungi and kurta (also called Panjabi). Men also wear the Pathani suit. The traditional female dress is the sari but women also wear the Punjabi salwar suit.

The salwar is a traditional garment in [[Afghanistan]] worn by men as the [[Khet partug]] outfit. The Khet is the tunic, similar to a robe and the partoog is the Afghanistan salwar, with multiple pleats. The male dress also includes the [[perahan tunban]].

'''''Scooby-Doo and the Goblin King''''' is a 2008 [[direct-to-DVD]] [[animation|animated]] [[comedy horror]] [[fantasy film]], and the twelfth in the series of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' direct-to-video films produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] (though it used a [[Hanna-Barbera]] logo at the end of the movie). It was dedicated to Paulette Oates, who helped resurrect Warner Bros. Animation in the late 1980s. All the main voice actors of Mystery, Inc. reprise their roles. The DVD was released on September 23, 2008. This is the first Scooby cartoon produced entirely without either one of the original creators, [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]].

Unlike the previous seven movies, this film is similar to ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island|Zombie Island]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost|Witch's Ghost]]'' (which previously featured [[Tim Curry]]), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders|Alien Invaders]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase|Cyber Chase]]'', by making all the fantastical elements of the story real.

==Plot==
The Mystery, Inc. gang visit a [[Halloween]] [[carnival]] on Halloween night. When the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] "The Amazing Krudsky" (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]) refuses to allow Scooby to see his show, he and Shaggy retaliate by exposing Krudsky as a fraud during one of his acts, resulting in the magician swearing revenge, his audience walking out on him, and the gang getting thrown out of the carnival. The rebellious [[Fairy]] Princess Willow (voiced by [[Hayden Panettiere]]) later enters Krudsky's tent, where he secretly reveals his wishes to become a real magician. The fairy inadvertently causes Krudsky to notice her on the [[Goblin]] Scepter in a spell book, which can be combined with fairy magic to control Halloween. Krudsky then gets an idea to obtain the scepter and rule the world with it. Willow decides to toy with him, but while flying, she accidentally slams her small body against a metal chair knocking her out; Krudsky then crushes her with his [[flyswatter]]. When he notices her cry of pain from being crushed, he sees that she is a real fairy, kidnaps her, and absorbs her magical powers, thus becoming a real magician.

Meanwhile, Scooby-Doo and the gang go [[trick-or-treating]] all night. Shaggy's and Scooby's last stop is a spooky looking house which claims to be a "genuine magic shoppe". However, a very loud thunderstorm also begins, frightening the heroes. Inside, they meet the kind proprietor of the magic shop Mr. Gibbles (voiced by [[Wallace Shawn]]), who reveals to the duo that magic really does exist. At that moment, Willow enters being chased by Krudsky; he captures her and turns Gibbles into a [[rabbit]], and steals the magic equipment before leaving. Mr. Gibbles explains to an astonished Shaggy and Scooby that Krudsky, after capturing the good magic of the princess, will now want the bad magic held in the scepter of the Goblin King, which will, as well, cause an imbalance in the supernatural order which will make Halloween remain forever and as a result will turn every human into horrifying monsters. Shaggy and Scooby board the Grim Reaper Railway which flies them to the spirit world. Once they arrive, the two realize that they need to get the scepter before Krudsky can, and return home before sunrise or else they will be trapped in the magic world forever. Before they depart, Gibbles gives them magic cards that perform spells just by reading the inscription on each one; however, the deck has to be saved for emergencies because each card can only be used once and each spell is temporary. To make it less suspicious-looking, Shaggy and Scooby are magically disguised by being transformed into monster-like versions of themselves.

While looking for Shaggy and Scooby, Fred, Daphne and Velma see Krudsky conversing with the Goblin King through a mirror where the Goblin King (voiced by [[Tim Curry]]) reluctantly agrees to exchange his scepter for Princess Willow at midnight at a clock tower. However, seeing that all the evil magic and the Goblin King are real causes Velma's rational mind to shut down and Velma herself to fall unconscious; Fred and Daphne leave Velma to rest and go to the tower and set a trap for both the Goblin King and Krudsky.

Back in the magic world, Shaggy and Scooby go to a bar owned by a [[werewolf]] (also voiced by [[Tim Curry]]). During the song "Bump in the Night", Shaggy adds in the lyric on how to get to the Goblin King's castle. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo find that everyone is afraid of the Goblin King and will not help them upon running off. The Goblin King's two bumbling goblin henchmen, Glob and Glum (voiced by [[James Belushi]] and [[Larry Joe Campbell]]), attempt to capture Scooby and Shaggy, but the latter two are saved and lead away by [[Jack-o'-lantern|Jack O'Lantern]] (voiced by [[Jay Leno]]), a living pumpkin who leads them to three [[Witchcraft|witches]] while running away from the [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]]. Along the way, they narrowly avoid the chasing monster (who was Jack's former body) by heading across a covered bridge which he cannot cross. The three of them arrive at the [[Witchcraft|Witches]]' Hut where they meet the Grand Witch (voiced by [[Lauren Bacall]]) and her two fellow witches (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] and [[Russi Taylor]]). The witches send Shaggy and Scooby on a ride on their flying broomstick nicknamed "Broomy" towards the Goblin King's castle, but they are shot down by Glob and Glum by a goblin gun-like cannon.

Crash-landing in a small fairy village, Shaggy and Scooby find three fairies named Sparkplug, Honeybee and Tiddlywink, who help them to the Goblin King's castle entrance. Reluctantly using a potion from the witches (made from someone called "Scratch"), Shaggy and Scooby disguise themselves as Daphne (Shaggy) and Velma (Scooby) in order for Glob and Glum to let them into the castle. Only a few minutes away from midnight, Shaggy and Scooby try to run off with the scepter, but are captured and sent to the dungeon by the Goblin King who heads off to meet with Krudsky. At the clock tower, Krudsky and the Goblin King are almost through with their trade when Fred and Daphne release a trap and run off with the fairy princess. But the trap only catches the Goblin King and Krudsky takes the scepter, turning himself into the new Goblin King before turning the Goblin King into a [[goose]].

Krudsky and his new goblin army set off to take over the world. He turns the Mystery Machine into a living monster vehicle called the "Monstrous Machine" to chase Fred, Daphne, and the now-awakened Velma. The goblins capture the three and Krudsky uses his newfound powers to turn Fred into a [[vampire]], Daphne into a [[Witchcraft|witch]], and Velma into a [[werewolf]] (respectively). At that moment, however, Scooby, Shaggy and Jack O'Lantern arrive having been saved from the dungeon before sunrise by the fairies and Broomy. Jack apparently sacrifices himself to strip Krudsky of the staff of which Scooby uses to break Krudsky's spells, restoring his friends, the Mystery Machine, Mr. Gibbles, and the Goblin King back to normal where he reclaims his staff from Scooby-Doo and then uses his restored powers to imprison Krudsky.

The Goblin King is revealed to be Willow's father who holds her responsible for all the trouble caused and grounds her for a year as punishment, though he does admits that he is relieved to have her back. Mr. Gibbles brings Jack back to life with the Goblin King's help, who then takes Krudsky prisoner for both his crimes and treachery (the Goblin King tells him that he will have plenty of time to "work on his act"). He, the goblin army, Willow, Jack, Broomy and Mr. Gibbles all leave and return to the magical world. But before departing and to also keep the balance between the worlds, the Goblin King uses one final spell to erase the memory of the events from Fred's, Daphne's, Velma's, and the others' minds. However, Scooby and Shaggy are allowed to keep theirs as they have proven their courage.

As morning comes, Fred, Daphne and Velma forget what transpired (due to the effects of the memory-erasing spell) as Shaggy and Scooby-Doo come to pick them up. As the carnival packs up, Scooby uses an unpacked mirror one last time to spook the gang as the film ends.

==About Author==
[[Parijat (writer)|Parijat]] was the nom de plume of Bishnu Kumari Waiba (1937-1993), a novelist, poet, and short story writer. Born in Darjeeling, India where she completed part of her schooling, she moved to Kathmandu, Nepal where she spent the rest of her life. Her first novel '''The Blue Mimosa.'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10579671-blue-mimosa&lt;/ref&gt;  ({{lang-ne|शिरिषको फूल}}) was published in 1965. The novel received '''Madan Puraskar''', the award offered in Nepal for ''The Best Book Of The Year.'' She was, and still is regarded as the first modern novelist of Nepal. The novel is highly acclaimed in Nepali literature, proving to introduce Nepalese Literature in a global platform. It has been translated and adapted in the literature curriculum of some colleges in some English speaking countries.

==Summary==

Parijat is the pseudonym name claimed by Bishnu Kumari Waiba. In her book, Sirish ko Phool (Blue Mimosa), 1965, she writes through a male narrative.  The flip of gender binaries strategically positions herself in the patriarchal environment during that time period and opens up a dialogue between the two. 

The book enters a post war veteran sub context as the narrator that is engaged in various forms of communication of love and life and delves into the preconceived structures of gender binaries. It analyses and makes way for a critical dialogue about the complexities of identities and trauma. It highlights the irrelevance of a patriarchal community during a time of toxic patriarchy.

==Plot==
''Suyogbir,45,'' is the main male protagonist. An ex-army serviceman Suyog fought against Japan in the second world war but being poor hearted was not even able to kill a single soldier and had not received any medal. Although his village is in hills, he lives in Kathmandu valley. His daily routine has become to drink alcohol in the evenings in the bar. He brutally raped and murdered several indigenous girls and he remembers several incidents during the war.

He meets and becomes friend with ''Shivaraj'' in the bar. Shivaraj has three sisters: Mujura, Sakambari and Sanu. Suyogbir unknowingly becomes near to them all and falls in love with Sakambari but he finds difficult to tell her. One day finding her alone, he kisses her revealing his love towards her.

Later, ''Suyogbir'' stops visiting ''Shivaraj'' and his family. He later knows Sakambari was ill and one day he comes to know ''Sakambari'' has committed suicide.

Suyog concludes even one sided love kills.

== Translated Version ==
This book has been translated as Blue Mimosa by Orchid Books and it was published in 2010

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6421">[[Image:skullion.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[David Jason]] as 'Skullion' in ''[[Porterhouse Blue#TV mini-series|Porterhouse Blue]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Skullion''' is a central character in ''[[Porterhouse Blue]]'' (1974) and ''[[Grantchester Grind]]'' (1995), two novels about life in the fictitious [[Porterhouse College, Cambridge|Porterhouse College]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] novelist [[Tom Sharpe]]. For centuries, Porterhouse College has been renowned for its cuisine, the prowess of its rowers and the low level of its academic achievements. Since the College was founded there have been Skullions at Porterhouse. 

Skullion is the Head [[Porter (college)|Porter]] at the College, a responsibility he has held for many years and which he takes very seriously indeed. 

==Head Porter of Porterhouse College==

[[Image:Porterhouse Blue Book.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;Cover of 'Porterhouse Blue'&lt;/center&gt;]]
James Skullion's first contact with Porterhouse College came when, as a young boy, he carried the students' cases for sixpence when they arrived at the railway station at Cambridge, running beside their cabs to help unload them at the College. He became a Porter at Porterhouse in 1937 and served in the [[Royal Marines]] during the [[Second World War]]. He became the Head Porter in 1949. In the books, Skullion has worked at the College for forty-five years, has served seven Masters, and sees himself as a link with the College's great and glorious past; as such he regards it as his duty to maintain the standards of bygone years. Porterhouse is not an academic college; rather, it is a club for gentlemen, where admission depends on rank and wealth and where degrees can be bought. This often involves a brighter substitute from another college being paid to take the place of the Porterhouse student in the examination. Based on their fraudulent degrees, many of these students have gone on to obtain positions of great power in government and industry. These men are known as '' 'Skullion's Scholars' ''. He keeps their names on a list, knowing it will be useful one day.

When the Master of Porterhouse dies without naming his successor, the College Visitor, the Queen, takes the [[Prime Minister|Prime Minister's]] advice and appoints [[Sir Godber Evans]] (a former student at the College) as his successor. Sir Godber, having been pressured by his wealthy [[left-wing]] wife, Lady Mary, announces sweeping changes to the centuries of College tradition, much to the concern of Skullion and the [[Fellow]]s, who plan a [[counter attack]] to the proposed [[Condom machine|contraceptive machines]], women students, and a self-service canteen. He also intends to sell the row of houses where the College servants live.

Skullion contemptuously remembers Sir Godber from his student days as not being a gentleman as he had been educated at a [[grammar school]]. Skullion is sacked for insolence by Sir Godber, the new Master, and is forced to leave his home. He appears live on a television programme in which he reveals all of the College's murky secrets, and refers to his list of '' 'Skullion's Scholars' '', to the horror of Sir Godber and the College's Senior Fellows, but to the amusement of everybody else. 

Skullion returns to Cambridge, determined to ask for his job back in return for donating a large inheritance he has received to the College. He confronts Sir Godber who treats him with pity and contempt. This angers Skullion's sense of pride, and he advances menacingly on Sir Godber, who, backing away in fear, trips and bangs his head. He is found dying by the Dean and Senior Tutor and tries to tell them who is responsible. They misunderstand his meaning and believe that he has named Skullion as his successor as Master. They inform Skullion of this and he suffers a '' 'Porterhouse Blue' '', a [[stroke]], but survives and is installed as Master of the College.

==Master of Porterhouse==
[[Image:grantchestergrind.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;Cover of ''Grantchester Grind''&lt;/center&gt;]]
In ''[[Grantchester Grind]]'' the wheel-chair bound Skullion is still Master, but is showing signs of physical frailty. The mystery surrounding the death of the previous Master, Sir Godber Evans, prompts his widow, the millionairess Lady Mary, to instigate a plan to investigate the death through a planted Fellow, Dr Purefoy Osbert, backed by a large, anonymous donation to Porterhouse. 

At the same time, the Dean decides to look for a new Master for the College, preferably a wealthy one, to replace Skullion; he drives around the country visiting Old Porterthusians (previous students at Porterhouse), including [[Lord Jeremy Pimpole]], (who is now a chronic alcoholic with a sexual predilection for sheep and dogs), in the hope that he will find one is willing to become Master. None is suitable. Meanwhile, the College Bursar is contacted by the American media and drug-running [[billionaire]] Edgar Hartang, who seems to be interested in supporting the College without clarifying what it is he wants in return. Knowing that Dr Osbert is eavesdropping, Skullion admits that he murdered Sir Godber Evans. He is immediately and secretly sent to ''Porterhouse Park'', an unpleasant retirement home for the College's mad or troublesome Fellows. He escapes from here with the assistance of Dr Osbert, and returns to Porterhouse and confronts the Fellows. As is his right as Master, Skullion nominates the new Master of the College, the alcoholic Lord Pimpole.

==Skullion in film==
In 1987 ''[[Porterhouse Blue]]'' was adapted for television as ''[[Porterhouse Blue (TV series)|Porterhouse Blue]]'' by [[Malcolm Bradbury]] for [[Channel 4]], with [[David Jason]] playing the role of Skullion,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092428/ ''Porterhouse Blue'' on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  and winning a [[BAFTA]] for Best Actor for the role.

Social responsibility must be intergenerational since the actions of one generation have consequences on those following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Invernizzi|first=Diletta Colette|last2=Locatelli|first2=Giorgio|last3=Brookes|first3=Naomi J.|date=2017-10-01|title=Managing social challenges in the nuclear decommissioning industry: A responsible approach towards better performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786316304586|journal=International Journal of Project Management|series=Social Responsibilities for the Management of Megaprojects|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1350–1364|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses can use ethical decision making to secure their businesses by making decisions that allow for government agencies to minimize their involvement with the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Kaliski, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; For instance if a company follows the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) guidelines for emissions on dangerous pollutants and even goes an extra step to get involved in the community and address those concerns that the public might have; they would be less likely to have the EPA investigate them for environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Kali-ski, B. (Ed.). Ethics in Management. (2001). Encyclopedia of Business and Finance (2nd ed., Vol. 1). New York: Macmillan Reference.p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; "A significant element of current thinking about privacy, however, stresses "self-regulation" rather than market or government mechanisms for protecting personal information".&lt;ref&gt;Swire, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; According to some experts, most rules and regulations are formed due to public outcry, which threatens [[profit maximization]] and therefore the well-being of the shareholder, and that if there is not an outcry there often will be limited regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/social.pdf | title = Social Irresponsibility in Management | author = J.

Some critics argue that corporate social responsibility (CSR) distracts from the fundamental economic role of businesses; others argue that it is nothing more than superficial window-dressing, or "[[greenwashing]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alejos Góngora|first1=Claudia Lucía|title=Greenwashing: Only the Appearance of Sustainability|journal=IESE|date=2013|url=http://www.ieseinsight.com/doc.aspx?id=1714&amp;ar=17&amp;idioma=2|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; others argue that it is an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful corporations though there is no systematic evidence to support these criticisms. A significant number of studies have shown no negative influence on shareholder results from CSR but rather a slightly negative correlation with improved shareholder returns.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, M., Bauer, T. &amp; Eiderdown, B. (2010). [http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/pub/principles-management-v1.1/128820#pdf-21 ''Principles of Management v1.1.''] Arlington, NY: Flat World Knowledge.p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate social responsibility==
{{Main article|Corporate Social Responsibility}}
Corporate social responsibility or CSR has been defined by [[Lord Holme]] and [[Richard Watts]] in the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]'s publication "Making Good Business Sense" as "…the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as the local community and society at large."
CSR is one of the newest management strategies where companies try to create a positive impact on society while doing business. Evidence suggests that CSR taken on voluntarily by companies will be much more effective than CSR mandated by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=1 December 2012|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no clear-cut definition of what CSR comprises. Every company has different CSR objectives though the main motive is the same. All companies have a two-point agenda—to improve qualitatively (the management of people and processes) and quantitatively (the impact on society). The second is as important as the first and stake holders of every company are increasingly taking an interest in "the outer circle"-the activities of the company and how these are impacting the environment and society.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate social responsibility http://www.mallenbaker.net/csr/definition.php p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The other motive behind this is that the companies should not be focused only on maximization of profits.

While many corporations include social responsibility in their operations, it is still important for those procuring the goods and services to ensure the products are [[Social sustainability|socially sustainable]]. Verification tools are available from a  multitude of entities internationally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/542/resources-verifying-sustainable-products|title=Resources for Verifying Sustainable Products   - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[UL (safety organization)|Underwriters Laboratories]] environmental standards, [http://levelcertified.org/ BIFMA], [[Biobased product|BioPreferred]], and [[Green Seal]]. These resources help corporations and their consumers identify potential risks associated with a product's [[Life Cycle Analysis|lifecycle]] and enable end users to confirm the corporation's practices adhere to social responsibility ideals.

==Scientists and engineers==

One common view is that scientists and engineers are morally responsible for the negative consequences which result from the various applications of their knowledge and inventions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 14, "Critical Science and Social Responsibility", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby, W. (2000). "Science, technology, and social responsibility", ''Interdisciplinary Science reviews'', 25 (1):20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, J.T. (1975). "Scientific freedom and responsibility", ''Science'', 188 (4189):687–693.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, J.T. (1981). "Two aspects of scientific responsibility".''Science'', 212 (4490):11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forge, J. (2008). ''The Responsible Scientist'', University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After all, if scientists and engineers take personal pride in the many positive achievements of science and technology, why should they be allowed to escape responsibility for the negative consequences related to the use or abuse of scientific knowledge and technological innovations?&lt;ref&gt;Ziman, J. 1971. "Social responsibility (I) — The impact of social responsibility on science." ''Impact of Science on Society'',21(2):113–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, scientists and engineers have a collective responsibility for the choice and conduct of their work. Committees of scientists and engineers are often involved in the planning of governmental and corporate research programs, including those devoted to the development of military technologies and weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, F. (1972). '"Social ethics and the conduct of science – Specialization and the fragmentation of responsibility", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 196(4):213–222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leitenberg, M. (1971). "Social responsibility (II) — The classical scientific ethic and strategic-weapons development", ''Impact of Science on Society'', 21(2):123–136.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many professional societies and national organizations, such as the [[National Academy of Science]] and the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the United States, have ethical guidelines (see [[Engineering ethics]] and [[Research ethics]] for the conduct of scientific research and engineering).&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, ''On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research'', The National Academies Press, 1995, http://www.nap.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
Clearly, there is recognition that scientists and engineers, both individually and collectively, have a special and much greater responsibility than average citizens with respect to the generation and use of scientific knowledge.

It has been pointed out that the situation is, unfortunately, not that simple and scientists and engineers should not be blamed for all the evils created by new scientific knowledge and technological innovations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; First, there is the common problem of fragmentation and diffusion of responsibility. Because of the intellectual and physical division of labor, the resulting fragmentation of knowledge, the high degree of specialization, and the complex and hierarchical decision-making process within corporations and government research laboratories, it is exceedingly difficult for individual scientists and engineers to control the applications of their innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, F. (1972). "Social ethics and the conduct of science – Specialization and the fragmentation of responsibility", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 196(4):213–222.&lt;/ref&gt; This fragmentation of both work and decision-making results in fragmented moral accountability, often to the point where "everybody involved was responsible but none could be held responsible."&lt;ref&gt;Lowrance, W.W. (1985). ''Modern science and human values'', Oxford University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is ignorance. The scientists and engineers cannot predict how their newly generated knowledge and technological innovations may be abused or misused for destructive purposes in the near or distant future. While the excuse of ignorance is somewhat acceptable for those scientists involved in very basic and fundamental research where potential applications cannot be even envisioned, the excuse of ignorance is much weaker for scientists and engineers involved in applied scientific research and technological innovation since the work objectives are well known. For example, most corporations conduct research on specific products or services that promise to yield the greatest possible profit for share-holders. Similarly, most of the research funded by governments is mission-oriented, such as protecting the environment, developing new drugs, or designing more lethal weapons. In all cases where the application of scientific knowledge and technological innovation is well known ''a priori'', it is impossible for a scientist or engineer to escape responsibility for research and technological innovation that is morally dubious.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, J.R. (1996). ''Scientific knowledge and its social problems'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; As John Forge writes in ''Moral Responsibility and the Ignorant Scientist'': "Ignorance is not an excuse precisely because scientists can be blamed for being ignorant."&lt;ref&gt;Forge, J. (2000). "Moral responsibility and the ignorant scientist",  ''Science and Engineering Ethics'', 6(3):341–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of view is that responsibility falls on those who provide the funding for the research and technological developments, which in most cases are corporations and government agencies. Furthermore, because taxpayers provide indirectly the funds for government-sponsored research, they and the politicians that represent them, i.e., society at large, should be held accountable for the uses and abuses of science.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, J., and F. Huang. (2005). "Should we make a fuss? A case for social ''Nature Biotechnology'', 23(12):1479–1480.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to earlier times when scientists could often conduct their own research independently, today's experimental research requires expensive laboratories and instrumentation, making scientists dependent on those who pay for their studies.

'''Stand Ye Guamanians''' ({{lang-ch|Fanohge Chamoru}}), generically known as '''The Guam Hymn''', is the official territorial anthem of [[Guam]]. 

==History and usage==
Adopted in 1919, the words and music were written in English by Dr. Ramon Manalisay Sablan. The Chamorro translation was the work of [[Lagrimas L.G. Untalan]], and it is this later version that enjoys wider usage today.

As a [[United States dependency]], the official [[national anthem]] is still the "[[Star Spangled Banner]]", which is always played before the Guam Hymn on official occasions. The Guam Hymn, however, is played alone at international sports competitions.

==Lyrics==

=== Chamorro  ===
:{{lang|ch|Fanohge Chamoru put i tano'-ta
:Kånta i ma tunå-ña gi todu i lugåt.
:Para i onra, para i gloria

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15869">{{About|the pseudolegal theory||Straw man (disambiguation)}}
'''Strawman theory''' (also called the '''Strawman illusion''') is a [[pseudolaw|pseudolegal]] theory prevalent in various movements such as [[sovereign citizen]], [[tax protestor]], [[freeman on the land]], and the [[redemption movement]]. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the "strawman"). The idea is that an individual’s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|"SPLC1"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: The [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster,{{R|"FBI"}}. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|"IRS"}}{{R|"Lii"}}

== About ==

Strawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' ("decrease of head"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|"Mackenzie1862"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it "Capitis Diminutio" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual’s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a "strawman".{{R|"Weill"}}

The theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|"SPLC1"}}

Proponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the "straw man," and John Doe is the baby's "real" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|"SPLC1"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protestors, "commercial redemption" and "get out of debt free" scams claim that one’s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Person"}} and a misunderstanding of the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Jperson"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|"Blacks_Nperson"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|"CanadaLaw"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|"Lovejoy"}}

Believers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings in are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, "no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land”.{{R|"MagnaCarta"}}

Freemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their various liabilities, responsibilities, and laws. This is typically attempted by denying they are a person in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|"Williams"}}

Judge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|"Moon"}}

It is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for "sounding the same") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|"Blacks_Idem"}} The earliest legal precedent is R v Davis in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|"ARCHBOLD1867"}}

{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}

|''United States v. Washington'' (1996)
|Kurt Washington
|Kurt Washington was charged with two counts of tax evasion. As part of the proceedings, he filed a motion to dismiss the charges on numerous grounds, including that the person charged was a strawman.
|"...the defendant contends that the Indictment must be dismissed because “KURT WASHINGTON,” spelled out in capital letters, is a fictitious name used by the Government to tax him improperly as a business, and that the correct spelling and presentation of his name is “Kurt Washington.” This contention is baseless."{{R|"Washington1996"}}
|-
|''State of Colorado v. Drew''
|Donald James Drew
|Donald Drew was previously convicted after pleading guilty to first degree kidnapping and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. Drew then filed a motion to vacate that conviction.
|“The core of defendant’s argument on appeal is that (1) he was born Donald James Drew, and the person charged in this matter was DONALD JAMES DREW; (2) the capitalization of the name created a “Strawman/Stramineous Homo/Ens Legis/ Artificial Person” (artificial person); (3) the artificial person was convicted; (4) he has been incarcerated as surety chattel or security for the artificial person; and (5) he has been denied due process. “Claims so premised are patently frivolous and without merit.”{{R|"Drew"}}
|-

|''Jaeger v. Dubuque County''
|Raymond Jaeger (plaintiff)
|Raymond Jaeger filed a $2M lawsuit against Iowa state law enforcement &amp; Department of Natural Resources, alleging illegal search and seizure. The ruling was made in response to a motion to strike the presented active defense. 
|"The court finds Jaeger’s arguments concerning capitalization otherwise specious. The court routinely capitalizes the names of all parties before this court in all matters, civil and criminal, without any regard to their corporate or individual status...Jaeger’s motions to strike are denied as to improper capitalization."{{R|"Jaeger"}}
|-

|''United States v. Furman''
|William Michael Furman
|William Furman was charged with two counts of conspiracy related to a scheme to defraud a bank and launder money. After being convicted, Furman filed an appeal based on the strawman theory, alleging both a literal misspelling of his name and the "improper" capitalizations typically seen in such arguments.
|"Here, the difference between "Micheal" and "Michael" is a mere transposition of letters with presumably little (if any) auditory significance, and the difference between "WILLIAM MICHAEL FURMAN" and "William Michael Furman" is a mere change of case with absolutely no auditory significance."{{R|"Furman"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19630">'''System information modelling''' ('''SIM''') is a generic term used to describe the process of modelling complex connected systems. '''System information models''' are digital representations of connected systems, such as [[Instrumentation and control engineering|electrical instrumentation and control]], [[Electric power system|power]] and [[Communications system|communication]] systems. The objects modelled in a SIM have a 1:1 relationship with the objects in the physical system. Components, connections and functions are defined and linked as they would be in the real world.

== Origins ==
The concept of SIM has existed since the mid 1990s. It was first proposed in 1994 by an Australian instrument, electrical and control system engineering company – I&amp;E Systems Pty Ltd. Like many technological innovations the idea for SIM was born out of necessity. Since the mid-nineties, the complexity of power, control and [[Information and communications technology|Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) systems has been growing exponentially due to rapid advances in technology; this has rendered the traditional paper-based methodologies and applications used for system design to become obsolete.

The cost of design related activities can be up to 70% of the total project expenditure in an electrical instrumentation and control system (EICS) engineering project. Analyses revealed that the limited nature of paper-based methods/workflows had significant contributions to the high design cost which required duplication of information on multiple documents resulting in design errors and omissions and therefore increasing the cost of labour. With this in mind, the company realized there is a need to shift away from the traditional paper-based methods to a more efficient systematic digital modelling approach.

The term 'System Information Modelling' was first published in a technical report in 2012 by Peter E.D. Love and Jingyang Zhou.&lt;ref&gt;Love, P.E.D., and Zhou, J. (2012). Documentation Errors in Instrumentation and Electrical Systems: Toward Systems Information Modelling. School of Built Environment for I&amp;E Systems, SoBE 100/2012, Curtin University, July, Perth, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The report presented empirical evidence to demonstrate that the use of a SIM could potentially improve productivity and reduce the cost to produce EICS documentation. The research examined a set of electrical engineering drawings of an Iron Ore Stacker Conveyor system; errors and omissions identified from the drawings have been classified and quantified. The report concluded that the use of traditional [[Computer-aided design|Computer-Aided-Design]] (CAD) methods to produce electrical engineering drawings is ineffective, inefficient and costly.

Since 2013, a number of scholarly research papers have been published that have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of using a SIM instead of CAD to design and document EICS in a variety of projects (e.g., [[iron ore]] processing plant, [[Floating production storage and offloading|FPSO]] safety control system, copper [[Smelting|smelter]] plant, [[oil refinery]], and a [[Geothermal electricity|geothermal power plant]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter E.D.

== Definition ==
''System Information Modelling can be defined as the process of digitally modelling a complex connected system. A System Information Model is a shared information resource of a system forming a reliable basis of knowledge during its [[Systems development life cycle|life-cycle]].''

== Throughout the life-cycle ==
A SIM containing all the project information can be applied throughout the entire life-cycle of the project.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Design ===
Engineering design and documentation can be undertaken simultaneously when using a SIM. A SIM can be created as the design of an EICS progresses. [[Drafter|Draftsman]] and modellers are no longer required. When a SIM is applied to the design of a connected system, all physical equipment and the associated connections to be constructed can be modelled in a [[relational database]]. Components are classified according to 'Type' and 'Location' attributes. The 'Type' attribute is used to define equipment functionalities. The 'Location' attribute is used to describe the physical position of equipment. Connections between equipment are modelled as 'connectors'. To facilitate the design, attributes, such as a device module, specifications and vendor manuals can be assigned and attached to each individual object.

When the design process is complete, a read only copy of the model is created, exported and made available to other project team members.  The users can access all or part of the design information within the SIM regarding to their respective authorization levels. Private user data can be established and attached to the model.

=== Procurement and construction ===
When the design is approved for construction, a SIM, which is a digital realization of the design, can be issued to different parties such as the [[procurement]] team and [[construction]] contractors. [[Information management]] can be achieved digitally and the role of paper drawings is eliminated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The procurement plan and construction schedule can be created for each individual object in the SIM. Construction activities can be assigned to objects or work-packs with weighting factors defined. This enables the managers to be able to track the progresses of the procurement and construction detailed to individual object level and make informed decisions.

=== Asset management ===
A SIM is specifically useful for asset managers, as it enables information to be stored in a single digital model.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a traditional CAD-based environment paper drawings are typically handed over to the asset owner in the form of [[Technical drawing|'As Built' drawings]], which reflect, in theory, the actual construction of every system, component and connection of a project. If an asset manager wants to maintain, repair or upgrade any portion of the asset, then the 'As Built' drawings need to be used. However, recovering information contained on an array of drawings is a tedious and time consuming task. Any error or omission contained within the drawings will potentially hinder the interpretation of the design.

When engineering is undertaken using a SIM it can be stored in a digital format whereby a 1:1 mapping is undertaken. Operations such as test, calibration, inspection, repair, minor change and isolation can be defined and scheduled within the SIM. The SIM data can also be conveniently exported and input into other third party asset management applications to comply with the owners' asset management strategy. In addition, the SIM can act as a training tool, which can be used regularly to assist operators to become familiar with the design.

== Software ==
A commercial proprietary software package, Digital Asset Delivery (DAD), has been developed based on the concept of SIM by I&amp;E Systems Pty Ltd.

The initial version of DAD was released in 1997 which was primarily a modelling tool used to design and document the electrical engineering system. Since born DAD has been tested and applied to many projects including but not limited to greenfield and brownfield, power, control and ICT systems. The DAD software has been continuously maintained and upgraded to cater for complex and rapid changing EICS projects. The latest release of DAD is version 12 which incorporates of a number of 'Portals' that can be applied to the entire life-cycle of a project including SIM Design Portal, Review Portal, Procurement Portal, Construction Portal, Commissioning Portal and Maintenance Portal. It also provides a facility to create Process Layers, Power Layers, Functional Layers and Comms layers to help to further understand the way a system operates.

== International development ==
The concept of SIM has been applied and verified in a number of international projects.

=== Australia ===
There are a number of Australian-based organisations in various industry sectors benefitting from SIM technology. A few examples:

[[Fortescue Metals Group]] (FMG) based in Western Australia has adopted SIM for all their projects built since 2010. These projects include the large scale [[Fortescue Metals Group|Solomon Iron Ore project]], the expansion of their export port facility and the North Star magnetite project. FMG acknowledges that using SIM on these projects resulted in large savings and more efficient project execution and that it continues to provide benefits for the operation of these facilities.

Opticomm builds, owns and operates a large [[Optical fiber|fibre optic]] communications network which connects tens of thousands of residential and commercial properties. Their network is totally modelled using SIM and all their construction and operations activities are based on the information in their SIM based information model.

In 2016, [[Perth Airport|Perth International Airport]] adopted the SIM and they had their power distribution network modelled using this technology. The electrical components and cable objects in their SIM are linked to the objects in their [[geographic information system]] (GIS). This seamlessly provides full system technical and geographical information about all their electrical system components and cables. Perth Airport has plans to expand the use of SIM to their other connected systems like runway lighting systems, and communication networks.

=== China ===
SIM has been applied to model and manage the electrical and communication systems of the [[Wuhan Metro]] Stations in China in 2014. In 2016, a SIM model was created to digitize the [[distributed control system]] (DCS) of the Wuhan International Expo Centre. Since 2014, a number of research projects have been undertaken by the BIM Centre of [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]] including SIM application, linking SIM to BIM and linking SIM to Engineering Information Modelling (EIM).

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In 2015, SIM was applied by a large Japanese Engineering and Construction company to model the electrical and instrumentation systems on a very large new oil refinery project in Saudi Arabia. The SIM was used as the basis for management of all procurement and construction activities through Procurement and Construction Portals.

== SIM and BIM ==
System information modelling is different from [[building information modeling]], though both focus on sharing knowledge and information. The process of BIM has been defined as:

'''[[Building information modeling]]''' ('''BIM''') is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. A '''BIM''' is a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition.

A SIM is akin to BIM; 'Building' is replaced with 'System' to represent the process of modeling complex connected systems, such as electrical control, power and communications, which do not possess geometry. Essentially, a SIM takes a discipline specific perspective to model complex connected systems, but can be integrated with a building information model when a [[single source of truth|single point of truth]] is formed.

The traditional way of documenting the design of the connected system is to use 2D drawings that are created by draftsmen and consist of various views that must be used jointly to form an integrated design. As the drawings are created manually and the information for a component could be represented on several different drawings, the propensity for errors, omission, conflicts and duplications to materialize significantly increases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since the mid 1970s, there has been a trend to replace the traditional manually drafted drawings with computer aided digital drawings. Though efficiencies in creating drawings has been improved since the introduction of CAD, there remains an over reliance on the production of paper based documentation despite the emergence of 'digital' engineering. With the introduction of SIM, productivity benefits can be achieved, particularly during the operations and maintenance of assets for EICS.

SIM is not restricted to the EICS, power and communication systems. It can be used to model a variety of connected systems such as [[network topology]], causal loop and interactions between people and organizations. The application scope of SIM is beyond the 'physical facility' that has been defined for BIM, which enables the SIM to be applicable to model both the physical and virtual networks of the connected systems.

== Extended applications ==
A SIM can be linked to Geographical Information Systems to support the management of spatial information. For example, a SIM model with components assigned by coordinates can be linked to [[Google Earth]] to show the real physical locations of the components. A SIM can also be linked to third party 3D models, using applications such as [[Navisworks|Autodesk Navisworks]], to gain spatial support and also provide detailed system data to the third parties. Interoperability can be achieved between SIM and a variety of technologies such as [[Image-based modeling and rendering|image modelling]], [[Google Maps]], [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], [[QR code|Quick Response code]], and [[radio-frequency identification]].

'''Table talk''' is a literary genre, a species of memoir. A collector (biographer, colleague, friend, etc.) records impromptu comments by some famous person (made generally at the dining table or in small get-togethers), in anticipation of their lasting value. The precedent in classical literature was the [[symposium]], such as the ''Table Talk'' of [[Plutarch]], though this was a supposed memoir of an occasion, rather than a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd M. Richardson|title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Art Discourse in the Sixteenth-century Netherlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPYQDqT9aVYC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6816-9|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phyllis Pray Bober|title=Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqDWvcWBL9sC&amp;pg=PA102|date=1 June 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06254-9|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis E.

"Table talk" may also refer to a similar informal conversation, more deliberately engaged in by the famous person, with the direct intent of publication (somewhat analogous to granting an interview).

==Collections==
Collections of such table talks by royal persons, celebrities, and other important personalities dating back to the 3rd century exist. The phrase ''table talk'' has been in use in the [[English language]] since the 16th century.

As examples, published table talks exist for:

* [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), see [[Table Talk (Luther)|''Table Talk'']];
* [[John Selden]] (1584–1654);
* [[John Milton]] (1608–1674);
* [[Samuel Johnson]] (1707–1784);
* [[Frederick the Great]] (1712–1786);
* [[Johann von Goethe]] (1749–1832);
* [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (1769–1821);
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827);
* [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] (1772–1834);
* [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (1799–1888);
* [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1856–1950);
* [[Adolf Hitler]] (1889–1945), see "[[Hitler's Table Talk]]";
* [[Orson Welles]] (1915–1985).

Occasionally, comments are collected from others by a notable person as part of that person's working notes and may survive in the papers of that person. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], for example, kept notes on the conversations of his family and friends, many of whom, of course, were noteworthy.

'''The Dot ''' is a work of art in [[Emmen (Drenthe)|Emmen]] ([[Netherlands]]). It is designed and painted by art collective the [[toyism|toyists]]. The Dot is a former gas container of which only two still exist in Europe. The toyists painted this monumental industrial object and linked it with the theme of Live with energy.

==History==
Toyist Dejo (founder of [[Toyism]]) came up with the idea of painting the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company [[Essent]] (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry , which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 meter high gas container. On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 116. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voormalige_gasbol.jpg|thumb|links|150px|Former gas container]]

==Transformation==
The transformation of the former (blue) gas container took several months to complete, from mid July 2009 until the unveiling on June 4 in 2010, with a winter break of two months. The project had 17 toyists from 7 different countries working for 6000 hours, they painted an area of 1250 m2 in multiple layers.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 61. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of this art work is live with energy. Figurative imagery in the painting tells the story of the history of energy production. There are four sub designs based on the four elements of life: earth (raw energy), water (hydroelectric power), fire (solar energy) and air (wind power). Each sub-design presents the combination or contrast of old and new forms of energy production and their applications (the sciences). In addition to these four fundamental themes, there is a single, central figure: the tree. The tree is a metaphor for life, energy, growth, development, and change. The province of Drenthe with its rich history of peat production is also represented in the painting. In addition, in the form of standalone motifs, general applications or containers of energy such as ecobunny lights and battery-insects can be seen moving throughout the whole painting.&lt;ref&gt;Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 108. {{ISBN|978-94-91196-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:THE DOT Live with Energy - Toyism.jpg|500px|Design of The Dot]]

==Restoration==
In the summer of 2015 The Dot was repainted. Over the years the paint had peeled off and The Dot needed to be restored to its former state. The toyists set up a crowdfunding project and, when enough money was collected, started the restoration.

In 2013 the toyists did a similar project in Keflavik, Iceland called [[Uppspretta]].

"'''Treehouse of Horror VI'''" is the sixth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]] and the sixth episode in the ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' series. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 29, 1995, and contains three self-contained segments. In "Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores", an ionic storm brings [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s oversized advertisements and billboards to life and they begin attacking the town. The second segment, "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace", is a parody of the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' film series, in which [[Groundskeeper Willie]] (resembling [[Freddy Krueger]]) attacks schoolchildren in their sleep. In the third and final segment, "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;", [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] finds himself trapped in a three dimensional world. It was inspired by ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone)|Little Girl Lost]]". The segments were written by [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Steve Tompkins]], and [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]] respectively.

An edited version of Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would appear alongside several other shorts in the 2000 American 3-D animated anthology film, [[CyberWorld]] shown in IMAX and IMAX 3D.

The first version of the episode was very long, so it featured a very short opening sequence and did not include several trademarks established in previous ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes. "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;", pitched by executive producer [[Bill Oakley]], features [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] computer animation provided by [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI). In the final scene of the episode, Homer is sent to the real world in the first ever live-action scene in ''The Simpsons''. "Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores" includes a cameo appearance from [[Paul Anka]], who sings the song "Just Don't Look".

In its original broadcast, the episode was watched by 22.9 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nielsen ratings |work=[[USA Today]] |author=USA Today|page=D3 |date=November 1, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 12.9, finishing 21st in the weekly ratings, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. In 1996, the "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;" segment was awarded the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] grand prize and the episode was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]].

==Plot==

===Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores===
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] goes to Lard Lad Donuts to get a "colossal doughnut". Upon realizing that the colossal doughnut is the name of the doughnut that Lard Lad holds and actual doughnuts that size do not exist, he denounces the store and vows to get a colossal doughnut. That night, he steals the giant doughnut from the Lard Lad statue in front of the store. In the midst of a freak storm, Lard Lad and other giant advertising statues come to life to terrorize [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Homer eventually returns the doughnut to Lard Lad, but that does not stop Lard Lad and his friends from causing destruction. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] goes to the ad agency that created those advertising characters, and an executive suggests the citizens stop paying attention to the monsters as they are advertising gimmicks, and attention is what keeps them motivated. He suggests a jingle will help distract people from watching the monsters. Lisa and [[Paul Anka]] later perform a catchy song and the citizens of Springfield stop looking at the monsters, who lose their powers and become lifeless.

===Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace===
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] has a nightmare that [[Groundskeeper Willie]] is out to kill him. He is slashed with a rake, and the scratches are still on his body after he wakes up. Many other students at [[Springfield Elementary School]] also say they were terrorized by Willie in their nightmares. When the students take a test, [[Martin Prince|Martin]] falls asleep and is strangled to death by Willie in his dream, before waking up and dying in the real world. Bart and Lisa tell [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] about the incident and she explains Willie burned to death while the parents of the students looked on and did nothing. Bart, Lisa, and Maggie try not to fall asleep for several days, but eventually, Bart decides that he is going to have to go to sleep and fight Willie in his dream. Bart falls asleep and attempts to find Willie, who appears as a lawn mower. Bart manages to trick Willie into mowing a sandbox containing quicksand, and Willie sinks. Willie recovers and turns into a giant bagpipe spider and is about to kill Bart as well as Lisa, who has entered the dream after also falling asleep. Suddenly, [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] appears and uses her pacifier to seal the vent on Willie's spider body, resulting in Willie exploding. The Simpsons children awaken and despite being pleased to be alive, Lisa fears that Willie might still be around. As it turns out, a very much alive and well Willie exits a bus and tries to scare the children, but ends up chasing the bus with one shoe when he realizes that he left his shotgun on board.

===Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
[[Patty and Selma]] visit the Simpsons, driving Bart, Lisa, and even the pets to evade them and consequently leave almost no place for Homer to hide. Desperate to avoid his wife's sisters, he looks behind a bookcase and enters a mysterious new world in which everything is in [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. Homer explores the peculiar area, and finds that he is trapped within. He seeks help from Marge and others, but their attempts to rescue him are fruitless.

Homer throws a cone into the floor and accidentally pierces the fabric of the space-time continuum, causing it to collapse into a [[wormhole]] threatening to pull Homer and the rest of the dimension into a [[black hole]]. Bart takes command and enters the third dimension to save Homer. Bart is unable to help, however, and the universe collapses on itself. Bart is pulled back into the house but Homer gets banished to the real world, lands in a [[dumpster]] in a [[live-action]] [[West Hollywood]], and begins to explore his surroundings.

==Production==
[[File:PaulAnka07.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Anka]] guest stars as himself. He had previously written a letter of thanks when he was referenced in another episode.]]
"Treehouse of Horror VI" was the first of two ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes to be executive produced by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]]. The episode was "so long" because, according to Oakley, "all three of these segments are very complex stories [...] and it's hard to fit three complete stories into 21 minutes". Because of the length, the episode featured a very short opening sequence and did not include several trademarks established in previous ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes, such as [[Treehouse of Horror#Opening sequence|Marge's warning]] or [[Treehouse of Horror#Wraparounds|wraparounds]].&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for "Treehouse of Horror VI", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The first segment, "Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores", was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], who had previously worked at an advertising agency.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for "Treehouse of Horror VI", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace" was written by [[Steve Tompkins]] and has been described by [[David X. Cohen]] as "one of the scariest [segments]".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, David X. (2005). Commentary for "Treehouse of Horror VI", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;" was written by Cohen, although the idea was pitched by Oakley. The original idea was that Homer would visit several dimensions, including one where everything was made out of paper cut-outs, but they decided that it would be too complicated.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt;

The episode includes a cameo appearance from [[Paul Anka]], who sings the song "Just Don't Look". Anka was briefly mentioned by Marge in "[[Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy]]". In response, he sent a letter to the producers in which he thanked them for the mention. After receiving the letter, they decided to ask him to guest star.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; According to [[David Mirkin]], he tried to get [[Al Gore]] to host the episode, but the producers got no response to their request. "There was an eerie silence", Mirkin said. He added that "if the VP decides now to pursue this showbiz offer, it's just too late [...] He missed his chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/07/17/1995-07-17_the_veep_ignores_chance_to_p.html |title=The Veep Ignores Chance To Play With The Simpsons |date=1995-07-17 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-12-23}} {{Dead link |date=April 2012 |bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final scene of the episode, Homer is sent to the real world in the first ever live-action scene in ''The Simpsons''. It was filmed on [[Ventura Boulevard]] in [[Studio City]]&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and directed by David Mirkin, who later said that Fox "couldn't have been less supportive" because they thought it would be too expensive.&lt;ref name=3D/&gt; The scene involves a [[crane shot]] which pulls back as the credits are shown. Fox "begrudgingly" allowed Mirkin to use a crane for the ending. The scene was filmed on a sidewalk with the crane on the street and Mirkin was not able to fully stop traffic for the shot. Because of this, when the camera swings around, a line of cars can be seen backed up on the street. Mirkin was also disappointed in the quality of the camera pan, again blaming the lack of support from Fox and the inability to halt the traffic.&lt;ref name=3D/&gt;

===Animation===
[[File:THOH6 - 3D transition.png|right|200px|thumb|In what [[Bill Oakley]] considers the "[[money shot]]", Homer steps into the 3D world]]
A large portion of "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;" was [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] and computer animated. Supervising director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] was aiming for something better than the computer animation used in the music video for "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" by [[Dire Straits]].&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for "Treehouse of Horror VI", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The animation was provided by [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI) and overseen by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]]. The animators at PDI worked closely with the normal animators on ''The Simpsons'' and worked hard not to "reinvent the character[s]". The animators storyboarded the segments and showed the PDI animators how they would have handled the scenes. While designing the 3D model of Bart, the animators did not know how they would show Bart's hair. However, they realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model. One of the most difficult parts for the PDI animators was to make Homer and Bart move properly without making them look robotic.&lt;ref name=3D/&gt;

One of the key shots in the segment was where Homer steps into the 3D world and his design transitions into 3D. Executive producer [[Bill Oakley]] considers the shot to be the "[[money shot]]" and had a difficult time communicating his idea to the animators.&lt;ref name=3D&gt;Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Johnson, Tim; Silverman, David; Mirkin, David; Cohen, David X. "Homer in the Third Dimension" (2005), in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

An edited version of Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would appear alongside several other shorts in the 2000 American 3-D animated anthology film, [[CyberWorld]] shown in IMAX and IMAX 3D.

===Background jokes===
Several background jokes were inserted into "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;". The PDI animators inserted a [[Utah teapot]], which was the first object to be rendered in 3D, and the numbers 734 (which on a phone pad correspond to PDI).&lt;ref name=3D/&gt; Several math equations were also inserted in the background. One of the equations that appears is ''1782&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; + 1841&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;=1922&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;''. Although a false statement, it appears to be true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision. If it were true, it would disprove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which had just been proven when this episode first aired. Cohen generated this "Fermat near-miss" with a computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/futurama/dxcinterview.html |title=A Futurama Math Conversation with David X.

This is a reference to the bestseller ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' by astrophysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], who was [[quadraplegic]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; In "Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores", some of the mascots are parodies of real life mascots. For example, the giant walking unnamed peanut is a parody of [[Mr. Peanut]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

Willie's bagpipe spider form is a reference to the fictional creature of the same name mentioned in an episode of ''[[The Goodies]]''.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "Treehouse of Horror VI" finished 21st in the ratings for the week of October 23 to October 29, 1995, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 12.9. It was watched in approximately 12.4 million households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Sports events five of top 10 shows |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=1995-11-02 |author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Nielsen Ratings |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=1995-11-02 |author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as "Complex, very assured and very clever, [...] The computer graphics are outstanding, and the final scene – as Homer enters our dimension – is one of the highlights of the entire series."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, "'Attack of the 50-Ft. Eyesores' stands as the strongest of the three segments. It doesn’t blast off the screen but it seems imaginative and fun. The ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' parody has its moments and comes across as generally entertaining. However, it lacks the bite the best pieces offer. Unfortunately, 'Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;' gives us the weakest of the bunch. It tosses out a few funny bits, but it mostly feels like an excuse to feature some 3-D animation."&lt;ref name=dvdmg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonstreehouseofhorror.shtml |title=The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror (1994) |accessdate=2008-10-08 |author=Jacobson, Colin |year=2003 |publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Budke of [[TV Squad]] listed "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;" as the fourth best ''Treehouse of Horror'' segment and gave honorable mention to "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Five: Best Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Segments |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2005/10/26/the-five-the-best-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-segments/ |author=Budke, Ryan J. |publisher=[[TV Squad]] |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Pfeifer of the ''[[Rockford Register Star]]'' called the episode "the best of the annual Halloween episodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Here's a look at five classic episodes |author=Pfeifer, Will |work=[[Rockford Register Star]] |date=2000-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
In 1996, the "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;" segment was awarded the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] grand prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawa.awn.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=311 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202123403/http://ottawa.awn.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=311 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-02 |title=Past Award Winners |accessdate=2007-10-18 |publisher=[[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]]" category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which the staff felt would have given it the edge.&lt;ref name="Emmys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search |publisher=Emmys.org |accessdate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215195726/http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode would eventually lose to ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''.

The definition of 'wearable computer' may be narrow or broad, extending to [[smartphone]]s or even ordinary [[wristwatch]]es. This article uses the broadest definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~thad/p/magazine/2002-1-no-longer-science-fiction.pdf|title = Wearable Computer: No Longer Science Fiction|last = Starner|first = Thad|date = January 2002|journal = Pervasive Computing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgizmo.com/evolution-of-smartwatches-infographic/|title=Evolution Of Smartwatches With Time: A Infographic Timeline {{!}} TopGizmo|website=TopGizmo|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearables may be for general use, in which case they are just a particularly small example of [[mobile computing]]. Alternatively they may be for specialized purposes such as [[fitness tracker]]s. They may incorporate special sensors such as [[accelerometer]]s, [[thermometer]] and [[Heart rate monitor|heart rate monitors]], or novel user interfaces such as [[Google Glass]], an [[optical head-mounted display]] controlled by gestures. It may be that specialized wearables will evolve into general all-in-one devices, as happened with the convergence of [[PDA]]s and mobile phones into smartphones.

Wearables are typically worn on the wrist (e.g. fitness trackers), hung from the neck (like a necklace), strapped to the arm or leg (smartphones when exercising), or on the head (as glasses or a helmet), though some have been located elsewhere (e.g. on a finger or in a shoe). Devices carried in a pocket or bag – such as [[smartphone]]s and before them [[pocket calculator]]s and [[PDA]]s, may or may not be regarded as 'worn'.

Wearable computers have various technical issues common to other [[mobile computing]], such as batteries, [[Thermal management (electronics)|heat dissipation]], [[software architecture]]s, [[wireless]] and [[personal area network]]s, and data management.&lt;ref&gt;O'donoghue, John, and John Herbert. "Data management within mHealth environments: Patient sensors, mobile devices, and databases." Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ) 4.1 (2012): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Many wearable computers are active all the time, e.g. processing or recording data continuously.

==Applications==
Wearable computers are not only limited to the computers such as fitness trackers, that are worn on wrists, they also includes wearables such as Heart pacemakers and other prosthetic.
It is used most often in research that focuses on behavioral modeling, health monitoring systems, IT and media development, where the person wearing the computer actually moves or is otherwise engaged with his or her surroundings. Wearable computers have been used for the following:

* general-purpose computing (e.g. [[smartphone]]s and [[smartwatch]]es)
* sensory integration, e.g. to help people see better or understand the world better (whether in task-specific applications like camera-based [[welding helmet]]s&lt;ref name=Quantigraphic&gt;{{Cite news |title=Quantigraphic camera promises HDR eyesight from Father of AR |work=SlashGear |author=Chris Davies |date= 12 September 2012 |url=http://www.slashgear.com/quantigraphic-camera-promises-hdr-eyesight-from-father-of-ar-12246941/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for everyday use like [[Google Glass]]
* [[behavioral modeling]]
* [[health care]] [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] [[system]]s
* [[service management]]
* [[E-textiles|electronic textile]]s and [[fashion design]], e.g. Microsoft's 2011 prototype "The Printing Dress".&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft, (3 August 2011), Dressing for the Future: Microsoft Duo Breaks Through with Wearable Technology Concept, Microsoft News Center&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearable computing is the subject of active research, especially the form-factor and location on the body, with areas of study including [[user interface]] design, [[augmented reality]], and [[pattern recognition]]. The use of wearables for specific applications, for compensating [[disabilities]] or supporting elderly people steadily increases.

==History==
[[File:Wearcompevolution.jpg|thumb|509x509px|right|Evolution of [[Steve Mann]]'s ''WearComp'' wearable computer from backpack based systems of the 1980s to his current covert systems]]
Due to the varied definitions of "wearable" and "computer", the first wearable computer could be as early as the first abacus on a necklace, a 16th-century abacus ring, a [[wristwatch]] and 'finger-watch' owned by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] of England, or the covert timing devices hidden in shoes to cheat at roulette by Thorp and Shannon in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorp|first=Edward|title=The Invention of the First Wearable Computer|journal=Digest of Papers. Second International Symposium on Wearable Computers (Cat. No.98EX215)|date=October 1998|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a computer is not merely a time-keeping or calculating device, but rather a user-programmable item for complex [[algorithm]]s, [[interface (computing)|interfacing]], and data management. By this definition, the wearable computer was invented by [[Steve Mann]], in the late 1970s:&lt;ref name=ISSCC2000&gt;{{cite news |title=IEEE ISSCC 2000: 'Dick Tracy' watch watchers disagree |author=Peter Clarke |work=EE Times| url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4039816/ISSCC--Dick-Tracy-watch-watchers-disagree}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watier&gt;{{cite news |title=Marketing Wearable Computers to Consumers: An Examination of Early Adopter Consumers' Feelings and Attitudes Toward Wearable Computers |author=Katherine Watier |date=19 April 2003 |work=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tara Kieffner |title=Wearable Computers: An Overview |url=http://misnt.indstate.edu/harper/Wearable_Computers.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010526051405/http://misnt.indstate.edu/harper/Wearable_Computers.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation |Steve Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto, was hailed as the father of the wearable computer and the ISSCC's first virtual panelist, by moderator Woodward Yang of Harvard University (Cambridge Mass.).|IEEE ISSCC 8 Feb. 2000}}

The development of wearable items has taken several steps of miniaturization from discrete electronics over hybrid designs to fully integrated designs, where just one processor chip, a battery and some interface conditioning items make the whole unit.

===1500s===
[[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of [[England]] received a watch from Robert Dudley in 1571, as a New Year present; it may have been worn on the forearm rather than the wrist. She also possessed a 'finger-watch' set in a ring, with an alarm that prodded her finger. &lt;ref&gt;David Boettcher, [http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatchinvention.php "The "Invention" of the Wristwatch"], ''Eur Ing David Boettcher'', April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===1600s===
The [[Qing Dynasty]] saw the introduction of a fully functional [[abacus]] on a [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]], which could be used while it was being worn.&lt;ref name=Interaction-Design /&gt;&lt;ref name=AbacusRing&gt;{{cite news |title=Huizhou people's abacus complex |date=2006-07-20 |work=Xinhua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
In 1961, mathematicians [[Edward O. Thorp]] and [[Claude Shannon]] built some computerized timing devices to help them win at a game of [[roulette]]. One such timer was concealed in a shoe and another in a pack of cigarettes. Various versions of this apparatus were built in the 1960s and 1970s.  Detailed pictures of a shoe-based timing device can be viewed at [http://www.eyetap.org/wearcam/eudaemonic/ www.eyetap.org].

Thorp refers to himself as the inventor of the first "wearable computer"&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=15725&amp;arnumber=729523&amp;count=30&amp;index=1 The invention of the first wearable computer], in ''The Second International Symposium on Wearable Computers: Digest of Papers'', IEEE Computer Society, 1998, pp. 4–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In other variations, the system was a concealed cigarette-pack sized [[analog computer]] designed to predict the motion of roulette wheels. A data-taker would use [[microswitch]]es hidden in his shoes to indicate the speed of the roulette wheel, and the computer would indicate an [[Octant (plane geometry)|octant]] of the roulette wheel to bet on by sending musical tones via radio to a miniature speaker hidden in a collaborator's ear canal. The system was successfully tested in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in June 1961, but hardware issues with the speaker wires prevented it from being used beyond test runs.&lt;ref name="BtD"&gt;Raseana.k.a shigady, ''Beat the Dealer'', 2nd Edition, Vintage, New York, 1966. {{ISBN|0-394-70310-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a wearable computer, because it could not be re-purposed during use; rather it was an example of task-specific hardware. This work was kept secret until it was first mentioned in Thorp's book ''Beat the Dealer'' (revised ed.) in 1966&lt;ref name="BtD"/&gt; and later published in detail in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Thorp, "Optimal gambling systems for favorable game." ''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'', V. 37:3, 1969, pp. 273–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[Pocket calculator]]s became mass-market devices from 1970, starting in Japan. [[Programmable calculators]] followed in the late 1970s, being somewhat more general-purpose computers. The HP-01 algebraic [[calculator watch]] by Hewlett-Packard was released in 1977.&lt;ref name="Marion"&gt;Andre F. Marion, Edward A. Heinsen, Robert Chin, and Bennie E. Helmso, wrist instrument Opens New Dimension in Personal Information [http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0022/other/0022hpjournal.pdf "Wrist instrument opens new dimension in personal information"], Hewlett-Packard Journal, December 1977. See also [http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0022/index.html HP-01 wrist instrument, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera-to-tactile vest for the blind, launched by C.C. Collins in 1977, converted images into a 1024-point, 10-inch square [[haptic technology|tactile grid]] on a vest.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;C.C. Collins, L.A. Scadden, and A.B. Alden, "Mobile Studies with a Tactile Imaging Device," ''Fourth Conference on Systems &amp; Devices For The Disabled'', 1–3 June 1977, Seattle WA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
The 1980s saw the rise of more general-purpose wearable computers. In 1981, [[Steve Mann]] designed and built a backpack-mounted 6502-based wearable multimedia computer with text, graphics, and multimedia capability, as well as video capability (cameras and other photographic systems). [[Steve Mann|Mann]] went on to be an early and active researcher in the wearables field, especially known for his 1994 creation of the Wearable Wireless [[Webcam]], the first example of [[Lifelog]]ging.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mann, "An historical account of the 'WearComp' and 'WearCam' inventions developed for applications in 'Personal Imaging,'" in ''The First International Symposium on Wearable Computers: Digest of Papers'', IEEE Computer Society, 1997, pp. 66–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FirstStep&gt;{{cite journal| title= Wearable Computing: A First Step Toward Personal Imaging |journal=IEEE Computer |volume=30 |number=2 |pages= |url=http://wearcam.org/ieeecomputer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seiko Epson]] released the [[RC-20]] Wrist Computer in 1984. It was an early [[smartwatch]], powered by a [[computer on a chip]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 Japanese PCs (1984)] (14:05), ''[[Computer Chronicles]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Reflection Technology marketed the Private Eye [[head-mounted display]], which scans a vertical array of [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] across the visual field using a vibrating mirror. This display gave rise to several hobbyist and research wearables, including Gerald "Chip" Maguire's [[IBM]] / [[Columbia University]] Student Electronic Notebook,&lt;ref name="Bade"&gt;J.

The Student Electronic Notebook consisted of the Private Eye, [[Toshiba]] diskless AIX [[notebook computer]]s (prototypes), a stylus based input system and a [[virtual keyboard]]. It used [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] radio links to provide all the usual [[TCP/IP]] based services, including [[Network File System|NFS]] mounted file systems and X11, which all ran in the Andrew Project environment.

The Hip-PC included an Agenda palmtop used as a chording keyboard attached to the belt and a 1.44 megabyte [[Floppy Drive|floppy drive]]. Later versions incorporated additional equipment from Park Engineering. The system debuted at "The Lap and Palmtop Expo" on 16 April 1991.

VuMan 1 was developed as part of a Summer-term course at Carnegie Mellon's Engineering Design Research Center, and was intended for viewing house blueprints. Input was through a three-button unit worn on the belt, and output was through Reflection Tech's Private Eye. The [[Central processing unit|CPU]] was an 8&amp;nbsp;MHz 80188 processor with 0.5 MB [[Read-only memory|ROM]].

===1990s===
In the 1990s [[PDAs]] became widely used, and in 1999 were combined with [[mobile phone]]s in Japan to produce the first mass-market [[smartphone]].

The watch crown (''icontrol'') can be used to move the defender left to right and the fire control is the Start/Split button on the lower side of the face of the watch at 6 o' clock. ]]
In 1993, the Private Eye was used in [[Thad Starner]]'s wearable, based on [[Doug Platt]]'s system and built from a kit from Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display on loan from [[Devon Sean McCullough]], and the Twiddler chording keyboard made by Handykey. Many iterations later this system became the [[MIT]] "Tin Lizzy" wearable computer design, and Starner went on to become one of the founders of MIT's wearable computing project. 1993 also saw [[Columbia University]]'s augmented-reality system known as KARMA (Knowledge-based Augmented Reality for Maintenance Assistance). Users would wear a Private Eye display over one eye, giving an overlay effect when the real world was viewed with both eyes open. KARMA would overlay wireframe schematics and maintenance instructions on top of whatever was being repaired. For example, graphical wireframes on top of a laser printer would explain how to change the paper tray. The system used sensors attached to objects in the physical world to determine their locations, and the entire system ran tethered from a desktop computer.&lt;ref name="Feiner"&gt;Steve Feiner, Blair MacIntyre, and Doree Seligmann, "Knowledge-based augmented reality," in ''Communications of the ACM'', 36(7), July 1993, 52–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feiner2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/projects/karma/karma.html|title=KARMA|work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Edgar Matias]] and Mike Ruicci of the [[University of Toronto]], debuted a "wrist computer." Their system presented an alternative approach to the emerging head-up display plus chord keyboard wearable. The system was built from a modified HP 95LX palmtop computer and a Half-QWERTY one-handed keyboard. With the keyboard and display modules strapped to the operator's forearms, text could be entered by bringing the wrists together and typing.&lt;ref name="Matias 94"&gt;Edgar Matias, I. Scott MacKenzie, and William Buxton, "Half-QWERTY: Typing with one hand using your two-handed skills," ''Companion of the CHI '94 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'', ACM, 1994, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The same technology was used by IBM researchers to create the half-keyboard "belt computer.&lt;ref name="Mattias 96"&gt;Edgar Matias, I. Scott MacKenzie and William Buxton, "A Wearable Computer for Use in Microgravity Space and Other Non-Desktop Environments," ''Companion of the CHI '96 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'', ACM, 1996, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, Mik Lamming and Mike Flynn at [[PARC (company)|Xerox EuroPARC]] demonstrated the Forget-Me-Not, a wearable device that would record interactions with people and devices and store this information in a database for later query.&lt;ref&gt;Mik Lamming and Mike Flynn, [http://www.lamming.com/mik/Papers/fmn.pdf "'Forget-me-not' Intimate Computing in Support of Human Memory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426205744/http://www.lamming.com/mik/Papers/fmn.pdf |date=26 April 2006 }} in ''Proceedings FRIEND21 Symposium on Next Generation Human Interfaces''&lt;/ref&gt; It interacted via wireless transmitters in rooms and with equipment in the area to remember who was there, who was being talked to on the telephone, and what objects were in the room, allowing queries like "Who came by my office while I was on the phone to Mark?". As with the Toronto system, Forget-Me-Not was not based on a head-mounted display.

Also in 1994, [[DARPA]] started the Smart Modules Program to develop a modular, ''humionic'' approach to wearable and carryable computers, with the goal of producing a variety of products including computers, radios, navigation systems and human-computer interfaces that have both military and commercial use. In July 1996, DARPA went on to host the "Wearables in 2005" workshop, bringing together industrial, university, and military visionaries to work on the common theme of delivering computing to the individual.&lt;ref name="DARPA"&gt;E.C. Urban, Kathleen Griggs, Dick Martin, Dan Siewiorek and Tom Blackadar, [http://www.darpa.mil/MTO/Displays/Wear2005/ Proceedings of Wearables in 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914132505/http://www.darpa.mil/MTO/Displays/Wear2005/ |date=14 September 2005 }}, Arlington, VA, 18–19 July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up conference was hosted by [[Boeing]] in August 1996, where plans were finalized to create a new academic conference on wearable computing. In October 1997, Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] co-hosted the [[IEEE]] [[International Symposium on Wearable Computers|International Symposium on Wearables Computers (ISWC)]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The symposium was a full academic conference with published proceedings and papers ranging from sensors and new hardware to new applications for wearable computers, with 382 people registered for the event.

In 1998, Steve Mann invented and built the world's first smartwatch.  It was featured on the cover of Linux Journal in 2000, and demonstrated at ISSCC 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/podcasts-trailblazers-s03-e02/ Watches: Innovation on Time, Trailblazers, Season 3, Episode 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Wearable Tech: From Calculator Watches to VR Headsets, Social Media Week, April 5th, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linux Journal, July 2000, Issue 75, Cover + pages 86-91&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Dr. [[Bruce H Thomas]] and Dr. Wayne Piekarski developed the Tinmith wearable computer system to support [[augmented reality]]. This work was first published internationally in 2000 at the ISWC conference. The work was carried out at the Wearable Computer Lab in the [[University of South Australia]].

In 2002, as part of [[Kevin Warwick]]'s [[Kevin Warwick#Project Cyborg|Project Cyborg]], Warwick's wife, Irena, wore a necklace which was electronically linked to Warwick's nervous system via an implanted [[electrode array]] The color of the necklace changed between red and blue dependent on the signals on Warwick's nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, "I, Cyborg", University of Illinois Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2002, [[Xybernaut]] released a wearable computer called the Xybernaut Poma Wearable PC, Poma for short. Poma stood for Personal Media Appliance. The project failed for a few reasons though the top reasons are that the equipment was expensive and clunky. The user would wear a head mounted optical piece, a CPU that could be clipped onto clothing, and a mini keyboard that was attached to the user's arm.&lt;ref&gt;PIERINI, D. (2015, July 26). First wearable computers made you look like a freaking Borg. Retrieved May 23, 2018, from https://www.cultofmac.com/311850/first-wearable-computer-xybernaut-poma/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GoPro]] released their first product, the [[GoPro#35mm|GoPro HERO 35mm]], which began a successful franchise of wearable cameras. The cameras can be worn atop the head or around the wrist and are shock and waterproof. GoPro cameras are used by many athletes and extreme sports enthusiasts, a trend that became very apparent during the early 2010s.

In the late 2000s, various Chinese companies began producing mobile phones in the form of wristwatches, the descendants of which as of 2013 include the i5 and i6, which are GSM phones with 1.8 inch displays, and the [[ZGPAX s5]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] wristwatch phone.

===2010s===
[[File:IPod Nano - LunaTik and TikTok.jpg|thumb|LunaTik, a machined wristband attachment for the [[IPod Nano#6th generation|6th-generation iPod Nano]]|198x198px]]
Standardization with [[IEEE]], [[IETF]], and several industry groups (e.g. [[Bluetooth]]) lead to more various interfacing under the [[Wireless personal area network|WPAN]] (wireless personal area network). It also led the [[Body area network|WBAN]] (Wireless body area network) to offer new classification of designs for interfacing and networking. The [[IPod Nano#6th generation|6th-generation iPod Nano]], released in September 2010, has a wristband attachment available to convert it into a wearable wristwatch computer.

The development of wearable computing spread to encompass [[rehabilitation engineering]], ambulatory intervention treatment, life guard systems, and defense wearable systems.{{Clarify|date=April 2012}}

[[Sony]] produced a wristwatch called [[Sony SmartWatch]] that must be paired with an Android phone. Once paired, it becomes an additional remote display and notification tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymobile.com/us/products/accessories/smartwatch/|title=Sony SmartWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fitbit]] released several wearable fitness trackers and the [[List of Fitbit products#Fitbit Surge|Fitbit Surge]], a full [[smartwatch]] that is compatible with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].

On April 11, 2012, [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise $100,000 for their initial smartwatch model. The campaign ended on May 18 with $10,266,844, over 100 times the fundraising target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/05/10/pebble-smartwatch-pre-orders-sold-out/|title=Pebble Smartwatch Pre-Orders Are Sold Out, $10+ Million Pledged|last=Newman|first=Jared|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pebble has released several smartwatches since, including the [[Pebble Time]] and the Pebble Round.

==Commercialization==
[[File:Zypad.jpg|thumb|Image of the [[ZYPAD]] wrist wearable computer from [[Eurotech (company)|Eurotech]]]]
[[File:Fitbit Charge HR.jpg|thumb|The [[List of Fitbit products#Fitbit Charge|Fitbit Charge]]]]
The commercialization of general-purpose wearable computers, as led by companies such as [[Xybernaut]], [[CDI Corporation|CDI]] and [[ViA, Inc.]] has thus far been met with limited success. Publicly traded Xybernaut tried forging alliances with companies such as [[IBM]] and [[Sony]] in order to make wearable computing widely available, and managed to get their equipment seen on such shows as [[First Person Shooter (The X-Files)|The X-Files]], but in 2005 their stock was delisted and the company filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection amid financial scandal and federal investigation. Xybernaut emerged from bankruptcy protection in January, 2007. ViA, Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and subsequently ceased operations.

In 1998, [[Seiko]] marketed the [[Ruputer]], a computer in a (fairly large) wristwatch, to mediocre returns. In 2001, IBM developed and publicly displayed two prototypes for a wristwatch computer running [[Linux]]. The last message about them dates to [https://web.archive.org/web/20110710192625/http://gadgets.engadget.com/2004/10/20/watch-this-wednesday-the-linux-watch/ 2004], saying the device would cost about $250, but it is still under development. In 2002, [[Fossil, Inc.]] announced the [[Fossil Wrist PDA]], which ran the [[Palm OS]]. Its release date was set for summer of 2003, but was delayed several times and was finally made available on January 5, 2005. [[Timex Datalink]] is another example of a practical wearable computer. [[Hitachi]] launched a wearable computer called Poma in 2002. [[Eurotech (company)|Eurotech]] offers the [[ZYPAD]], a wrist wearable touch screen computer with [[GPS]], [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] connectivity and which can run a number of custom applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcom.com/wearable_computer/Zypad/default.htm|title=Eurotech Group: embedded boards, rugged systems for integrated solutions – high performance computing|work=arcom.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307134352/http://www.arcom.com/wearable_computer/Zypad/default.htm|archivedate=7 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a wearable computing device on the wrist to control body temperature was developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2013/11/05/wristify-thermal-comfort-via-a-wrist-band/ |title=Wristify: Thermal Comfort via a Wrist Band |publisher=Slice of MIT |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of weak market acceptance was demonstrated when [[Panasonic]] Computer Solutions Company's product failed. Panasonic has specialized in mobile computing with their [[Toughbook]] line for over 10 years and has extensive market research into the field of portable, wearable computing products. In 2002, Panasonic introduced a wearable [[brick computer]] coupled with a handheld or a touchscreen worn on the arm. The "Brick" Computer is the CF-07 Toughbook, dual batteries, screen used same batteries as the base, 800 x 600 resolution, optional GPS and [[Wireless WAN|WWAN]]. Has one M-PCI slot and one PCMCIA slot for expansion. CPU used is a 600&amp;nbsp;MHz Pentium 3 factory under clocked to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz so it can stay cool passively as it has no fan. Micro DIM RAM is upgradeable. The screen can be used wirelessly on other computers. The brick would communicate wirelessly to the screen, and concurrently the brick would communicate wirelessly out to the internet or other networks. The wearable brick was quietly pulled from the market in 2005, while the screen evolved to a [[thin client]] touchscreen used with a handstrap.

Google has announced that it has been working on a [[head-mounted display]]-based wearable "[[augmented reality]]" device called [[Google Glass]]. An early version of the device was available to the US public from April 2013 until January 2015. Despite ending sales of the device through their Explorer Program, Google has stated that they plan to continue developing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plus.google.com/u/1/111626127367496192147/posts/aKymsANgWBD |title=Project Glass – Google+ – We think technology should work for you—to be there when… |publisher=Plus.google.com |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/+GoogleGlass/posts/QLD88fE7qmE |title=Last week we told you we'd be trying out new ways to find Explorers.

[[LG]] and [[iriver]] produce earbud wearables measuring heart rate and other biometrics, as well as various activity metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Burns |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/05/the-lg-lifeband-touch-and-heartrate-earphones-are-the-wonder-twins-of-activity-trackers/ |title=The LG LifeBand Touch And HeartRate Earphones Are The Wonder Twins Of Activity Trackers |website=[[TechCrunch]] |date=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Amanda |last=Kooser |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/fitness-sensor-earphones-gather-health-data-deliver-music/ |title=Fitness sensor earphones gather health data, deliver music |website=[[CNET]] |date=10 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater response to commercialization has been found in creating devices with designated purposes rather than all-purpose. One example is the WSS1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.symbol.com/product.php?productID=212|title=WSS1000/1060 Wearable Scanning &amp; Computing System|website=www.symbol.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WSS1000 is a wearable computer designed to make the work of inventory employees easier and more efficient. The device allows workers to scan the [[barcode]] of items and immediately enter the information into the company system. This removed the need for carrying a clipboard, removed error and confusion from hand written notes, and allowed workers the freedom of both hands while working; the system improves accuracy as well as efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Popular culture ==
Many technologies for wearable computers derive their ideas from science fiction. There are many examples of ideas from popular movies that have become technologies or are technologies currently being developed.
* '''3D User Interface:''' Devices that display usable, tactile interfaces that can be manipulated in front of the user. Examples include the glove-operated hologram computer featured at the Pre-Crime headquarters in the beginning of ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and the computers used by the gate workers at Zion in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' trilogy]].
* '''Intelligent Textiles:''' Clothing that can relay and collect information. Examples include ''[[Tron]]'' and its [[Tron Legacy|sequel]], and also many [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] military films.
* '''Threat Glasses:''' Scan others in vicinity and assess threat-to-self level. Examples include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]'', 'Threep' Technology in ''Lock-In, and [[Kill Switch (2017 film)|Kill switch]].''
* '''Computerized Contact Lenses:''' A special contact lenses that is used to confirm one's identity.  Used in ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol|Mission Impossible 4]]''.
* '''Combat Suit Armor:''' A wearable exoskeleton that provides protection to its wearer and is typically equipped with powerful weapons and a computer system.  Examples include numerous [[Iron Man]] suits, along with [[Samus Aran|Samus Aran's]] Power Suit and Fusion Suit in the ''[[Metroid]]'' video game series.  
* '''Brain Nano-Bots to Store Memories in the Cloud:''' Used in ''Total Recall''.
* '''Infrared Headsets:''' Can help identify suspects and see through walls. Examples include [[RoboCop|Robocop's]] special eye system, as well as some more advanced visors that Samus Aran uses in the [[Metroid Prime Trilogy|''Metroid Prime'' trilogy]].
*'''Wrist-Worn Computers:''' Provide various abilities and information, such as data about the wearer, a vicinity map, a flashlight, a communicator, a poison detector or an enemy-tracking device.  Examples include the Pip-Boy 3000 from the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' games and [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]]'s Wrist Device from the ''[[Futurama]]'' TV sitcom.
*'''On-chest device''' or smart necklace form-factor of wearable computer was shown in many sci-fi movies, including ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' and ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', however such location of the most precious individual's possession comes from history of wearing amulets and charms.

'''Writers Workshop''' is a [[Calcutta]]-based literary publisher founded by the poet-professor [[Purushottama Lal]] in 1958. Over the next few decades it published many new authors of post-independence urban literature. Many of these authors later became important.&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/writers-workshop-completes-50-years-of-lite/369360/|title=Writers’ Workshop completed 50 years of literary glory|date=October 4, 2008|work=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/nilanjana-s-roy-p-lalthe-writer%5Cs-workshop-story/414127/|title=P Lal and the Writer's Workshop story|date=November 9, 2010|work=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-14/kolkata/28213705_1_purushottama-lal-chinmoy-guha-english|title=City remembers a great scholar &amp; human|date=November 14, 2010|work=The Times of India |location=Kolkata, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main48.asp?filename=hub150111I_Remember.asp|title=I Remember An Idyll|date=January 15, 2011|journal=Tehelka Magazine |volume=8 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Writers Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Writers Workshop Team|url=http://www.writersworkshopindia.com/who-we-are/|website=Writers' Workshop, India|publisher=Writers'Workshop, India|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; company was first founded as a group of eight writers (Lal, Deb Kumar Das, [[Anita Desai]], Sasthibrata Chakravarti writing as [[Sasthi Brata]], William Hull, Jail Ratan, Kewlian Sio, and Pradip Sen) in 1958. It was an initiative of [[Purushottama Lal]] (1929–2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writers' Workshop @ fifty|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-literaryreview/writers-workshop-fifty/article662196.ece|website=The Hindu|publisher=TheHindu.Com|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of English at [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta]].

Although it mainly publishes Indian writing in English, it has also published books in other modern Indian languages. To date, the press has published over 3500 titles of [[poetry]], [[novels]], [[drama]], and other literary works, with two focuses: [[experimental literature]] of the present day, and [[translation]]s from [[Sanskrit]] and other classical [[Languages of India|Indian languages]].

Writers Workshop of [[India]] has published the first books by many authors who have gone on to become famous, including [[A. K. Ramanujan]], Asif Currimbhoy, [[Agha Shahid Ali]], Adil Jussawalla, [[Arun Kolatkar]], [[Arvind Krishna Mehrotra]], [[Chandrakant Bakshi]], [[Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni]], [[Gieve Patel]], [[Hoshang Merchant]], [[Jayanta Mahapatra]], [[Joe Winter]], [[Keki Daruwalla]], [[Kamala Das]], [[Meena Alexander]], [[Mani Rao]], [[Nissim Ezekiel]], [[Pritish Nandy]], [[Poile Sengupta]], [[R. Parthasarathy]], [[Ruskin Bond]], [[Shiv Kumar Batalvi|Shiv Kumar]], Saleem Peeradina, [[Vihang A. Naik]], [[Vikram Seth]], and William Hull among others who have been included in ''The Golden Treasury of Writers Workshop Poetry'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubana Huq, ed. The Golden Treasury of Writers Workshop Poetry.

As Writers Workshop enters its sixth decade of existence, it has become an extremely important part of the literary history of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A life in five acts|url=http://www.harmonyindia.org/hportal/VirtualPrintView.jsp?page_id=6064|website=HarmonyIndia.org|publisher=Harmony India : a social initiative of Dhirubhai Ambani Memorial Trust|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its titles are printed as hand-loom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblio-beauties|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/asPpwI6GTYmt3EEUMcPkqO/Bibliobeauties.html|website=LiveMint|publisher=LiveMint.Com|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sari-bound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BEYOND THE ORDINARY - The calligrapher of Calcutta-45|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101128/jsp/opinion/story_13228555.jsp|website=TelegraphIndia.Com|publisher=TelegraphIndia|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; volumes with exquisite [[calligraphy]] on them. Throughout its history, this alternative publishing venture has published authors without a distribution system to back it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P Lal obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/05/p-lal-obituary|website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=TheGuardian.com|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most important publishing venture Writers Workshop has undertaken is Lal's translation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puroshottama Lal: sought to 'transcreate' an epic|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/puroshottama-lal-sought-to-transcreate-an-epic|website=TheNational.ae|publisher=TheNational.ae|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the entire Indian epic [[Mahabharata]] in 18 volumes (appearing 2005–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The P. Lal transcreation of the complete epic text in 18 volumes|url=http://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/mahabharata/the-mahabharata-of-vyasa-all-volumes/|website=WritersWorkshop, India|publisher=WritersWorkshop, India|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Purushottama Lal's death in 2010, his family members now run his publishing house.
