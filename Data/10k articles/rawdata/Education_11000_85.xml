[[File:Q03 - via Omero Academia Belgica P1010348.JPG|thumb|Façade of the Academia Belgica]]
The '''Academia Belgica''' is an academic organization. The goal of the Academy is to promote the cultural, scientific and artistic cooperation between [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]]. 

The organization was founded in 1939 when the [[Belgium|Belgian]] princess [[Marie-José of Belgium|Marie-José]] married the Italian crown prince [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto]]. The Academy is also the seat of the [[Belgian Historical Institute]] in [[Rome]] and of the foundation princess Marie-José, which supports historical research.

In 1947, [[Franz Cumont]] donated his library to the Academia Belgica. [[Pierre Bautier]] and [[Henri Pirenne]], also donated collections to the academy.

'''Academic dishonesty''', '''academic misconduct,''' '''academic fraud''' and [[academic integrity]] are related concepts that refer to various actions on the part of students that go against the expected norms of a school, university or other learning institution. Definitions of academic misconduct are usually outlined in institutional policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bretag, T., Mahmud, S., Wallace, M., Walker, R., James, C., Green, M., . . . Partridge, L. (2011). Core elements of exemplary academic integrity policy in Australian higher education. ''International Journal for Educational Integrity, 7''(2), 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bretag, T., Mahmud, S., East, J., Green, M., &amp; James, C. (2011). ''Academic integrity standards: A preliminary analysis of the Academic integrity policies at Australian Universities''. Paper presented at the Proceedings of AuQF 2011 Demonstrating Quality, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=Sarah Elaine|date=2017-01-17|title=Comparative Analysis of Institutional Policy Definitions of Plagiarism: A Pan-Canadian University Study|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7|journal=Interchange|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=271–281|doi=10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7|issn=0826-4805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of academic dishonest include:

*'''[[Plagiarism]]''': The adoption or reproduction of original creations of another author (person, collective, organization, community or other type of author, including anonymous authors) without due acknowledgment.
*'''[[Fabrication (science)|Fabrication]]''': The falsification of data, information, or [[citation]]s in any formal academic exercise.
*'''[[Deception]]''': Providing false information to an instructor concerning a formal academic exercise—''e.g.,'' giving a false excuse for missing a deadline or falsely claiming to have submitted work.
*'''[[Cheating#Academic|Cheating]]''': Any attempt to obtain assistance in a formal academic exercise (like an [[Test (assessment)|examination]]) without due acknowledgment (including the use of [[cheat sheet]]s).
*'''[[Bribery]]''' or paid services: Giving assignment answers or test answers for money.
*'''[[Sabotage]]''': Acting to prevent others from completing their work. This includes cutting pages out of library books or willfully disrupting the experiments of others.
*'''[[Academic dishonesty#Professorial misconduct|Professorial misconduct]]''': [[Professor]]ial acts that are academically fraudulent equate to academic fraud and/or grade fraud.
*'''[[Impersonation]]''': assuming a student's identity with intent to provide an advantage for the student, such as sitting an exam on behalf of that student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taught Postgraduate Framework (Part B - Doctorate Level) |url=http://www.qmu.ac.uk/quality/documents/prof_doc_regs_june08.doc |date=June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518120810/http://qmu.ac.uk/quality/documents/prof_doc_regs_june08.doc |archivedate=2012-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic misconduct |date=May 8, 2015 |url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/academic-services/students/postgraduate-taught/discipline/academic-misconduct |work=University of Edinburgh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916220010/http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/academic-services/students/postgraduate-taught/discipline/academic-misconduct |archivedate=September 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic conduct in assessment|url=http://micn.otago.ac.nz/current-students/assessment/assessment-procedures-guide-web-version/11-conduct|work=University of Otago|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210220152/http://micn.otago.ac.nz/current-students/assessment/assessment-procedures-guide-web-version/11-conduct|archivedate=February 10, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plagiarism|work=University of Sussex|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/academicoffice/1-4-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203185811/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/academicoffice/1-4-1.html|archivedate=December 3, 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Contract cheating]]''': A form of cheating in which students hire a third party to complete work on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R., &amp; Lancaster, T. (2006). ''Eliminating the successor to plagiarism: Identifying the usage of contract cheating sites''. Paper presented at the Second International Plagiarism Conference, Gateshead, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; Essay mills fall under this category.

Academic dishonesty has been documented in every type of educational setting from [[elementary school]] to [[graduate school]]. Throughout history this type of dishonesty has been met with varying degrees of approbation.

==History==
[[File:Prüfungszellen-Nanking.jpg|thumb|Chinese Examination Cells at the South River School (Nanjiangxue) Nanjing (China). This structure prevents cheating in exams.]]
In antiquity, the notion of [[intellectual property]] was thought of differently than it is today. Ideas were the common property of the [[literate elite]]. Books were published by hand-copying them. Scholars shared digests or commentaries on other works, which could contain as much or as little original material as the author desired. There was no standard system of citation at this time. Scholars were an elite and small group who knew and generally trusted each other. This system continued through the European Middle Ages. Education was in [[Latin]] and occasionally [[Greek language|Greek]]. Some scholars were [[monk]]s, who used much of their time copying [[manuscript]]s. Other scholars were in urban [[universities]] connected to the [[Catholic Church]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Academic dishonesty dates back to the first tests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lang, J. M. (2013). ''Cheating lessons: Learning from academic dishonesty''. Harvard, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars note that cheating was prevalent on the [[Chinese civil service]] exams thousands of years ago, even when cheating carried the penalty of death for both examinee and examiner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name = bushway623&gt;Ann Bushway and William R. Nash, "School Cheating Behavior", ''Review of Educational Research'' 47, no. 4 (Autumn 1977), 623.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bribery of examiners was also common, as represented in works such as the Ming-dynasty story collection ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 The Book of Swindles]''&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.&lt;/ref&gt; and Qing-dynasty novel ''[[Rulin waishi]]'' [The Unofficial History of the Scholars].

Standards for citation and referencing began at the end of the 19th century with the emergence of guidance provided by scholarly societies that developed discipline-specific expectations for referencing such as the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and the [[American Psychological Association|APA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sue Carter Simmons|contribution=Competing Notions of Authorship: A Historical Look at Students and Textbooks on Plagiarism and Cheating|title=Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World|editors=Lise Buranen, Alice M. Roy|location=Albany|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=April 23, 1999|page=42|isbn=978-0791440803}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time, scholars began researching issues related to cheating, with some early research dating back to the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Gallwey, T. (1879). Plagiarism or coincidence: Which? ''The Irish Monthly, 7'', 312-319.&lt;/ref&gt; and early 20th centuries, when cheating was identified as a widespread problem at college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, C. (1929). An improved method of detecting cheating in objective examinations. ''The Journal of Educational Research, 19''(5), 341-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sue Carter Simmons, "Competing Notions of Authorship: A Historical Look at Students and Textbooks on Plagiarism and Cheating", in ''Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World'' ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1999), 45&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that as many as two-thirds of students cheated at some point of their college careers at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason M. Stephens|url=http://www.academicintegrity.org/cai_research/templeton_stephens.php|title=Psychology Through Ecology: Academic Motivation, Moral Aptitudes, and Cheating Behavior in Middle and High School Settings|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411054802/http://www.academicintegrity.org/cai_research/templeton_stephens.php|archivedate= April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sorority|Fraternities]] often operated so-called [[essay bank]]s, where term papers were kept on file and could be resubmitted over and over again by different students, often with the only change being the name on the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Stavisky, Leonard Price (1973). "Term Paper 'Mills', Academic Plagiarism, and State Regulation". Political Science Quarterly: 445–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of academic dishonesty became more prominent in the latter half of the twentieth century, as universities shifted towards more democratic approaches to admission.

==Today==
Academic dishonesty does not have a universal definition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educational institutions in different regions understand and act on academic dishonestly in different ways. Below are some examples of specific contexts.

=== United States ===
In the United States, one study has shown that 20% of students started cheating in the first grade.&lt;ref name = bushway623/&gt;  Similarly, other studies reveal that currently in the U.S., 56% of [[middle school]] students and 70% of [[high school]] students have cheated.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Decoo, ''Crisis on Campus: Confronting Academic Misconduct'' (Cambridge, Mass.: [[MIT Press]], 2002), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  A large-scale study in Germany found that 75% of the university students admitted that they conducted at least one of seven types of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or falsifying data) within the previous six months.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the effect of academic procrastination on the frequency and variety of academic misconduct: a panel study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are not the only ones to cheat in an academic setting. A study among North Carolina school teachers found that some 35% of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another. The rise of [[high-stakes testing]] and the consequences of the results on the teacher is cited as a reason why a teacher might want to inflate the results of their students.&lt;ref name="Jacob-Levitt-2003"&gt;Brian Aaron Jacob &amp; Steven D. Levitt (2003) ''Catching Cheating Teachers: The Results of an Unusual Experiment in Implementing Theory", available at [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/brookings-wharton_papers_on_urban_affairs/v2003/2003.1jacob02.pdf Project Muse].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scholarly studies in the 1960s of academic dishonesty in [[higher education]] found that nationally in the U.S., somewhere between 50–70% of college students had cheated at least once.&lt;ref name= bowers155&gt;William J. Bowers, ''Student Dishonesty and its Control in Colleges'' (New York: Bureau of Applied Social Research, [[Columbia University]], 1964), 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  While nationally, these rates of cheating in the U.S. remain stable today, there are large disparities between different schools, depending on the size, selectivity, and anti-cheating policies of the school. Generally, the smaller and more selective the college, the less cheating occurs there. For instance, the number of students who have engaged in academic dishonesty at small elite [[liberal arts colleges]] can be as low as 15–20%, while cheating at large [[public university|public universities]] can be as high as 75%.&lt;ref name = labeff192&gt;Emily E. LaBeff, et al., "Situational Ethics and College Student Cheating", ''Sociological Inquiry'' 60, no. 2 (May 1990), 192.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, researchers have found that students who attend a school with an [[honor code]] are less likely to cheat than students at schools with other ways of enforcing [[academic integrity]].&lt;ref name=mccabetrevino_honorcode_532&gt;Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Academic Dishonesty: Honor Codes and Other Contextual Influences", ''The Journal of Higher Education'' 64, no. 5, (September–October 1993), 532.&lt;/ref&gt; As for graduate education, a recent study found that 56% of MBA students admitted cheating, along with 54% of graduate students in engineering, 48% in education, and 45% in law.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Pope, 'Higher education sees rise in dishonesty', [[Associated Press]], May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheating in high schools is growing in the United States at an exponential rate. There is also a great difference in students' perceptions and the reality of their own ethical behavior. In a 2008 survey of 30,000 students in high school carried out by the Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 62 percent of students polled said they "copied another's homework two or more times in the past year."&lt;ref name="Josephson Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethics of American Youth: 2008|url=http://charactercounts.org/pdf/reportcard/2008/Q_all.pdf|work=Report Card on the Ethics of American Youth|publisher=Josephson Institute|accessdate=14 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616061145/http://charactercounts.org/pdf/reportcard/2008/Q_all.pdf|archive-date=16 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, on the same survey, 92 percent said they were "satisfied with their personal ethics and character."&lt;ref name="Josephson Institute" /&gt;  Hence, there is generally a discrepancy between actual behavior and self-image of high school students' character.

As more students take courses and assessments online, there is a persistent perception that it is easier to cheat in an online class than a face-to-face course.&lt;ref name="West Georgia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheating in the Digital Age: Do Students Cheat More in Online Courses?|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/spring131/watson131.html|work=Cheating in the Digital Age|publisher=University of West Georgia|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there are online services that offer to prepare any kind of homework of high school and college level and take online tests for students.&lt;ref name="ohiomatyc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheating goes high tech |last=Maclean |first=Phil |url=http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |newspaper=Ohiomatyc News |date=Fall 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While administrators are often aware of such websites, they have been unsuccessful in curbing cheating in homework and non-proctored online tests, resorting to a recommendation by the Ohio Mathematics Association to derive at least 80% of the grade of online classes from proctored tests.&lt;ref name="ohiomatyc"/&gt; In addition, colleges and universities are increasingly turning to online proctoring services to oversee tens of thousands of exams per year.&lt;ref name="Inside Higher Ed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Proctoring Catches Cheaters; Raises Concerns|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/05/10/online-exam-proctoring-catches-cheaters-raises-concerns|work=Online Proctoring|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While research on academic dishonesty in other countries is less extensive, anecdotal evidence suggests cheating could be even more common in countries like Japan &lt;ref&gt;L.M. Dryden, "A Distant Mirror or Through the Looking Glass?: Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in Japanese Education", in ''Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World,'' ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: [[SUNY Press]], 1999), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/doaj/23507756/2015/00000003/00000002/art00010&lt;/ref&gt;

A typology of academic misconduct has been devised by Perry (2010).&lt;ref name="eprints.hud.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/10515/1/IrelandPlagiarismpdf.pdf|title= Plagiarism: Let's start as we don't mean to go on|author=Ireland, Chris|author2= English, John|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry's typology presents a two dimensional model of academic misconduct with one dimension measuring the degree to which rules are understood and the other dimension measuring how closely these rules are followed.&lt;ref name="eprints.hud.ac.uk"/&gt; According to the typology only those students who understand the rules but fail to adhere to the rules are classified as 'cheats'.&lt;ref name="eprints.hud.ac.uk"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, academic dishonesty is addressed by the [https://www.teqsa.gov.au/ Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Bretag|first = T|date =4 October 2017|website = Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency|title = Good Practice Note: Addressing contract cheating to safeguard academic integrity |url = https://www.teqsa.gov.au/latest-news/publications/good-practice-note-addressing-contract-cheating-safeguard-academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a government agency.

=== UK ===
In the UK, the Quality Assurance Agency is responsible for quality assurance in higher education. It has produced several policy and guidance documents for policy makers, educators and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (UK) (QAA)|date = 2016|title = Plagiarism in higher education - Custom essay writing services: an exploration and next steps for the UK higher education sector |url = https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/plagiarism-in-higher-education-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=308cfe81_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (UK) (QAA)|date = October 2017|title=Contracting to cheat in higher education: How to address contract cheating, the use of third-party services and essay mills |url = https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/quality-code/contracting-to-cheat-in-higher-education.pdf?sfvrsn=f66af681_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, academic misconduct is handled by individual post-secondary institutions,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, P. D. (2014). ''An Exploration of Faculty Attitudes Toward Student Academic Dishonesty in Selected Canadian Universities.'' (Doctor of Education), University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.

=== Bribery ===
{{Main|Bribery}}
'''Bribery''' is an act of giving money or gift giving that alters the behavior of the recipient. Bribery constitutes a crime and is defined by ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' as the [[Offer and acceptance|offering]], [[wikt:giving|giving]], [[Offer and acceptance|receiving]], or [[Solicitation|soliciting]] of any item of value to influence the actions of an official or other person in charge of a public or [[legal]] [[duty]].

The bribe is the gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct. It may be any [[money]], [[Good (economics)|good]], [[Chose (English law)|right in action]], [[property]], [[Promotion (rank)|preferment]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], [[Remuneration|emolument]], object of value, advantage, or merely a promise or undertaking to induce or influence the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or public capacity.&lt;ref&gt;See generally T. Markus Funk, [http://www.perkinscoie.com/Dont-Pay-for-the-Misdeeds-of-Others-Avoiding-Foreign-Third-Party-FCPA-Liability-01-05-2011 "Don't Pay for the Misdeeds of Others:  Intro to Avoiding Third-Party FCPA Liability," 6 BNA White Collar Crime Report 33 (January 14, 2011)] (discussing bribery in the context of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating}}
[[Image:Cheating.JPG|right|thumb|Using [[cheat sheet|crib notes]] during an examination without prior permission from the instructor is cheating]]
Cheating can take the form of crib notes, looking over someone's shoulder during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise. Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years. For instance, students have been documented hiding notes in the bathroom toilet tank, in the brims of their baseball caps, up their sleeves, along their thighs or in their cleavage. Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began. While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat. Methods of secretly signalling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers. Some students have been known to use more elaborate means, such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers (i.e. where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer "A", two taps for answer "B", and so on).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Cheating differs from most other forms of academic dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly [[telegraphed]] answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work is in no way affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students in the same class but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If the student in the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.

One other method is taking advantage of time zones, particularly in exams administered worldwide. Those who take the exam first (likely in Oceania) can then post answers for those about to take the exam (in a time zone behind like Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clampdown on timezone cheats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1788872.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deception===
{{Main|Deception}}
Deception is providing false information to a teacher/instructor concerning a formal academic exercise. Examples of this include taking more time on a take-home test than is allowed, giving a dishonest excuse when asking for a deadline extension, or falsely claiming to have submitted work. This type of academic misconduct is often considered softer than the more obvious forms of cheating, and otherwise-honest students sometimes engage in this type of dishonesty without considering themselves cheaters. It is also sometimes done by students who have failed to complete an assignment, to avoid responsibility for doing so.

===Fabrication===
{{Main|Lie#Fabrication}}
Fabrication is the falsification of data, information, or citations in any formal academic exercise. This includes making up citations to back up arguments or inventing quotations. Fabrication predominates in the natural sciences, where students sometimes falsify data to make experiments "work". It includes data falsification, in which false claims are made about research performed, including selective submitting of results to exclude inconvenient data to generating bogus data.

Bibliographical references are often fabricated, especially when a certain minimum number of references is required or considered sufficient for the particular kind of paper. This type of fabrication can range from referring to works whose titles look relevant but which the student did not read, to making up bogus titles and authors.

There is also the practice of ''dry-labbing''—which can occur in [[chemistry]] or other lab courses, in which the teacher clearly expects the experiment to yield certain results (which confirm established laws), so the student starts from the results and works backward, calculating what the experimental data should be, often adding variation to the data. In some cases, the lab report is written before the experiment is conducted—in some cases, the experiment is never carried out. In either case, the results are what the instructor expects.

===Impersonation===
{{Main|Impersonation}}
Impersonation is a form of cheating whereby a different person than the student assigned an assignment or exam completes it. Different from regular cheating,{{clarify|date=July 2012}} the academic work is totally 'outsourced' to another person or organization, usually for pay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf Ohiomatyc News]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plagiarism ===
{{Main|Plagiarism}}
Plagiarism, as defined in the 1995 ''Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary'', is the "use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own [[original work]]".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite book| title = Library plagiarism policies | first = Vera | last= Stepchyshyn |author2=Robert S. Nelson | publisher = Assoc of College &amp; Resrch Libraries | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8389-8416-9 | page = 65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHamIn5dPR8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academia, this can range from borrowing without [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]] a particularly apt phrase, to [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrasing]] someone else's original idea without citation, to wholesale [[contract cheating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pennycook, Alastair|title=Borrowing Others' Words: Text, Ownership, Memory, and Plagiarism|year=1996|journal=TESOL Quarterly|publisher=Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, Inc.

The modern concept of plagiarism as [[immoral]] and [[originality]] as an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to "copy the masters as closely as possible" and avoid "unnecessary invention".&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynch, Jack|url=http://www.writing-world.com/rights/lynch.shtml|title=The Perfectly Acceptable Practice of Literary Theft: Plagiarism, Copyright, and the Eighteenth Century|journal=Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|volume=24|number=4|date=Winter 2002–2003|pages=51–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Will63"&gt;Will, Frederic (1963) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20162879 ''Publica materies''], in ''Arion''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RSC07"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] |date = 2007|title = The RSC Shakespeare - William Shakespeare Complete Works|chapter = Introduction to the Comedy of Errors |page = 215| quote=...while we applaud difference, Shakespeare's first audiences favoured likeness: a work was good not because it was original, but because it resembled an admired classical exemplar, which in the case of comedy meant a play by Terence or Plautus...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lindey52"&gt;Lindey, Alexander (1952) ''Plagiarism and Originality''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young59"&gt;[[Edward Young]] (1759) ''Conjectures on Original Composition''&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century new morals have been institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia (including academic science, education, engineering etc.) and [[journalism]], where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], subject to sanctions like [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] and other severe career damages. Not so in [[the arts]], which have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as a fundamental practice of the [[creative process]], with plagiarism being still hugely tolerated by 21st-century artists.&lt;ref name="Alfrey"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alfrey, Penelope|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/alfrey.html|title=Petrarch's Apes: Originality, Plagiarism and Copyright Principles within Visual Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawmaking is a professional field which is not structured around the concept of originality and for which plagiarism is less relevant.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Plagiarism is not a [[crime]] but is disapproved more on the grounds of [[Morality|moral]] offence.&lt;ref name="Lynch02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Stuart P. |year=2002–2003 |title=Plagiarism, Norms, and the Limits of Theft Law: Some Observations on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights |journal=Hastings Law Journal |volume=54 |pages=167–242 |publisher=University of California |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/380/380reading/greenplagiarism.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=8 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807134106/http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/380/380reading/greenplagiarism.pdf |archive-date=7 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be a case for [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] if it is so substantial to constitute [[copyright infringement]].

Since 2000, discussions on the subjects of [[student plagiarism]] have increased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ranald Macdonald &amp; Jude Carroll|year=2006|title=Plagiarism—a complex issue requiring a holistic institutional approach, Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|volume=31|issue=2|pages=233–245|

===Professorial misconduct===
Professorial misconduct includes improper grading of students' papers and oral exams, grade fraud, deliberate negligence towards cheating or assistance in cheating. This can be done for reasons of personal bias towards students (favoritism) or a particular viewpoint (intellectual dishonesty), for a [[bribe]], or to improve the teacher's own perceived performance by increasing the passing rate. It is still occasionally done for matters of ego or to procure sexual favors (sexual harassment).

===Sabotage===
{{Main|Sabotage}}
Sabotage is when a student or professor prevents others from completing their work. This includes cutting pages out of library books, deleting data off of classmate's computer or otherwise willfully disrupting the experiments of others. Sabotage is usually only found in highly [[competition|competitive]], cutthroat environments, such as at extremely elite schools where class rankings are highly prized.
Poor behavior and the low level disruption of other students' learning, however, is extremely common in all educational settings.
Some medical-school librarians have noted that important articles—required reading for key courses—are frequently missing from bound journals—sliced out with razor blades, scalpels, or other sharp blades. Other journals will be marked up in crayon. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Causes==
There are a variety of causes of academic misconduct. Researchers have studied the correlation of cheating to personal characteristics, demographics, contextual factors, methods of deterring misconduct, even [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].

===Incentives to cheat===
Some scholars contend that there are students who have a pathological urge to cheat. The writer [[Thomas Mallon]] noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature ([[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Charles Reade]] being two notable examples) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to [[kleptomania]] (a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing, even when it is against the interests of the thief).&lt;ref&gt;Mallon, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mallon concludes it is probable that most "cheaters" make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct.&lt;ref name="Sattler, S. 2013"&gt;Sattler, S., Graeff, P., Willen, S. (2013). "Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity", Deviant Behavior 34: 444-463 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.2012.735909#.VOzjCPmG_dA])&lt;/ref&gt; A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to "gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power".&lt;ref name="Vojinovic and Abbott, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vojinovic|first1= Zoran|last2= Abbott |first2= Michael B. |date =2012|title = Flood Risk and Social Justice|publisher = IWA Publishing|isbn= 9781843393870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/strat-ldr-dm/pt4ch15.html|title=Values and Ethics|website=www.au.af.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Fass puts forward the possibility that business scandals in the real world make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Fass, "By Honor Bound: Encouraging Academic Honesty", ''Educational Record'' 67, no. 4 (Fall 1986), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: "It is not that we love honesty less, but that we love success more."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any.&lt;ref&gt;Landon Tomas Jr., "On Wall Street, a Rise in Dismissals over Ethics", ''New York Times,'' 29 March 2005 late ed., A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been shown that the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.&lt;ref name="Sattler, S. 2013"/&gt;

Recent studies have indicated that there is no clear link between academic dishonesty and academic success{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;!---Conclusive study?---&gt;. One study showed that students given an unexpected opportunity to cheat did not improve their grades significantly from the control group.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 35.{{incomplete citation|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study showed that students who were allowed to bring cheat sheets to a test did not improve their grades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  While this may conflict with the common perception of cheating (one survey found only 13% of males and 46% of females think that cheating does not help grades,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;) it is often apparent to professors and members of academic conduct committees when a paper has been plagiarized by its inferior quality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} &lt;!--Bowers?---&gt;

In the USA, William Bowers reported that, on average, one third of grade A students cheated in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students might be tempted to cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

====Teachers====
The federal government of the United States has mandated high-stakes testing as part of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], signed into law in 2002. Schools and teachers are held accountable for the results. According to Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, co-authors of ''Freakonomics'', teachers are known to "teach to the test": while not teaching the actual answers, they teach the questions and similar ones, and they neglect any topic that will not be tested on. Levitt also states that teachers may inflate the results of tests given in their classroom.&lt;ref name="Jacob-Levitt-2003" /&gt; Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://blogs.tip.duke.edu/giftedtoday/2008/10/03/guiding-the-gifted-to-honest-work/|title = Guiding the Gifted to Honest Work| website = Gifted Today|publisher = Duke TIP|last = Abilock|first = Debbie|date = Fall 2008|deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221141749/http://www.dukegiftedletter.com/articles/vol9no1_feature.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic and personal causes===
Research has identified a number of demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average.&lt;ref name=McCabe&gt;Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Individual and Contextual Influences on Academic Dishonesty: A Multicampus Investigation", ''Research in Higher Education'' 38, no. 2, (1997), 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievement&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Jude Carroll, ''A Handbook for Deterring Plagiarism in Higher Education''(Oxford: The Oxford Centre for Staff and Learning Development, 2002), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so. Students involved in  extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat.  It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college.&lt;ref name = smithdavyeasterling&gt;Kenneth J. Smith, Jeanette A. Davy, and Debbie Easterling, "An Examination of Cheating and its Antecedents Among Marketing and Management Majors", ''The Journal of Business Ethics''50, no. 1, (March 2004), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a [[Defining Issues Test|morality test]] and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development#Pre-conventional|pre-conventional]] stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development#Post-Conventional|post-conventional]] stage).&lt;ref&gt;Tim West, Sue Ravenscroft, and Charles Shrader, "Cheating and Moral Judgment in the College Classroom: A Natural Experiment", ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 54, no. 2, (October 2004), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; This German panel study among thousands of university students argues that academic misconduct might be a coping-strategy to overcome the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as lower performance.

[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]], [[nationality]], and [[social class|class]] all show little correlation with academic misconduct. There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that that person will cheat. A comparison between students of different [[religion]]s yielded similar results, although the study did show that [[Jews]] tend to cheat less than members of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 207&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the strongest demographic correlations with academic misconduct in the United States is with language. Students who speak [[English language|English]] as a second language have been shown to commit academic dishonesty more and are more likely to be caught than native speakers, since they will often not want to rewrite sources in their own words, fearing that the meaning of the sentence will be lost through poor paraphrasing skills.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[University of California]] system, [[international students]] make up 10% of the student body but comprise 47% of academic dishonesty cases.&lt;ref&gt;Decoo, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]], students from outside of the [[European Union]] make up 12% of the student body but comprise 35% of academic dishonesty cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Universities catch almost 50,000 student cheats| newspaper =The Guardian| date =2 January 2016| url =https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/02/universities-catch-almost-50000-student-cheats| access-date =9 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contextual causes===
Academic misconduct is more easily traced to the academic and social environment of students than to their background. These contextual factors can be as broad as the social milieu at school to as narrow as what instructions a teacher gives before an exam.

Contextual factors that individual teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A study found that increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior.&lt;ref name= Kerkvliet&gt;Joe Kerkvliet and Charles L. Sigmund, "Can We Control Cheating in the Classroom?", ''The Journal of Economic Education'' 30, no. 4, (Autumn, 1999), 331.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, increased exam [[proctor]]ing and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated at least once in the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught.&lt;ref name = labeff192/&gt; As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable [[arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas N. Bunn, Steven B. Caudill, and Daniel M. Gropper, "Crime in the Classroom: An Economic Analysis of Undergraduate Student Cheating Behavior", ''The Journal of Economic Education'' 23, no. 3, (Summer 1992), 205.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or at the beginning of a test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%.&lt;ref name= Kerkvliet/&gt;  Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.emich.edu/mthomsen/sape.htm|title=Eastern Michigan University: The Department of Physics and Astronomy|website=www.physics.emich.edu|access-date=2008-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507120356/http://www.physics.emich.edu/mthomsen/sape.htm|archive-date=2008-05-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers can, however, accidentally promote cheating behavior. A study found a correlation between how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as a way of getting back at the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Bushway and Nash, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a [[grade curve]], are more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard E. Whitley, "Factors Associated with Cheating Among College Students: A Review", ''Research in Higher Education'' 39, no. 3, (June, 1998), 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also shown a correlation between goal orientation and the occurrence of academic cheating. Students who perceive their classroom to have high mastery goals are less likely to engage in cheating than those who perceive their classroom to emphasize performance goals.&lt;ref&gt;Anderman, E., &amp; Midgley, C. (2004). Changes in self-reported academic cheating across the transition from middle school to high school. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], 29, 499-517.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, students who are encouraged to learn for the sake of learning and who exhibit an intrinsic value of education are less likely to cheat than those who are encouraged primarily by grades and other extrinsic rewards.

The most important contextual causes of academic misconduct are often out of individual teachers' hands. One very important factor is [[time management]]. One survey reported two-thirds of teachers believed that poor time management was the principal cause of cheating.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;  Often social engagements are to blame. It has been found that there is a strong correlation between [[extracurricular activities]] and cheating, especially among athletes, even those on intramural teams.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation", 382.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been found that student cheating rates rise significantly the more time students spend [[playing cards]], watching television, or having a few drinks with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity or sorority]] membership is also strongly correlated with academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation", 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, [[peer pressure]]. Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] of their [[peer group]], which would include norms about academic dishonesty.&lt;ref&gt;F. Clark Power, Ann Higgins, and Lawrence Kohlberg, ''Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1989), 214.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat. Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student's decision to cheat is his perception of his peers' relationship with academic dishonesty.&lt;ref name="mccabetrevino_honorcode_532" /&gt;  For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct.&lt;ref name=bowers155/&gt;  Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if he or she has seen someone else cheat.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure. For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school's cheating rate.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Donald L. Butterfield, "Honor Code and Other Contextual Influences on Academic Integrity: A Replication and Extension to Modified Honor Code Settings" ''Research in Higher Education'' 43, no. 3, (June 2002), 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical causes===
No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior, before they can cheat they must overcome their own [[conscience]]. This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape a sense of guilt. For instance, students who personally do not have a moral problem with academic misconduct can cheat [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]-free. However, while many students have been taught and have internalized that academic dishonesty is wrong, it has been shown that on average a third of students who strongly disapprove of cheating have in fact cheated.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  People who cheat despite personal disapproval of cheating engage in something called "neutralization", in which a student rationalizes the cheating as being acceptable due to certain mitigating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Richard A. Bernardi, Rene L. Metzger, Ryann G. Scofield Bruno, Marisa A. Wade Hoogkamp, Lillian E. Reyes, and Gary H. Barnaby|title=Examining the Decision Process of Students' Cheating Behavior: An Empirical Study|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=50|number= 1|year=2004|page=399|doi=10.1023/B:BUSI.0000025039.47788.c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologists of deviant behavior, people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question, but "conjure up" reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case.&lt;ref name = smithdavyeasterling/&gt;  Neutralization is not a simple case of ''ex post facto'' rationalization, but is rather a more comprehensive affair, occurring before, during, and after the act of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;LaBeff, et al., 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty, which they categorize by type of justification.  ''Denial of responsibility'' – that is, the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat – is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated, with 61% of cheaters using this form of justification.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald L. McCabe|title=The Influence of Situational Ethics on Cheating Among College Students|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=62|number=3|year=1992|page=368|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1992.tb00287.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Condemnation of condemner'' – that is, that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves – is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28%.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992" /&gt;  The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the ''appeal to higher loyalties,'' where the student thinks their responsibility to some other entity, usually their peers, is more important than doing what they know to be morally right. About 6.8% of cheaters in higher education use this form of neutralization.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992" /&gt; ''Denial of injury'' – thinking that nobody is worse off for the cheating – is the fourth most popular kind of neutralization at 4.2% of cheaters.&lt;ref name="McCabe-1992" /&gt;

==Effects==
{{essay-like|section|date=August 2015}}
Cheating in academics has a host of effects on students, on teachers, on individual schools, and on the educational system itself.

For instance, students who engage in neutralisation to justify cheating, even once, are more likely to engage in it in the future, potentially putting them on a road to a life of dishonesty.&lt;ref name = smithdavyeasterling/&gt;  Indeed, one study found that students who are dishonest in class are more likely to engage in fraud and theft on the job when they enter the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Sarath Nonis and Cathy Owens Swift, "An Examination of the Relationship between Academic Dishonesty and Workplace Dishonesty", ''Journal of Business Education'' 77, no. 2, (November–December 2001), 69-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Students are also negatively affected by academic dishonesty after graduation. A university diploma is an important document in the [[labor market]]. Potential employers use a degree as a representation of a graduate's knowledge and ability. However, due to academic dishonesty, not all graduates with the same grades actually did the same work or have the same skills. Thus, when faced with the fact that they do not know which graduates are skilled and which are the "lemons" (see "[[The Market for Lemons]]"), employers must pay all graduates based on the quality of the average graduate. Therefore, the more students who cheat, getting by without achieving the required skills or learning, the lower the quality of the average graduate of a school, and thus the less employers are willing to pay a new hire from that school. Because of this reason, all students, even those that do not cheat themselves, are negatively affected by academic misconduct.

Academic dishonesty also creates problems for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In economic terms, cheating causes an underproduction of knowledge, where the professor's job is to produce knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a case of cheating often will cause emotional distress to faculty members, many considering it to be a personal slight against them or a violation of their trust. Dealing with academic misconduct is often one of the worst parts of a career in education, one survey claiming that 77% of academics agreed with the statement "dealing with a cheating student is one of the most onerous aspects of the job".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic misconduct can also have an effect on a college's reputation, one of the most important assets of any school. An institution plagued by cheating scandals may become less attractive to potential donors and students and especially prospective employers.  Alternatively, schools with low levels of academic dishonesty can use their reputation to attract students and employers.

Ultimately, academic dishonesty undermines the academic world. It interferes with the basic mission of education, the transfer of knowledge, by allowing students to get by without having to master the knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, academic dishonesty creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to the learning process, which affects honest students as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; When honest students see cheaters escape detection, it can discourage student morale, as they see the rewards for their work cheapened. Cheating also undermines academia when students steal ideas. Ideas are a professional author's "capital and identity", and if a person's ideas are stolen it retards the pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Thomas|last =  Mallon|title = Stolen Words|publisher =Harcourt |date = 2001|page =  4|isbn = 978-0156011365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If never formally retracted, fraudulent publications can remain an issue for many years as articles and books remain on shelves and continue to be cited. The case of [[S. Walter Poulshock]], a 1960s early-career historian whose work was found to contain wholly fabricated material, was exposed in 1966 with the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' providing a warning on the topic.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternstein|first1=Jerome|title=Historical Fraud and the Seduction of Ideas: The Poulshock Case|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/568|website=History News Network|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Luker&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luker|first1=Ralph|title=The Year When We Got Caught|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/1184|website=History News Network|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, his book was never removed from the shelves of many university libraries and (together with his related thesis) was still being cited in 2013, 47 years after it was intended to have been withdrawn by its publisher.&lt;ref name=Margolies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolies|first1=Daniel S.|title=Henry Watterson and the new South the politics of empire, free trade, and globalization|date=2006|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Ky.|isbn=9780813138527|page=317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTk7xGOP66wC&amp;pg=PA317|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farrar-Myers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar-Myers|first1=Victoria A.|title=Scripted for change: the institutionalization of the American presidency|date=2007|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=9781603444637|page=252|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW9ojP-HMbYC&amp;pg=PT271|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sachsman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachsman|first1=David|last2=Bulla|first2=David|title=Sensationalism murder, mayhem, mudslinging, scandals, and disasters in|date=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781412851138|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RduAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skocpol&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|title=Protecting soldiers and mothers the political origins of social policy in the United States|date=1995|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674043725|page=581|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHTHNalul5IC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deterrence==
All parties involved in the dishonesty&amp;mdash;not just the individual whose grade is increased by it&amp;mdash;can be punished.

Historically the job of preventing cheating has been given to the teacher. It used to be that in college the professor acted ''[[in loco parentis]]'' and was able to regulate student behavior as a parent.&lt;ref name = hardyburch&gt;"Richard J. Hardy and David Burch, "What Political Science Professors Should Know in Dealing with Academic Dishonesty", ''Teaching Political Science'' 9, no. 2 (Fall 1981), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, professors who discovered cheating could assign essentially any punishment they deemed appropriate. Students often had no mechanism for appeal. Generally, proctors were hired to patrol exams. If a case was particularly serious, a dean or other top-level administrator might have been involved. Against this inconsistent and paternalistic system, students at some schools rebelled and demanded to be treated as adults.

===Honor codes===
{{Main|Academic honor code}}
First at the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1779, and then followed by schools like the University of Virginia in the 1850s and [[Wesleyan University]] in 1893, the students, with the agreement of faculty who declared themselves dedicated to ideals of democracy and human character, created honor codes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Roy Geiger, ''The Honor System in Colleges'' (Williamsburg, VA: College of William and Mary, 1937), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign, a student controlled [[judiciary]] that hears alleged violations, unproctored examinations, and an obligation for all students help enforce the code.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Kenneth D. Butterfield, "Academic Integrity in Honor Code and Non-Honor Code Environments: A Qualitative Investigation", ''The Journal of Higher Education 70, no. 2 (March–April 1999), 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system relied on student self-enforcement, which was considered more becoming of young gentlemen than the policing by proctors and professors that existed previously. Of interest, the [[military academies]] of the US took the honor code one step further than civilian colleges, disallowing "tolerance", which means that if a cadet or midshipman is found to have failed to report or outright protected someone engaged in academic dishonesty (as well as other dishonesties or stealing), that individual is to be expelled along with the perpetrator.

===Mixed judicial boards===
However, many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty. This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Bowers, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly. In response to these concerns, in the middle of the twentieth century, many schools devised mixed judicial panels composed of both students and faculty. This type of academic integrity system was similar to the traditional faculty control system in that it relied on professors to detect cheating, except in this system cheaters were brought before centralized boards of students and faculty for punishment. By the 1960s over a quarter of American universities had adopted this system of mixed judicial boards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  Still, though, over half of American universities continued to use faculty-centered control systems.

===Student due process rights===
Starting in the 1960s, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] began chipping away at the ''in loco parentis'' doctrine, giving college students more [[civil liberties]] such as the right of [[due process]] in disciplinary proceedings (''[[Dixon v. Alabama Board of Education]],'' 1961).&lt;ref name = hardyburch/&gt;  In ''Cooper v. Blair'' (1973), specifically academic misconduct was ruled to require due process, being a disciplinary matter and not an educational matter.{{Citation needed|reason=Could not google anything about it at all.|date=January 2017}} The due process rights of students in academic misconduct cases is not to the same degree as in a court of law. For instance, the student has no right to representation and the burden of proof is not necessarily stringent. In the "General Order on Judicial Standards of Procedure and Substance in Review of Student Discipline in Tax Supported Institutions of Higher Education", (1968) student due process rights were laid out as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
# The student should be given adequate notice in writing of the specific ground or grounds and the nature of the evidence on which the discipline proceedings are based.
# The student should be given an opportunity for a hearing in which the disciplinary authority provides a fair opportunity for hearing of the student's position, explanations, or evidence.
# No disciplinary action may be taken on grounds which are not supported by any substantial evidence.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These new rules put an end to the old faculty-based system of policing academic dishonesty, now students were entitled to an impartial hearing. While schools using the old honor code method or the mixed judicial system were not affected by these decisions, schools using the faculty based system generally instituted systems that relied on a committee of faculty and administrators or a dean to run the academic misconduct hearings.

===Modified honor codes===
Recently, Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, two experts in the field of academic dishonesty, have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process, making it clear that it is the students' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves, but at the same time students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, "Modified Honor Code" 357.&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers who advocate this type of code seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, "Modified Honor Code", 362.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to supporters of this system, schools with a large student body, a weak college community, or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code. However, while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct, research shows that schools with modified codes still have higher rates of cheating than schools with full honor codes.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, "Modified Honor Code", 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of different systems of enforcement===
Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between forms of academic integrity system and levels of cheating at a school. Several studies have found students who attend schools with honor codes are less likely to cheat than students at schools with traditional integrity codes.&lt;ref name="mccabetrevino_honorcode_532" /&gt;  Another study found that only 28% of schools with honor codes have high levels of cheating, whereas 81% of schools with mixed judicial boards have high rates of cheating.&lt;ref name=bowers155 /&gt;  Whereas faculty or administration run codes of conduct tend to rely on policing and punishment to deter students from cheating, honor codes tend to rely on and cultivate student senses of honor and group peer pressure to deter academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe and Trevino, "Multicampus Investigation", 384.&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned above in the section on causes of cheating, increased enforcement or punishment is rarely effective at discouraging cheating, whereas there is a high correlation between peer pressure and academic honesty. The modified honor code attempts to cultivate peer disapproval of cheating while maintaining the traditional proctor system, although critics argue that the proctor system undermines the creation of an atmosphere of student self-policing, reducing the effectiveness of the honor code, possibly explaining why modified honor codes have not been as effective as the original version.

===Faculty issues in deterring academic dishonesty===
There are limitations to relying on the faculty to police academic dishonesty. One study found that up to 21% of professors have ignored at least one clear cut case of cheating.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study revealed that 40% of professors "never" report cheating, 54% "seldom" report cheating, and that a mere 6% act on all cases of academic misconduct that confront them.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A8.&lt;/ref&gt;  A third survey of professors found that while 79% had observed cheating, only 9% had penalized the student.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. McCabe, Kenneth D. Butterfield, and Linda Klebe Trevino, "Faculty and Academic Integrity: The Influence of Current Honor Codes and Past Honor Code Experiences," ''Research in Higher Education'' 44, no. 3 (June 2003), 368.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a manual for professors on cheating,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
the reasons for this lack of action include unwillingness to devote time and energy to the issue, reluctance to undergo an emotional confrontation, and fear of retaliation by the student, of losing students, of being accused of harassment or discrimination, and even of being sued for these offenses and/or defamation of character.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are other reasons as well. Some professors are reluctant to report violations to the appropriate authorities because they believe the punishment to be too harsh.&lt;ref name = schneidera9&gt;Alison Schneider, "Why Professors Don't Do More to Stop Students who Cheat," ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' 22 January 1999, A9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erasmus University |title=2014 Report on Academic Conduct |url=http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2014/4761230/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911071132/http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2014/4761230/ |dead-url=no |archive-date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Others do not report academic misconduct because of [[postmodernist]] views on cheating. Postmodernism calls into question the very concepts of "authorship" and "originality."  From the perspective of cultural studies and historicism, authors themselves are simply constructs of their social surroundings, and thus they simply rewrite already written cultural stories. Moreover, in the field of composition studies, students are being encouraged more and more to do group work and participate in ongoing collective revision. The postmodernist view is that "the concept of intellectual malpractice is of limited [[epistemological]] value. Under the ironic gaze of postmodernism, the distinctions between guilt and innocence, integrity and deceit permeating the scandal debates appear irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Ron Robin, ''Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases that Shook the Academy.'' (Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 2004), 222.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an argument that postmodernism is just [[moral relativism]], therefore cheating is condoned as a valid academic method, even if it is morally and legally wrong. One professor wrote in an article in ''The English Journal'' that when he peeked in on an unproctored class taking a test and saw several students up and consulting with one another, he decided that they were not cheating, but were using non-traditional techniques and collaborative learning to surmount the obstacles teachers had put in their way.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Davis, "Student Cheating: A Defensive Essay," ''The English Journal'' 81, no. 6 (October 1992), 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues of cultural relativism also affect professors' views on cheating; the standard objection being that "students from certain Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures are baffled by the notion that one can 'own' ideas, since their cultures regard words and ideas as the property of all rather than as individual property".&lt;ref&gt;S.H. McLeod quoted in Whitley, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue teachers may have with deterring cheating is that they may decide that it is not their job. The argument that "they're professors, not policemen" is often heard in academia.&lt;ref name = schneidera9/&gt;  In economic terms, some professors believe they are being paid to provide learning, and if the student loses that learning through cheating, he is only cheating himself out of the money he paid.&lt;ref&gt;Decoo, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5914">'''Academic imperialism''' is a form of [[imperialism]] where there is an unequal relation between academics, where one group dominates and the other is dominated or ignored. Early theories of academic imperialism date to the 1960s.&lt;ref name="SangheraAmsler2007"/&gt;

== Definitions ==

Academic imperialism has been defined either in the context of certain disciplines or subdisciplines oppressing others,&lt;ref name="Chilisa2011"/&gt; or (more often) as part of the political imperialism, focused on inequality between academia in the [[First World]] (the West) and [[Third World]].&lt;ref name="SangheraAmsler2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chilisa2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sa3/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ammon1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RaviRutten2004"/&gt;

=== Within disciplines ===
In the intradisciplinary context, an example of imperialistic behavior was the dismissive attitude of the 1920s-1930s adherents of [[behavioral psychology]] in the United States towards non-behavioral psychologists.&lt;ref name="Chilisa2011"/&gt;

=== Internationally ===
In the international context, academic imperialism began in the [[colonialism|colonial period]] when the colonial powers designed and implemented a system of academia in their colonial territories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sa3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ammon1989"/&gt; [[C.

== Relation to academic dependency ==

International academic imperialism generates [[dependency theory|academic dependency]], or the dependency of non-Western scholars on Western academia.&lt;ref name="sa4-5"/&gt; In non-Western countries, science is still dependent on institutions and ideas of Western science, which are often transplanted from Western countries.&lt;ref name=sa4-5/&gt;

Syed Farid Alatas lists the following six aspects of academic dependency:&lt;ref name="sa6"/&gt;

* Dependence on ideas;
* Dependence on the media of ideas;
* Dependence on the technology of education;
* Dependence on aid for research as well as teaching;
* Dependence on investment in education;
* Dependence of Third World social scientists on demand in the West for their skills.

Specific examples of academic dependency include the fact that most major journals are based in the Western countries and carry works by scholars located at Western universities; and that scholars in the Western countries study the entire world, whereas scholars in the non-Western countries focus on their own societies.&lt;ref name="sa7"/&gt; Another example is the dominance of [[English language]] in the world of international academia.&lt;ref name="Ammon1989"/&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
As with all public budgets, the EU's budget is also at risk of [[maladministration]]. Every year, the [[Court of Auditors]] reports on the management of the budget. The introduction of [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and a [[double-entry book-keeping]] system is likely to improve budget management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_200408/ai_n12590016 Auditor blames politicians for EC waste and corruption] (The Sunday Herald, 8 August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to strengthen the means of fraud prevention, the Commission established the [[OLAF|European Anti-Fraud Office]] (OLAF - Office Européen de Lutte Anti-Fraude) by EC, ECSC Decision 1999/352.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999D0352:EN:NOT 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom: Commission Decision of 28 April 1999 establishing the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Office was given responsibility for conducting administrative anti-fraud investigations by having conferred on it a special independent status.

==Auditing==
The [[Court of Auditors]] checks that all the Union's revenue has been received and all its expenditure incurred in a lawful and regular manner and that the EU budget has been managed soundly. The Court was established on 22 July 1975 by the Budgetary Treaty of 1975. The Court started operating as an external Community audit body in October 1977.

==Transparency==
At present, the meetings of the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] (the relevant Minister from each member state) are mostly public, a webcast on the sessions can be seen on the website of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.consilium.europa.eu video.consilium.europa.eu  – Council LIVE]&lt;/ref&gt; What goes on behind the scenes will, of course, never be televised.

Also, the standard of plenary sittings of the [[European Parliament]] is to [[Streaming media|stream]] the debates over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarltv.europa.eu/ europarl'''tv'''] and [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/public/default.do?language=en EP Live] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002111233/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/public/default.do?language=en |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the public can observe sittings directly from a separate gallery. Also, nearly all sittings of [[European Parliament#Organisation|Parliamentary Committees]] are observable by the public,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/public/default.do?language=en EP Live] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002111233/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/public/default.do?language=en |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; except for certain matters such as requests for removal of the parliamentary immunity of a Member of the European Parliament.

In addition, the activities of the [[European Commission]] are subject to [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. The monitoring of the Commission has to be performed by a body that is independent of the Commission, such as "European Anti-Fraud Office" (OLAF) that reports to the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/ OLAF website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">'''Attilio Labis''' (born 1936) is a French ballet dancer and teacher. He began his training at the [[Opéra de Paris]] when he was nine years old and rose through the ranks of the school. In 1952 he was accepted into the corps de ballet Paris Opera Ballet, but in 1958 he had to join the military. Upon the completion his military service, he came back and successfully auditioned for a "Premier Danseur" (First soloist) position after only one week of training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etoiledelopera.e-monsite.com/pages/etoile-homme-de-1960-a-1989/attilio-labis.html= French link]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to "Danseur Étoile" (principal dancer) approximately one year later, after [[André Malraux]] saw him dance "Pas de Dieux", a choreography by [[Gene Kelly]], and recommended he be promoted. He performed as a ''Danseur Étoile'' (principal dancer) in the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] from 1960 to 1972, then taught the company as a ballet teacher until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmi.univ-mrs.fr/~esouche/dance/POBetoiles.html= principal dancer's list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He is seen as having brought many technical innovations to the French school, including more acrobatic steps in solos and duets, and moving the foot higher to the "retiré au genou" (knee height) position for pirouettes, from the old "à la cheville" (ankle height) position.&lt;br&gt;
He often performed with his wife, "Étoile" [[Christine Vlassi]], as well as with other "Étoiles" such as [[Margot Fonteyn]] and [[Claude Bessy (dancer)|Claude Bessy]].&lt;br&gt;
He originated the role of Siegfried in the [[Vladimir Bourmeister]] staging of [[Swan Lake]] at the [[Paris Opera Ballet]].

== Filmography ==

Labis has appeared in several movies and television series, including ''L' Âge en fleur'' (1975), ''Le Spectre de la danse'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&amp;id=1809552920&amp;cf=gen Yahoo Movies link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522072340/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&amp;id=1809552920&amp;cf=gen |date=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Les Cahiers retrouvés de Nina Vyroubova''

The '''Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France''' ('''C2RMF''', ''Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France'') is the national [[Research institute|research centre]] in [[France]] responsible for the [[Documentation (field)|documentation]], [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation and restoration]] of the items held in the collections of more than 1,200 [[museum]]s across France. C2RMF also carries out extensive scientific studies and data recording for these collections, and is active both nationally and internationally in the field of [[cultural heritage]] conservation and analysis. The C2RMF is involved in the development of technologies and scientific procedures employed in the preservation of art works and artefacts, both on its own and in partnership with other museums and research institutions across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre was established in 1998 by an ''arrêté'' (administrative decision) issued by [[Catherine Trautmann]], the then [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture and Communications]], which was gazetted in the ''Journal Officiel'' on December 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998-12-30 |title=Arrêté du 16 décembre 1998 érigeant divers services de la direction des musées de France en services à compétence nationale |url=http://admi.net/jo/1998/19955.html |journal=[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] |issue=302 |page=19955 |id=NOR: MCCB9800657A |accessdate=2008-04-22|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by merging the functions and facilities of two other research bodies, the [[Laboratoire de recherche des musées de France]] (LRMF, ''Research Laboratory of the Museums of France'') and the [[Service de restauration des musées de France]] (SRMF, ''Restoration Service of the Museums of France'') and it is organized in 4 departments. Today the center is affiliated to the [[CNRS]] with the label UMR-171.

In 2005 Mme. [[Christiane Naffah]] was appointed director of the centre by the French Minister of Culture and Communications [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], replacing Jean-Pierre Mohen. Naffah had been a [[curator]] in France's [[national museum]]s since 1977, and prior to her appointment had held positions at the [[Louvre]], [[Musée du Quai Branly]] and had been director of the [[Institut du monde arabe|Musée de l'institut du monde arabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=[[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication]] |date=2005-07-27|title=Christiane Naffah est nommée directrice du Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/donnedieu/c2rmf.html |accessdate=2008-04-22|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actual director is Mme. [[Marie Lavandier]].

Since the early 1930s, over 174,000 paintings and 34,000 objects have been individually studied or restored by the C2RMF, and its predecessor organisations LRMF and SRMF.&lt;ref&gt;Lahanier (2004, p.158)&lt;/ref&gt;

The C2RMF's key activities focus on the study of works of art at both a national and regional level. It undertakes investigations prior to any acquisition. Equipped with world-class experimental facilities that are constantly being improved, like the [[particle accelerator]] [[Accélérateur Grand Louvre d'analyse élémentaire|AGLAE]], the C2RMF focuses its research on several key areas: the physical
and chemical characteristics of materials, the ageing of materials, database management, image analysis, digitisation and 3D modelling. The C2RMF is one of the most experienced centres in the world in the use of scientific techniques on art works. They have an unparalleled knowledge and experience of the current state-of-the-art in the practical capture of 3D data from many different types of artefact. The latest research has concerned the multispectral imaging of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Colantoni ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ontologies and the semantic web and the 3D modelling of objects and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Pitzalis ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has achieved significant results with an Open Source database management system that provides multilingual access (17 languages) to specialised vocabularies for the cultural museum sector and a semantic interface to browse the results.

'''Christopher John "Chris" Offutt''' (born August 24, 1958) is an American writer. He is most widely known for his short stories and novels, but he has also published two memoirs and nonfiction articles. In 2005, he had a story included in a comic book collection edited by [[Michael Chabon]], and another in the anthology ''Noir''. He has written episodes for the TV series ''[[True Blood]]'' and ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]].''

==Early life and education==
Chris Offutt was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], the son of [[Andrew J. Offutt]], an author, and his wife Jodie. His brother [[Jeff Offutt]] is a professor of software engineering. He has two sisters, Scotty Hyde, who lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Melissa Offutt, in San Diego. They grew up in [[Haldeman, Kentucky|Haldeman]], a small former [[mining]] community located in [[Rowan County, Kentucky|Rowan County]] in the [[Appalachian Mountain]] foothills of eastern Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Preston| first = Tim| title = Chris Offutt: From Morehead to Hollywood| work = [[The Independent (Ashland)|The Independent]]| accessdate = 2015-04-19| date = 2014-01-13| url = http://www.dailyindependent.com/news/local_news/chris-offutt-from-morehead-to-hollywood/article_76611310-4e88-58e1-b4d3-c47af23c5ac3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They all attended public schools. Offutt quit high school intending to join the army, but failed the physical.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 
Offutt subsequently attended [[Morehead State University]] and graduated with a degree in theater and a minor in English. After college, he hitchhiked around the country, taking more than 50 jobs, all part-time, and began writing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Offutt later attended the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].

==Literary career==
In 1992, Offutt published his first short story collection, ''Kentucky Straight''. His second book was the 1993 memoir ''The Same River Twice''. In 1997 he published his first novel, ''The Good Brother''.

In 1999, he published his second collection of stories, ''Out of the Woods''. His next book was a memoir, ''No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home'' (2002), about a six-month return to [[Rowan County, Kentucky|Rowan County]] where he had lived as a child.

In 2005, Offutt made his comic book debut when he wrote "Another Man's Escape" for ''[[Michael Chabon]] Presents: The Amazing Adventures of [[The Escapist (character)|the Escapist]]''.  A second comic is included in the anthology ''Noir'', from Dark Horse Comics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Offutt has been a visiting faculty member at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], the [[University of Montana]], the [[University of New Mexico]], [[Grinnell College]], Morehead State University, and [[Mercer University]]. He is teaching at the [[University of Mississippi]] as visiting faculty.

In addition to his fiction, Offutt writes non-fiction articles, which have been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Men's Journal]]'', and the ''Oxford American'' and aired on [[National Public Radio]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} His work is widely translated, and it is taught in high schools and colleges. His stories are included in many anthologies, including ''Best American Short Stories'', and ''New Stories of the South'' (four works). They have twice been featured on "Selected Shorts" on [[NPR]]. He has also written screenplays for TV series.

==Honors==
His work has received awards from the Lannan Foundation, [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. He received a [[Whiting Awards|Whiting Award]] in Fiction and Nonfiction. In 1996 Offutt was named one of the twenty best young American fiction writers by ''[[Granta]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestyoungnovelists.com/Granta-54-Best-of-Young-American-Novelists-1-1996 "Best of Young American Novelists"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515150030/http://www.bestyoungnovelists.com/Granta-54-Best-of-Young-American-Novelists-1-1996 |date=May 15, 2010 }}, Granta 54,&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37625">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''cognitive load''' refers to the effort being used in the [[working memory]].  Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

''Intrinsic'' cognitive load is the effort associated with a specific topic, ''extraneous'' cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner, and ''germane'' cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a [[schema (psychology)|schema]].

Cognitive load theory was developed  in the late 1980s out of a study of [[problem solving]] by [[John Sweller]].&lt;ref name="Sweller, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=J|title=Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=June 1988|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257–285|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller argued that [[instructional design]] can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners.
Much later, other researchers developed a way to measure perceived mental effort which is indicative of cognitive load.&lt;ref name=Paas1993&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paas|first1=Fred G. W. C.|last2=Van Merriënboer|first2=Jeroen J. G.|title=The Efficiency of Instructional Conditions: An Approach to Combine Mental Effort and Performance Measures|journal=Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|date=1993|volume=35|issue=4|pages=737–743|doi=10.1177/001872089303500412|url=http://hfs.sagepub.com/content/35/4/737.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Measuring Cognitive Load in Embodied Learning Settings |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |date=2017 |volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01191}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Task-invoked pupillary response]] is a reliable and sensitive measurement of cognitive load that is directly related to [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pupillary responses index cognitive resource limitations|journal=Psychophysiology|date=July 1996|volume=33|issue=4|pages=457–461|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1996.tb01071.x|pmid=8753946|author1=Granholm|first1=E.|last2=Asarnow|first2=R. F.|last3=Sarkin|first3=A. J.|last4=Dykes|first4=K. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy cognitive load can have negative effects on task completion, and it is important to note that the experience of cognitive load is not the same in everyone. The elderly, students, and children experience different, and more often higher, amounts of cognitive load.

High cognitive load in the elderly has been shown to affect their center of balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersson|first1=Gerhard|last2=Hagman|first2=Jenni|last3=Talianzadeh|first3=Roya|last4=Svedberg|first4=Alf|last5=Larsen|first5=Hans Christian|title=Effect of cognitive load on postural control|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=May 2002|volume=58|issue=1|pages=135–139|doi=10.1016/s0361-9230(02)00770-0|pmid=12121823}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increased distractions, particularly from cell phone use, students are more prone to experiencing high cognitive load which can reduce academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frein|first1=Scott T.|last2=Jones|first2=Samantha L.|last3=Gerow|first3=Jennifer E.|title=When it comes to Facebook there may be more to bad memory than just multitasking|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2013|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2179–2182|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
"Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance".&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Van Merriënboer, J. |author3=Paas, F.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998 |title=Cognitive architecture and instructional design |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume= 10 |issue=3 |pages=251–296 |doi=10.1023/A:1022193728205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller's theory employs aspects of [[information processing]] theory to emphasize the inherent limitations of concurrent [[working memory]] load on learning during instruction. It makes use of the [[schema (psychology)|schema]] as primary unit of analysis for the design of [[instructional materials]].

===History===
The history of cognitive load theory can be traced to the beginning of Cognitive Science in the 1950s and the work of [[George Armitage Miller|G.A. Miller]]. In his classic paper,&lt;ref name="Miller, 1956"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller, G.A. |year=1956 |title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity to process information  |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |pages=81–97 |doi=10.1037/h0043158 |pmid=13310704 |issue=2|titlelink=The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was perhaps the first to suggest our [[Working memory#Capacity|working memory capacity]] has inherent limits.  His experimental results suggested that humans are generally able to hold only [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|seven plus or minus two units]] of information in short-term memory. And in the early 1970s Simon and Chase&lt;ref name="Simon and Chase, 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chase, W.G.  |author2=Simon, H.A. |year=1973 |title=Perception in chess |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=55–81 |doi= 10.1016/0010-0285(73)90004-2|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to use the term "chunk" to describe how people might organize information in short-term memory. This chunking of memory components has also been described as [[schema (psychology)|schema]] construction.

In the late 1980s [[John Sweller]] developed cognitive load theory (CLT) while studying problem solving.&lt;ref name="Sweller, 1988"/&gt; Studying learners as they solved problems, he and his associates found that learners often use a problem solving strategy called [[means-ends analysis]]. He suggests problem solving by means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity, which may not be devoted to schema construction. Sweller suggests that instructional designers should prevent this unnecessary cognitive load by designing instructional materials which do not involve problem solving. Examples of alternative instructional materials include what are known as worked-examples and goal-free problems.

In the 1990s, cognitive load theory was applied in several contexts. The empirical results from these studies led to the demonstration of several learning effects: the completion-problem effect;&lt;ref name="Paas, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paas, F. |year=1992 |title=Training strategies for attaining transfer of problem-solving skill in statistics: A cognitive-load approach |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=429–434 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[modality effect]];&lt;ref name="Moreno &amp; Mayer, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moreno, R. |author2=Mayer, R.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1999 |title=Cognitive principles of multimedia learning: The role of modality and contiguity |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=358–368 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358|citeseerx=10.1.1.458.4719  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mousavi, S. |author2=Low, R. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=319–334 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[split-attention effect]];&lt;ref name="Chandler and Sweller, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1992 |title=The split-attention effect as a factor in the design of instruction |journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=62 |issue=2  |pages=233–246 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.1992.tb01017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[worked-example effect]];&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cooper, G. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=Effects of schema acquisition and rule automation on mathematical problem-solving transfer |journal= Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=347–362 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Cooper, G.A.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1985 |title=The use of worked examples as a substitute for problem solving in learning algebra |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59–89 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[expertise reversal effect]].&lt;ref name="Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kalyuga, S. |author2=Ayres, P.

==Types==
Cognitive load theory provides a general framework and has broad implications for [[instructional design]], by allowing instructional designers to control the conditions of learning within an environment or, more generally, within most instructional materials. Specifically, it provides empirically-based guidelines that help instructional designers decrease extraneous cognitive load during learning and thus refocus the learner's attention toward germane materials, thereby increasing germane (schema related) cognitive load. This theory differentiates between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic cognitive load, germane cognitive load, and extraneous cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998" /&gt;

===Intrinsic===
''Intrinsic cognitive load'' is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. The term was first used in the early 1990s by Chandler and Sweller.&lt;ref name="Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P.  |author2=Sweller, J. |year=1991 |title=Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=293–332 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/edupapers/128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, all instruction has an inherent difficulty associated with it (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a [[differential equation]]). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor. However, many schemas may be broken into individual "subschemas" and taught in isolation, to be later brought back together and described as a combined whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|title=Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=41|issue=2|pages=75–86|year=2006|last1=Kirschner|first1=Paul A.|last2=Sweller|first2=John|last3=Clark|first3=Richard E.|url=http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329224506/http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraneous===
''Extraneous cognitive load'' is generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners and is under the control of instructional designers.&lt;ref name="Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991" /&gt; This load can be attributed to the design of the instructional materials. Because there is a single limited cognitive resource using resources to process the extraneous load, the amount of resources available to process the intrinsic load and germane load (i.e., learning) is reduced. Thus, especially when intrinsic and/or germane load is high (i.e., when a problem is difficult), materials should be designed so as to reduce the extraneous load.&lt;ref name="Ginns, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ginns, P. |year= 2006 |title=Integrating information: A meta-analysis of the spatial contiguity and temporal contiguity effects |journal=Learning and Instruction |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=511–525 |doi= 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of extraneous cognitive load occurs when there are two possible ways to describe a square to a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clark, R. |author2=Nguyen, F. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006 |title=Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-Based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load |location=San Francisco |publisher=Pfeiffer |isbn=978-0-7879-7728-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A square is a figure and should be described using a figural medium. Certainly an instructor can describe a square in a verbal medium, but it takes just a second and far less effort to see what the instructor is talking about when a learner is shown a square, rather than having one described verbally. In this instance, the efficiency of the visual medium is preferred. This is because it does not unduly load the learner with unnecessary information. This unnecessary cognitive load is described as extraneous.

Chandler and Sweller introduced the concept of extraneous cognitive load. This article was written to report the results of six experiments that they conducted to investigate this working memory load. Many of these experiments involved materials demonstrating the [[split attention effect]]. They found that the format of instructional materials either promoted or limited learning. They proposed that differences in performance were due to higher levels of the cognitive load imposed by the format of instruction. "Extraneous cognitive load" is a term for this unnecessary (artificially induced) cognitive load.

===Germane===
''Germane cognitive load'' is the processing, construction and automation of [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]. It was first described by Sweller, Van Merriënboer and Paas in 1998. While [https://acmecollinsschool.com/blog/cognitive-load intrinsic cognitive load] is generally thought to be immutable (although techniques can be applied to manage complexity by segmenting and sequencing complex material), instructional designers can manipulate extraneous and germane load. It is suggested that they limit extraneous load and promote germane load.&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998"/&gt;

Until the 1998 article by Sweller, Van Merriënboer &amp; Paas, cognitive load theory primarily concentrated on the reduction of extraneous cognitive load. With this article, cognitive load researchers began to seek ways of redesigning instruction to redirect what would be extraneous load, to now be focused toward schema construction (germane load). Thus it is very important for instructional designers to "reduce extraneous cognitive load and redirect learners' attention to cognitive processes that are directly relevant to the construction of schemas".&lt;ref&gt;(Sweller et al., 1998, p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Paas and Van Merriënboer&lt;ref name=Paas1993/&gt; developed a construct (known as relative condition efficiency) which helps researchers measure perceived mental effort, an index of cognitive load. This construct provides a relatively simple means of comparing instructional conditions. It combines mental effort ratings with performance scores. Group mean z-scores are graphed and may be compared with a one-way [[ANOVA|Analysis of variance (ANOVA)]].

Paas and Van Merriënboer used relative condition efficiency to compare three instructional conditions (worked examples, completion problems, and discovery practice). They found learners who studied worked examples were the most efficient, followed by those who used the problem completion strategy. Since this early study many other researchers have used this and other constructs to measure cognitive load as it relates to learning and instruction.&lt;ref name="Paas et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Paas, F. |author2=Tuovinen, J.E. |author3=Tabbers, H.K. |author4=Van Gerven, P.W.M.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2003 |title=Cognitive load measurement as a means to advance cognitive load theory |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=63–71 |doi=10.1207/S15326985EP3801_8|citeseerx=10.1.1.670.1047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ergonomic approach seeks a quantitative neurophysiological expression of cognitive load which can be measured using common instruments, for example using the [[heart rate]]-[[blood pressure]] product (RPP) as a measure of both cognitive and physical occupational workload.&lt;ref name="Fredericks et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fredericks T.K. |author2=Choi S.D. |author3=Hart J. |author4=Butt S.E. |author5=Mital A. |year=2005 |title=An investigation of myocardial aerobic capacity as a measure of both physical and cognitive workloads |journal=International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1097–1107 |doi= 10.1016/j.ergon.2005.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that it may be possible to use RPP measures to set limits on workloads and for establishing work allowance.

[[Task-invoked pupillary response]] is a form of measurement that directly reflects the cognitive load on [[working memory]]. Greater pupil dilation is found to be associated with high cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"/&gt; Pupil constriction occurs when there is low cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"/&gt; [[Task-invoked pupillary response]] shows a direct correlation with working memory, making it an effective measurement of cognitive load explicitly unrelated to learning.

Some researchers have compared different measures of cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey 2017" /&gt;  For example, Deleeuw and Mayer (2008)&lt;ref name="DeLeeuw and Mayer (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DeLeeuw, K.E. |author2=Mayer, R.E.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=A comparison of three measures of cognitive load: Evidence for separable measures of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=223–234 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.100.1.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared three commonly used measures of cognitive load and found that they responded in different ways to extraneous, intrinsic, and germane load.

==Individual differences in processing capacity==
Evidence has been found that individuals systematically differ in their processing capacity.&lt;ref name="Scandura, 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scandura|first1=Joseph M.|title=Deterministic Theorizing in Structural Learning: Three Levels of Empiricism|journal=Journal of Structural Learning|language=en|date=1971|volume=3|issue= 1|pp=21–53|citeseerx=10.1.1.532.3585|issn=0022-4774|id=[[ERIC]]: [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ085112 EJ085112]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voorhies &amp; Scandura, 1977"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voorhies|first1= D.|last2=Scandura|first2=J.

M.|location=New York|chapter= Determination of memory load in information processing|pp=299–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are individual differences in processing capacities between novices and experts.&lt;ref name="Murphy and Wright 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Gregory L.|last2=Wright|first2=Jack C.|title=Changes in conceptual structure with expertise: Differences between real-world experts and novices.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1984|volume=10|issue=1|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.1.144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have more knowledge or experience with regard to a specific task which reduces the cognitive load associated with the task. Novices do not have this experience or knowledge and thus have heavier cognitive load.

It has been theorized that an impoverished environment can contribute to cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Mani et al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mani|first1=A.|last2=Mullainathan|first2=S.|last3=Shafir|first3=E.|last4=Zhao|first4=J.|title=Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function|journal=Science|date=29 August 2013|volume=341|issue=6149|pages=976–980|doi=10.1126/science.1238041|pmid=23990553|bibcode=2013Sci...341..976M|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.6303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the task at hand, or the processes used in solving the task, people who experience poverty also experience higher cognitive load. A number of factors contribute to the cognitive load in people with lower [[socioeconomic status]] that are not present in middle and upper-class people.&lt;ref name="Hackman and Farah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackman|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Farah|first2=Martha J.|title=Socioeconomic status and the developing brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=February 2009|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003|pmid=19135405|pmc=3575682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying the processing capacity of individuals could be extremely useful in further adapting instruction (or predicting the behavior) of individuals. Accordingly, further research would clearly be desirable. First, it is essential to compute the memory load imposed by detailed analysis of the processes to be used. Second, it is essential to ensure that individual subjects are actually using those processes. The latter requires intensive pre-training.

==Effects of heavy cognitive load==
{{See also|Audience effect|Drive theory}}
A heavy cognitive load typically creates [[error]] or some kind of interference in the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Paas, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moreno &amp; Mayer, 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandler and Sweller, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003"/&gt; A heavy cognitive load can also increase [[Stereotype|stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="Biernat et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biernat|first1=Monica|last2=Kobrynowicz|first2=Diane|last3=Weber|first3=Dara L.|title=Stereotypes and Shifting Standards: Some Paradoxical Effects of Cognitive Load|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=October 2003|volume=33|issue=10|pages=2060–2079|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01875.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stereotype|Stereotyping]] is an extension of the [[Fundamental Attribution Error]] which also increases in frequency with heavier cognitive load.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989&gt;Gilbert, D. T. (1989). Thinking lightly about others: Automatic components of the social inference process. In J. S. Uleman &amp; J. A. Bargh (Eds.), ''Unintended thought'' (pp. 189–211). New York, Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The notions of cognitive load and [[arousal]] contribute to the "Overload Hypothesis" explanation of [[social facilitation]]: in the presence of an audience, subjects tend to perform worse in subjectively complex tasks (whereas they tend to excel in subjectively easy tasks).

==Sub-population studies==
===Elderly===
The danger of heavy cognitive load is seen in the elderly population. Aging can cause declines in the efficiency of [[working memory]] which can contribute to higher cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Wingfield et al. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wingfield|first1=Arthur|last2=Stine|first2=Elizabeth A.L.|last3=Lahar|first3=Cindy J.|last4=Aberdeen|first4=John S.|title=Does the capacity of working memory change with age?|journal=Experimental Aging Research|date=June 1988|volume=14|issue=2|pages=103–107|doi=10.1080/03610738808259731|pmid=3234452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between heavy cognitive load and control of [[center of mass]] are heavily correlated in the elderly population. As cognitive load increases, the sway in [[center of mass]] in elderly individuals increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = G. | last2 = Hagman | first2 = J. | last3 = Talianzadeh | first3 = R. | last4 = Svedberg | first4 = A. | last5 = Larsen | first5 = H. C. | year = 2002 | title = Effect of cognitive load on postural control | url = | journal = Brain Research Bulletin | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 135–139 | doi=10.1016/s0361-9230(02)00770-0| pmid = 12121823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined the relationship between body sway and cognitive function and their relationship during multitasking and found disturbances in balance led to a decrease in performance on the cognitive task&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01147.x|pmid=17397436|title=Multitasking: Association Between Poorer Performance and a History of Recurrent Falls|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=55|issue=4|pages=570–576|year=2007|last1=Faulkner|first1=Kimberly A.|last2=Redfern|first2=Mark S.|last3=Cauley|first3=Jane A.|last4=Landsittel|first4=Douglas P.|last5=Studenski|first5=Stephanie A.|last6=Rosano|first6=Caterina|last7=Simonsick|first7=Eleanor M.|last8=Harris|first8=Tamara B.|last9=Shorr|first9=Ronald I.|last10=Ayonayon|first10=Hilsa N.|last11=Newman|first11=Anne B.|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy cognitive load can disturb [[balance (ability)|balance]] in elderly people. Conversely, an increasing demand for balance can increase cognitive load.

===College students===
With the widespread acceptance of laptops in the classroom, an increasing cognitive load while in school is a major concern. With the use of [[Facebook]] and other social forms of communication, adding multiple tasks is hurting students performance in the classroom. When many cognitive resources are available, the probability of switching from one task to another is high and does not lead to optimal switching behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calderwood | first1 = C. | last2 = Ackerman | first2 = P. L. | last3 = Conklin | first3 = E. M. | year = 2014 | title = What else do college students "do" while studying? An investigation of multitasking | url = | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 19–29 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both students who were heavy Facebook users and students who sat nearby those who were heavy [[Facebook]] users performed poorly and resulted in lower [[GPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frein | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Jones | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Gerow | first3 = J. E. | year = 2013 | title = When it comes to Facebook there may be more to bad memory than just multitasking | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 2179–2182 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sana | first1 = F. | last2 = Weston | first2 = T. | last3 = Cepeda | first3 = N.

===Children===
The components of [[working memory]] as proposed by British psychologists, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]], are in place at 6 years of age.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gathercole|first1=Susan E.|last2=Pickering|first2=Susan J.|last3=Ambridge|first3=Benjamin|last4=Wearing|first4=Hannah|title=The Structure of Working Memory From 4 to 15 Years of Age.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=177–190|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.177|pmid=14979759|date=March 2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.529.2727}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a clear difference between adult and child knowledge. These differences are due to developmental increases in processing efficiency.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; Children lack general knowledge, and this is what creates increased cognitive load in children. Children in impoverished families often experience even higher cognitive load in learning environments than those in middle-class families.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; These children do not hear, talk, or learn about schooling concepts because their parents often do not have formal education. When it comes to learning, their lack of experience with numbers, words, and concepts increases their cognitive load.

As children grow older they develop superior basic processes and capacities.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alibali|first1=Robert S. Siegler, Martha|title=Children's thinking|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Education/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0131113848|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also develop [[metacognition]], which helps them to understand their own cognitive activities.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; Lastly, they gain greater content knowledge through their experiences.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; These elements help reduce cognitive load in children as they develop.

[[Gesture|Gesturing]] is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking.&lt;ref name="Gathercole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ping|first1=Raedy|last2=Goldin-Meadow|first2=Susan|title=Gesturing Saves Cognitive Resources When Talking About Nonpresent Objects|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=34|issue=4|pages=602–619|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01102.x|pmid=21564226|year=2010|pmc=3733275}}&lt;/ref&gt; By gesturing, they can free up [[working memory]] for other tasks.&lt;ref name="Gathercole"/&gt; Pointing allows a child to use the object they are pointing at as the best representation of it, which means they do not have to hold this representation in their [[working memory]], thereby reducing their cognitive load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballard|first1=Dana H.|last2=Hayhoe|first2=Mary M.|last3=Pook|first3=Polly K.|last4=Rao|first4=Rajesh P. N.|title=Deictic codes for the embodiment of cognition|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1 December 1997|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1017/s0140525x97001611|pmid=10097009|pages=723–42; discussion 743–67|citeseerx=10.1.1.49.3813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, gesturing about an object that is absent reduces the difficulty of having to picture it in their mind.&lt;ref name="Gathercole"/&gt;

==Embodiment and interactivity==
Bodily activity can both be advantageous and detrimental to learning depending on how this activity is implemented.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Embodied learning: introducing a taxonomy based on bodily engagement and task integration |journal=Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1186/s41235-018-0092-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive load theorists have asked for updates that makes CLT more compatible with insights from [[embodied cognition]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10648-011-9179-2|title=An Evolutionary Upgrade of Cognitive Load Theory: Using the Human Motor System and Collaboration to Support the Learning of Complex Cognitive Tasks|journal=Educational Psychology Review|volume=24|issue=1|pages=27–45|year=2011|last1=Paas|first1=Fred|last2=Sweller|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Embodied Cognitive Load Theory has been suggested as a means to predict the usefulness of interactive features in learning environments.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski et al., 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skulmowski|first1=Alexander|last2=Pradel|first2=Simon|last3=Kühnert|first3=Tom|last4=Brunnett|first4=Guido|last5=Rey|first5=Günter Daniel|title=Embodied learning using a tangible user interface: The effects of haptic perception and selective pointing on a spatial learning task|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=92–93|pages=64–75|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.011|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, the benefits of an interactive feature (such as easier cognitive processing) need to exceed its cognitive costs (such as motor coordination) in order for an embodied mode of interaction to increase learning outcomes.

[[File:Tips for how to handle a college interview.png|thumb|right|300px]]
A '''college interview''' is a short face-to-face meeting, usually between a college admissions officer and a high school student applying for admission. It is one of several ways for a college to assess an applicant along with grade transcripts and standardized scores and essays.&lt;ref name=twsMay2S213&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efinger advises students to write up their major achievements, organize them into themes, and have a three to five minute theme-oriented "success story" ready (but not memorized) before an interview, and suggests that interviewees should try to steer the conversation to show how their skills and experience meet criteria valued by the interviewer. For example, if trying to demonstrate an aptitude for "planning and organization", he or she might show how they plan their schedule using their mobile scheduling app.

Advisers agree that a usual open-ended question to begin the interview will be along the lines of "tell me about yourself", and that a student should be ready with a response.&lt;ref name="twsBuffaloSuntimes"&gt;{{cite web

A '''Commons Club''' is a type of social organization whose membership is "open" rather than selective based on personal introduction and invitation. It may also refer to the lodge or other meeting facility associated with such a club and used for its activities. Usually, ''Commons Club'' refers to a type of men's social organization which flourished at institutions of [[higher education]] in [[North America]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Principles==
Commons Clubs both emulated and differentiated themselves from [[fraternities]] and other competing social institutions. They provided a [[social network]], but membership was usually open to anyone interested in joining. The resources of a large organization could be put to sponsoring events and activities, as well as providing dining and housing, beyond the means of an individual student. Commons Clubs over time came to identify their chief ideals as [[Democracy]], [[Community service|Service]], and Brotherhood.

===Commons Club Creed===
I Believe in Democracy... a democracy characterized by the practice of justice in every relation of life. I hold that justice is the foremost principle to be considered in making my decisions as a voting member of the Commons Club, the student body, and as a citizen of the United States. I believe in that broad conception of democracy which seeks freedom of opportunity, and recognizes no color, race, creed, or position.

I Believe in Service... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact.

I Believe in Brotherhood... Brotherhood that reaches beyond the limits of the Commons Club and welcomes every man as my Brother. I believe in the intrinsic worth of the man at my side, and in his ability to make good and justify my faith in him.

I hold these beliefs as my profound conviction, and I pledge my fellow men to live up to them to the best of my ability.

==History==
Greek-letter literary and philosophical societies, starting with [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (est. 1779), rose at American [[University|universities]] as an outlet for students frustrated with the traditional [[curriculum]] centered on the [[classics]]. Some early organizations to use the phrase "commons club" were of this type, their name referring to the democracy and debates of the [[British House of Commons]]. In the mid-19th century, general or "social" [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] supplanted the literary fraternities, to the point where "independent" students became disadvantaged in campus awards and activities as opposed to "Greeks" and considered to occupy a lower position in the social hierarchy of the time.

===Wesleyan Commons Club===
The founding of the first Commons Club can be tentatively traced back to the founding of Wesleyan University.  The founders of [[Wesleyan University]] selected Dr. [[Wilbur Fisk]], a Methodist preacher who had successfully revived the Wesleyan Academy in Massachusetts during the late 1820s, as the first President.   Dr. Fisk was widely known to be an opponent of abolitionism, as he saw in it a threat to divide the Methodist Church.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, David. Wesleyan University 1831-1910, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 8, 1833, a group known as the Tub Philosophers or the Cynics, the first 4-year secret society on the Wesleyan Campus, rose in opposition to Dr. Fisk.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Bernard C. Contributions to American Educational History: No. 14, The History of Education in Connecticut. (Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1893), p. 279  See also: Nicolson, Frank Walter. Alumni Record of Wesleyan University. (The Tuttle, Morehouse &amp; Taylor Company. 1881) p. lxxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired by the Rev. [[John Wesley]]'s pamphlet "Thoughts Upon Slavery,"&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, Rev. John A.M. Thoughts Upon Slavery. 4th ed. (W. Whitestone, Dublin, 1775).&lt;/ref&gt; they decided to form a group based upon the "[[Golden Rule]]."  This group would go through many changes (changed name to Thecannies Society in 1839 and again changed name to Wesleyan House of Commons Debating Society 1840) and have a tenuous and possibly discontinuous existence until [[Woodrow Wilson]] would reorganize it in 1889.

As a counter to the advantages held by the "Greeks," [[Woodrow Wilson]], then a member of the [[Wesleyan University]] faculty, reformed the Wesleyan House of Commons Debating Society in 1889 to look after the social need of male students outside the fraternity system. In 1899, sixteen non-fraternity men, led by Frederick Clark, Thomas Travis, and Herbert Ward, formally established the Wesleyan Commons Club.  In November 1899, they met and talked the matter over with Dr. Frank Walter Nicolson, Dean.  Dean Nicolson was impressed with the fact that the non-fraternity members of the college were boarding around town or boarding themselves with no social opportunities.  The Dean suggested to the President of the University that the Trustees do something.  A newspaper contribution also appeared as the result of discussions among this group picturing the drab lot of the non-fraternity men at Wesleyan  Dean Nicolson persuaded the trustees of Wesleyan to convert the unused Foss House on the campus, formerly a private dwelling, into a new college-operated lunchroom, and lounging place, or “Commons” for the Commons Club. The Trustees organized the Commons Club as a dining hall, beginning with thirty-eight members, setting the price of board at $2.25 a week.  The next fall, the membership increased to seventy and the college enlarged the building in which they were dining to provide meeting rooms for the group.  Because of the financial aid provided, the Trustees felt free to make a condition that all undergraduate members of the college, not belonging to fraternities, should be offered an election to the group regardless of race, color or creed.&lt;ref&gt;"Our History - C.C. Chronicles" The Commons Club Chronicle, Vol. VI, No.1, June, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Federation of Commons Clubs===
The success of the Wesleyan Commons Club inspired the founding of similar organizations at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Middlebury College]], and [[Norwich University]]. These four formed the National Federation of Commons Clubs in 1906, which would add thirteen additional members by 1918 as well as numerous non-aligned Commons Clubs on campuses throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/10/19/100654351.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the increase in chapter memberships, went a great many improvements, following the easiest course in imitation of the older Greek-letter societies which were close at hand in every college, rather than in sticking to original principles or in making novel but difficult improvements.  The Commons Clubs adopted, one after the other, most of the characteristics of the Greek-letter fraternities, not, however, without a fight at every adoption by the sterner, more democratic element in every chapter.  The innovations consisted of yearly conventions, an annual magazine, initiation and installation rituals, robes, secret hand grips, badges, pennants, private fraternity houses, alumni organizations, and the like.

Because membership was open, a Commons Club could grow to a size unwieldy to govern, inadequate for forming close friendships, and unsuited to the effective advancement of their stated ideals. Factions and in some cases whole clubs split away and sought petitions from national fraternities or declared themselves a local fraternity. In 1905, ten members of the Middlebury Commons Club, including President George E. Kimball, left to form a new organization which later became the [[Kappa Delta Rho]] national fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kdr.com/content/8/About-KDR/About-Kappa-Delta-Rho/&lt;/ref&gt; The weak organization of the Federation itself left it vulnerable to splits along competing visions. The never-solved problems of the national order included that of financial support of an adequate system of national control and chapter assistance, without so raising the cost of membership as to defeat the democratic principles of the order; and that of maintaining an efficient and progressive national administration, while still fostering freedom of action of chapters and of individual members.  Most of the national officials, by terms of the constitution, were unpaid undergraduates with little power and with scant financial allotment.  National control was entirely lacking.  Local autonomy allowed the chapters to develop without any spirit of national unity.

As the principles of the order became crystallized and some attempts were made to secure closer national control and similarity among the chapters, the old fight between the democratic and the progressive elements broke out in a more organized way.  That is, the progressive elements in a number of chapters lined up against the democratic factions of other chapters and brought their arguments into the columns of the Chronicle and to the convention floor in 1916, 1917, and 1918.

An attempt was made by the national officers to postpone the 1918 annual convention in an effort to consolidate the interior position of the order, but the storm which had been hovering for years was far too advanced to stem.  Ironically, the Wesleyan Commons Club hastened the storm by proposing in a 1917 round robin letter that the order use a Greek-letter name "[[Phi Mu Delta]]."  The "progressives" insisted upon meeting and settling the question.  Only a small representation attended the convention, delegates from seven of the remaining thirteen chapters.  The progressives controlled the delegates of four chapters, the democrats of three.  A compromise was tried but found unacceptable to either side.  The progressives insisted upon a Greek-letter name and exclusive membership policies and the democrats leaned over backwards on the fundamental democratic principles of the order and insisted that the original wide open membership plan be strictly enforced and the old name retained.

The 1918 convention split into two separate meetings, [[Union College]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[University of Vermont]], and [[University of New Hampshire]] delegates retiring.  Clarence Dexter Pierce, a member of the [[University of Vermont]] Commons Club, successfully sponsored a resolution to declare the Federation a Greek-letter fraternity, with its attendant structure and selectivity. The Commons Clubs at the University of Vermont, [[University of New Hampshire]], and University of Connecticut ratified the plan, forming what is now the [[Phi Mu Delta]] national fraternity. While the Union College Commons Club intended to join its counterparts in organizing [[Phi Mu Delta]], the group instead elected to refound the Alpha Charge of [[Theta Delta Chi]] in 1923 because of pressure from its alumni.

Those from [[Wesleyan]], [[Tufts]], and [[Massachusetts]], remaining, revised the Commons Club constitution, providing for compulsory adherence to the wide open membership policies of the original [[Wesleyan]] Commons Club. The revised Commons Clubs secured the ratification of their more strict democratic constitution by the [[Hobart]] chapter and by the nominally-existing but really war-casualty [[St. Lawrence]] chapter, and with the three convention stand-patters: Wesleyan, Tufts, and Massachusetts; carried on as the National Federation of Commons Clubs.  By 1928 all the remaining chapters had withdrawn from the Federation and it died.

===American Association of Commons Clubs===
While the National Federation of Commons Clubs, as such, passed into limbo because of the indifference of the members following [[World War I]], the Commons Club movement is still present on many campuses of the United States.  Due to the zealous extension activities of the Federation's members up to 1917, the Commons Club idea was spread widely.

The most important transplanting of this seed was in the formation of the American Association of Commons Clubs (AACC), while never actually a formal part of the federation, it is an historical descendant of it.  The seed of the idea was carried to the campus of [[Denison University]] as early as 1914, during the extension campaign, and was harbored there.  The resultant local Denison Commons Club was assisted by literature of the federation and by the [[Allegheny College]] chapter, at the time of its formation in 1916-17, and again in 1920 by the Federation officers, just prior to the completion of a movement at [[Denison University]] to organize a union of local Commons Clubs of the Midwest.  Founded  as a "non-fraternity" (but never anti-fraternity) organization, the Denison Commons Club sought to make available to all unaffiliated male students the advantages of fraternity life—which tended to be restricted to an exclusive segment of the campus.  During the fall and winter of 1916, a group consisting of interested men met to develop an organization to provide social advantages to unaffiliated men.  The President of Denison, C.W. Chamberlain, offered his support to the group.  J. Thomas Allison was elected chairman, and those interested in forming an organization signed their names to a list.  J. Leslie Putnam, J.T. Allison, and George B. Cressey were appointed to draw up a constitution.

The ideals for which the chapters strove were Democracy, Brotherhood, University First, Open Door, and non-Greek but not anti-Greek.  Under these ideals, there were no membership restrictions based on race, creed or religion.  All unaffiliated male students in good standing on campus were eligible for membership.  The membership always included a wide variety of racial, national and religious—as well as social and economic—backgrounds.  In line with the "Open Door" policy and the principles of democracy, no more than a 50 percent vote was required to elect a man to membership or qualified Pledges to Active status and entitled them to the ritual.  The right to select members was thus recognized, but it was not carried to the extreme of a "blackball" system.  Unlike most other fraternities, it took a majority vote to deny membership. The "Open Door" swung out as well as in, for a man could leave if he found that he did not fit in with the group or wished to join another fraternity, however, each officer took an oath not to exercise that right during his term of office. The Denison Commons Club strove to give as many men as possible the influence of fraternity life, and looked to what it could do for the man, not what he could do for the Commons Club.  The Denison Commons Club was known for its inclusiveness from its very beginnings.  Many of its members were minorities, bi-racial or otherwise disenfranchised members of society.

At a convention held in 1921 on April 22 and 23 in [[Granville, Ohio]], delegates from the commons clubs of [[Denison University]], [[Ohio University]], and [[Hillsdale College]] met for the express purpose of forming a new national organization. The official delegates who gathered for this purpose were T.V. Caulkins, Jr., and D.S. Cowles of the Denison Commons Club; Dennis West and W.V. Wilkerson of the Ohio University Commons Club; and Clinton Douglas and L.L. Latham of the [[Hillsdale College]] Commons Club.  The [[Ohio Wesleyan]] group decided not to attend.  The new organization was known official as the American Association of Commons Clubs. The new organization, commonly known as the American Commons Club, was an American letter fraternity for men without restrictions as to race, creed, or color.&lt;ref&gt;Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities. Vol 19. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Association was augmented by a chapter at [[Wabash College]], which was a remnant of a former Federation chapter there.

All chapters active prior to [[World War II]] succeeded in resuming operation after the war.  The two in Colorado, however, were lost in 1948 and 1956.  One new chapter was installed in 1949, but after a few years became weak and was asked for its charter in 1961.  Many felt the Commons Club movement lost its relevance and withered in the more liberal climate of student life after [[World War II]]. With the withdrawal in 1963 of the [[Cincinnati]] Chapter, which had long been active in the Association, the remaining chapters at Denison and [[Adrian]] felt it futile to maintain a national organization with just two chapters.  Accordingly, at a Special Convention held at Adrian April 4, 1964, the delegates voted unanimously to suspend national operation as of June 15. By 1964 only the founding chapter at [[Denison University]] remained, and in 1969 the American Association of Commons Clubs became an organization of only alumni while the active chapter became a member of [[Delta Chi]] national fraternity.  At the time of the suspension of the Association, the national officers then current were designated as a permanent Executive Committee to act in the interests of the Association in all matters regarding protection and use of insignia, maintenance of records, disposition of assets, and other matters.  These officers included the following:  Allan M. Dewey (Denison '37), President;  Edward G. Voss (Denison '50), General Secretary; R.A. Wiley (Adrian '50) Treasurer; and John N. Miller (Denison '54), Editor.

===Association of Commons Clubs===
In 1989, a new Commons Club was formed at Indiana University with the support of the alumni of the AACC.  It spread to other Midwestern campuses and continues the Commons Club tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsclub.org Association of Commons Clubs website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The involvement of women in the Commons Club movement==
The [[Allegheny College]] Commons Club started in 1903 as the Teutonic Association, an all-male group that included in membership all non-fraternity men.  At its 1909 annual banquet, the idea of adding women to the group resulted in the formation of Teutonia Association “…for the purpose of establishing a closer social relationship and opportunity among all non-sorority women of the college.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ernest Ashton. Allegheny - A Century of Education: 1815-1915. (The Allegheny College History Company, Meadville, PA 1916). pp. 343-344.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wittenberg University]] Commons Club began as a group that admitted female students as equal members of the organization.  When the members of DCC first heard of this, ''The Denison Commoner'' published the following reflection:
:“There is also an organization containing both men and women at Wittenberg which claims to be patterned after the D.C.C.  This is a dream, but, do you suppose that the Commons Club will have female chapters in the future?  The men from Hillsdale ask if there is such a thing, stating that there is need of one at Hillsdale.  Under a separate heading will appear an article telling of the formation of the Shepardson Club, doing the same thing for the women of Shepardson College that the D.C.C. does for the men of Granville College.”&lt;ref&gt;Denison Commoner. May 1920, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Before being admitted as a member of the AACC, the Wittenberg chapter decided to split the group into separate male and female organizations.  It is not known what became of the female group.  At [[Colorado State University]], the AACC chapter helped to form the Valkyries Club for women that continued as a “sister” organization for the life of the chapter. At Denison, the Spring of 1920 saw the organization of the Shepardson Club, a “sister” organization to the Denison Commons Club.  The women of Shepardson College that merged with Denison University at the turn of the century formed the Shepardson Club with the help of the AACC chapter at Denison.  “The idea of the Shepardson Club was conceived in the minds of some freshmen.  Other have seen the need, but realizing the enormity of an undertaking to remedy the situation, have gone no farther.  It remained for those freshman girls to have the initiative and courage to act upon their convictions.  When plans had been formulated, the good will of the sororities assured, and the approval and backing of the faculty and administration obtained, the Shepardson Club was launched.  Unaffilliated upper-classmen and all freshmen were given an opportunity to join and there was an almost universal response…. The primal purpose of the organization is one of service…. Membership will not, however, prevent a girl from leaving at any time to accept a sorority bid.  Through this Club there is now made possible equal social opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;Denison Commoner. May 1920. pp.16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shepardson Club continued to share participation in many collegiate events over the years with the Denison Chapter.  Eventually, it suffered from the same issues as the Denison Commons Club and ceased operations.  At [[Ohio University]], the local Commons Club attempted to copy Denison in the Spring of 1920 and form a girl’s Commons Club.&lt;ref&gt;The Arrow of [[Pi Beta Phi]]. Vol. 36, Is. 3. 1920. p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Named after the first AACC newsletter, [[Trianon (sorority)|Trianon]] was another “sister” organization to the Commons Club.  It formed from the mergers of three college clubs in Ohio and Indiana.  First, at the [[University of Cincinnati]], in 1925, Dean Josephine P. Simrall and a group of female students, inspired and encouraged by the Cincinnati Commons Club, created the Campus Club.  Next, in November 1926, several women at [[Butler University]] formed a Campus Club on their campus.  Then, in the spring of 1929, thirty-seven female students at [[Miami University]] formed the Miami Girl's Club.  Members of the three clubs convened the first National Convention on December 28 and 29, 1929, to form Trianon.  In 1957, Trianon dropped open membership.  The Trianon Pledge Manual explained, "The definition of how a girl could become a candidate was changed from a written application to a girl being invited upon a favorable majority vote of active members."  In 1959, the sorority’s official magazine creased publication.  The sorority was still active in the 1960s, but the last known national convention met in 1965 and by 1974, mention of Trianon’s activities in Butler’s yearbooks ceased.

'''David Elkind''' (born March 11, 1931) is a Jewish-American [[child psychology|child]] [[psychologist]] and author. David and his family relocated to California when he was still a teenager. He studied at the University of California at Los Angeles and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1952 and Doctorate in Philosophy in 1955. David also earned an honorary doctorate in Science at the Rhode Island College (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/210/David-Elkind.html|title=David Elkind|website=psychology.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime professor at [[Tufts University]], his groundbreaking books &amp;mdash; ''The Hurried Child'', ''The Power of Play'' and ''Miseducation'' informed [[early childhood education professionals]] of the possible dangers of "pushing down" the elementary school [[curriculum]] into the very early years of a child's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://villagepreschoolofportland.com/philosophy/research.html|title=What Research Says|date=2013-09-02|work=Village Preschool of Portland|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, he argued, teachers and parents alike could lapse into developmentally inappropriate instructional and learning practices that may distort the smooth development of learning. He is associated with the belief of decline of social markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/profile/david_elkind|title=David Elkind {{!}} Profile|website=Greater Good|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''educational program''' is a program written by the institution or ministry of [[education]] which determines the learning progress of each subject in all the stages of formal education.

Besides the primary educational program, some schools use a different educational program written by another source which uses different learning progress - either in some subjects, such as the [[Mofet]] educational program in [[Israel]] or in all subjects, such as [[special education]].

Educational programs help people decide if they are going to be a teacher or not. They're mostly in high schools called C4 program. C4 programs help students in high schools decide what they are going to be before they get to college, so they do not waste their time taking classes they do not need in college or wasting their parents' money on classes and books they do not need.

'''Fahr Monastery''', ({{lang-de|Kloster Fahr}}) is a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] of nuns located in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] municipality of [[Würenlos]] in the [[canton of Aargau]]. Located in different [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], [[Einsiedeln Abbey]] and Fahr Monastery form a [[double monastery]], ruled by the [[Abbot]] of Einsiedeln. Fahr and Einsiedeln are perhaps the only such community still to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kloster-fahr.ch/Kloster/doppelkloster.html|work=Kloster Fahr|title=Doppelkloster|accessdate=2012-11-17|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kloster Fahr IMG 5988 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the monastery from towards the Limmat]]

== Geographical and administratively special situation ==
The monastery historically was located in an [[exclave]] of the canton of Aargau within the [[Municipalities of the canton of Zürich|municipality]] of [[Unterengstringen]] in the [[canton of Zürich]] in the [[Limmat Valley]]. The nuns' monastery had not been part of a political municipality, although some administrative tasks have been carried out by the Würenlos authorities since the 19th century and the nuns were always allowed to fulfill their political rights (voting, etc.) in Würenlos. Since 1 January 2008 Fahr Monastery has been a part of Würenlos. The nunnery has its own postal code, 8109 Kloster Fahr.

== History ==
The monastery is first mentioned in AD 1130 as ''Vare'' (an old term used for "ferry"). The lands were donated by the [[House of Regensberg]]. On 22 January 1130 Lütold II and his son Lütold III and his wife Judenta&lt;ref name="hds-regensberger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D19753.php|title=Regensberg, von|publisher=HDS|author=Martin Leonhard|language=German|date=2013-01-29|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; handed over lands and estates on the shore of the [[Limmat]] around [[Weiningen]] and [[Unterengstringen]]-[[Oberengstringen]] to the [[Einsiedeln Abbey]] to establish a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery for nuns. The Chapel of St. Nicholas already stood on the land. This may have been connected with the death of Lütold I in 1088 while engaged in battle against the forces of the Abbey of Einsiedeln. The monastery was dedicated to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Our Lady]]. In addition to the medieval St. Nikolaus-Kapelle ([[Saint Nicholas]] chapel), built around 10th century AD and now called ''St. Anna-Kapelle'', and the late medieval church of the monastery, the parish church of Weiningen were subordinated to the monastery.

From the very beginning, the nunnery has been ruled by the [[Abbot]] of Einsiedeln; the nuns are governed in their daily life by a [[prioress]] appointed by the abbot. The [[bailiwick]] rights were first held by the Regensberg family, after 1306 by the citizens of the municipality of Zürich, and from 1434 to 1798 by the Meyer von Knonau family.

Around 1530 the monastery was suppressed during the [[Reformation in Zürich]], but it was reopened in 1576.
An era of prosperity during the 17th century led to a brisk program of construction: In 1678 the tavern ''Zu den zwei Raben'' ("Two Ravens", the emblem of Einsiedeln Abbey) was built; from 1685 to 1696 the cloister and church tower were renovated; in 1703/04 a new [[refectory]] was designed by Johann Moosbrugger; and a house for the chaplain was erected in 1730/34. From 1743 to 1746 the monastery's church was decorated with frescoes by the Torricelli brothers.

In dissolving the old County (''Grafschaft'') of Baden in 1803, the cantons of Zurich and Aargau established an exclave of Aargau within the canton of Zürich, for the former lands of the monastery. Formerly part of the [[Bishopric of Constance]], the monastery has been part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel]] since 1828. The canton of Aargau chose in 1841 to close all monasteries within its territory, but this was reversed in 1843 for women's monasteries. The negotiations between Einsiedeln Abbey and the cantonal authorities regarding assets and authority were completed nearly 90 years later, in 1932. At that point Aargau granted full autonomy to the monastic community.

During World War II, from November 1943 to February 1944, 11 female Jewish refugees lived secretly in the cloister; unfortunately they had to leave for an unknown destination when the school was opened.&lt;ref name="tagi-20100404"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/region/Das-Kloster-Fahr-nahm-juedische-Frauen-auf/story/27977583|title=Das Kloster Fahr nahm jüdische Frauen auf|publisher=[[Tages Anzeiger]]|author=|language=German|date=2010-04-04|accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;


On 1 February 1944, the monastery established a ''Bäuerinnenschule'', i.e. an [[agricultural school]] for women.

On 1 January 2008 the monastery was incorporated into the municipality of Würenlos, happening over a century after the municipality's initial attempts to absorb the 1.48-hectare area of the monastery.&lt;ref name="tagi-20061208"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/zuerich/696456.html|title=Kloster Fahr wird eingemeindet|publisher=[[Tages Anzeiger]]|author=|language=German|date=2011-07-07}}{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707004213/http://sc.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/zuerich/696456.html|date=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2009 the former Abbot of Einsiedeln, Dom Martin Werlen, O.S.B., presented the nuns a new community seal, thereby indicating that the nuns were in full control of the business affairs of their monastery.&lt;ref name="orden-online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orden-online.de/news/2009/01/24/kloster-fahr-erhaelt-siegelrecht-zurueck/|title=Kloster Fahr erhält Siegelrecht zurück|publisher=Orden online|author=|language=German|date=2009-01-24|accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

End of 2014 the women's agricultural school (''Bäuerinnenschule'') had to close for financial reason.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-bäuerinnenschule"/&gt; At the same time the overall renovation of the monastery's buildings that were built between 1689 and 1746 started. The interior decoration, the windows and electric cables will be renewed to 2016, as well as the living cells of the sisters will be equipped with hot water. As the residential wing was the focus of the renovation, the sisters lived in the former peasant school. Primarily, the estimated total cost of CHF 21 million will ensure fire prevention and include energetically improvements to meet statutory requirements.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20151231"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/so-faellt-das-loslassen-von-der-baeuerinnenschule-weniger-schwer-129952416|title=So fällt das Loslassen von der Bäuerinnenschule weniger schwer|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Sophie Rüesch|language=German|date=2015-12-31|accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convent ==
As of April 2010, there were 26 nuns (7 in 1873, 33 in 2000) living at the monastery. [[Silja Walter]] (Sister Maria Hedwig, O.S.B.) (1919–2011), a renowned novelist, was the most prominent member of the community.&lt;ref name="tagi-20113101"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/buecher/Silja-Walter-ist-tot/story/24721993|title=Silja Walter ist tot|publisher=[[Tages-Anzeiger]]|author=|language=German|date=2011-01-31|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kath.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kath.ch/index.php?na=11,10,0,0,d,60494|title=Prior Irene Gassmann, Kloster Fahr: Zum Tod von Schwester Hedwig (Silja) Walter OSB|publisher=kath.ch|author=|language=German|date=2011-01-31|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Silja Walter}}
On 23 April 2016 the ''Silja-Walter-Raum'' was inaugurated. Sister Maria Hedwig's literal work is inextricably linked to the nunnery as she lived for over 60 years in the Benedictine community. During this time, Silja Walter wrote most of her literary work that included lyrics, mystery plays and theatre. After the renovation of the provost, the former office of the provost with its beautiful stucco ceiling was chosen to establish a small museum. It contains numerous texts, film, audio and photographic documents, as well as excerpts from the radio interview from 1982, when Silja Walter and her brother, [[Otto F. Walter]], another renowned Swiss writer, recorded the interview tape ''Eine Insel'' (An Island). But also personal objects like the nun's typewriter are exhibited, and also the lesser known drawings and painting of the artist. The monastery would appeal to people who knew the artist's work, but also for the younger generation, said Prioress Irene during an interview.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20160425"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/unerwartete-einblicke-hinter-die-klostermauern-zu-ehren-von-schwester-silja-walter-130223257|title=Unerwartete Einblicke hinter die Klostermauern zu Ehren von Schwester Silja Walter |publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Anna Gepp|language=German|date=2016-04-25|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For now, the room will be open every last Sunday of the month after the worship service from approximately 10:45 to 14:00.

On memorial of Saint [[Wiborada]] – the first (Swiss) woman who was ever canonized by the Roman Catholic Church – on 2 May 2016 started a two months pilgrimage of eight respectively seven Fahr nuns from Wiborada's former home St. Gallen to Rome; the project group ''Kirche mit*'' insists on more rights for the Catholic woman. Along their {{convert|1000|km}} travel to the Vatican, the group of pilgrims was accompanied on stages by other women right's activists.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20160506"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/die-nonnen-des-kloster-fahr-erwandern-sich-die-gleichstellung-130243267|title=Tausend Gläubige setzten ein Zeichen für mehr kirchliche Frauenrechte.

== Cloister garden ==
Sister Beatrice Beerli (born 1947) has the responsibility over the monastery gardens for over 20 years. In the peasant school (''Bäuerinnenschule'') she headed the module horticulture. Since the closure of the school in July 2013, she taught her knowledge on occasion of group tours in the multi-award-winning Fahr gardens. Besides herbs, teas, syrup or herb salt, the sisters also sell tinctures from the herbs in their monastery shop. Vegetables are grown both for their own use as well as for the monastery's pilgrim hostel.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-20160610"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/die-nonnen-laden-in-ihre-preisgekroenten-gaerten-ein-130339973|title=Die Nonnen laden in ihre preisgekrönten Gärten ein|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Sophie Rüesch|language=German|date=2016-06-10|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="migrosmagazin-abschied"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.migrosmagazin.ch/menschen/reportage/artikel/kloster-fahr-abschied-im-bluetenmeer|title=Bäuerinnenschule Kloster Fahr: Abschied im Blütenmeer|publisher=migrosmagazin.ch|author=|language=German|date=2013-07-29|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and points of interest ==
Viticulture played, for centuries, an important role in the monastic culture. Even in the deed of donation of 22 January 1130, a vineyard was mentioned. In the Middle Ages the cultivation and trade in wine was significant and frequently documented. Cultivation and wine pressing are part of the historic tradition, and the present vineyards comprise 4.2 hectares on the "Wingert" hill just above the monastery in the [[Municipalities in the canton of Zürich|municipality]] of Unterengstringen and on monastic property in [[Weiningen]] where selected grape varieties are grown: Riesling-Sylvaner, Pinor Noir, Pinot Gris, Regent and Dornfelder. With the young vines Zweigelt, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, the historic wine selection was expanded.&lt;ref name="fahr-weinbau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kloster-fahr.ch/?page_id=297|title=Klösterlicher Weinbau gestern und heute|publisher=Kloster Fahr|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known wine estate is managed by the nuns and around 30 external employees.

Agricultural products made by the nunnery also include liquors and honey, and a variety of other products among them fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. The monastic community sells its products in a shop (from Monday to Saturday) situated in the monastery and provides a restaurant (from Wednesday to Sunday) in the former pilgrim's hostel, built in 1678 AD. The Chapel of St. Anna is a popular site for weddings.

The monastery was also renowned for its agricultural school for women (''Bäuerinnenschule'') that was established in 1944, but had to be closed in January 2015 for economical reasons and because the few nuns were no longer able to ensure the high quality of the 20-weeks courses for young women.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-bäuerinnenschule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/grosser-abschied-kloster-fahr-schliesst-baeuerinnenschule-125966840|title=Grosser Abschied: Kloster Fahr schliesst Bäuerinnenschule|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Anina Gepp|language=German|date=2015-01-25|accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From spring 2016, the rooms of the convent are also opened for civil marriages which performs the ''Zivilstandsamt Wettingen'' on Friday afternoons from May to September: ''Abtstube'' for up to 10 people, and the ''Vier Jahreszeiten'' room for up to 20 people, regardless of religion, creed and nationality.&lt;ref name="limmattaler-trauungen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/die-abtstube-ist-neu-auch-ein-trauzimmer-130035503|title=Die Abtstube ist neu auch ein Trauzimmer|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Anina Gepp|language=German|date=2016-02-03|accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For tourists, Fahr Monastery is a highlight in the [[Limmat Valley]] and a popular stop for hikers and bikers along the Limmat.&lt;ref name="lz-20151007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/touristisch-ist-das-limmattal-ein-blinder-fleck-im-schatten-der-grossstadt-129623106|title=Touristisch ist das Limmattal ein blinder Fleck im Schatten der Grossstadt|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Raphael Biermayr |language=German|date=2015-10-07|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Heritage ==
Kloster Fahr is listed in the [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]] as a ''Class A'' object of national importance.&lt;ref name="kgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.00012.DownloadFile.tmp/ag2015.pdf|title=A-Objekte KGS-Inventar|publisher=Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, Amt für Bevölkerungsschutz|author=|language=|date=2015-01-01|accessdate=2015-09-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609114704/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.00012.DownloadFile.tmp/ag2015.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''History Aptitude Test''' ('''HAT''') is a [[standardized test]] used as part of the admissions process to [[Oxford University]] for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History.

The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions.

==Criticism==
In 2004 John Dunford, the general secretary of the [[Secondary Heads Association]] complained that the language used in the test could be seen as favouring those from independent schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/oct/11/accesstouniversity.highereducation&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute for Personal Robots in Education''' ('''IPRE''') was initiated by a [[United States dollar|$]]1 million grant from [[Microsoft Research]] to [[Bryn Mawr College]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and announced in July 2006. IPRE is designing introductory [[computer science]] curricula centered on a [[Personal Robot]]. Their vision is that each student will purchase a small, inexpensive robot at the bookstore which they will use throughout their classes in exploring computer science. The hope is that the robot will cost about as much as a textbook. IPRE will develop the hardware, software, and curricular materials for these courses.

The software being developed for introductory computer science courses is called Myro, short for My Robot, and is based in part on Pyro from [[Python Robotics]]. Myro is an interface to communicate with robots. It is designed to be used through a number of computer languages, include [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].

The robot currently being used is the [[Scribbler (robot)|Scribbler]] from [[Parallax, Inc. (company)]] augmented with a small computer board, called the Fluke. The Fluke contains [[Bluetooth]] and a camera. This allows any robot that has a serial interface to be controlled through the low-cost Fluke.

== History ==
* Announced in July 2006
* First courses taught at [[Bryn Mawr College]] and [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Spring 2007

'''Julius Schniewind''' (28 May 1883 - 7 September 1948) was a [[Germany|German]] [[:de:Evangelische Theologie|evangelical (Lutheran) theologian]].&lt;ref name=JSlautKB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0001/bsb00019558/images/index.html?seite=343| pages=323-324|title=Schniewind, Julius Daniel|author=Katrin Bosse|work=[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] |volume= 23|date=2007| publisher= Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, München |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JSlautHE&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.catalogus-professorum-halensis.de/schniewindjulius.html|title=Julius Schniewind |author=Henrik Eberle| publisher=Archiv der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He came to prominence in the 1930s as a leader of the [[Confessing Church |Confessing Church (''"Bekennende Kirche"'')]],&lt;ref name=BekKirlautMT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.histdata.uni-halle.de//texte/halbz/13_Taatz.pdf| title=Die Theologische Fakultät der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg im Nationalsozialismus| author=Marianne Taatz |pages=33-62| date=2003| issn=1433-7886| publisher=Druckerei der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg |work=Hallische Beiträge zur Zeitgeschichte, Heft 13, Sonderheft |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen as a movement within German Protestantism that arose during [[Nazi Germany|the Nazi years]] in [[German resistance to Nazism |opposition]] to government-sponsored efforts to unify all Protestant churches into a single pro-Nazi [[Protestant Reich Church]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany |title=Germany |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}} See drop-down essay on "Unification, World Wars, and Nazism"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life == 
=== Provenance and early years ===
Julius Daniel Schniewind was born in [[Elberfeld]], a town in the [[Ruhr|Ruhr region]] which had emerged during the nineteenth century as a major centre for the textiles industry, and which has subsequently been subsumed into [[Wuppertal]].  His father,  also called Julius Schniewind (1847-1902) worked in the silk business and was a partner in the Elbersfeld-based firm "H. E. Schniewind".  His grandfather, Heinrich Ernst Schniewind (1813-1895), had also been a partner in the family firm, and a prominent member of the local business community.  His mother, born Emmi Elisabeth Burchard (1854–1924), was from [[Hamburg]], a daughter of a banker originally from [[Bremen]] called Friedrich Wilhelm Burchard (1824–92).  His childhood was shaped by a confident spirit of religious piety within the family.&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;  He attended the [[:de:Wilhelm-Dörpfeld-Gymnasium|Wilhelm Dörpfeld Gymnasium (''"grammar school"'')]] in [[Elberfeld]] and then moved on to study [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Theology]] at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Halle|Halle]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] und [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] between 1901 and 1906.&lt;ref name=JSlautHE/&gt;  His tutors included [[:de:Paul Feine|Paul Feine (1859-1933)]], [[Karl Heim]] (1874-1958) and [[Friedrich Loofs]] (1858-1928).&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/nachlaesse/schniewind.htm|author=Marie-Christine Henning|title=Julius Schniewind (1883-1948), Theologe| publisher=Hochschulschriften der Universität Halle-Wittenberg an der Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Sachsen-Anhalt |date=4 August 2004|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also became, according to at least one major source, the most significant of the students of [[Martin Kähler]] (1835-1912).&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;

In 1910 he received his [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate (higher degree)]] at [[University of Halle|Halle]] for a piece of work on the writings and preaching of [[Paul the Apostle]] (''"Die Begriffe Wort und Evangelium bei Paulus"'').  He remained at Halle, teaching [[New Testament |New Testament studies]], till 1914.  That year he received his [[habilitation]] (degree) for a piece of work on parallel [[pericope]]s for [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]] (''"Die Parallelperikopen bei Lukas und Johannes"'').  His academic progress was interrupted during at least a part of the [[First World War]], when Schniewind became a volunteer [[Military chaplain|field chaplain]].&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;  He was awarded the [[Iron Cross#World War I|Iron Cross 2nd Class (''Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse'')]].&lt;ref name=JSlautHE/&gt;

=== Marriage and family ===
Julius Schniewind married Anna Alice Wanda Eveline Countess of Keyserling (1884-1955) at [[Elberfeld]] on 7 May 1919.  His bride came from [[Courland]].  The marriage was followed by the births of the couple's two sons.&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt; 

=== Academic progression ===
In 1919 Schniewind was appointed to a provisional extraordinary professorship which in 1921 became a regular extraordinary professorship with a full teaching contract covering [[New Testament |New Testament studies]], [[Patristics|Patristic]] [[Philology]] and [[Palaeography]].&lt;ref name=JSlautHE/&gt;  [[University of Halle|The university]] awarded him a doctorate in theology in 1925.&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;  The next year he was appointed to the teaching chair in [[New Testament |New Testament studies]].&lt;ref name=JSlautHE/&gt;

He moved in 1927 when he received a [[:de:Lehrstuhl|full professorship]] in [[New Testament |New Testament studies]] at the [[University of Greifswald]] in the extreme north of [[Weimar Germany|the country]].&lt;ref name=JSlautHE/&gt;  Two years later he moved again, this time accepting an offer from the [[University of Königsberg]] where he was in regular (and sometimes disputatious) contact with a younger generation of notable theologians such as [[Günther Bornkamm]], [[Hans Iwand]] and [[Martin Noth]].&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;

=== Nazi years ===
In 1933 the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] [[Machtergreifung|took power]], following several years during which politics had become progressively more polarised and then gridlocked.  The new government lost no time in [[Gleichschaltung|transforming]] Germany into a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[Enabling Act of 1933|dictatorship]].  In April 1933 leading protestant churchmen were persuaded to draft a new constitution for the "[[German Evangelical Church]]", which was part of a government plan for a state controlled protestant church.  The idea was not one that sat comfortably with German tradition, and many protestant theologians responded by creating the [[Confessing Church |Confessing Church (''"Bekennende Kirche"'')]] movement,&lt;ref name=BekKirlautMT/&gt;  Actively backed by [[Günther Bornkamm|Bornkamm]] and [[Hans Iwand|Iwand]], Schniewind took a lead in the struggle to establish the Confessing Church in [[East Prussia]].  They managed to involve the Bahnauer Fraternity.  The Theology faculty at [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]] became a power house for theological training on behalf of the [[Confessing Church]].  Schniewind joined the [[Pfarrernotbund|Pfarrernotbund (''loosely "Emergency League of Pastors"'')]].&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 553f. {{ISBN|978-3-596-16048-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his activities involving the [[Confessing Church]] and his openly hostile attitude to the Nazi regime, in 1935 Schniewind was expelled from the [[University of Königsberg]].&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;  He had made a public attack on the [[East Prussia]]n [[Gauleiter]], [[Erich Koch]].  He was sent to [[University of Kiel|Kiel]] where, as before, he engaged actively with the  [[Confessing Church]].  Meanwhile relations between the Confessing church and the [[Landeskirche|more mainstream regional protestant churches]] had broken down.  Professors involved with the Confessing Church had been forbidden from setting exams for theology students since February 1935.  Schniewind continued to profess his support for the Confessing Church and refused to set exams on behalf of the regional churches.&lt;ref name=JSlautba&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-kiel.de/ns-zeit/bios/schniewind-julius.shtml| title=Professor Dr. Julius Schniewind|author="ba"|work=geb. 28. Mai 1883 in Wuppertal-Elberfeld; gest. 7. September 1948 in Halle/Saale:  Einrichtung: Neues Testament|publisher=Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936, because of his continuing refusal to comply with the requirements of the authorities in Kiel, he was sent away after a few months.&lt;ref name=JSlautba/&gt;  He accepted an invitation to return to [[University of Halle|Halle]].  He nevertheless persisted with his open commitment to the [[Confessing Church]].  Along with [[:de:Ernst Wolf (Theologe)|Ernst Wolf]] he became a leader of the student religious community.&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;

In March 1937 Schniewind was removed from his university post and early in 1938 the authorities launched a criminal investigation case into his involvement with the Confessing Church.&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;  He was obliged to take an 80% salary cut.&lt;ref name=JSlautba/&gt;  Many sources assume or imply that he remained deprived of his professorship till [[World War II |war]] [[End of World War II in Europe|ended]] in May 1945, but recent investigation of personnel records retained in the archives at the [[University of Halle]] has indicated that Schniewind's professorship was quietly restored in some form later in 1938&lt;!---according to a contribution to his entry in wiki-de---&gt;.  There is no report of the criminal case having reached the stage of a prosecution.  According to one source, alongside his lecturing activities on behalf of the Confessing Church, he was able to continue "mentoring his students privately".  After [[Declarations of war during World War II|1939]] he combined his activities at the university with work as a military-hospital chaplain.&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;

=== Final years ===
As the [[End of World War II in Europe|war ended]], the western two thirds of Germany was divided into zones of military occupation.  The central portion, including [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany |was now administered]] as the [[Soviet occupation zone]].  The [[Ruhr]] region, where he had been born and lived as a young man became part of the British occupation zone.  Schniewind received invitations to take up university appointments from Münster, Mainz and Berlin, but he turned them down.&lt;ref name=JSlautHE/&gt;  If his employment status at the [[University of Halle]] had been unclear before 1945, it now became a matter of public record, as he was restored to a full professorship.  As a lecturer at the university and [[Provost (religion)|church provost]] in the Halle-Merseburg region he played a decisive role in a revival of public Christian awareness and the life of the church in [[Halle (Saale) |Halle]] and in the [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony|Ecclesiastical Province of Saxony]] more widely.&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;

Julius Schniewind died in Halle aged 65.&lt;ref name=JSlautba/&gt;

== Theology ==
Schniewind is regarded as the most important student of [[Martin Kähler]] (1835-1912).&lt;ref name=JSlautKB/&gt;  He was also influenced by [[Hermann Cremer]], [[Adolf Schlatter]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;  He understood bible theology as the Word of God, deeply rooted in the [[Old Testament]].  In that respect he decisively stood apart from the ranks of the liberal theologians from [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]] to [[Adolf von Harnack]].&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;&lt;ref name=JSlautba/&gt;  Schniewind's programme of "spiritual renewal" created a happy unity out of the frequently problematic relationship between scriptural belief and [[Historical criticism |historical-critical]] [[Biblical criticism |biblical exegesis]].&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;

At the same time, his first interest was in the [[New Testament]] and in his pastoral duties.  ("Others write books.  I must be there for my students.")&lt;ref name=JSlautba/&gt;  Recognition of the value of religious scholarship and [[form criticism]] never prevented Schniewind from stressing in his elaboration of the Words of Christ the "signs of the times".  In that respect he applied a [[Paul the Apostle|pauline]] interpretation of National Socialism as nothing less than the Wrath of God.&lt;ref name=JSlautMCH/&gt;  With regard to [[Nazi Germany|the state's]] attempts to control the church, he would have endorsed [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]'s judgement that [[Protestantism]] without the [[Confessing Church]] would amount to a denial of the Truth of the Gospel.  During the Nazi years Julius Schniewind exercised a huge influence over his students.  He uncompromisingly rejected [[Nazism|National Socialist ideology]], and sought to combine subjective religious experience with the objectivity of biblical witness.&lt;ref name=JSlautba/&gt;

In the spring of 2000, she and two-thirds of the editorial board of the [[Kluwer]]-owned journal ''[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]]'' resigned in protest to its pay-to-access archives with simultaneously limited financial compensation for authors.&lt;ref name="effjour"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shieber |first1=Stuart |title=An efficient journal |url=https://blogs.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/ |website=The Occasional Pamphlet |accessdate=12 February 2017 |date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaelbling co-founded and served as the first [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Journal of Machine Learning Research]]'', a peer-reviewed [[open access journal]] on the same topics which allows researchers to publish articles for free and retain copyright with its archives freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/editorial-board.html JMLR editorial board], retrieved 2010-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the mass resignation, [[Kluwer]] changed their publishing policy to allow authors to self-archive their papers online after [[peer-review]]. Kaelbling responded that this policy was reasonable and would have made the creation of an alternative journal unnecessary, but the editorial board members had made it clear they wanted such a policy and it was only after the threat of resignations and the actual founding of ''JMLR'' that the publishing policy finally changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robin|first1=Peek|title=Machine Learning's Editorial Board Divided|journal=Information Today|date=1 December 2001|volume=18|issue=11|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-95801675/machine-learning-s-editorial-board-divided|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy was established by music teacher, Bruce Cole and Jack Balchin, musical instigator in 1980 as a resource centre for young people in South East London. Marion Fudger joined staff soon after beginning. Fitzroy King became involved as a staff member on a voluntary basis with his connections to the local black community. John Hunt and Denise --- were the first members of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Cole {{cite web |url=http://music.york.ac.uk/staff/research.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210120752/http://music.york.ac.uk/staff/research.php |archivedate=2009-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth and community music organisation [[Community Music (CM)]]&lt;ref&gt;Community Music http://www.cmsounds.com&lt;/ref&gt; (founded by Dave O'Donnell and [[John Stevens (drummer)]]) held regular music workshops there during the 1980s.

==Campus==
It was located in the old coroners court[[and morgue]] in Watson Street in [[Deptford]], South-East [[London]]. The Lewisham Academy of Music evolved through the early days and developed the class rooms as money allowed. Money in the early days came from The Combination at the Albany Empire that umbrellered the project to start the ball rolling.Funding was then pursued with aid from the Albany and a council of management that was established for guidance for the project once it was proven of value to the community. The premises were eventually taken over by Midi Music Company after the collapse of funding sources brought the life of the Academy to an end.&lt;ref&gt;National School of Government {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalschool.gov.uk/downloads/CaseStudyReport_CreatingTheConditions.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095314/http://www.nationalschool.gov.uk/downloads/CaseStudyReport_CreatingTheConditions.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Midi Music Company http://www.themidimusiccompany.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Brought up in the canton of [[Fribourg]], in 1996 Lucienne Peiry was the first woman to obtain a Phd in the History of Art in Lausanne (capital of Switzerland's canton of Vaud). Her thesis was the first to be devoted to "Art Brut" and to the history of the collection that [[Jean Dubuffet]] instigated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbserv1-bcu.unil.ch/persovd/detail.php?Num=2456|title=BCUL – Personnalités vaudoises|publisher=dbserv1-bcu.unil.ch|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially published by Flammarion (Paris) as "L'Art Brut," (1997, new editions 1999, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300684967|title=L'art brut|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=1997|publisher=Flammarion|year=|isbn=9782080122339|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=300684967}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300833880|title=L'art brut|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=2006|publisher=Flammarion|year=|isbn=9782080115973|edition=Nouv. éd|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=300833880}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300833880|title=L'art brut|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=2006|publisher=Flammarion|year=|isbn=2080115979|edition=Nouv. éd|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=300833880}}&lt;/ref&gt; English translation 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51833303|title=Art brut : the origins of outsider art|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=2001|publisher=Flammarion|others=Collection de l'art brut (Lausanne, Switzerland)|year=|isbn=2080105841|edition=English-language|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=51833303}}&lt;/ref&gt; new edition 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68772839|title=Art brut : the origins of outsider art|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=2006|publisher=Flammarion|year=|isbn=9782080305435|edition=2nd English language|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=68772839}}&lt;/ref&gt; German translation 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76630421|title=Art Brut : Jean Dubuffet und die Kunst der Aussenseiter|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=2005|publisher=Flammarion|year=|isbn=2080210297|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=76630421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese translation 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/995473661|title=L'art brut|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|date=2015|publisher=Shandagpress|year=|isbn=9787567117501|location=[Sl.l]|pages=|oclc=995473661}}&lt;/ref&gt;); an enlarged and updated version by Flammarion appeared in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965622819|title=L'art brut|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|publisher=|year=|isbn=9782081375383|edition=Nouvelle édition revue et augmentée|location=|pages=|oclc=965622819}}&lt;/ref&gt; (400 pp, 500 illus.).

Formerly, Lucienne Peiry was a journalist with [[Radio Suisse Romande|Radio suisse romande]] (French language radio broadcasts) and, at the same time, a freelance exhibition curator (1987–2001). In 2001, she took over the direction of Lausanne's [[Collection de l'art brut]] from {{ill|Michel Thévoz|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbrut.ch/fr_CH/art-brut/chronologie|title=Collection de l'Art Brut – Chronologie|publisher=Art Brut|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that position, she set up a number of temporary exhibitions and added to the museum's holdings by discovering Outsider Art creators in Switzerland and in various other countries of Europe, as well as in notably India, Japan, China and Benin.

The author of several works and articles on Outsider Art, Lucienne Peiry has also directed numerous publications and exhibition catalogues for the museum, including the cult book "Collection de l'Art Brut, Lausanne," published by Flammarion-Skira of Paris in 2012 (French, English, German).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/819138191|title=Collection de l'art brut Lausanne|last=Peiry|first=Lucienne|last2=Lombardi, Sarah|date=2012|publisher=Skira Flammarion|others=|year=|isbn=9782081253230|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=819138191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucienne Peiry has encouraged the museum to produce or coproduce (with the French filmmaker Philippe Lespinasse) several documentaries on Outsider Art creators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2001 she launched a teaching program for the Collection de l'Art Brut (young persons guided tours, activities books, workshops, publications), which she continued to develop.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbrut.ch/fr_CH/art-brut/lucienne-peiry|title=Collection de l'Art Brut – Lucienne Peiry|publisher=Art Brut|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, she organized an exhibition on [[Louis Soutter]] (title: "Louis Soutter et la musique"), jointly with the [[Basel]] Museum of Art and the Cantonal Museum of Fine Art Lausanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbrut.ch/fr_CH/exposition/louis-soutter-et-la-musique|title=Collection de l'Art Brut – Louis Soutter et la musique|publisher=Art Brut|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Zacharias]], director of the [[Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne|Lausanne Chamber Orchestra]] (OCL) participated in the project. She set up various partnerships with other Swiss cultural institutions, including the Théâtre de Vidy in Lausanne, the Museum of Art and History in Fribourg, and Lausanne's Petit Théâtre.

Appointed Director of Research and International Relations for the Collection de l'Art Brut in 2012, Lucienne Peiry gave up her position as museum director. She is now in charge of promoting the Lausanne museum abroad (exhibitions, lectures) and of seeking out new Outsider Art creators throughout the world (Europe, Asia, Africa, and more). She encourages studies on the creators she discovers, and on behalf of new publications and documentary films. She also lends advice to students and researchers, being called upon as an expert for works on Outsider Art at various universities (including the "hautes écoles") in Switzerland and abroad.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since 2012, she has also kept up a monthly artistic contribution for the RTS (Radio Télévision Suisse) broadcasting company, on behalf of their "A vous de jouer" (your turn to play) program on [[Espace 2]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lucienne Peiry curated an exhibition on the encyclopedic art work of {{ill|Armand Schulthess|fr}} ("The Poetic Labyrinth of Armand Schulthess") at [[Neuchâtel]]'s [[Centre Dürrenmatt Neuchâtel|Centre Dürrenmatt]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bundesmuseen.ch/cdn/00120/00133/01395/01405/index.html?lang=fr|title=Centre Dürrenmatt Neuchâtel "Le labyrinthe poétique d'Armand Schulthess"|publisher=bundesmuseen.ch|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again at [[Lugano]]'s Museo cantonale d'Arte in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masilugano.ch/it/519/armand-schulthess|title=Archivio 2016 – Armand Schulthess – MASILugano|publisher=MASILugano|language=it|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two trilingual exhibition catalogues were published for the two events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882213806|title=Le labyrinthe poétique de Armand Schulthess|last=|first=|date=2014|publisher=Edizioni Sottoscala and Centre Dürrenmatt|others=Perret Sgualdo, Janine; Schulthess, Armand; Schlichenmaier, Beate; Luong, Duc-Hanh; Geier, Beat; Clerc,  Jean-Paul; Hofer, Denise and Matasci Candido|year=|isbn=9788895471198|location=Neuchâtel/Bellinzona|pages=|oclc=882213806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Armand Schulthess domaine 1|last=|first=|publisher=Sottoscala|year=2016|isbn=|location=Bellinzona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
Many of Strand's poems are nostalgic in tone, evoking the bays, fields, boats, and pines of his Prince Edward Island childhood. Strand has been compared to [[Robert Bly]] in his use of surrealism, though he attributes the surreal elements in his poems to an admiration of the works of [[Max Ernst]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], and [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref name= perkins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=George|last2=Perkins|first2=Barbara|title=Contemporary American Literature|date=1988|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780075549543|page=953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strand's poems use plain and concrete language, usually without rhyme or meter. In a 1971 interview, Strand said, "I feel very much a part of a new international style that has a lot to do with plainness of diction, a certain reliance on surrealist techniques, and a strong narrative element."&lt;ref name= perkins/&gt;

'''Michael Lally''' (born May 25, 1942) is an American-born poet and the author of twenty-seven books of [[poetry]].  He is considered part of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of poetry, which began in the early 1950s and is acknowledged as one of the most influential movements of American poetry.  He counts among his major influences the poets [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[William Carlos Williams]], as well as writer [[William Saroyan]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
The youngest of seven in an Irish-American family of policemen, priests, and politicians Lally was born in [[Orange, New Jersey]] and raised in [[South Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Susan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/25viewwe.html "Food, Drink, and Plenty of Literary Dish"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 25, 2007. Accessed July 28, 2011. "Michael Lally, a New Jersey poet, did not seem to be suffering from a surfeit of fame. He sat at the writers’ table and waited his turn at the lectern.... Mr. Lally read next, from a work-in-progress he called “Poor Moth Boy on the Moon,” about growing up Irish Catholic in South Orange, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry and prose moves through and reflects on many of the seminal shifts in American culture from the 1950s forward: the civil rights, gay rights, women’s rights and anti-war movements and his active participation in each.  Master of the autobiographical style, his writing charts the internal emotional landscape of the evolving 20th century man.

Lally started out playing piano and reading his poetry in coffeehouses and bars in 1959.  In 1962 he joined the [[United States Air Force]], where he spent more than four years as an enlisted man, and later used the G.I. Bill to attend the University of [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].   While living in Iowa Lally’s devotion to political reform extended beyond editorials.  In the fall of 1968 he actively campaigned for the position of Johnson County Sheriff as part of the Peace and Freedom Party ticket.

===Writing career===
In 1972 he wrote the autobiographical “South Orange Sonnets” which received a New York Poetry Center Discovery Award.

===Acting career===
He moved from New York to [[Los Angeles]] in 1982 to find work acting in movies and TV (as Michael David Lally), mostly as a bad guy and the occasional good guy.  He was seen in films including Basic Instinct (1992), White Fang (1991) and Cool World (1992), as well as on TV as Captain Bubb in Deadwood (2004), Walter Hoyt on NYPD Blue (1995–97) and Detective Frank Costa on JAG (1997–98).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0482470/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm&lt;/ref&gt;  His writing found its way into several movies including .

===Personal life===
Lally has been married three times. His first wife Carol Lee Fisher from 1964 to 1979.  The second wife was Penelope Milford from 1982 to 1984.  He then wed a third time to Jaina Flynn in 1997 before separating in 2003.  Lally has three children: Caitlin, Miles and Flynn

The use of [[mobile phone]]s in school settings or environments is a topic of debate. 
Supporting parents believe that cell phones address their safety concerns by enabling them to communicate with their children. Teachers and administrators opposed to mobile phone usage in schools believe that they cause disruption, and may be used for malicious purposes such as [[academic dishonesty|cheating on tests]] or taking inappropriate photographs.&lt;ref name="NLE_2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nathan L.

==Studies==
A study of a group of [[undergraduate student]]s, published in the journal ''[[Computers in Human Behavior]]'' in 2015, found that among undergraduate students, total mobile-phone use (measured in number of minutes per day, not limited to school time) was "a significant and negative predictor of college students' academic performance, objectively measured as cumulative GPA." The study [[Controlling for a variable|controlled for]] various other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/5/1/2158244015573169 |title=The Relationship Between Cell Phone Use and Academic Performance in a Sample of U.S. College Students |author1=Andrew Lepp |author2=Jacob E.

A 2015 study by the [[London School of Economics]], conducted in four cities of England, found that test scores increased by more than 6% in schools which banned cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-32771253 |title=Mobile phone bans 'improve school exam results' |publisher=BBC News |date=17 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, researchers [[Julia Irwin]] and Natasha Gupta of [[Macquarie University]] performed an experiment in 2016 testing the effect of [[Facebook]] distractions in the classroom. The study found that students interested in the subject material and the way it was presented were less likely to be distracted by Facebook, however, those same students with access to phones still performed lower than students that were not allowed access to cell phones during the lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Natasha|last2=Irwin|first2=Julia D.|title=In-class distractions: The role of Facebook and the primary learning task|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563214005457|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=55|pages=1165–1178|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 collective study published by ''[[Applied Cognitive Psychology]]'', found that college students retained less knowledge when allowed to use or have a cell phone on them during lectures. During the experiment, students that were not allowed access to a cell phone tested better than students that had access to cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Seungyeon|last2=Kim|first2=Myeong W.|last3=McDonough|first3=Ian M.|last4=Mendoza|first4=Jessica S.|last5=Kim|first5=Min Sung|date=2017-05-01|title=The Effects of Cell Phone Use and Emotion-regulation Style on College Students' Learning|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3323/abstract|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=360–366|doi=10.1002/acp.3323|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the numerous drawbacks that come with the use of cellphones in classrooms, there are also exist certain benefits. A 2017 study conducted by Dr. James Derounian at the University of Gloucestershire involving 100 participants revealed that 45% of students believe that the use of phones in classrooms supports their education. One of the most common strengths listed was the use of phones for accessing digital textbook and thus engaging deeper with the material presented. However, Derounian mentioned that there could be "an element of social desirability conveyed in the student views given".&lt;ref&gt;Derounian, James Garo. "Mobiles in class?"&amp;nbsp;Active Learning in Higher Education, 2017, p. 146978741774521., doi:10.1177/1469787417745214.
&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by Emma Henderson for the ''Independent'' in the UK goes over "phantom vibrations" caused by "learned bodily behavior". The part of the body the phone is close to becomes very sensitive and the slightest vibration can cause a person to believe the phone has vibrated, hence the name "phantom vibration". 9 out of 10 people have claimed to have felt their mobile device vibrate while in the pocket when it in fact did not. It can be beneficial for students not only out of respect for the professor to have their mobile phones out of their pockets but also to themselves to help break this cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/phantom-vibration-syndrome-up-to-90-per-cent-of-people-suffer-phenomenon-while-mobile-phone-is-in-a6804631.html|title=Most people suffer from ‘phantom vibration syndrome’|date=2016-01-10|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
In the [[United Kingdom]], no schools banned mobile phones in 2001. However, by 2007, 50% of the schools had banned these devices, and by 2012, this number had increased to 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results |title=Schools that ban mobile phones see better academic results |author=Jamie Doward |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''CNN Money'', students' academic skills improved when policies were implemented to ban cell phone use in schools. Schools banning students from carrying phones helped students score higher on [[exams]] and reduced the students' temptations to use cell phones for non-[[scholarly]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ivana Kottasova|title=Kids do a lot better when schools ban smartphones|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/18/technology/smartphones-schools-ban/|accessdate=10 March 2016|publisher=CNNMoney (London)|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the past, some U.S. schools have installed [[mobile phone jammer]]s to prevent mobile phones from working on campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mary Ann Bell |author2=Holly Weimar |author3=James Van Roekel |title=School Librarians and the Technology Department: A Practical Guide to Successful Collaboration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbxdAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 |date=23 May 2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-58683-540-8 |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale and use of jammers is illegal in the U.S. under the federal [[Communications Act of 1934]], because jammers cut off [[9-1-1]] calls and can disrupt [[air navigation]] near airports, and in 2012 the [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC) stepped up enforcement of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Koebler, [https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/10/17/fcc-cracks-down-on-cell-phone-jammers FCC Cracks Down on Cell Phone 'Jammers'], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (October 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mt. Spokane High School]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state at one point installed a jammer in school to prevent  students from calling and text-messaging, but removed the device after determining that it was "probably not legal" under federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khq.com/story/9980952/school-scraps-cell-phone-jammer-program School scraps cell phone jammer program], [[KHQ-TV]] (undated).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, one [[Florida]] science teacher received a five-day unpaid suspension for installing a jammer in his classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://abc7chicago.com/education/teacher-suspended-for-jamming-students-cellphones/764005/ Teacher suspended for jamming students' cellphones] (June 3, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[New York City Department of Education]] imposed a citywide ban on mobile phones in public schools.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Kate Taylor, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/nyregion/ban-on-cellphones-in-new-york-city-schools-to-be-lifted.html Ban on Cellphones in New York City Schools to Be Lifted], ''New York Times'' (January 6, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', the ban was "inconsistently enforced, with some schools allowing students to carry phones as long as staff members do not hear or see them, and other schools—particularly those with [[metal detector]]s at the doors—maintaining a strict ban. Outside those schools, small businesses have sprung up that allow students to park their phones inside a truck for a dollar a day."&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; The ban was unpopular among parents because it impeded communication with children.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; In March 2015, the citywide ban was lifted,&lt;ref name="SandovalEisinger"&gt;Edgar Sandoval, Dale Eisinger &amp; Reuven Blau, [http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dept-education-ends-cell-phone-ban-nyc-schools-article-1.2134970 Department of Education lifts ban on cell phones in New York City schools], ''New York Daily News'' (March 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling a campaign promise made by Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Under the new policy, [[school principal]]s (in consultation with teachers and parents) may set rules on use and storage of mobile phones during instructional time and lunch breaks.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SandovalEisinger"/&gt; The default rule would be that phones would be required to remain hidden, but principals could also choose to "require students to store phones in backpacks or in a designated place; allow use of phones during lunch or in designated areas; or allow phones to be used for instructional purposes".&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; De Blasio said that the policy shift would allow to parents stay in better touch with their children, particularly in emergencies, especially in case of an emergency, and Schools Chancellor [[Carmen Fariña]] noted that the change means that students in schools with metal detector would no longer have to pay outside vendors to store phones for them during the school day.&lt;ref name="SandovalEisinger"/&gt;

Students tend to support the side that grants them the opportunity to bring mobile phones in school campus, arguing that phones allow them to reach their parents if any problem occurs. Parents also argue that there isn't a replacement for mobile phones, so phones are an essential device to carry around. If their child is in danger or doesn't feel safe, he or she has to be able to reach out to them.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Future-for-cell-phones-in-classrooms/52871235142490/|title=Future for cell phones in classrooms?|last=Soloway|first=Elliot|date=|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that having a phone shows responsibility.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

[[Theft]] of mobile phones is a concern in some schools. For example, in the [[Wichita School District]] (USD 259) public schools, 80 cases of theft of cell phones were reported in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Preventing-cell-phones-from-being-stolen-at-school-326128761.html Preventing cell phones from being stolen at school], [[KAKE]] (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, following an undercover investigation, thirteen students in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], all juveniles, were arrested and charged with running a cell phone theft ring that resulted in the theft of several thousand dollars' worth of mobile phones, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], and other [[Consumer electronics|electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Stamm, [http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Cell-Phone-Thefts-Bensalem-High-137123123.html High School Cell Phone Theft Ring Busted], NBC Philadelphia (January 11, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing number of schools are now allowing use of cell phones as learning tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/08/07/views-shift-on-cell-phones-in-schools/2607381/ |title=More schools use cellphones as learning tools |author=Josh Higgins |publisher=USA Today |date=7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of cell phones in schools is challenging. Some schools reported allowing all students to use cell phones at the same time slows down school [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Y. School Blocks Cell Phones from Wi-Fi Network|url=http://www.campussafetymagazine.com/article/n.y._school_blocks_cell_phones_from_wi_fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Governors Highway Safety Association]], while no state bans all mobile-phone use for all drivers, 20 states and the [[District of Columbia]] prohibit [[school bus]] [[Bus driver|drivers]] from using mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html Distracted Driving Laws], Governors Highway Safety Association (last updated February 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; School bus drivers have been fired or suspended for using the phone or [[Texting while driving|text-messaging while driving]].&lt;ref&gt;Steph Solis, [http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2015/10/28/academy-charter-high-student-films-driver-texting-while-driving-speeding/74734370/ School bus driver fired for speeding, texting], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'' (October 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/Local/basd-school-bus-driver-suspended-for-allegedly-texting-and-driving/36117460 Bethlehem Area School District bus driver suspended for allegedly texting and driving], WFMZ (October 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/09/school-bus-driver-suspended-after-cellphone-video-shows-her-texting/ School Bus Driver Suspended After Cellphone Video Shows Her Texting], [[ABC News]] (September 20, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apps Used by Students for Schoolwork ===
Mobile phones can be very beneficial in schools. There are many apps used that help students excel.

==== Quizlet ====
Quizlet is an online study tool that allows you to make digital notecards and allows you to see other peoples notecard sets.  The Quizlet app is very easy and accessible to use.  Quizlet has multiple ways to test yourself using different variations of games. Quizlet has over 30 million active users.

==== Tophat ====
Tophat is used in many different classes to record attendance and take quizzes.  It allows the professors to know whether you were in class or not and whether you were participating or not.

==== TurningPoint ====
TurningPoint is similar to the previous mentioned app, Tophat. It is used as an interactive polling inside the classroom. Professors can also track attendance and provide quizzes for the students with the use of this app.

==== Rider ====
Rider is an app currently used at multiple colleges to locate the buses throughout the bus system.  It allows students to track the buses and give them an estimated time of arrival.

These apps have helped students around the world on a day to day basis.  These apps encourage the use of cell phones and/or computers during school classes. Students and professors are moving more and more to only using electronics. 

== Messaging Applications ==
With the rise of use of mobile cell phones in school, applications for these cellphones have been created to support this. As of February 2018, 80,000 applications were available for teacher use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetechedvocate.org/13-best-apps-high-school-students/|title=13 of the Best Apps for High School Students - The Tech Edvocate|website=www.thetechedvocate.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A variety of messaging apps provide communication for student to student relationships as well as teacher to student. Some popular apps for both student, teacher, and parent use are ClassDojo, and Remind. This accounts for the 72% of iTunes’ top selling education apps are for preschoolers and elementary school students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/parentingcom/technology-in-the-classroom_b_2456450.html|title=Technology in the Classroom; The Pros and Cons|last=|first=|date=|website=Parenting.Com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apps like Remind and ClassDojo offer many different abilities such as language translation, scheduled reminders, and parent messages.

ClassDojo is one of the Apps that is used widely throughout schools. According to crunchbase.com, it is a “means to encourage learning, skill development and character building among students”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classdojo#section-overview|title=ClassDojo|last=|first=|date=|website=CrunchBase|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The app offers a platform for teachers to share pictures, videos, and reports with parents and administrators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Remind App is another way for teachers to communicate with parents and administration. The App allows teachers to send out scheduled text messages to parents, and also provides a class blog for the teacher to update with upcoming due dates, tests/quizzes, and other class information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsense.org/education/website/remind|title=Remind - Review For Teachers|date=2013-12-08|work=Common Sense Education|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WhatsApp is different from the other apps because it provides communication for students to other students. The app offers group chats, video messaging, video class, and photo messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=WhatsApp|date=2018-10-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WhatsApp&amp;oldid=864815918|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another app that allows students to communicate is GroupMe. GroupMe allows students to communicate in a group chat, while also only using WiFi instead of cellular data. Some college-aged students use this app for sharing course information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/groupme|title=GroupMe - App Review|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology in schools is becoming a common practice throughout many grades and age levels. The creation of messaging applications helps support this boom of usage in schools. This new technology comes with both pros and cons. A pro of messaging apps is their easy usage and accessibility to student, teachers, and parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
Accessibility of the messaging apps makes it easier for parents with disabilities, demanding full time jobs, and language barriers to communicate more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Jordan |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Technology to Communicate with K-12 Parents |url=https://otus.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-technology-to-communicate-with-k-12-parents/ |website=Otus |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A con is that not all students and parents have this technology available to them. This can cause a gap in students who have cellphones and computers and those who do not. Increased access and transparency can make students shift their responsibilities to their parents, minimizing student ownership. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Jordan |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Technology to Communicate with K-12 Parents |url=https://otus.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-technology-to-communicate-with-k-12-parents/ |website=Otus |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another con is the ease in sharing of information can lead to academic dishonesty. This is a policy colleges are cracking down on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php|title=LSU Code of Student Conduct {{!}} Student Advocacy &amp; Accountability|last=(LSU)|first=Louisiana State University|website=www.lsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the kinks of messaging applications become smoothed out over time, the future of them lies ahead. By minimizing both student and parent entitlement, setting communication boundaries, stating expectations early, and reinforcing student responsibility some of the cons from messaging apps can be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Jordan |title=The Pros and Cons of Using Technology to Communicate with K-12 Parents |url=https://otus.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-technology-to-communicate-with-k-12-parents/ |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is hope that they become more advanced, specifically when using them for help via a bot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/03/5-things-need-know-future-messaging-platforms/|title=5 things you need to know about the future of messaging platforms - Watson|date=2017-03-06|work=Watson|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advancement in this field will allow for higher frequency of use, more emotional connection, and higher convenience for users. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2016/09/22/the-future-of-messaging-apps/#27e9dbcb7b87|title=The Future Of Messaging Apps|last=Forrester|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Māori language revival''' is a movement to promote, reinforce and strengthen the speaking of the [[Māori language]]. Primarily in [[New Zealand]], but also in centres with large numbers of New Zealand migrants (such as [[London]] and [[Melbourne]]), the movement aims to increase the use of Māori in the home, in education, government and business. The movement is part of a broader [[Māori Renaissance]].

Until [[World War II]] (1939–1945) most Māori people spoke Māori as their first language but by the 1980s fewer than 20% of Māori spoke the language well enough to be classed as native speakers. The causes of the decline included the switch from using Māori to using English compulsorily in schools and increasing urbanisation, which disconnected younger generations from their extended families and in particular their grandparents, who traditionally played a large part in family life. Even many of those people no longer spoke Māori in the home. As a result, many Māori children failed to learn their ancestral language, and generations of non-Māori-speaking Māori emerged.

In response, Māori [[leadership|leaders]] initiated Māori-language recovery-programs such as the '''[[Kōhanga Reo]]''' (literally, "language nest"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016043128/http://www.kohanga-reo.co.nz/ Te Kohanga Reo - Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka o Maui]&lt;/ref&gt;) movement, which from 1982 immersed infants in Māori from infancy to school age. In 1989 official support was given for [[Kura Kaupapa Māori]] - primary and secondary Māori-language immersion schools.

==Māori Language Week==
{{main|Māori Language Week}}
A government-sponsored initiative, ''[[Māori Language Week|te wiki o te reo Māori]]'' has been celebrated since 1975 and is intended to encourage [[New Zealand]]ers to learn or at least support [[Māori language|Māori]].

==Māori Language Act and Māori Language Commission==
The [[Māori Language Act 1987]] was passed as a response to the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] finding that the Māori language was a ''[[taonga]]'', treasure or valued possession, under the Treaty of Waitangi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dana|first=Peterson|title=Te Reo Māori - the Māori language|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7C98C7EE-4175-41F5-9576-87AB4ED03419/428/004TeReo3.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Parliamentary Library|accessdate=14 February 2013|pages=1–9 [3]|date=14 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act gave [[Te Reo Māori]] [[official language]] status, and gave speakers a right to use it in legal settings such as in court. It also established the [[Māori Language Commission]] (initially called ''Te Komihana Mo Te Reo Māori'' but later renamed ''Te Taura Whiri I Te Reo Māori'') to promote the language and provide advice on it.

==Kōhanga reo==
Kōhanga reo ([[Māori language|Māori]]: literally "[[language nest]]") is a [[whānau]] (family) development and [[language revitalisation]] initiative grounded in Māori cultural principles and ideals. It facilitates the growth and development of mokopuna (children) through the transmission of Māori language, knowledge and culture. The kōhanga reo movement operates from the Māori philosophical world view and is principally guided by [[kaumātua]] (respected elders).

Individual Kōhanga Reo are autonomously run by their respective whānau, which consists of a "collective group of teachers, parents, local elders, and members of the Māori community.&lt;ref&gt;King, Jeanette. 2001. Te kōhanga reo: Māori language revitalization. In The green book of language revitalization in practice, ed. Leanne Hinton and Ken Hale, 123. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;"  While funded by governmental quarterly grants from the Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust, Kōhanga Reo often also charge additional fees to cover operational costs. These fees, determined by each whānau, are generally comparable to or less expensive than traditional child-care.&lt;ref&gt; King, Jeanette. 2001. Te kōhanga reo: Māori language revitalization. In The green book of language revitalization in practice, ed. Leanne Hinton and Ken Hale, 119–128. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducted entirely in the medium of Māori language, kōhanga reo is an environment where 0 – 6 year olds,&lt;ref&gt;Schooling is compulsory from age 6 in New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; kaumātua and whānau spend time together talking, playing, praying and learning. Daily activities may take place anywhere that is safe and warm including [[marae]] (traditional Māori buildings), converted homes or purpose-built centres.

Emerging in the late 1970s at the direction of kaumātua, kōhanga reo was an immediate and urgent response to the decline of te reo Māori (Māori language) and [[tikanga Māori]] (Māori culture, cultural habits and practices). [[Jean Puketapu]] and [[Iritana Tawhiwhirangi]] were among the early leaders when the first kōhanga reo was founded in [[Wainuiomata]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomson|first1=Rebecca|title=Celebrating New Zealand's first kohanga reo - 150 Years of News|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/hutt-valley/73945639/celebrating-new-zealands-first-kohanga-reo--150-years-of-news|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=The Dominion Post|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later there were over 300 operating.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

The success of kōhanga reo is such that they have been followed by the establishment of [[primary school]]s and [[secondary school]]s ([[Kura Kaupapa Māori]]) where Māori is the primary language of instruction. The role of Maori language in education in New Zealand is enshrined in the Education Act 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM175959.html Education Act 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

The kōhanga reo concept has led to other before-school initiatives in New Zealand that instruct in Pacific languages, e.g. [[Fijian language|Fijian]], [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and [[Tongan language|Tongan]] and other countries adopting a similar concept. A notable example being ''[[Pūnana Leo]]'' established in [[Hawaii]] to revitalise the indigenous [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neason|first1=Alexandria|title=How Hawaiian Came Back From the Dead|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/tomorrows_test/2016/06/how_the_ka_papahana_kaiapuni_immersion_schools_saved_the_hawaiian_language.html|website=www.slate.com|publisher=Slate|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The [[Māori Party]] election campaigns often feature increased roles for [[reo Māori]]; [[New Zealand general election, 2011|in 2011]] it wanted to require all secondary schools offer Māori language as an option to every student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/te-reo-maori/news/article.cfm?c_id=336&amp;objectid=10764982 |title=Maori Party wants te reo available to all |work=nzherald.co.nz |quote=The Maori Party wants to make te reo 'compulsorily available' in schools by 2015 but students wouldn't be compelled to take the subject. |accessdate=25 November 2011 |first=Yvonne |last=Tahana |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kura Kaupapa Māori==
''[[Kura Kaupapa Māori]]'' are Māori immersion [[primary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Act 1989, Section 155: Kura Kaupapa Maori|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM182441.html|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The New Sudan Education Initiative''' (NESEI) is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Colchester]], [[Vermont]] in the United States, which is building secondary schools (high schools) throughout [[South Sudan]], a region affected by war for nearly half a century.  It was founded in January 2006 by Atem Deng, a former Sudanese refugee, and Robert Lair, a social entrepreneur and educator. The organization was created after a [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] was signed in 2005, bringing the conflict in southern Sudan to an official close. The CPA created a critical opportunity for development to take place in this region.  In 2004, Deng and Lair asked [[Sudanese people|Sudanese]] they met at refugee camps throughout [[East Africa]] what was most needed in their homeland. "Education" was the resounding answer they received. South Sudan currently suffers from some of the worst education access rates in the world. Female illiteracy hovers above 93%, and only 5% of young people graduate from high school. It was from these discussions with [[Sudanese refugees]] that they developed NESEI. The organization opened its first school in May 2008, near the town of [[Yei, South Sudan|Yei]], and it currently plans to build 20 schools throughout South Sudan.

== History and present activities ==
NESEI was first conceived in January 2004, on a plane ride from East Africa to Vermont, when Robert Lair, a [[teacher|faculty member]] at [[Saint Michael's College]], and Atem Deng, a former Sudanese refugee and student at the [[University of Vermont]], decided that they needed to make an impact in Southern Sudan, after witnessing the poor living conditions and lack of education opportunities affecting Sudanese in refugee camps across East Africa. They formulated a plan to work with the large [[Sudan|Sudanese]] [[diaspora]] population in the Burlington, VT area and throughout the [[United States]] to bring diaspora-initiated education opportunities to Sudan. Together, they founded an organization, named the New Sudan Education Initiative (NESEI), through which they planned to provide an education for young people throughout Southern Sudan who lacked education opportunities, including former child [[soldiers]], young women, [[Internally Displaced Person]]s (IDPs), and other groups who had been most adversely affected in the decades-long [[war]] there.

Over the next few years, their organization evolved into a plan to provide secondary education to 20,000 Southern Sudanese children and to build 20 schools throughout the region. Their first school, The New Sudan School of Health Sciences, opened on May 19, 2008, with an initial class of 75 young women.
&lt;ref&gt;Sally Pollak,"If you build it," The Bor Globe, April 27th, 2008, http://www.borglobe.com/southern-sudan-news/2-southern-sudan-news/180-if-you-build-it.html?5e29647c293977af965708edc8f8cba4=40d9cba83fef34c4a9be978e71e933a4"&lt;/ref&gt;

NESEI has evolved into an organization that has as its priority the incorporation of sustainable economic and environmental practices at its school campus. To achieve this goal, they have instituted [[social business]] practices that include agriculturally based income generating projects that provide food to the campus and broader community. Additionally, the school plans to replace the [[Electric generator|generator]]s which currently power the school with [[solar panels]], increasing [[sustainability|environmental]] and [[economic]] sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Pellett, "Verilux helps light up Sudan school," Burlington Free Press, July 28th, 2008, http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080728/BUSINESS/807280301/1003"target="_blank"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, NESEI was renamed [[Africa Education and Leadership Initiative]].

== Future plans ==
NESEI's school plans to expand to over 100 students in 2009.  NESEI also plans to open an agriculture program within the next year at the same location, which will teach students agricultural practices in an 'interactive classroom' on the school farm.  As part of their studies, students will grow and learn about food at the farm, helping to support their campus and the surrounding communities.

NESEI plans to open schools throughout South Sudan. These schools will combine a standard high school curriculum, as well as specialized vocational courses, which will provide training to young [[Sudan|Sudanese]] in specific occupations which are in high [[Demand (economics)|demand]] and low [[Supply (economics)|supply]] throughout [[South Sudan]], including [[Health Sciences]], [[Agriculture]], Computer Technology, and [[Business]].

== Philosophical guidelines ==
Although NESEI is currently a traditional non-profit organization, and receives most of its funding from private [[Donation|donors]], it operates under the belief that a [[sustainable]] [[business model]] is one which will be most able to create a lasting and scalable impact. It believes that there is much to learn from the [[social entrepreneur]] movement, and plans to become a [[social business]] in the future, which will no longer have to rely on donations for its funding.  It plans to become sustainable through charging a small tuition to its more affluent students, and by utilizing income-generating projects in its schools.  The projects will include activities in each school, with examples being small agricultural plots and [[animal husbandry]].  This will provide food for the school, teach students valuable skills, and supply the local community with reasonably priced and fresh products.&lt;ref&gt;New Sudan Education Initiative, http://www.nesei.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portal Resources for Indiana Science and Mathematics''' '''(PRISM)''' is a free website originally designed for Indiana middle school math, science, and technology teachers. It links Indiana Academic Standards for middle school science, technology, pre-engineering, and math (STEM fields) to appropriate, teacher-reviewed online learning activities. Users may either browse materials by academic standard or use the keyword search engine to find appropriate sites.

With the integration of the [[Moodle]] open source [[Learning Management System]] in 2006, PRISM now serves a much larger audience. Teachers from all grades may use Moodle to establish online classroom courses.

Typical PRISM reviewed resources include web-delivered simulations, visualizations, modeling packages, and resource sites providing access to live data or collaborative experiments. PRISM endeavors to encourage interactive learning, foster new liaisons among students, parents, and teachers, and foster alternative pedagogical approaches.

Membership in PRISM is free and is open to parents, teachers, and pre-service personnel. Student names and/or usernames are not displayed publicly on the site.

The PRISM Project is funded by a grant from the [[Lilly Endowment]] and hosted at [[Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology]] (RHIT). PRISM is the West Central Regional Coordinator for the [http://www.istemnetwork.org I-STEM Network].  [http://www.rose-hulman.edu/hss/fac-patricia.htm Dr. Patricia A. Carlson] (RHIT) is the Program Director of the project.

He was born in [[Paris]], the son of [[Laurent de La Hire]], a distinguished artist and Marguerite Coquin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58635.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, he moved to [[Venice]] for four years to study painting.&lt;ref name=Chareix662/&gt;  Upon his return to Paris, he became a disciple of [[Girard Desargues]] from whom he learned [[geometrical perspective]]&lt;ref name=Chareix662/&gt; and was received as a master painter on 4 August 1670.&lt;ref name=Benezit/&gt; His paintings have sometimes been confused with those of his son, Jean Nicolas de La Hire, who was a doctor but also a painter.&lt;ref name=Benezit/&gt;

He also began to study science and showed an aptitude for mathematics. He was taught by the French Jesuit theologian, mathematician, physicist and controversialist [[Honoré Fabri]] and became part of a circle formed by Fabri which included [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], [[Claude Francois Milliet Deschales]], [[Christiaan Huygens]] and his brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[René Descartes]] and [[Marin Mersenne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/jg/jg4.htm ''Introduction to Jesuit Geometers'' by Joseph F. MacDonnell - Chapter 4  Influence on Other Geometers]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1678, and subsequently became active as an astronomer, calculating tables of the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets and designing contrivances for aiming [[aerial telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3592w/f134.image.langEN "Méthode pour se servir des grands verres de lunette sans tuyau pendant la nuit"]. In: ''Mém. de l'Acad.'', 1715&lt;/ref&gt; From 1679–1682 he made several observations and measurements of the French coastline, and in 1683 aided in mapping France by extending the [[Paris meridian]] to the north. In 1683 La Hire assumed the chair of mathematics at the [[Collège de France|Collège Royal]]. From 1687 onwards he taught at the [[Académie royale d'architecture|Académie d’architecture]].

La Hire wrote on graphical methods, 1673; on [[conic sections]], 1685; a treatise on [[epicycloid]]s, 1694; one on [[Roulette (curve)|roulettes]], 1702; and, lastly, another on [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoid]]s, 1708. His works on conic sections and [[epicycloid]]s were based on the teaching of [[Desargues]], of whom he was the favourite pupil. He also translated the essay of [[Manuel Moschopulus]] on [[magic square]]s, and collected many of the theorems on them which were previously known; this was published in 1705. He also published a set of astronomical tables in 1702. La Hire's work also extended to descriptive zoology, the study of respiration, and physiological optics.

Two of his sons were also notable for their scientific achievements: [[Gabriel-Philippe de La Hire]] (1677–1719), mathematician, and [[Jean-Nicolas de La Hire]] (1685–1727), botanist.

[[Mons La Hire]], a mountain on the Moon, is named for him.

'''Roger de La Fresnaye''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɔʒe də la fʁɛnɛ|lang}}; 11 July 1885 – 27 November 1925) was a French [[Cubist]] [[Painting|painter]].

==Early years and education==
La Fresnaye was born in [[Le Mans]] where his father, an officer in the French army, was temporarily stationed. The La Fresnayes were an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family whose ancestral home, the Château de La Fresnaye, is in [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]]. His education was classically based, and was followed from 1903 to 1904 by studies at the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris, and from 1904 to 1908 at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-de-La-Fresnaye Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt;. From 1908 he studied at the [[Académie Ranson]] under [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Paul Sérusier]], whose joint influence is evident in early works such as ''Woman with Chrysanthemums'', 1909. This demonstrates the dreamlike [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] ambience and stylistic character of work by the [[Les Nabis]] group.

==Career==
From 1912 to 1914 La Fresnaye was a member of the [[Section d'Or]] group of artists, and his work demonstrates an individual response to [[cubism]]. He was influenced by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], but his work has a more decorative than structural feel and his prismatic colours reflect the influence of [[Robert Delaunay]]. He was a member of the [[Puteaux Group]], an [[Orphism (art)|orphist]] offshoot of cubism led by [[Jacques Villon]]. His most famous work is ''The Conquest of the Air'', 1913, which depicts himself and his brother outdoors with a balloon in the background.

La Fresnaye enlisted in the French army in [[World War I]] but contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was discharged in 1918.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;"Roger de La Fresnaye", Oxford Art Online&lt;/ref&gt; His health deteriorated rapidly after the war. He never recovered the physical energy to undertake sustained work. In the later paintings that he did create, he abandoned cubist spatial analysis for a more linear style. He ceased painting in 1922 but continued to draw.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; De la Fresnaye died in [[Grasse]] in 1925 at the age of 40.

==Art market==
On March 24, 2017 a new record was established for a work by De la Frensaye at auction when "La conquête de l'air, avec deux personnages" sold for €2,370,500 at [[Christies]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=6063662 Christie's Paris, ''La conquête de l'air, avec deux personnages''], Art Impressionniste et Moderne, 24 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation''' is a peace and development organization based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].  It is named for [[Tegla Loroupe]], a world-champion marathon runner from [[Kapenguria]], [[Kenya]].

==Mission==
The foundation's mission is to promote peaceful co-existence and socioeconomic development of poor and marginalized individuals and communities in Northern Kenya and the Greater Horn of Africa Region.

==History and operations==
Since its founding in 2003, the foundation has organized annual Peace Races across East Africa, primarily in Kenya and Uganda. Thousands of participants from tribes across the region participate in meetings, peace dialogues and athletic competitions.

Violence in the region from cattle rustling and tribal rivalries occurs across an area of tens of thousands of square kilometers.  The Peace Races draws participants from hundreds of kilometers away, with the conditions that all warriors participating must lay down their weapons and arrive at the race site prepared to join those with whom they may be at war.

Races have taken place in the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]] area, a constant site of violent tribal and economic warfare; in [[Kapenguria]], in [[West Pokot]]; in Moroto, in Uganda.  Tribes participating in the races include the [[Pokot people|Pokot]], the [[Turkana people|Turkana]], the [[Karamajong]], the [[Maraquet]], the [[Orma people|Orma]], and the [[Pokomo people|Pokomo]].

===School===
The foundation has built a school for orphans affected by the violence in the cattle raising areas of north-west [[Kenya]], eastern [[Uganda]], southern [[Ethiopia]] and southern [[Sudan]]. Now in operation for over five years,{{when|date=June 2016}} there are 270 students drawn from areas affected by regional violence.

Phase one of the curriculum will be for primary levels, with children from six years old to fourteen years old. Phase two will extend classes through higher forms.

In 2015, the [[Tegla Loroupe Peace Academy]]'s top student achieved Kenya Examination score of 381.  The school is improving its ranking every year.

'''''The False Principle of Our Education: Or, Humanism and Realism''''' ({{lang-de|Das unwahre Prinzip unserer Erziehung, oder: Humanismus und Realismus}}) is an article written by [[Max Stirner]] and published in the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' in April 1842.

== Content ==
Stirner begins by stressing the importance of education: "the school question is a life question."

He then sketches a brief history of education from the Reformation. For him, the Enlightenment introduced a new principle behind education to challenge the classical humanist principle. Where education had taught the few "to talk about everything," the Enlightenment saw the rise of the realist "demand for a practical finishing education." Stirner concludes "Henceforth, knowledge was to be lived..."

Stirner saw educational theory in his day as a battlefield between the two parties - humanists, grasping the past, and realists, seizing the present. He criticised both as seeking power over the "transitory," as viewing education as a "struggle towards mastery in the handling of material." Stirner supports the realist criticism that the humanists seek knowledge for its own sake, but asks whether the realists do any better. Because the realists merely supply the individual with the tools to achieve his will, without reforming that will, they fail to achieve what Stirner calls "freedom of will." They fail to reach self-understanding (a concept Stirner took from [[Hegel]] and twisted in his fashion in ''[[The Ego and its Own]]'') and "fall in the abyss of their own emptiness."

If the failures of the humanists (and realists) are truly to be overcome, "the final goal of education can no longer be knowledge." Asserting that "only the spirit which understands itself is eternal," Stirner calls for a shift in the principle of education from making us "masters of things" to making us "free natures." Till one knows oneself, one has not mastered one's own will, and one is merely subservient; once one masters it one is free.

Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters...who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment."

==Death==
Oakland was murdered at his home on March 4, 2015, at the age of 75. Local police alleged at the time that Stephen Underwood Jr., an ex-convict whom Oakland had previously given over $37,000 in cash, fatally struck Oakland in the head and body. Police also claimed that Underwood then stole money from Oakland's home before setting it on fire. Underwood was soon arrested and charged with [[murder]], [[arson]], [[burglary]], and [[grand theft]].&lt;ref name=ufl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retired-univ-of-florida-professor-thomas-oakland-was-bludgeoned-before-house-fire-suspect/ |title=Retired Univ. of Florida professor gave suspect $37K before alleged murder |date=2015-03-06 |website=[[CBS News]] |language=en |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Underwood was found guilty of Oakland's murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wcjb.com/content/news/Man-sentenced-in-UF-professors-murder-472862363.html |title=Man sentenced in UF professor's murder |last=Jones |first=David |date=2018-02-05 |website=[[WCJB]] |language=en |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom McHale''' (1941 – March 30, 1982) was an American novelist. His works include ''Principato'', ''Farragan's Retreat'' (nominated for the [[National Book Award]]), ''Alinsky's Diamond'', ''School Spirit'', ''The Lady from Boston'', and ''Dear Friends''. He was born in [[Avoca, Pennsylvania]] and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the [[University of Iowa]]. He committed suicide in [[Florida]] in 1982.

==Early life==
Thomas "Tom" McHale was  born in 1941 in [[Avoca, Pennsylvania]] located nine miles (15&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. He was the eldest of six children from an [[Irish-Catholic]] family.&lt;ref name="novelist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5402 |title=Tom McHale |accessdate=2010-07-01|work=|first=Martin |last=Kich |publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia - June 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family’s Irish-American ethnicity and Roman Catholicism would become prominent elements in his novels.&lt;ref name="principato"/&gt;

He worked as a caseworker for the Department of Public Assistance in Philadelphia for a brief period.&lt;ref name="principato"/&gt;

He attended [[Jesuit]] Catholic schools&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; including ''Scranton Preparatory'' (1955–1959)&lt;ref name="portrait"/&gt;  and was a graduate of [[Temple University]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="principato"/&gt; He went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts from the [[University of Iowa]] Writers Workshop.

He had planned to be a doctor and attended medical school but changed his mind and dropped out.&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;{{cite news |title=From Book to Brick |first=Phil |last=Thomas|newspaper=The Citizen Auburn |location=[[Auburn, New York]] |date=May 9, 1976}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=July 2, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After the success of his first novel, ''Principato'' in 1972, McHale secured the position of ''writer-in-residence'' at [[Monmouth University]] in [[West Long Branch, New Jersey]], a position he held until the end of his life.&lt;ref name="principato"/&gt;

Shortly before his death he was rewarded with a teaching position at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] that was to commence in fall semester, September, 1983.&lt;ref name="portrait"&gt;{{cite news |title=Portrait of a Writer as a Young Suicide |first=Cathy Lynn |last=Grossman |newspaper=[[Miami Herald]] |location=[[Miami, Florida]] |date=July 4, 1983}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=July 1, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

McHale took an interest in writing early on, however, after attending a wedding in Israel in the late 1960s he decided to "give the writing monster inside me a chance and stayed there a year to see what I could do, to see if anything came up. I wrote a first novel. It was so bad that I tore it up into little pieces, took it out to the [[Negev Desert]] and threw it all over."&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;

Shortly after, he wrote a second novel and traveled to Paris, France where he shared it with the widow of novelist [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]. She liked what she saw and the book was later published as ''Principato'', McHale's first important work.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;

By the 1970s he was one of the most promising American novelists of his generation. During a period of 12 years between 1970 and 1982, he produced six novels that received wide acclaim and positive reviews.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt;

In 1976, McHale noted that he "writes in longhand, then has his work transcribed by a typist he describes as 'marvelous', she actually knows the English language and corrects my spelling and punctuation."&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt; He would spend an average of 18 months working on each novel but admitted that ''School Spirit'' only took him about seven months.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt; During that period he was living in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and expressed that he would like to work on a movie script because next because "I'm terribly interested in film. It's such a vast medium, so many people can see a movie. A novel, however, is limited in its appeal."&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;

McHale described his work;
{{Quotation|Parts of all of my novels are funny. But there's a tragi-comic sense to all of them. You can't deny the comedy, but neither can you deny the tragedy. It's there.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;}}

By 1972, Paramount pictures was very enthused about McHale's first novel, ''Farragan's Retreat''. They even hired [[screenwriter]] [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] to turn the novel into a screenplay. This was during the time of [[Richard Nixon]]'s election and Paramount eventually decided that the [[War in Vietnam]] was going to end soon. Because the book was about a young man who had gone to Canada to avoid the draft, the studio decided against using the story because they worried that by the time the film finally came out, the war would be over and the American public would have lost interest. As it turns out, Nixon prolonged the war, but by then Paramount had unfortunately moved on. Lardner mentioned several years later, in 1982, that he regretted that Paramount dropped the project because it was the screenplay he "liked the very best that never got made."&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ring Lardner, Jr. |first=Lisa Faye |last=Kaplan |newspaper=Herald Statesman |location=[[Yonkers, New York]]|year=1982}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=July 2, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Reviewers compared McHale's novels to those of [[Joseph Heller]], [[Kurt Vonnegut Jr.]], [[John Updike]] and [[Philip Roth]] because of his black comic humor. They also saw considerable talent in his quickly growing body of work.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt; A [[New York Times]] review in March, 1971 noted that "There are many young writers with healthy reserves of rags and chaos, some indeed with little else. What distinguishes McHale is not only the fertility of his invention but the humanity—remarkable in a writer of 28—that penetrates even his crudest characters.".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Books: Ring Around the Rosary |first=|last=|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |date=March 1, 1971}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=July 1, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''Life Magazine'' in 1971 went on to say that "McHale writes as if born to the craft. He imagines and schemes like a beery poet. He sees, pokes, probes. He tells fabulous jokes---McHale's capacity to trigger emotions ranges from laughter to compassion to cold horror. Realism, pathos, mystery, Tom McHale is not another new writer. He is himself."&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A fusion of blasphemy and formality |first=Webster |last=Schott |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22tom+mchale%22+novelist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8VD4zgB67r&amp;sig=MdUnQgF94N-Ed-t2wGQ8MDzQE-k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pHYtTI7bLYuCnQeU98TUAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine |location=[[New York, New York]] |publisher=Time Inc. |date=February 5, 1971|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1976, a review from [[Associated Press]] gave much credit to the novel ''School Spirit'' for grappling with "questions that men have long pondered, questions such as the sanctity of life, guilt, punishment, redemption, but instead of creating what should have been a heavy philosophic text, he successfully produced a comic novel that makes the reader think, even as he laughs."&lt;ref name="spirit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Book Reviews by AP |first=|last=|newspaper=The Citizen; [[Associated Press]] |location=[[Auburn, New York]] |date=April 11, 1976}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=July 2, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many good reviews, not all were favorable. In 1971 a scathing review of ''Farragan's Retreat'' noted that "this is an absurd book that started well. Now that this talented author has this novel out of his system, we can only hope that he'll live up to his potential."&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;{{cite news |title=Book Reviews |first=|last=|newspaper=The Citizen-Advertiser |location=[[Auburn, New York]] |work= |date=February 27, 1971}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=July 2, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
McHale was married to Suzanne McHale and had homes in [[Kittery, Maine]] and [[Killington, Vermont]].&lt;ref name="principato"/&gt; McHale enjoyed working with masonry in his spare time. He started in his mid-twenties by building fieldstone walls and later built fireplaces. In 1976, he proudly talked about the home in Maine, 60 miles from Boston, that he was looking forward to the construction of that summer; "It'll give me a chance to do some physical work. Outside, I'll do the masonry work on the base of the house and inside, I'll do the fireplace."&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;

McHale committed suicide at age 40 at his sister’s home in [[Pembroke Pines, Florida]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edrants.com/tom-mchale-novelist/ |title=Tom McHale, novelist |accessdate=2010-07-01|work=|first=Richard |last=Grayson |publisher=Edward Champion's Reluctant Habits - May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bibliography===
* ''Principato'' (1970) –  The novel was "almost universally hailed as a remarkable debut effort." This is religious fiction and is a story about ''Angelo Principato'', an [[Italian-American]] Catholic social worker from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] who marries an [[Irish-Catholic]] girl named ''Cynthia Corrigan'' who is the daughter of a wealthy mortician.&lt;ref name="principato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewstamand.com/supplemental/tom_mchale/principato.htm |title=Tom McHale - Principato |accessdate=2010-07-01|work=|first=Matthew |last=St. Amand |publisher=Matthew St. Amand - 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Farragan's Retreat'' (1972) –  The book received even more enthusiastic reviews than ''Principato'' &lt;ref name="principato"/&gt; and was named a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] later that year.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt; Like his first novel, it was a story about Irish and Italian Catholics in Philadelphia.
* ''Alinsky's Diamond'' (1974) –  Adeptly combined satire and comedy, by then a style very familiar to McHale. It is the story of ''Frances X. Murphy'', an [[Irish-American]] hustler who marries into a "fine" [[French people|French]] family.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt;
* ''School Spirit'' (1976) – Explored the consequences of exposing a "long-buried secret" and was McHale's first suspense novel."&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt;
* ''The Lady from Boston'' (1978) –  Dealt with the manipulation and betrayal of a young man by a beautiful woman and was far more cynical and darker than previous works.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt;
* ''Dear Friends'' (1982) –  His last written work was a deeply dark novel about a lawyer whose life unravels in a matter of days after witnessing two suicides and later discovering his firstborn child was fathered by another man.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt;

===Unfinished works===
* ''Elspath's War Canoe'' (1977) – A story about a young man who comes to Boston from Kansas City. He's determined to knock the world for a loop but he gets knocked instead.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;

===Awards===
In 1974, McHale was awarded the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for Fiction for ''Alinsky's Diamond''.&lt;ref name="novelist"/&gt; He also received the ''Thomas More Association'' medal, an award given annually for the most distinguished contribution to Catholic Literature for his novel ''School Spirit'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="more"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/peeking/Sheporaitis_initiated_recycling_in_1947_03-28-2010.html |title=Peeking into the past; 1977, 33 years ago |newspaper=Pittston Dispatch |location=[[Pittston, Pennsylvania]] |date=March 1, 1971 |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Wisconsin Experimental College''' was a two-year college designed and led by [[Alexander Meiklejohn]] inside the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a [[great books]], [[liberal arts]] curriculum. It was established in 1927 and closed in 1932. Meiklejohn proposed the idea for an alternative college in a 1925 ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]'' magazine article. The magazine's editor-in-chief, [[Glenn Frank]], became the University of Wisconsin's president and invited Meiklejohn to begin the college within the university. Despite pushback from the faculty, the college opened in the fall of 1927 with a self-governing community of 119 students and less than a dozen faculty. Students followed a uniform curriculum: [[Fifth-century Athens|Periclean Athens]] for freshmen and modern America for sophomores. The program sought to teach democracy and to foster an intrinsic love of learning within its students.

The college's students became known as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were unlike the rest of the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away from the heart of the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through [[tutorial]] instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led.

The [[Great Depression]] and lack of outreach to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's slow decline. Enrollment decreased every year since the program began, which its statewide reputation exacerbated. After his son was expelled in 1931 by dean and Experimental College critic [[George Sellery]], Meiklejohn recommended the college's dissolution. Public criticism of the college included student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the college, which philosopher [[John Dewey]] reviewed favorably and noted for its contribution to educational philosophy. University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to dissolve the college in May 1932. Some advisers stayed to teach in the university, and Meiklejohn remained briefly before moving to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. The Experimental College influenced programs internal to the university, and was the precursor to its Integrated Liberal Studies undergraduate program.

== Background ==

[[File:Alexander Meiklejohn Time magazine cover, October 1, 1928.jpg|thumb|Meiklejohn on the October 1928 cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine]] In June 1923, [[Alexander Meiklejohn]] had been asked to step down as president of [[Amherst College]].{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=145}} He was recruited specifically to revitalize the college a decade earlier with the views on education for which he was known. Meiklejohn announced curriculum reform with a singular focus on "understanding human life as to be ready and equipped for the practice of it", and subsequently made the [[humanities]] coursework more interdisciplinary, added [[social sciences]] courses, and attracted new faculty members interested in the [[Socratic method]].{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|pp=144–145}} Meiklejohn had student support, but clashed with senior faculty and alumni, and was ultimately removed due to his administrative mismanagement and not his educational reforms.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=145}}

Meiklejohn resolved to open a new, experimental liberal arts college in late 1924, but struggled to find funding. Seeking $3 million for the venture, he was rejected by [[Bernard Baruch]] and [[Abraham Flexner]] but through support from ''[[The New Republic]]''{{'s}} [[Herbert Croly]] was offered planning funds from [[Dorothy Payne Whitney|the magazine's main benefactor]]. The planning team included journalist Mark Sullivan, [[New School for Social Research|New School]] professor [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]],{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=147}} and ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' editor-in-chief{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=90}} [[Glenn Frank]].{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=147}} Frank had previously published Meiklejohn's work{{refn|Frank published two books about Meiklejohn: one on his Amherst public addresses on college education, and one on Meiklejohn's ouster from the college, which was sympathetic in tone.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|pp=146–147}}|group=note}} and was sympathetic to his cause.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|pp=146–147}}

In January 1925, ''Century'' published Meiklejohn's plan for a new and "experimental" college, "A New College: Notes on a Next Step in Higher Education".{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=90}} The proposed college would have a "unified" two-year curriculum and closer ties between faculty and students,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=134}} who were to be "coequal partners".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=135}} Meiklejohn called for a small school with a maximum of 35 professors and 300 students, with [[tutorial]] as the chief means of instruction.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=134}} The planned program eschewed division by academic discipline and preferred holistic study of human civilization, particularly [[ancient Athens]] and the contemporary United States.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=134}} The school sought to foster students who understood themselves in the context of their surrounding society as a "total human undertaking".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=134}} Meiklejohn wanted students who would independently volunteer to live in self-governance.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=135}} Meiklejohn biographer Adam Nelson wrote that for the 1920s, this idea of voluntary interest in study "seemed almost laughable".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=162}} The augmented liberal arts program was a departure from [[vocational education]] trends of the time, as was its emphasis on smaller classes in a time of large lectures for burgeoning college populations.{{sfn|Hove|1991|p=123}}

Frank stepped down from the magazine in May 1925 to become the incoming president of the [[University of Wisconsin]] (UW).{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=136}} He invited Meiklejohn to open his school there and offered him a distinguished professorship.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=136}} Meiklejohn planned the experimental college in secret{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=136}} and moved to Madison in January 1926 to teach in the philosophy department.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=140}} Meiklejohn finished his experimental college proposal by April 1926.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=140}} It was similar in style to his ''Century'' article and became codified as the Experimental College based on its colloquial reference in correspondence between Meiklejohn and Frank.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=140}} Meiklejohn presented his proposal to the All-University Study Commission convened by Frank{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=140}} "to investigate the first two years of liberal college work".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=139}} The university faculty received the proposal apprehensively, and criticized its vagueness, lack of control group, costliness, and effect on their livelihoods.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=141}} It was eventually approved on the condition that the faculty could review its details and regular progress.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=141}} The Wisconsin legislature approved two years of funding, and the Experimental College was scheduled to open in fall 1927.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=142}}

Meiklejohn prioritized compatibility in his staff selection, and so hired ten of his friends who could work in "intimate fellowship".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=145}} The college received hundreds of faculty applications in the summer of 1926,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=144}} and the final makeup included six from Amherst, two from Brown, and one from Scotland, mostly in [[idealism|idealist]] philosophy and [[labor economics]] disciplines.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=145}} The team met through the winter and into the 1927 spring to plan the program.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=145}} They received 119 applications even though the program was unadvertised.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=147}} Half of the applicant pool was interested in working with Meiklejohn specifically, and he was excited to work with "an entirely self-selected and therefore truly democratic community of learning."{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=147}}

== Program ==

Meiklejohn's Experimental College proposal called for two years of compulsory and interdisciplinary study of civilizations: ancient Athens for freshmen, and contemporary America for sophomores.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=140}} The plan had students and teachers living and working together in the same residence hall with no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semester grades, but a common syllabus.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=141}} Their only grade was to be the single final exam.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=141}} The college aimed "to inspire students to want to learn" and to teach democracy{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=150}} through "the intrinsic value of learning" over bribery, coercion, and physical violence.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=163}}

[[File:Experimental College advisers with Alexander Meiklejohn and Glenn Frank.png|thumb|left|Meiklejohn and Frank (center) among the Experimental College advisers, March 15, 1928]] The teachers, called advisers, would instruct via small, weekly tutorials and occasional schoolwide lectures on their personal research.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=140}} Adviser appointments were split with two-thirds in the Experimental College and one-third in the rest of the university, a compromise between Meiklejohn and the College of Letters and Sciences.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=147}} The program's budget and appointments were negotiated directly with President Frank, bypassing the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Letters and Science|UW College of Letters and Science]] and its dean, [[George Sellery]].{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=183}}

Meiklejohn saw books as the main instrument of a [[liberal education]], and chose a [[great books]] curriculum so as to model the human intellect he wished to impart and to connect the timeless philosophical questions that occupy all such works.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=153}} He wanted his college to read the same books and to debate the same questions simultaneously.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=154}} Meiklejohn did not prefer one "great book" over another and saw them as interchangeable and in pursuit of the same essential questions about goodness, justice, and truth.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=154}} Freshmen studied ancient Athens in [[age of Pericles|the age of Pericles]], reading authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Herodotus]], [[Homer]], [[Plato]], [[Thucydides]], and [[Xenophon]].{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=154}} Meiklejohn's curriculum accentuated the author's thoughts behind the work as related to general questions about society, and forewent emphasis on the texts themselves.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=155}}

Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' was the freshman year capstone, as "the apex of literary and philosophical achievement in ancient Athenian thought" and the book that best embodied their civilization.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=156}} Meiklejohn asked the students to synthesize how the contents of their first year were "interrelated in the experience of the individuals and of the community as a whole".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=156}} Over the summers, Meiklejohn assigned [[Middletown studies]] where students drew conclusions about American society based a view of their hometowns as typical of society.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=157}} The returning sophomores were expected to exhibit self-regulation as the primary regulator of their understanding, to educate themselves self-sufficiently, and to wean themselves of the college institution.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=158}} This freedom was taught so as to empower students towards independence while the advisers continued to hold pedagogical power.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=158}} [[Henry Adams]]'s ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]]'' was the sophomore year capstone, chosen for its complexity, self-criticism, and study of modern America's development.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=158}} Meiklejohn biographer Adam Nelson compared the Ex College curriculum and Adams's autobiography as both lamenting "the tragedy of lost spiritual and intellectual unity"{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=159}} and enabling students to relate "their literary and lived experiences".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=160}}

=== Extracurriculars ===

[[File:UW Experimental College Lysistrata cast (1928) - detail.jpg|thumb|Cast of the Experimental College's fall 1928{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=182}}  production of ''Lysistrata'']] All extracurricular groups were student-led.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=162}} Clubs included the Philosophy Club (held weekly at Meiklejohn's house), the Law Group, the Forum, and the Experimental College Players (a theater troupe).{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=160–162}} The Philosophy Club discussed topics such as the self{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=160}} and the relation between philosophy and science, for which Meiklejohn invited [[Clarence Ayres]] from Amherst to speak.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=161}} The Law Group discussed [[liberty]], state action, and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', while the Forum discussed [[current events]] like war, [[behaviorism]], and [[imperialism]].{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=161}} The Players performed classical plays including ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', ''[[The Clouds]]'', [[Euripides]]'s ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'', and ''[[Lysistrata]]'', which caused a particular stir for its [[cross-gender acting]] in erotic scenes.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=162}} The English department chair and dean of women both castigated President Frank for letting the play run.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=183}} Meiklejohn also invited several prominent speakers, including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and [[Lewis Mumford]].{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=161}}

=== Facilities ===

[[File:UW Experimental College "men in den", Adams Hall, December 15, 1927 - cropped.jpg|thumb|College men in the Adams Hall den, December 15, 1927]] The College was based in Adams Hall, where students and their advisers lived and worked by the shore of [[Lake Mendota]]{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=151}} (except for Meiklejohn, who lived in a large house several blocks away).{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=183}} Adams Hall was constructed in 1926, with a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]-style [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] and eight identical divisions, each with its own common room, den, and facilities for 30 students, two advisers, and a fellow.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=151}} The surrounding facilities afforded abundant sporting opportunities,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=151}} and the site offered distance from the city and university.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=152}} The students shared part of Adams Hall with non-Experimental College students, and the nearby common dining hall with the UW students in Tripp Hall.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=195}} The other students were said to be bothered by the Experimental College's disregard for property,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=173}} rambunctiousness, noise, and dining hall biscuit fights.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=195}}

== Rise ==

The first class arrived in fall 1927.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=148}} The incoming Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=148}} One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 percent in the university), most were from urban areas (the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] had particularly strong representation), one third were [[second-generation immigrants]], and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=148}} The College was all-male, due in part to space availability and the regents' refusal of [[mixed-sex]] living arrangements,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=151}} in keeping with American college conventions.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=182}} The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with higher scores on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=149}} Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=150}}

[[File:UW Experimental College 1927 group photo - edited.jpg|thumb|The first Experimental College class, 1927]] Meiklejohn recommended student government to the fall 1927 class, but they couldn't decide on its form and ultimately voted against government.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=174}} Put another way, they democratically voted against democratic governance in favor of anarchy.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=174–175}} This disappointed Meiklejohn,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=174}} but he thought they would eventually change their minds.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=195}}

As freshmen struggled with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts in the field of the current work studied.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=156}} In their dorms, the college students were known for their lack of respect for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets than the rest of the university.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=173}} Meiklejohn saw this as desirable{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=195}} and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=173}} Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=195}} Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of [[Ivy League]] and prominent [[State university system|state universities]].{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=163}} By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=164}}

The college was reputed to be a radical institution.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=169}} A judge presiding over a case involving three students in a socialist march declared the school "a hotbed of radical activity".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=169}} Meiklejohn bemoaned this characterization of his school and blamed the college's media prominence for disproportionate coverage of an avant-garde minority.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=169}} Two such cases included a former student who announced his [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] gubernatorial bid from jail, and another who organized a labor march with the college's students that ended in a face-off described as "bearded 'Experimenters'" against varsity athletes "bent on 'smashing the heads of the Reds'".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=169}} The Experimental College students acted differently from those of the rest of the university. They grew beards, wore their hair long, carried an air of apathy conspicuously, and did not tend as meticulously to their outward presentation.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=175}} They developed a tradition of wearing dark blue blazers with pearl gray trim, emblazoned with the [[owl of Athena]], worn in the "spirit of fellowship" and to set the college apart from the university.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=175}} Many of the advisers (including Meiklejohn) were indeed progressive-minded activists.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=483}}

Despite their stereotypical "queerness", ''[[The Daily Cardinal]]'' reported in 1930 that a majority of Experimental College students participated in sport, and that a number joined intramural teams, pledged for [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|Greek life]], and joined campus clubs.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=175}} However, the students abnormally read an average of 16 non-assigned books each semester and had an average of "only two dates a month", which the paper considered abnormal amid hints of homosexuality.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=176}} As these claims became widespread, Meiklejohn imported psychiatrist [[Frankwood Williams]] from New York to study the students' sexual habits.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=176}} He found the students to be "warped and twisted" as "normal for ... their age", praised the program for aiding their psychosexual growth where others inhibit, and concluded that the advisers made the students subservient to their demands even as they spoke in praise of student autonomy.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=177–179}}

== Decline ==

[[File:UW Experimental College freshman class, March 21, 1929 - cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Freshman class, March 21, 1929]] With the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, the Experimental College began a slow decline.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=167–168}} Many students couldn't afford tuition, fewer had additional savings, and several [[dropped out]].{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=167}} Along with books and campus salaries,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=168}} the Experimental College became a budgetary luxury during a time of economic need for both students and the state, and its funding was in jeopardy.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=167}} Meiklejohn started an Experimental College interest-fee loan fund for unfunded students, and asked advisers and monied students to donate.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=167}} During this period, some sophomores absconded the college for two weeks to live like the vagrant hobos who traveled the Midwest by rail looking for work.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=168}} They returned to write papers about their experiences, which Meiklejohn is said to have appreciated for its [[syncretism]] of experience and the great questions grounded in their readings.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=168}}

A 1930 faculty review of the curriculum questioned the program's focus and choice of civilizations.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=170–171}} The advisers entertained the Enlightenment, Middle Ages, and Renaissance as alternatives to their ancient Athens curriculum, but ultimately did not change course.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=171}} By early 1930, Meiklejohn began to show a loss of faith in the experiment and in education reform, chiefly in the ability to teach "rational self-criticism".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=173}} Around the same time, Meiklejohn received letters from the [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], schools superintendent and a Baraboo judge noting the Experimental College's sordid reputation in the state and its habit of repelling "ordinary" students whose parents were uninterested in the ramifications of such an education.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=179}} Within the community, a January 1930 student committee reported a widespread lack of individual responsibility in their living arrangements.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=173}} Parents began to complain about the college's public esteem, the qualities forming in their sons, and the curriculum.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=181}} The experiment was in ill repute.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=180}}

Enrollment dropped every year since the program's inception such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=180}} UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=180}} UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=180}} Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=184}} Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=180–181}} He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve what he saw as a communication issue.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=181}} The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students to the point where they did not consider improvements upon that model.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=181}} The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=181}}

The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=183}} He was foreign to Madison in his politics, social life, and personality.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=183}} Dean Sellery and President Frank's professional relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn due to his close association with Frank.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=184}} Sellery had the support of the faculty, who were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=184}} In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|pp=184–185}} Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=185}} Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College in the first quarter of 1929,{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|pp=185–186}} and Frank attempted to fire him in response.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=749}} In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=186}} Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=186}} A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=187}}

Common public explanations for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=187}} ''[[The Nation]]''{{'}}s [[Eliseo Vivas]] blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=187}} In ''School and Society'', Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=188}} Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=190}} Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought,{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=182}} but admitted that he did not know how to facilitate this.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=172}}

The University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to end the Experimental College in May 1932.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=190}} There was a farewell banquet for 250 guests in June 1932.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=865}} Meiklejohn did not judge the college's success by its permanence, which he did not expect—he said he attempted the college as a test.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=193}} Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=194}} Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the [[University of Wisconsin–Extension|University of Wisconsin Extension Division]] in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=195}} He later moved to Berkeley.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=199}} Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known as popular and innovative,{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=483}} and Agard became the [[Classics]] department chair.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=861}}

Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the Experimental College during the first half of 1932.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=192}} [[John Dewey]] reviewed the published book and declared it "a contribution to the philosophy of American education".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=192}} He saw the college to be a true expression of liberal education as it fostered rational faculties and self-criticism, and noted the college's place in fighting norms on a much larger timescale.{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=192}} For its ability to produce free-thinkers in an age without similar values, Dewey found the college "a tragic success".{{sfn|Nelson|2001|p=193}}

In ''The University of Wisconsin: A Pictorial History'', Arthur Hove states that the Experimental College "had little discernible influence beyond the university", though it served as a prototype for the university's Integrated Liberal Studies (ILS) program,{{sfn|Hove|1991|p=123}} spawned interest in learning, and showed the university's role in making individuals as well as workers.{{sfn|Hove|1991|p=128}} Cronon and Jenkins' ''The University of Wisconsin: A History, 1925–1945'' notes the college's recognition as the "best known example of [Wisconsin] curricular innovation" at the time, and blamed the college's closure on the depression but more so "the hubris of its architects" for not evangelizing its value to Wisconsinites and UW faculty.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=841}} Cronon and Jenkins also saw the college's influence in [[Charles Russell Bardeen]]'s fourth-year medical school [[preceptor]] program, the academic recommendations from the 1930 Fish and 1940 Daniels Committees, and the inception of Integrated Liberal Studies.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=841}} Similar to the Experimental College, the Integrated Liberal Studies started in the late 1940s was a great books, liberal arts, tutorial curriculum.{{sfn|Hove|1991|p=217}} It was developed in part by Agard, the Classics professor and former Experimental College adviser.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=868}} An English professor described ILS's ambience as that of a "small college" within a large university.{{sfn|Hove|1991|p=217}} Meiklejohn received an [[honorary doctorate|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from Madison in June 1964, where he was escorted by the first ILS director, Robert Pooley.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=868}}

A 1939 announcement described him as "one of the university's greatest teachers".{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=867}} Notable alumni include [[Victor Wolfson]], a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[playwright]] and founder of the college's theater group.{{sfn|Cronon|Jenkins|1994|p=866}}

==History==
[[File:Forestry building (1930).jpg|The School of Forestry building was built in commemoration of the school's 20th anniversary.&lt;ref name="100 Years 0.5"/&gt;|thumb|left]]

CFNR traces its roots to the Forest School founded in April 14, 1910,&lt;ref name='Foundation'&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.up.edu.ph/upnewsletter.php?issue=65&amp;i=1182 | title = Forestry celebrates Centennial Week | author = Andre Encarnacion | journal = UP Newsletter | publisher = University of the Philippines | location = Quezon City | date = 2010-05-01 | accessdate = 2011-04-30 | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320042758/http://www.up.edu.ph/upnewsletter.php?issue=65&amp;i=1182 | archive-date = 2012-03-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; through an [[List of Philippine laws|Act]] 1989 by the [[Insular Government of the Philippines]] and efforts by Secretary of the Interior, [[Dean Conant Worcester]].  It was originally established as a department in the newly established of the College of Agriculture, and all of its early faculty were from the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|Bureau of Forestry]]. The Forest School became independent of the College of Agriculture in February 1916 through Act 2578. Since then directors of the bureau had acted as [[ex officio]] deans of the school.&lt;ref name = '100 Years 0.5'&gt;{{cite book| pages = 47–74 | chapter = Chs. 4–5 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-45 | accessdate = 2011-05-01 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

[[Americans in Philippine Scouting#Other BSA Philippine Islands Council Board Members, 1924–1937|Arthur Frederick Fischer]], the School of Forestry's first dean, retired as director of the Bureau of Forestry in February 1936. He was replaced by [[Florencio Tamesis]] who became the School of Forestry's second dean, as well as its first [[Filipino people|Filipino]] dean.&lt;ref name = '100 Years 0.5'/&gt;

The [[Second World War]] devastated the campus. All the School of Forestry buildings, including student and faculty houses, were destroyed. Large parts of the [[Mount Makiling|Makiling Forest Reserve]], which is administered by the school were likewise damaged. Only four faculty including Tamesis and silviculture professor Teodoro C. Delizo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.gov.ph/details.php?uid=e6a3c7d8512263bc1f479867b0fe555d|title=Forest nursery and plantation handbook for the Philippines|author=Teodoro Cachero Delizo|date=1964|publisher=University of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with five students returned upon the resumption of classes. Classes were held under trees until its buildings could be reconstructed through the help of [[war reparation]] funds worth [[Philippine Peso|₱]]59,300 (US$1,380).&lt;ref name="conversion"&gt;Approximate conversion value as of May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = '100 Years'&gt;{{cite book | pages = 75–122 | chapter = Chs. 6–8 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-68 | accessdate = 2011-05-01 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

The School of Forestry became the College of Forestry on June 14, 1949, by effect of RA 352,&lt;ref name="Forest History"/&gt;&lt;ref name='RA 352'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno352.html | title = Republic Act No. 352 | author = Congress of the Philippines | publisher = Chan Robles Virtual Law Library | date = 1949-06-04 | accessdate = 2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the College of Forestry finally separated from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957, effectively putting it under direct administration of the [[University of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="100 Years"/&gt;

In 1954 the College of Forestry signed an agreement with [[Cornell University]] for providing academic and financial assistance. The College of Forestry received [[visiting professor]]s from Cornell and grants that were used for construction and forestry research, while faculty and students were awarded scholarships for pursuing [[master's degree]]s at [[United States|US]] universities.&lt;ref name="100 Years"/&gt;

Domingo M. Lantican became the dean of the College of Forestry in May 1966. Lantican implemented a 5-year campus development program which included construction of new buildings and designating areas for [[dormitory|dormitories]] and staff housing.&lt;ref name = '100 Years 2'&gt;{{cite book| pages = 123–160 | chapter = Chs. 9–10 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-910 | accessdate = 2011-05-02 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

The College of Forestry and Natural Resources is managed by a [[dean (education)|dean]], currently Juan M. Pulhin, who is appointed by the UP [[board of regents|Board of Regents]], and assisted by an associate dean.&lt;ref name='Old CFNR'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://old.uplb.edu.ph/cfnr | title = College of Forestry and Natural Resources | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources | accessdate = 2011-05-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155320/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/cfnr | archive-date = 2011-08-23 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the college's separation from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957, the deans of the College of Forestry and its predecessors were not appointed by the board but were the directors of the Bureau of Forestry acting as ex officio heads of the college. Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] (about 64 kilometers), directors of the bureau appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school, a practice which continued until 1957.&lt;ref name="100 Years 0.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="100 Years"/&gt;

The graduates of the college has maintained substantially good performance in the forestry license exams conducted by the [[Professional Regulation Commission]]. For instance, the mean passing rates of its graduates in the exams for the years 2008–2010 is 92.49%. This is almost double of the mean national passing rate for the same period. Furthermore, six of its graduates belonged to the top ten best performing students in the 2010 exam, while four belonged to the top ten in both 2008 and 2009 exams. (see table)

===Libraries and collections===

The CFNR Library holds about 30,000 [[publication]]s which mostly focus on forestry and related disciplines. The library has a floor area of 974.64 sq. m, and is open 40 hours a week.&lt;ref name='CFNR library'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cfnr.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/cfnr-library.html | title = The CFNR Library | date = 2010-06-18 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum of Natural History of the University of the Philippines Los Baños, established in 1976, is located in the campus. It holds over 200,000 biological specimens; including half of the samplings from the Philippine Water Bug Inventory Project. More than half of the museum's specimens are in its [[entomology|entomological]] collection. While most of the museum's collections are in its main building, some are housed in other UPLB units.&lt;ref name='Wien'&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.landesmuseum.at/pdf_frei_remote/ANNA_101B_0041-0042.pdf | publisher = Naturhistorischen Museums Wien | author = A.C.

The '''Varkey Foundation''', initially the Varkey GEMS Foundation, is a global charitable foundation focused on improving the standards of education for underprivileged children.&lt;ref&gt;Abrioux, Marc and Jill Rutherford. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D1UGVo8AI2AC&amp;pg=PT128 ''Introducing the IB Diploma Programme'']. Cambridge University Press, 2013. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 2010 by Indian businessman [[Sunny Varkey]], the founder and chairman of [[GEMS Education]], the world's largest operator of kindergarten-to-grade-12 schools.&lt;ref name=forbespro&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/sunny-varkey/ Sunny Varkey] – Profile at ''[[Forbes]]''. Retrieved 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's main focuses are improving global teacher capacity by training tens of thousands of teachers and principals in developing countries; providing access to education via a variety of programmes and projects; and advocating for change in, and conducting research that can help develop, education policies worldwide.&lt;ref name=expertise /&gt;&lt;ref name=tomorrow/&gt;

The Varkey Foundation has partnered with a variety of major global organizations including [[UNESCO]], [[UNICEF]], and the [[Clinton Global Initiative]]. In 2013 it launched the Global Education and Skills Forum, an annual education summit dedicated to addressing the world's educational needs. After analyzing the public status of teachers worldwide, in 2014 it launched the annual Global Teacher Prize, a $1{{nbsp}}million award to an outstanding pioneering teacher who has had a widespread impact.

==History==

===Launch===
The foundation was formed by [[Sunny Varkey]] in 2010 as the strategic philanthropic arm of [[GEMS Education]], and was initially called the Varkey GEMS Foundation. Its stated intention is to impact 100 impoverished children for every child enrolled at GEMS schools, or 10 million children globally, via projects such as enrollment and education-access initiatives, worldwide teacher-training programs, advocacy campaigns, policy input through strategic partnerships, and physical projects such as building classrooms, schools, and learning centers.&lt;ref name=hamdan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.varkeygemsfoundation.org/projects Varkey GEMS Foundation – Projects] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109012526/https://www.varkeygemsfoundation.org/projects |date=9 November 2014 }}.

===Teacher training===
Beginning in 2013, the foundation's Teacher Training Programme committed to train 250,000 teachers within 10 years in under-served communities across the world.&lt;ref name=ttraining /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story/Dubai_Cares_partners_with_Varkey_GEMS_Foundation_to_train_and_develop_teachers_across_the_developing_world-ZAWYA20140316130416/ "Dubai Cares partners with Varkey GEMS Foundation to train and develop teachers across the developing world"].

''[[The Times of India]]''. 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher training programme moves lessons away from focusing on students' ability to remember and repeat facts; instead, it focuses on encouraging students to apply, analyse, and create based on what they remember. The programme trains teachers to create a culture of personalised learning, with greater student participation, cooperative learning activities, and exploration of ideas. Rather than simply relying on "chalk and talk" methods of standing at the front of the classroom, teachers are taught to interact with students, and to accommodate different learning needs – including those of pupils who learn best through [[Visual learning|visual]], [[auditory learning|auditory]], or [[kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic]] methods.&lt;ref name=williams /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, William.

====Global Teacher Prize====
{{Main|Global Teacher Prize}}
In order to raise the status of teaching, at the second annual Global Education and Skills Forum in March 2014, the foundation launched the Global Teacher Prize, an annual $1 million award to an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://educationandskillsforum.org/press-release-applications-open-for-worlds-first-one-million-dollar-teacher-prize/ "Applications open for world’s first one million dollar teacher prize"] (press release). ''EducationandSkillsForum.org''. March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Business Backs Education====
In 2014 the Varkey Foundation, together with UNESCO, co-created Business Backs Education, a global advocacy campaign that encourages businesses, companies, and corporations to support education to the same degree that they support other basic services such as healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemseducation.com/organisation/varkey-foundation/business-backs-education/ Business Backs Education].

On the grounds that skills shortages negatively impact companies' ability to prosper and innovate, and inequalities in educational opportunity also weaken the social and political stability needed for businesses to thrive, the BBE campaign recommends that companies worldwide allocate at least 20% of their [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) spending to educational initiatives by the year 2020.&lt;ref name=williams /&gt;&lt;ref name=urged /&gt;&lt;ref name=cgi2014 /&gt;
