'''1865 Broadway''' is a building in [[New York City]] owned by [[AvalonBay Communities]] and designed by architect [[Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill]]. The new structure replaced another SOM-designed building completed in 1965.
__NOTOC__
==History==
===Original building===
The headquarters of the [[American Bible Society]] originally stood on the site.&lt;ref name=nyt2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/nyregion/new-york-says-farewell-to-american-bible-society-and-its-building.html?_r=0|title=New York Says Farewell to American Bible Society, and Its Building|last=Dunlap|first=David|date=21 October 2015|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/10/1865-broadways-brutalist-inspired-facade-reaches-its-rooftop-on-the-upper-west-side-of-manhattan.html|title=1865 Broadway’s Brutalist-Inspired Facade Reaches Its Rooftop On The Upper West Side Of Manhattan|last=Nelson|first=Andrew|date=10 October 2018|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill designed the original structure. It incorporated some Biblical symbolism, inspired by its anchor tenant.&lt;ref name=nyt2015/&gt; John Kriskiewicz, a Manhattan-based historian of architecture, referred to the original 1865 Broadway as “structurally expressive” but also expressed that it “might have left the public cold.” The Bible Society placed the building on the market in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140325/REAL_ESTATE/140329922/american-bible-society-wants-300m-for-hq|title=American Bible Society wants $300M for HQ|last=Geiger|first=Daniel|date=25 March 2014|publisher=Crain's New York Business|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New structure===

AvalonBay purchased the building from the Society in 2015 for $300 million, after the organization announced it intended to move its headquarters to [[Philadelphia]]. Like the former building, Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill designed the new building. 1865 Broadway topped out in December of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2017/12/som-designed-1865-broadway-tops-out-on-the-upper-west-side.html|title=SOM-Designed 1865 Broadway Tops Out On The Upper West Side|last=Fedak|first=Nikolai|date=20 December 2017|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building will contain mostly residential space, with a mix of apartments for rent and condominiums for sale.

SOM took inspiration from the facade of [[I. M. Pei|I. M. Pei's]] Brutalist [[Kips Bay Towers]].

The '''A630''' is an [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A road]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It runs between [[Sheffield]] city centre {{nowrap|({{coord|53.3762|-1.3998|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A630 road (southwestern end)}})}} and junction 4 of the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18 motorway]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.5400|-1.0229|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A630 road (northeastern end)}}),}} passing through [[Rotherham]] and [[Doncaster]] on the way. The road is entirely in [[South Yorkshire]].

==Route==
The road starts at the A57 just outside [[Sheffield City Centre]] which forms part of the Sheffield Parkway, then runs to the [[M1 motorway|M1]] at Junction 33. Beyond the roundabouts it heads west to [[Rotherham]] which it passes as the dual carriageway, four-lane ''Centenary Way'', turning north and northeast towards [[Conisbrough]] and [[Doncaster]], passing [[Conisbrough Castle]]. Between Warmsworth and Balby it meets the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]] at Junction 36. From there it heads east to Doncaster, then passing [[Armthorpe]] it heads to the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]] at Junction 4 where the road terminates.&lt;ref name = SABRE/&gt;

==Motorway junctions==
The A630 has a junction with [[M1 motorway|M1]] at Junction 33 at [[Catcliffe]], another with [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]] at Junction 36 at [[Warmsworth]], and finally at [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]] at Junction 4 at [[Armthorpe]] where the road terminates.

'''Agenda 21''' is a non-binding [[action plan]] of the [[United Nations]] with regard to [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Agenda 21?|url=http://www.icleiusa.org/about-iclei/faqs/faq-iclei-the-united-nations-and-agenda-21#what-is-agenda-21|publisher=ICLEIUSA|accessdate=8 Dec 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212203307/http://www.icleiusa.org/about-iclei/faqs/faq-iclei-the-united-nations-and-agenda-21#what-is-agenda-21|archivedate=12 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a product of the [[Earth Summit]] (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels.

The "21" in Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 refers to the 21st&amp;nbsp;century. It has been affirmed and had a few modifications at subsequent UN&amp;nbsp;conferences. Its aim is achieving global sustainable development. One major objective of the agenda 21 is that every local government should draw its own local Agenda 21. Since 2015, [[Sustainable Development Goals]] are included in the [[Agenda 2030]].

== Structure and contents ==

Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 is a 350-page document divided into 40&amp;nbsp;chapters that have been grouped into 4&amp;nbsp;sections:

*''Section&amp;nbsp;I: Social and Economic Dimensions'' is directed toward combating poverty, especially in [[developing countries]], changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making.
*''Section&amp;nbsp;II: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development'' includes atmospheric protection, combating [[deforestation]], protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]), [[control of pollution]] and the management of [[biotechnology]], and [[radioactive waste]]s.
*''Section&amp;nbsp;III: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups'' includes the roles of children and youth, women, [[NGO]]s, local authorities, business and industry, and workers; and strengthening the role of [[indigenous peoples]], their communities, and farmers.
*''Section&amp;nbsp;IV: Means of Implementation'' includes science, [[technology transfer]], [[education for sustainable development|education]], [[international organization|international institutions]] and financial mechanisms.

== Development and evolution==
The full text of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 was made public at the UN&amp;nbsp;Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]), held in Rio de Janeiro on June 13, 1992, where 178&amp;nbsp;governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.

=== Rio+5 (1997)===
In 1997, the [[UN&amp;nbsp;General Assembly]] held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as "uneven" and identified key trends, including increasing [[globalization]], widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] (S-19/2) promised further action.

=== Rio+10 (2002)===
{{main|World Summit on Sustainable Development}}

The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] ([[Earth Summit&amp;nbsp;2002]]), affirmed UN commitment to "full implementation" of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21, alongside achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and other international agreements.

=== Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 for culture (2002) ===
{{main|Agenda 21 for culture}}

The first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 was for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agenda21culture.net/|title=Culture 21 - Agenda 21 for culture|author=|date=|website=www.agenda21culture.net|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225094231/http://www.agenda21culture.net/|archivedate=25 December 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with [[G8]]&amp;nbsp;countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Rio+20 (2012)===
{{main|United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development}}
In 2012, at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 in their outcome document called "The Future We Want".
180 nation leaders participated.

=== Sustainable Development Summit (2015) ===
{{main|Sustainable Development Goals}}Agenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals, was a set of goals decided upon at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit|title=United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211014539/https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit|archivedate=2017-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes all of the goals set by Agenda 21 and re-asserts them as the basis for sustainable development, saying, “We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development…”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:.

== Implementation==
The [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21. The UN&amp;nbsp;Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works "within the context of" Agenda&amp;nbsp;21.

Implementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.

=== Local level ===
{{See also| International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives}}
The implementation of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter&amp;nbsp;28 of the document. These programs are often known as "Local Agenda 21" or "LA21".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/sustainability/Older/Local_Agenda21.html Manchester Metropolitan University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722181929/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/sustainability/Older/Local_Agenda21.html |date=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Philippines]], the plan is "Philippines Agenda&amp;nbsp;21" (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000&amp;nbsp;cities, towns, and counties in 88&amp;nbsp;countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 implementation.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Leslie|author2=Kate Zernike|authorlink2=Kate Zernike|title=Activists Fight Green Projects, Seeing U.N.

Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smardon|first=Richard|title=A comparison of Local Agenda 21 implementation in North American, European and Indian cities|journal=Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal|year=2008|volume=19|issue=1|pages=118–137|doi=10.1108/14777830810840408|accessdate=9 October 2013|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/86583203/A-Comparison-of-Local-Agenda-21-Implementation-in-North-American-European-and-Indian-Cities|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611110931/https://www.scribd.com/doc/86583203/A-Comparison-of-Local-Agenda-21-Implementation-in-North-American-European-and-Indian-Cities|archivedate=11 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, for example, all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda 21 initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jörby|first=Sofie|title=Local Agenda 21 in four Swedish Municipalities: a tool towards sustainability|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|year=2002|volume=45|issue=2|pages=219–244|doi=10.1080/09640560220116314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional levels==

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs|title=Areas of Work - National Information by Country or Organization|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_ni/ni_index.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804031335/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd_aofw_ni/ni_index.shtml|archivedate=4 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[Australia]] is a signatory to Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to [[ICLEI]], an organization that promotes Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 globally. Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States.&lt;ref name=ICLEI&gt;{{cite web|last=ICLEI |title=ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability: Global Members |url=http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=11454 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725211037/http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=11454 |archivedate=25 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, national support for Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 [[Sam Nujoma]], who was then President of [[Namibia]], spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a [[semi-arid]] country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Namibian president calls for implementation of Agenda 21|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-09/02/content_547409.htm|accessdate=15 August 2012|newspaper=Xinhua News Agency|date=2 September 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115234421/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-09/02/content_547409.htm|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 participation in [[North Africa]]n countries mirrors that of [[Middle East]]ern countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 status reports.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} By contrast, [[South Africa]]'s participation in Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21&amp;nbsp;city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 by national-level government.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===== Support =====
The United States is a signatory country to Agenda&amp;nbsp;21, but because Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the [[United States Senate]] did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]]. President [[George H. W. Bush]] was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.courier-journal.com/watchdogearth/2013/02/20/senators-attack-sustainable-development-and-agenda-21/|title=Senators attack sustainable development, Agenda 21|work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=20 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131012081628/http://blogs.courier-journal.com/watchdogearth/2013/02/20/senators-attack-sustainable-development-and-agenda-21/|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2012/11/04/news/01top_11-04-12.txt|title=Secret agenda at city hall?|date=4 November 2012|work=Wyoming Tribune Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year Representatives [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Eliot Engel]] and [[William Broomfield]] spoke in support of [[United States House of Representatives]] Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 in the United States.&lt;ref name=HuffPost /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MxMif1tBVk|title=Agenda 21 Nancy Pelosi .mp4|first=|last=Arnie Rosner|date=3 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323204956/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MxMif1tBVk|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by a 1993 Executive Order, the President's Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, "Sustainable America: A New Consensus", to the President in early 1996.  In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21. 

In the United States, over 528&amp;nbsp;cities are members of [[ICLEI]], an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 and Local Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of 1,200&amp;nbsp;cities promoting sustainable development at a local level.&lt;ref name=ICLEI /&gt; The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 status reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/usa/natur.htm|title=Agenda 21 - United States|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008053420/http://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/usa/natur.htm|archivedate=8 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said "Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments".&lt;ref name=HuffPost/&gt;

The [[Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012, arguing "It would be bad for business" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development.&lt;ref name=HuffPost/&gt;

'''Anastas Spasov Razboynikov''' ({{lang-bg|Атастас Спасов Разбойников}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n revolutionary and teacher, a worker of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] (IMARO).

Anastas Razboynikov was born in 1882 in the town of Mustafa Pasha (today known as [[Svilengrad]]) in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He finished the [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Adrianople]] in 1901-1902. In this school he together with his classmates founded a revolutionary group of students. After he finished the school, he became a major teacher for the region of [[Bunarhisar]]. There he met the revolutionary band of [[Ivan Shishmanov]] with the goal of organising revolutionary activities among the population. During the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]] he was a freedom fighter in the revolutionary band of [[Stoyan Petrov]].

He was a delegate of the Congress of [[Petrova niva]] as a representative of the Bunarhisar revolutionary region and, together with [[Hristo Silyanov]], he was elected secretary of the congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridian27.com/trakia/v22.htm Тракийско дружество „Антим Първи“] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206192102/http://www.meridian27.com/trakia/v22.htm |date=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Sofia]] in 1967.

]]
The '''Boulogne camp''' may designate two military camps around [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in [[France]].

== First camp ==
The first camp was prepared by [[Julius Caesar]], in 54 BCto prepare the fleet for his second [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|expedition to Britain]]. 
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; One hypothesis is that Julius Caesar set up his camp at the current location of the [[:fr:Ville fortifiée de Boulogne-sur-Mer|old City of Boulogne-sur-Mer]].  Some historians believe that the Old City was built on the camp; at a vicinity to ''[[Itius Portus|Itius port]]'' which he cites in Chapter IV of its [[Gallic Wars]]   :  
: ''Caesar returns in Hither Gaul, and from there to the army. When he got there, he visited all neighborhoods, and finds that the singular activity of the soldiers had managed, despite extreme shortages of all things, to build about six hundred ships of the form described above and twenty eight galleys, all ready for sea in a few days. After giving praise to soldiers and those who had led the work, he instructs his intentions and ordered them to go all the Itius port, where he knew the ride in Brittany is very convenient, the distance this island to the mainland being only thirty thousand steps.''

== Second camp ==
[[File:Télégramme_du_Général_Soult_à_l’Empereur_Napoléon_Bonaparte_l’informant_que_l’escadre_anglaise_est_toujours_devant_Boulogne._1_-_Archives_Nationales_-_AE_II_2302.jpg|thumb|
Telegram of General Soult Napoleon informing him that the English squadron is still before Boulogne, June 12, 1804. [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales]].

]]
The second camp was established by  [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] (Napoleon 1st) in 1803, and continued by Napoleon until 1805. This was where he assembled the "Grand Army", or [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|Army of the ocean]], to invade Britain. 
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; On  May 16, 1803, the British, without previous declaration of war, seized  a hundred French and Batavian ships. France declared war on England then.  Bonaparte then chose [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] as a base for attacks against England. 
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; The Boulogne camp housed about &lt;span&gt;60,000&lt;/span&gt; soldiers in 1805, it was divided into two large camps   : 
* one was on the left bank of the [[Liane (river)|Liana]], near d'[[Outreau]],    
* the other was in the area of Vallon [[:fr:Terlincthun|Terlincthun]] and the plateau of the [[:fr:Tour d'Ordre|tour d'Order]]. 
At the top of the cliff were the command barracks, including that of Napoleon, but the headquarters was located at [[:fr:Château de Pont-de-Briques|Castle of Pont-de-Briques]].&lt;ref&gt;
The Boulogne camp is behind the construction of the magazine. We can especially note the work done in 1841 in the context of strengthening the protection of places: Construction of a wall in stone, paving of the courtyard and a gatehouse and a lightning rod. Powder belonged to the artillery and was paid in 1835 by the Indirect Taxation Administration. The latter are sites of gunpowder and hunting weapons. When Second World War came, the powder bunker was certainly exploited by the Germans who reinforced the site, as evidenced by bunker there. At the end of the conflict, the magazine was abandoned to become a real ruin until the day when the city decided to restore it. The inauguration took place in 1990.

'''Cantre'r Gwaelod''', also known as '''Cantref Gwaelod''' or '''Cantref y Gwaelod''' ({{lang-en|The Lowland Hundred}}), is a legendary ancient [[Lost lands|sunken kingdom]] said to have occupied a tract of fertile land lying between [[Ramsey Island]] and [[Bardsey Island]] in what is now [[Cardigan Bay]] to the west of [[Wales]]. It has been described as a "Welsh [[Atlantis]]" and has featured in folklore, literature and song.

==The myth==
Cantre'r Gwaelod was an area of land which, according to legend, was located in an area west of present-day Wales which is now under the waters of Cardigan Bay. Accounts variously suggest the tract of land extended from [[Bardsey Island]] to [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] or as far south as [[Ramsey Island]].&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gwyndaf |first=Robin|title=Welsh folk tales/Chwedlau gwerin Cymru |year=1989|publisher=National Museum Wales/Amgueddfa Genedlaethol Cymru|location=Cardiff|isbn=978-0-7200-0326-0|edition=2|chapter=34. Cantre'r Gwaelod, Dyfed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legends of the land suggest that it may have extended 20 miles west of the present coast.&lt;ref name=bbc-legacies&gt;{{cite web|title=Cantre’r Gwaelod – The Lost Land of Wales|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/wales/w_mid/article_1.shtml|work=Legacies - UK History Local to You|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of the myth. The earliest known form of the legend is usually said to appear in the ''[[Black Book of Carmarthen]]'', in which the land is referred to as ''Maes Gwyddno'' ({{lang-en|the Plain of Gwyddno}}). In this version, the land was lost to floods when a well-maiden named Mererid neglected her duties and allowed the well to overflow.&lt;ref name=bbc-legacies/&gt;

[[Rachel Bromwich]] questions this identification, saying that "There is no certainty, however, that in twelfth century tradition Maes Gwyddneu did represent the submerged land in Cardigan Bay." She also links [[Gwyddno Garanhir]] with the [[Hen Ogledd]], not Wales.&lt;ref name="Rachel Bromwich 1950 231"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Early Cultures of North-West Europe|year=1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=231|author=Rachel Bromwich|editor=Cyril Fox, Bruce Dickins|chapter=Cantre'r Gwaelod and Ker-Is}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular version known today is thought to have been formed from the [[17th century]] onwards. Cantre'r Gwaelod is described as a low-lying land fortified against the sea by a [[levee|dyke]], [[Sarn Badrig]] ("[[Saint Patrick]]'s causeway"), with a series of [[sluice]] gates that were opened at low tide to drain the land.&lt;ref name=bbc-legacies/&gt;

Cantre'r Gwaelod's capital was ''[[Caer]] Wyddno'', seat of the ruler Gwyddno Garanhir. Two princes of the realm held charge over the dyke. One of these princes, called [[Seithenyn]], is described in one version as a notorious drunkard and carouser, and it was through his negligence that the sea swept through the open floodgates, ruining the land.

The church bells of Cantre'r Gwaelod are said to ring out in times of danger.

===Relationship to myth of Llys Helig===
Rachel Bromwich discusses a similar tale, that of the submergence of the kingdom of [[Helig ap Glanawg]] in the [[River Conwy|Conwy estuary]]. As with Cantre'r Gwaelod, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom ([[Llys Helig]]).  Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that "The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century. She also notes that the [[Masonic manuscripts|Halliwell Manuscript]] gives Helig the title "Lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod".&lt;ref name="Rachel Bromwich 1950 231"/&gt; In the book ''New Directions In Celtic Studies'' Antone Minard wrote that "The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Directions In Celtic Studies|year=2000|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859896221|page=60|author=Antone Minard|editor=Amy Hale and Philip Payton|chapter=Pre-Packaged Breton Folk Narrative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical evidence==
[[File:CardiganBay.svg|thumb|right|Cardigan Bay, supposed location of Cantre'r Gwaelod]]
There is no reliable physical evidence of the substantial community that legend promises lies under the sea, although several reports exist of remains being sighted.

In 1770, Welsh antiquarian scholar [[William Owen Pughe]] reported seeing sunken human habitations about four miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) off the [[Ceredigion]] coast, between the rivers [[River Ystwyth|Ystwyth]] and [[River Teifi|Teifi]].&lt;ref name=haughton&gt;{{cite book|last=Haughton|first=Brian|title=Haunted spaces, sacred places : a field guide to stone circles, crop circles, ancient tombs, and supernatural landscapes|year=2008|publisher=New Page Books|location=Franklin Lakes, NJ|isbn=1-60163-000-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpwJ9Iz3iH8C&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Haunted%20Spaces%2C%20Sacred%20Places%20Cantre'r%20Gwaelod&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1846 edition of ''The Topographical Dictionary of Wales'', [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]] described a feature of stone walls and causeways beneath the shallow waters of Cardigan Bay:

{{Quotation|In the sea, about seven miles west of Aberystwyth in Cardiganshire, is a collection of loose stones, termed Caer Wyddno, "the fort or palace of Gwyddno;" and adjoining it are vestiges of one of the more southern causeways or embankments of Catrev Gwaelod. The depth of water over the whole extent of the bay of Cardigan is not great; and on the recess of the tide, stones bearing Latin inscriptions, and Roman coins of various emperors, have been found below high-water mark: in different places in the water, also, are observed prostrate trees."|[[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]]|The Topographical Dictionary of Wales.&lt;ref name=haughton/&gt;}}

Lewis takes the view that maps by the [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[Ptolemy]] marked the coastline of Cardigan Bay in the same location as it appears in modern times, suggesting that the date of the flood occurred before the second century AD.

}}
The "causeways" described by Lewis can be seen today at beaches around Cardigan Bay. Known as ''Sarnau'', these ridges stretch several miles into the sea at right angles to the coast, and are located between each of the four river mouths in the north of Cardigan Bay. Modern geologists surmise that these formations of clay, gravel and rocks are [[moraine]]s formed by the action of [[Glacial landform|melting glaciers]] end of the last [[ice age]]. In a 2006 episode of the [[BBC]] television documentary ''[[Coast (TV series)|Coast]]'', presenter [[Neil Oliver]] visited ''[[Sarn Gynfelyn]]'' at [[Wallog]]. The programme also featured the remains of the submerged forest at [[Ynyslas]], near [[Borth]] which is associated with the lost land of Cantre'r Gwaelod. The vista of dead oak, pine, birch, willow and hazel tree stumps preserved by the acid [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions in the soil is revealed at [[Tide|low tide]] and is estimated to be about 5000 years old.&lt;ref name="coast"/&gt;&lt;ref name=submerged/&gt;

==Origins of the myth==
[[File:Coccoliths in the Celtic Sea-NASA.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Comparable Celtic myths describe a submerged kingdom near Brittany or Cornwall|alt=Satellite view of the Celtic Sea]]
The myth, like so many others, may be a folk memory of gradually rising sea levels at the end of the [[ice age]]. The physical remains of the preserved sunken forest at [[Borth#Geography|Borth]], and of Sarn Badrig nearby, could have suggested that some great tragedy had overcome a community there long ago, and so the myth may have grown from that.&lt;ref name=submerged&gt;{{cite web|title=5. Submerged Forest|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/coast/pages/5.shtml|work=Mid Wales Coast - Ynyslas Walk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogies in other legends===
The legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod is comparable to the [[Flood myth|deluge myth]] found in nearly every ancient culture, and it has been likened to the story of [[Atlantis]].

Several similar legends exist in [[Celtic mythology]] which refer to a lost land beneath the waves. Both the [[Breton mythology|Breton legend]] of [[Ys|Ker-Ys]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tale of [[Lyonesse]] refer to a kingdom submerged somewhere in the [[Celtic Sea]], off the coast of [[Brittany]] or [[Cornwall]] respectively.

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
The legend has inspired many poems and songs throughout the ages. The earliest mention of Cantre'r Gwaelod is thought to be in the thirteenth-century [[Black Book of Carmarthen]] in a poem called ''"Boddi Maes Gwyddno"'' ("The Drowning of the Land of Gwyddno") which relates the tale of Mererid and the well.

The story inspired a [[Victorian era]]-novel, ''[[The Misfortunes of Elphin]]'' (1829), by [[Thomas Love Peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas Love Peacock|first=Thomas Love|title=The Misfortunes of Elphin|year=1829|publisher=Thomas Hookham|pages=240|chapter=1. The Prosperity of Gwaelod}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 1925 [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], held in [[Pwllheli]], [[Dewi Morgan]] ('Dewi Teifi') won the [[Chairing of the Bard|Bardic Chair]] with his [[Awdl]] recounting the legend, adopting Thomas Love Peacock's version as the basis for his poetic rendition.
[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - Great Britain and Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Ptolemy's map of Great Britain and Ireland (1467 copy)]]
Geologist William Ashton's 1920 book, ''The Evolution of a Coast-Line, Barrow to Aberystwyth and the Isle of Man, with Notes on Lost Towns, Submarine Discoveries, &amp;C'', discusses the legend and takes Ptolemy's map as evidence of the existence of an area of lost land in Cardigan Bay. Ashton also includes a conjectural map of Cantre'r Gwaelod within the bay.&lt;ref name=ashton&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashton|first=William|title=The Evolution of a Coast-Line, Barrow to Aberystwyth and the Isle of Man, with Notes on Lost Towns, Submarine Discoveries, &amp;C|publisher=Edward Stanford Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-176-60264-9|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7161480M/The_evolution_of_a_coast-line|chapter=31. The Lost Cantref Gwaelod}} ([https://archive.org/stream/evolutionofcoast00ashtrich#page/256/mode/2up/search/Cantref-y-Gwaelod map illustration on page 257])&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantre'r Gwaelod is also featured in modern [[children's literature]]. Cantre'r Gwaelod is central to the setting of the 1977 [[Newbery Medal|Newbery Honor]] Book ''[[A String in the Harp]]'' by [[Nancy Bond]].  The kingdom also plays a major role in ''Silver on the Tree'', the last book of ''[[The Dark Is Rising Sequence|The Dark Is Rising]]'' by [[Susan Cooper]], parts of which are set in [[Aberdyfi]]. Siân Lewis and Jackie Morris's book ''Cities in the Sea'' (2002) retells the legend for children,&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Siân Lewis &amp; Jackie|title=Cities in the sea|year=2002|publisher=Pont|location=Llandysul|isbn=1-84323-172-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Welsh musician [[Cerys Matthews]]'s first children's book ''Tales from the Deep'' (2011) features a story, ''The Ghost Bells of the Lowlands'', which was adapted from the legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod.&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite news|title=Cerys Matthews writes children's book of Welsh legends|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13271364|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and art===
[[File:St Peter's Church and Terrace Road Aberdyfi - geograph.org.uk - 1005740.jpg|thumb|right|The bells of St Peter's, Aberdyfi can play ''Clychau Aberdyfi'']]
The [[Folk music|folk song]] "Clychau Aberdyfi" ("[[The Bells of Aberdovey (song)|The Bells of Aberdovey]]"), popularised in the 18th Century, relates to the part of the legend about the bells being heard ringing beneath the waves in the town of [[Aberdyfi]]. This song inspired cultural projects in the town involving bells; a new [[Chime (bell instrument)|chime of bells]] was installed in September 1936 in the tower St Peter's Church, Aberdyfi, specifically designed to allow the playing of ''The Bells of Aberdovey''.&lt;ref name=stpeters&gt;{{cite web|title=About us |url=http://ten-wolde.net/stpeters/page2.html |work=St Peter's Church website |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091115/http://ten-wolde.net/stpeters/page2.html |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[Installation art|art installation]] by the sculptor Marcus Vergette, a bronze "Time and Tide Bell", was mounted beneath the jetty in Aberdyfi Harbour in July 2011 as a homage to the folk song. The bell is rung by the action of water at high tide.&lt;ref name=bbc-bells&gt;{{cite news|title=New bell rings as the tide rises in Aberdyfi, Gwynedd|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14131599|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vergette&gt;{{cite web|title=Time and Tide Bell|url=http://www.marcusvergette.co.uk/bell.htm|work=Marcus Vergette official website|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
An episode of the [[BBC]] [[CBeebies]] programme ''[[Telly Tales]]'', first broadcast in 2009, featured a children's re-enactment of the legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod through a mixture of animation and live action.&lt;ref name="tellytales"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantre'r Gwaelod featured in the BBC documentary series ''[[Coast (TV series)|Coast]]''. Presenter [[Neil Oliver]] visited the sands of Aberdyfi and [[Ynyslas]], near [[Borth]], and examined the remains of the submerged forest and Sarn Badrig which are revealed at low tide, assisted by local historians and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]].&lt;ref name="coast"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Cardigan Bay to the Dee |series=Coast |network=BBC |airdate=2005 |seriesno=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=submerged/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5048">The '''Central Asian northern desert''' is an [[ecoregion]] in the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]], located in the [[Central Asia]]n countries of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. The annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|100|to|150|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, the winters are cold at {{convert|-10|to|-15|°C|°F}} and the summers hot at around {{convert|25|°C|°F}}. There are a range of habitat types including salt flats, clay desert, rocky desert and some sand desert. The vegetation consists of scanty xeric shrubs including ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' and ''[[Salsola]]''. The fauna is varied, as well as mammals and birds, there are a large number of reptiles and many species of invertebrate. Some protected areas are included in this [[ecoregion]] but other parts are being [[environmental degradation|degraded]] by conversion to [[farmland]], [[overgrazing]] and [[poaching]].

==Setting==
The Central Asian northern desert occupies southern Kazakhstan and most of Uzbekistan, and largely corresponds with the desert known as the [[Kyzyl Kum]]. This ecoregion experiences a typical [[cold desert climate]]; January mean temperatures range from {{convert|-10|°C|°F}} to {{convert|-15|°C|°F}}, while July means range from {{convert|24|°C|°F}} to {{convert|26|°C|°F}}. On average, precipitation ranges from {{convert|100|mm|in}} to {{convert|150|mm|in}} annually. The topography of this ecoregion is varied, featuring salty "''[[solonchak]]''" deserts with a great number of [[Dry lake|salt flats]], clay deserts, rocky deserts, and a small area of sandy desert in the southern portion of the region.

==Flora==
The vegetation of this ecoregion is dominated by [[shrub]]s and semi-shrubs, with a variety of different species adapted to the different soil types found in it. Clay deserts support communities of ''[[Anabasis salsa]]'', ''[[Salsola]] orientalis'', and the ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' species ''A. terrae albae'', ''A. turanica'', and ''A. gurganica''. The stony deserts support mainly ''[[Salsola]] arbusculae formis'' and ''[[Nanophyton]] erinaceum'', while the "''solonchaks''" support the semi-shrubs ''[[Ceratoides]] papposa'', ''Artemisia terrae albae''', var. ''massagetovii'', ''A. santolina'', and ''A. songarica'', shrubs such as ''[[Calligonum]] aphyllum'', ''[[Ephedra]] lomatolepis'' as well as grasses such as ''[[Agropyron]] fragile''.

==Fauna==
Mammals of the Central Asian northern desert include the [[long-eared hedgehog]] (''Hemiechinus auritus''),  [[Tolai hare]] (''lepus tolai''), various species of [[gerbil]] and [[jerboa]], [[saiga antelope]] (''Saiga tatarica''), [[steppe polecat]] (''Mustela eversmanni''), [[goitered gazelle]] (''Gazella subgutturosa ''), [[onager]] (''Equus hemonius'') and suslik (''[[Spermophilus]] spp.'').

Birds of this ecoregion include [[wheatear]]s (''Oenanthe isabellina'', ''O. deserti''), [[Asian desert warbler|desert warbler]] (''Sylvia nana''), [[brown-necked raven]] (''Corvus ruficollis''), the endangered [[houbara bustard]] (''Chlamydotis undulata''), [[black-bellied sandgrouse]] (''Pterocles orientalis''), [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), [[steppe eagle]] (''Aquila rapax''), [[Egyptian vulture]] (''Neophron percnopterus''), and the [[saker falcon]] (''Falco cherrug'').

Numerous reptiles can be found in this ecoregion, including numerous ''[[Agama (genus)|Agama]]'' lizards, Rustamov's skink gekko (''Teratoscincus scincus rustamovi''), Chernov's snake-lizard (''Ophimorus chernovi''), Ferghana sand lizard (''Eremias scripta pherganensis''), [[desert monitor]] (''Varanus griseus'') and the Central Asian cobra (''[[Naja oxiana]]'').

The [[invertebrate]] fauna of this ecoregion is quite rich, especially in the sandy deserts, supporting a variety of [[grasshopper]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s.

==Conservation status and threats==
The conservation status of this ecoregion is listed as "Vulnerable", and the main threats to its integrity are conversion of habitat to farmland, over-hunting and poaching and the use of plants for firewood and silk production. Protected areas include the [[Barsa-Kelmes Nature Reserve]] on an island in the [[Aral Sea]], the Kaplankyr reserve, the Ustyurt reserve, and the [[Altyn-Emel National Park]] in Kazakhstan.

In summer the influence of the North Pacific high-pressure system brings hot, humid weather with temperatures soaring as high as 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F) on occasion. In winter the city is topographically influenced by expanding [[Siberian High]]-pressure zones and prevailing west winds, temperatures dropping almost as low as -20&amp;nbsp;°C (-4&amp;nbsp;°F) in severe cold waves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/south-korea|title=Climate - South Korea|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The bitterly cold days tend to come in three-day cycles regulated by rising and falling pressure systems, during winter snowfall can cause frosty weather in the city. The most pleasant seasons, for most people in the city are spring and autumn, when azure blue skies and comfortable temperatures are regular. Most of Seoul's precipitation falls in the summer monsoon period between June and September, as a part of [[East Asian monsoon]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seoul.world-guides.com/seoul_weather.html Seoul Weather Forecast, Climate, When to Go: Weather in Seoul Area, South Korea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors==
Seoul has a wet and very humid climate during the summer season, with cold and dry weather during the winter season. Spring (although windy) and autumn are mild but are short in duration. These seasons are considered the best time to visit Seoul.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.koreaorbit.com/korea-travel/seoul-south-korea/general-information-seoul.html Korea: General Information about Seoul&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Siberian winds bring frosty weather with sporadic snowfall in the city, which takes the average temperature down to 0 to -10 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://frayadventures.blogspot.com/2010/12/siberian-windsahhh.html Fray Adventures: Siberian Winds Ahhh!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Asian Dust]] is a seasonal meteorological phenomenon which affects much of East Asia including [[South Korea]] sporadically during the springtime months. The dust storms also affect wildlife particularly hard, destroying crops, habitat, and toxic metals interfering with [[reproduction]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/climate.htm DPRK Climate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The East Asian monsoon brings heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during a short rainy season called ''[[East Asian rainy season|jangma]]'', from the end of June through the end of July&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldkeyeducation.com/GKE/Weather.html|title=South Korea Weather|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Typhoon season occurs from July through September. About once each year, a typhoon passes very close to or moves over Korea, causing heavy showers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Seasonal climate==
As a [[temperate climate]], Seoul has winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons. The [[monsoon]] season and [[typhoon]]s also occurs in the summer season.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Winter===
The winter in Seoul is controlled by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitation. The amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air has been over the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls (falls very much) during the winter. Frequently the weather is cloudless, clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4&amp;nbsp;°C (27&amp;nbsp;°F). January is the coldest month in Seoul, often with the lowest temperatures, almost always dropping below -10&amp;nbsp;°C (14&amp;nbsp;°F), and sometimes below -15&amp;nbsp;°C (5&amp;nbsp;°F).

===Summer===
During the summer, [[East Asian monsoon]] winds engulf the city and the warm, moisture laden air moving off the oceans clashes with the drier air to the north. These fronts oscillate back and forth across Korea during the summer months. The interior highlands disturb the winds, forcing them into a westerly/southwesterly direction. The majority of the annual precipitation falls between late June and the middle of September, with rains fully developing along the entire peninsula by mid-June. Seoul receives approximately 126&amp;nbsp;mm (5&amp;nbsp;in) of precipitation during the winter (December–March), but in July alone receives approximately 383&amp;nbsp;mm (14.3&amp;nbsp;in). July is the wettest month in the metropolis.

Thunderstorms usually occur about 2 to 5 days per month during this period. Summer precipitation in Seoul is as likely to occur at 0200 as at 1400. Humidity is very high and fog will develop whenever a cold air mass confronts this moisture laden air, often forming on cloudless days. The [[typhoon]] season occurs from July through September. About once each year, a typhoon will pass very close to or move over Korea, causing heavy showers. Strong winds are usually confined to islands and exposed coastal areas. Although winds might not pose a problem, the associated rainfall can cause significant flash flooding, a very real threat during the rainy season, especially in rough terrain. The mean temperature for Seoul in August is 25.7&amp;nbsp;°C (78&amp;nbsp;°F)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/kr/seoul/226081/july-weather/226081|title=July Weather|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autumn===
October is the transition month between the summer rainy season and the cold, dry winter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bemariekorea.com/autumn-in-seoul-korean-autumn-leaves/|title=Autumn In Seoul|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The predominantly tropical cloudy weather of the summer is replaced by cooler, drier, and less cloudy conditions. The primary weather producers during October are cold frontal systems from the Asian mainland. On the average, one frontal passage per week can be expected during the month. A typical frontal passage is proceeded by increasing middle and high cloudiness with light rain. Following the frontal passage, mostly clear skies can be expected for 3 or 4 days. During this clear period it is very likely for fog to form. [[Fog]] is especially prevalent in river valleys and in low-lying areas.

'''Daan Viljoen Game Reserve''' is a [[game reserve]] near [[Windhoek]], [[Namibia]]. It is situated in the hill area of [[Khomas Hochland]].&lt;ref name="TonchiLindeke2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tonchi|first1=Victor L.|last2=Lindeke|first2=William A.|last3=Grotpeter|first3=John J.|title=Historical Dictionary of Namibia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VUkGQ6xfYkgC&amp;pg=PA69|date=31 August 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7990-4|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The park has many walking paths and allows tourists to travel around by themselves. The park is a good example of the [[wildlife of Namibia]]. It is named for [[Daniel Thomas du Plessis Viljoen]] (1892–1972), the [[South Africa]]n [[List of colonial governors of South West Africa|administrator of South West Africa]] from 1953 to 1963.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25078">{{Politics of Libya|administrative}}
There are twenty-two '''districts of [[Libya]]''', known by the term ''shabiyah'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] singular {{lang|ar|شعبية}} ''šaʿbiyya'', plural ''šaʿbiyyāt''). In the 1990s these replaced the older [[baladiyat]] system.

Historically the area of Libya was considered three provinces (or states), [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest, [[Cyrenaica]] in the east, and [[Fezzan]] in the southwest.  It was the conquest by Italy in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] that united them in a single political unit. Under the Italians Libya was eventually divided into four provinces and one territory: Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, Derna, (in the north) and the Territory of the Libyan Sahara (in the south).&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Chia-Lin (1949) "The Population of Libya" ''Population Studies,'' 3(1):  pp. 100–125, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; After the French and British occupied Libya in 1943, it was again split into three provinces: [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest, [[Cyrenaica]] in the east, and [[Fezzan-Ghadames]] in the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/histatlas/northafrica/libya19431951.gif "Map of Libya 1943–1951" ''Zentrale f&amp;uuml;r Unterrichtsmedien'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 176 of the [[Constitution of Libya (1951)|1951 constitution of Libya]] stated "The Kingdom of Libya shall be divided into administrative units in conformity with the law to be promulgated in this connection. Local and regional councils may be formed in the Kingdom. The extent of these units shall be determined by law which shall likewise organize these Councils." in exact quote.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

After independence (1951), Libya was divided into three [[Governorates of Libya|governorates]] (''[[muhafazah|muhafazat]]''), matching the three provinces of before, but in 1963 it was divided into ten governorates. In 1983 a new system was introduced dividing the country into forty-six districts (''[[baladiyat]]''). In 1987 this was reduced to twenty-five districts.

On 2 August 1995, Libya reorganized into thirteen districts (''[[shabiyah|shabiyat]]''). In 1998 this was increased to 26 shabiyat districts. In 2001 it was increased to thirty-two districts plus three administrative regions.  Finally in 2007 it was reduced to twenty-two districts.

For historical evolution see also: [[Subdivisions of Libya]].

Libyan districts are further subdivided into [[Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)|Basic People's Congresses]] which act as [[township]]s or [[borough]]s.

==Districts (''Shabiya'')==
''Shabiyah'' ({{Lang-ar|شعبية}}  ''šaʿbiyyah'', plural:  {{lang|ar| شعبيات}} ''šaʿbiyyāt'')  is a [[neologism]] exclusive to [[Libya under Gaddafi]],  in line with exclusive terms for republic ([[jamahiriya]]), ministry (amanah) and embassy (people's-bureau).
The term basically means a district, that is, a top level administrative division. Etymologically, it is an adjective meaning "of or pertaining to the people, popular".

=== 22 districts (2007) ===
In 2007 the current twenty-two districts (''shabiya'') replaced the older thirty-two district system.&lt;ref name="GPCO-shabiya"&gt;[http://gpco.gov.ly/online/shabyat.php ''شعبيات الجماهيرية العظمى''{{spaced ndash}}Sha'biyat of Great Jamahiriya] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220000000/http://gpco.gov.ly/online/shabyat.php |date=December 20, 2008 }}, accessed 10 May 2009, in Arabic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;:{{cite web|url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/libya.aspx|title=Libya population statistics|publisher=Geohive|accessdate=30 October 2009|language=English, Arabic|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015051855/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/libya.aspx|archivedate=15 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statoids"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statoids.com/uly.html|title=Districts of Libya|publisher=Statoids.com|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===26 districts (1998)===
In 1998 Libya was reorganized into twenty-six districts which were: Butnan, Jafara, Jufra, Kufra, Marj, Murqub, Quba, Al Wahat, Bani Walid, Benghazi, Derna, Gharyan, Jabal al Akhdar, Murzuq, Misrata, Nalut, Nuqat al Khams, Sabha, Sabrata/Sorman, Sirte, Tarhuna/Msalata, Tripoli, Wadi al Hayaa, Wadi al Shatii, Yafran, and Zawiya&lt;ref&gt;"Libya" ''2006 Statesman's Yearbook''&lt;/ref&gt;

===13 districts (1995)===
On 2 August 1995 Libya dropped the baladiyat system and reorganized into thirteen districts (''shabiyat'').  Among them were Butnan (formerly Tobruk), Jabal al Akhdar, Jabal al Gharbi, Zawiya, Benghazi, and Tripoli.  However, there is not agreement about the other seven names.&lt;ref name="statoids"/&gt;

==Former ''baladiya'' {{anchor|Baladiyat}} ==
''[[Baladiyah]]'' (singular) or ''baladiyat'' (plural), are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words used in many Arab countries to denote administrative divisions of the country. In Libya, the baladiyat system of districts was introduced in 1983 to replace the governorate system.  Originally there were forty-six baladiyat districts,&lt;ref name="statoids"/&gt; but in 1988 that number was reduced to twenty-five baladiyat. The table hereunder lists the old twenty-five baladiyat in alphabetical order with a link to each one and numbered to be located on the map. Note that each district linked may be both a baladiyah and a shabiyah. The many changes may not always be reflected in the article.

For 1988, name is provided if different from nowadays. As said above, AR stands for the three "Administrative Region" of 2001.

Fazzan wasn't strictly a district, but a historical [[muhafazah]] or [[wilayah]] along with [[Tripolitania]] (capital [[Tripoli]]) and [[Cyrenaica]] (capital [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] -near nowadays [[Shahhat]]- with [[Diocletian]], moved to [[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]] after the [[365 Crete earthquake|earthquake of 365]], and to [[Barca (ancient city)|Barce]] -nowadays [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]]- with [[Omer Bin Khattab]] in 643).

'''Driptech Inc.''' is a company engaged in making of irrigation-equipment, a type of [[drip irrigation]] method. The company won awards for its innovative, low cost drip irrigation system, eliminating expensive and complex emitters used by traditional drip irrigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/article1103190.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Driptech launches new low-cost drip irrigation systems | date=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is based out of Mountain View, California.

==History==
[[File:Frykman+Four+-+main.jpg|left|thumb|Company founder Peter Frykman has a working model of his Driptech system in his California office.]]
In the spring of 2008, three [[Stanford University]] graduate students from the schools of business, engineering, and design joined forces in a course called Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability. The team traveled to Ethiopia to see where they could apply their talents to help, arriving in the middle of the worst drought Ethiopia had experienced in 20 years. The farmers they met had no means to grow crops with the scarce water resources available. The drip irrigation products that were locally available were too expensive for most farmers and seldom worked properly. These farmers needed better, less costly, more effective ways to use their meager water supplies efficiently.

The team returned to the Stanford [[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]] ("d.school") and invented a new manufacturing technology that makes clean, consistent holes in super-low-cost plastic tubing. The resulting product works better and more reliably than the competition at 2-5x less cost. With this success, mechanical engineer Peter Frykman put his plan to get an engineering Ph.D. on hold and incorporated Driptech to manufacture and sell drip irrigation tubing for developing markets across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.driptech.com/aboutus/ourstory.html Driptech | About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703951704576092010276714424 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Justin | last=Lahart | title=For Small Businesses, Big World Beckons | date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The company has operations in India and China. In India, it supplies equipment for small farmers in [[Karnataka]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] through the distribution network of [[Godrej Agrovet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-14/hubli/28355949_1_drip-irrigation-driptech-marginal-farmers | work=The Times Of India | title=Low-cost drip irrigation system to help ryots | date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Gaussian grid''' is used in the [[earth science]]s as a gridded horizontal coordinate system for [[scientific modeling]] on a [[sphere]] (i.e., the approximate [[shape]] of the [[Earth]]). The grid is rectangular, with a set number of [[orthogonal coordinates]] (usually [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]). 

The gridpoints along each latitude (or ''parallel''), i.e., the longitudes, are ''equally'' spaced. Thus, at each latitude, the distance between any two adjacent degrees of longitude is the same. However the gridpoints along each longitude (or ''meridian''), i.e., the latitudes, are ''unequally'' spaced: the distance between adjacent degrees of latitude will vary. Instead, spacing of latitudes is defined by [[Gaussian quadrature]]. By contrast, in the "normal" geographic [[Geographic_coordinate_system#Geographic_latitude_and_longitude|latitude-longitude grid]], gridpoints are equally spaced along both latitudes and longitudes. Gaussian grids also have no grid points at the [[geographical pole|poles]]. 

In a ''regular'' Gaussian grid, the number of gridpoints along the longitudes is constant, usually double the number along the latitudes. In a ''reduced'' (or ''thinned'') Gaussian grid, the number of gridpoints in the rows decreases towards the poles, which keeps the gridpoint separation approximately constant across the sphere.

'''Geography of Bankura district''' refers to the geography of the present [[Bankura district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]].

Bankura is one of the districts of [[Burdwan division]]. It is situated between 22° 38’ and 23° 38’ north latitude and between 86° 36’ and 87° 46’ east longitude. It has an area of {{convert|6788|km²}}&lt;ref name= omalley1&gt;O’Malley, L.S.S., ICS, ''Bankura'', Bengal District Gazetteers, pp. 1-20, first published 1908, 1995 reprint, Government of West Bengal&lt;/ref&gt; On the north and north-east the district is bounded by [[Bardhaman district]], from which it is separated by the [[Damodar River]]. On the south-east it is bounded by [[Hooghly district]], on the south by [[Paschim Medinipur district]] and on the west by [[Purulia district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://bankura.gov.in/Location/location.htm
| title=Bankura, West Bengal |work= Location and extent| publisher=District administration | accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configuration==
[[File:Joypur Jungle Road.JPG|thumb|Joypur jungle]]
Bankura district has been described as the “connecting link between the [[Ganges Delta|plains of Bengal]] on the east and [[Chota Nagpur plateau]] on the west.” The areas to the east and north-east are low lying [[Alluvium|alluvial]] plains, similar to predominating rice lands of Bengal. To the west the surface gradually rises, giving way to undulating country, interspersed with rocky hillocks. Much of the country is covered with jungles.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

The area consists of two different tracts.  The western portion marks the gradual descent from the table land of Chota Nagpur to the delta of lower Bengal, consisting largely of [[Spur (mountain)|spurs]] projecting from the western tableland and of low swelling ridges. However, there is no marked ridge of hills. In the central portion of the district there are rolling downs eventually merging with the alluvial plains.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

The western part of the district has poor, [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] soil and hard beds of [[laterite]] with scrub jungles and ''sal'' ([[Shorea robusta]]) woods. Long broken ridges with irregular patches of more recent alluvium have marks of seasonal cultivation.  During the long dry season large extents of [[Ultisols|red soil]] with hardly any trees lend the country a scorched and dreary appearance. In the eastern part the eye constantly rests on wide expanses of rice fields, green in the rains but parched and dry in summer.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

==Hills==
[[File:Susunia.jpg|Susunia hills|thumb]]
The hills of the district consist of outliers of the Chota Nagpur plateau and only two are of any great height &amp;ndash; [[Biharinath]] and [[Susunia]]. While the former rises to a height of {{convert|448|m}}, the latter attains a height of {{convert|440|m}}. There are a number of low hills in the [[Saltora]] area. There are small hills, e.g. the Mejia hill rising to a mere {{convert|60|m}} from the base or the Karo hill, halfway between [[Mejia (community development block)|Mejia]] and [[Bankura]], rising a little higher to about {{convert|120|m}}. To the south, in the police station areas of [[Khatra]] and [[Raipur, Bankura|Raipur]] there are picturesque low hills, locally called Masaker Pahar.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

==Rivers==
The rivers of the area flow from the north-east to the south-west in courses roughly parallel to one another. They are mostly hill streams, originating in the hills in the west. The rivers come down in floods after heavy rains and subside as rapidly as they rise. In summer, their sand beds are almost always dry.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

[[Damodar River]] forms the northern boundary of the district with Bardhaman district for about {{convert|72|km}} and then flows into Bardhaman district. Floods in the Damodar rarely do much damage to the district. [[Sali River, Bengal|Sali River]] which drains the northern part of the district is an important tributary of the Damodar.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

Amongst the other rivers flowing through the district, the most important is [[Dwarakeswar River]]. It has many branches or old beds in [[Onda (community development block)|Onda]] and [[Bishnupur (Bankura)|Bishnupur]] police station areas. The main tributaries of Dwarakeswar River are the [[Gandheswari River|Gandheswari]], the Kukhra, and the Birai. Other major rivers are [[Shilabati River]] and [[Kangsabati River]], both of which enter the district from Purulia district, run along a short course in the territory and then enter [[Paschim Medinipur district]]. Gandheswari River is a tributary of Dwarakeswar River and flows in Bankura district. Flowing south-west of Susunia Hill and north of Bankura it joins the Dwarakeswar near Bhutsahar.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt; It is subject to sudden flooding during rains. There are some small but picturesque water falls along the course of the Shilabati near Harmasra, and along the course of the Kangsabati in the Raipur area. Amongst the minor rivers in the district are Jaypanda, a tributary of Shilabati, and Bhairabbanki.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

Mejia Beel is a large swamp formed by the overflow of the Damodar. There are several small tanks or artificial lakes developed by the former rajas, in and around Bishnupur.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

===River projects===
[[Kangsabati Project]] was started during the [[Five-year plans of India#Second Plan (1956-1961)|second five-year plan]] period (1956–1961). The dam across the Kangsabati has a length of {{convert|10098|m}} and a height of {{convert|38|m}}. Apart from this dam there are two pick up barrages in the Shilabati and the Bhairabbanki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.abasar.net/bk_main.asp?what=B00053| title= Sankhipta Bharatkosh| work= | publisher= abasar.net| accessdate= 2009-06-15| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024419/http://www.abasar.net/bk_main.asp?what=B00053| archivedate= 2007-09-27| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a proposal for the construction of a dam across the Dwarakeswar. The preliminary project report on Dwarakeswar Gandheswari Reservoir was received in Central Water Commission in January, 2004 for which ‘in- principle’ consent of Central Water Commission for preparation of detailed Project Report has been conveyed to the State Government in March, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The greater portion of the district consists of a rolling country covered by laterite and alluvium. While [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or [[gneiss]]ose rocks are found to the extreme west, to the east there is a wide plain of recent alluvium. Strong massive runs of [[Hornblende|hornblendic]] varieties stretch across the region in tolerably continuous lines, the general strike being nearly east and west.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

The most characteristic geological feature of the district is the area of laterite and associated rocks of sand and gravel. At some places one finds hard beds of laterite. At other places it is decomposed and reorganised. Locally, the ferruginous rock is called ''kankar''. The calcareous concretions, commonly used as the sources of lime, are known as ''ghutin''.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

The [[Gondwana]] system is represented in the northern portion of the district, south of the Damodar, between Mejia and Biharinath Hill. The beds covered with alluvium contains seams of coal belonging to the Raniganj system.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

==Climate==
The climate, especially in the upland tracts to the west, is much drier than in eastern or southern Bengal. From the beginning of March to early June, when the [[monsoon]] sets in, hot westerly winds prevail, the thermometer in the shade rising to around {{convert|45|C}}. The westerly winds die down around sunset and allow cool winds to blow from the south. [[Nor'wester (Bangladesh)|Nor'westers]] are frequent during this period and help to mitigate the excessive heat.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

The monsoon months, June to September, are comparatively pleasant, as the weather is not as sultry as in other parts of Bengal.  The total average rainfall is {{convert|1400|mm}}, the bulk of the rain coming in the months of June to September.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

Winters are pleasant with temperatures dropping down to below {{convert|27|C}} in December.&lt;ref name= omalley1/&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The district comprises three subdivisions: [[Bankura Sadar subdivision|Bankura Sadar]], [[Khatra subdivision|Khatra]] and [[Bishnupur subdivision|Bishnupur]]. Bankura Sadar subdivision consists of [[Bankura]] municipality and eight community development blocs: Bankura&amp;nbsp;— I, Bankura&amp;nbsp;— II, Barjora, Chhatna, Gangajalghati, Mejia, Onda and Shaltora. Khatra subdivision consists of eight community development blocs: Indpur, Khatra, Hirbandh, Raipur, Sarenga, Ranibandh, Simlapal and Taldangra. Bishnupur subdivision consists of [[Bishnupur (Bankura)|Bishnupur]] and [[Sonamukhi]] municipalities and six community development blocks: Indas, Joypur, Patrasayar, Kotulpur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur.&lt;ref name=blocdir&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=February 25, 2009 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankura is the district headquarters. There are 21 police stations, 22 development blocks, 3 municipalities, 190 [[gram panchayat]]s and 5187 villages in this district.&lt;ref name=blocdir/&gt;&lt;ref name=adminsetup&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than municipality area, each subdivision contains community development blocs which in turn are divided into rural areas and census towns. In total there are 5 urban units: 3 municipalities and 2 [[census town]]s.&lt;ref name=adminsetup/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7093">The '''geology of [[Uganda]]''' formed beginning in the [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] eons of the [[Precambrian]], and much of the country is underlain by [[gneiss]], [[argillite]] and other [[metamorphic rock]]s that are sometimes over 2.5 billion years old. [[Sedimentary rock]]s and new [[igneous rock|igneous]] and metamorphic units formed throughout the Proterozoic and the region was partially affected by the [[Pan-African orogeny]] and [[Snowball Earth]] events. Through the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]], ancient [[basement rock]] has weathered into water-bearing [[saprolite]] and the region has experienced periods of [[volcanism]] and [[rift valley]] formation. The [[East Africa Rift]] gives rise to thick, more geologically recent [[sedimentary structures|sediment sequences]] and the country's numerous lakes. Uganda has extensive natural resources, particularly gold. 

==Stratigraphy and geologic history==
The oldest rocks in Uganda date to the [[Archean]] and are more than 2.5 billion years old, forming a [[gneiss]] and [[granulite]] complex in the north and center of the country. The [[Watian Group]] rocks in the West Nile region date to the [[Mesoarchean]], 2.9 billion years ago and metamorphosed to [[granulite]] grade on the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]]. Other rocks, similar to the Watian Group form enclaves within gneiss sequences in the Karamoja District. 

These Archean rock formations tend to also include [[quartz]] [[diorite]], acid and intermediate granulites and less commonly, basic granulites. [[Aruan Group]] rocks overly the Watian Group in the West Nile area, with [[biotite]] gneiss, [[hornblende]] gneiss, [[migmatite]] and granitic gneiss and [[quartzites]].  [[Karamoja Gneiss Group]] rocks share a very similar lithology to the Aruan Group, along with the eastern West Nile [[Mirian Group]], although this group has experienced intense [[isoclinal]] folding.&lt;ref name=schluter&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|264}}

The [[Neoarchean]] is represented by [[rhyolites]], [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], [[tuff]] and [[basalt]] in the Nyanzian System, close to the Kenya border and in southeast Uganda.{{r|schluter|page=264}}

===Proterozoic (2.5 billion – 541 million years ago)===
The [[Ruwenzori Fold Belt]] (also known as the Buganda-Toro System) dates to the [[Paleoproterozoic]] and covers much of western and south-central Uganda. The fold belt is mainly [[argillite]], with thick [[amphibolite]] in the Jinja area and basal [[arenite]] in some locations. Parts of the belt are grantized, with low-grade [[phyllite]] close to [[Lake Victoria]]. Overall, the metamorphic grade tends to decrease southwards. The Ruwenzori Fold Belt includes the Igara Schist [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]] and [[mica]] [[schist]], as well as the sandstones, [[slate]] and phyllite of the Bwamba Pass Series and the Kilembe Series. 

The [[Kibaran orogeny]] impacted the region in the [[Mesoproterozoic]], forming the arenites, argillites, siltstones and metacalcareous rocks of Karagwe-Ankole Belt, which unconformably overlies the Buganda-Toro System in the southwest. The [[Madi Series]] in northwest Uganda may date to a similar time period, but its age remains poorly understood. 

The [[Neoproterozoic]] [[Bunyoro Series]] a 160-kilometer section of central Uganda, built on a bottom unit of [[tillite]], likely related to the [[Snowball Earth]] glacial deposits from the period. The unmetamorphosed, [[molasse]] related [[Singo Series]] and [[Mityana Series]] of the Bukoban System are common in the west-central parts of the country. [[Karasuk Group]] rocks including gneiss, [[amphibolite]], marble, quartzite and ultramafic rocks form a 200- by 40-kilometer strip near the Kenyan border, related to the Neoproterozoic [[Pan-African orogeny]].

===Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago – present)===
During the [[Paleozoic]], between 541 and 251 million years ago, the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], including Uganda, joined with [[Euramerica]] to form the new supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. A large rift valley formed in southern Pangaea spanning southern Africa and southern South America and filled with sediments, depositing the [[Karoo Supergroup]], the most extensive stratigraphic unit in Africa. Compared with neighboring countries, Uganda has comparatively few Karoo rocks. Down-faulted outliers are situated beneath [[Entebbe]], Dagusi Island and Bugiri. 

Throughout the late [[Mesozoic]] into the [[Cenozoic]], Uganda experienced the regional effects of the [[East Africa Rift]], which caused deep layers of sediments—often laden with fossils--to accumulate as sedimentary rocks in rift valleys. In the [[Miocene]], volcanic activity near the Kenyan border created the mountains in the Karamoja region. [[Carbonatite]] ring complexes formed due to the regionally unique geochemistry.{{r|schluter|page=264}}

==Structural geology &amp; Tectonics==
Structurally, the geology of Uganda is strongly influenced by fold belts and shear zones, as well as the [[East Africa Rift]] related crustal downwarping in the [[Pleistocene]] that formed [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Aswa Shear Zone]] is one example of several [[Neoproterozoic]] shear zones in Precambrian rocks, running for 300 kilometers on a northwestern trend. 

The East Africa Rift defines the western border of Uganda with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rift is occupied by [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]], along with the horst block of the [[Ruwenzori Mountains]]. Modern sediment depths in the Rift Valley are believed by 1.8 to 4 kilometers. Although volcanoes are no longer active in Uganda, the country has some remnant hot springs.{{r|schluter|page=265}}

==Hydrogeology==
Unconsolidated and unconfined fluvial aquifers, with an average water table depth of 20 meters are common along rivers in Uganda. However, most of the country is underlain by igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock from the Precambrian. Water in these semi-confined units occurs five to 20 meters below ground, either in weathered [[saprolite]] or fractures in the rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Uganda|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Uganda#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Because of long-running, intense weathering, Uganda has deposits of gold, [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], tin, rare earth elements and [[apatite]]. Gold has been mined from quartz vein and alluvial deposits near Busia, hosted in an Archean greenstone belt, and occurs in Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic metasediments at Buhweju and Kigezi. Exploration in the Buhweju-Mashonga area, indicates that artisanal gold mining is taking place in [[laterite]] gravels, overlying [[kaolin]] bedrock.{{r|schluter|page=265}}

[[Image:The-Decapolis-map.svg|right|thumb|200px|Map of Roman Israel showing Gadara and Gerasa]]

'''Gergesa''', also '''Gergasa''' or the '''Country of the Gergesenes''', is a place on the eastern ([[Golan Heights]]) side of the [[Sea of Galilee]] located at some distance to the ancient [[Decapolis]] cities of [[Umm Qais|Gadara]] and [[Jerash|Gerasa]]. It is mentioned in some ancient manuscripts of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] as the place where the [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|Miracle of the Swine]] took place, an [[exorcism]] performed by [[Jesus]] who drove [[demons]] out of two possessed men and into a herd of [[pigs]]. All three [[Synoptic Gospels]] mention this miracle, but only [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] writes about two possessed men instead of just one, and only some manuscripts of his Gospel name the location as Gergesa, while the other copies, as well as all versions of Luke and Mark, mention either Gadara or Gerasa (see {{Bibleref2|Mark 5:1-20, Luke 8:26-39, Matthew 8:28-34}}). 

Some are of the opinion that Gergesa was the country of the ancient [[Girgashites]]; but it is more probable that 'Gergesenes' was introduced by [[Origen]] upon mere conjecture; as before him most copies seem to have read 'Gadarenes', agreeable to the [[parallel passage]]s and the ancient [[Peshitta|Syriac version]]. In any event, the "country of the Gergesenes/Gadarenes/Gerasenes" in the [[New Testament]] Gospels refers to some location on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The name is derived from either a lakeside village, Gergesa, the next larger city, Gadara, or the best-known city in the region, Gerasa.

==Interpretations==
''Gergesenes'' means "those who come from pilgrimage or fight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Roswell D. |last=Hitchcock |authorlink=Roswell Dwight Hitchcock |year=1869 |title=Gergesenes |url=http://www.studylight.org/dic/hbn/view.cgi?number=T898 |accessdate=2009-01-24 |encyclopedia=An Interpreting Dictionary of Scripture Proper Names |location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Testament manuscripts refer to the "Country of the Gadarenes" or "Gerasenes" rather than the Gergesenes. Both Gerasa and Gadara were cities to the east of the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan. They were both [[Gentile]] cities filled with citizens who were culturally more Greek than Semitic; this would account for the pigs in the biblical account. Gerasa and Gadara are accounted for in historical accounts (by writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Josephus]]) and by archaeological research. Today they are the modern towns of [[Jerash]] and [[Umm Qais]].

A third city, [[Hippos]], was similar in character to Gadara and Gerasa, and it may fit the biblical account even better. It was located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, whereas Gerasa and Gadara were several kilometers south-east of it. Hippos, Gerasa, and Gadara were all counted in the Decapolis, an informal grouping of [[Greco-Roman]] cities just south of the ancient city of  [[Caesarea Philippi]].

==Identification with Kursi==
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Christian [[monk]]s venerated a site situated a few kilometres north of Hippos on the lake shore, as the location of the miracle. It is the only place fitting Matthew's description, since it contains the only "steep bank" in the area descending all the way to the shore of the lake. The site became apparently known since at least the [[Muslim history in Palestine|Early Muslim period]] as Kursya,&lt;ref name="Jol"&gt;Harry M. Jol, Gloria I. López, Haim Cohen, Michal Artzy, ''Initial GPR explorations near the ancient anchorage of Kursi, Sea Of Galilee, Israel'', 2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia (19–22 October 2014), Paper No. 95-8. Retrieved 30 June 2016 [https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2014AM/webprogram/Paper250661.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Aramaic]] word for "chair", and later as [[wikt:kursi|Kursi]], a word with the same meaning in [[Arabic]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Sumerian'', in ''Languages of Iraq, Ancient and Modern'', British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2007, p. 12 [http://www.bisi.ac.uk/sites/bisi.localhost/files/Postgate_Languages_of_Iraq.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The monks built a walled monastic complex there and made it a destination for Christian [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]]. That monastery was destroyed by [[Sassanid]] Persian armies in 614 CE, partially rebuilt, and finally levelled by the [[749 Galilee earthquake]]. The remains of the monastery can be visited in the [[Kursi, Golan Heights|Kursi National Park]]. Christian artifacts from Kursi can be viewed at the [[Golan Archaeological Museum]].

Several [[classical antiquity|classical]] authors place northern Tunisia's [[Phoenician colonies|colonization]] {{c.|1100}}{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} but modern archaeology has only found evidence suggestive of a date closer to {{c.|800}}{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. In either case, the settlement at Ghar el-Melh came to serve as Utica's chief port as the [[Medjerda River|Medjerda]] changed course and began silting up Utica's harbor.{{sfnp|Moore|1949|loc=[https://archive.org/details/L381LivyHistoryOfRomeVIII2830/page/n587 "Utica and Carthage"]}} Its [[Punic language|Punic]] name Rus Eshmun meant "Cape [[Eshmun]]", after the Punic name for Cape Farina.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=82}}{{sfnp|Bonnet|2005}}

[[Scipio Africanus]] landed nearby, took the town, and pillaged the surrounding countryside in 204{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} ahead of [[Siege of Utica (204 BC)|his siege of Utica]] during the [[Second Punic War]]. A naval battle ending in Roman victory was fought off the town's coast the next year, ahead of [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] and the end of the war.&lt;ref name=livy/&gt;

===Roman city===
The port fell under [[Roman Republic|Roman rule]] along with the rest of the [[Carthaginian Empire]] during the course of the [[Punic Wars]]. It sometimes preserved its former name{{mdash}}[[latinization of names|latinized]] as Rusucmona{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=82}}{{sfnp|Bonnet|2005}}&lt;ref name=livy&gt;{{harvp|Moore|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/L381LivyHistoryOfRomeVIII2830/page/n415 415]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}but also came to be known as {{nowrap|Castra Lalia}}{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=82}} or Delia,&lt;ref name=imperium&gt;{{citation |contribution=Ghar El Melh (Porto Farina) |contribution-url=http://imperium.ahlfeldt.se/places/28166.html |title=Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire |date=2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably after [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]]'s friend and lieutenant [[Gaius Laelius|G. Laelius]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=82}} Its peninsula preserved an ancient and important [[Ancient Roman temples|temple]] to "[[Apollo]]", probably representing a continuation of the [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian]] worship of the [[healing god]] [[Eshmun]] [[Interpretatio graeca|harmonized with the Greco-Roman pantheon]].{{sfnp|Bonnet|2005}} {{nowrap|Castra Delia}} held [[civitas|native city]] (''{{lang|la|civitas}}'') status&lt;ref&gt;R.B.

===Pirate base===
Much later, it became an important base for the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] corsairs. Following the [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunisia]] by [[Emperor Charles V|Charles{{nbsp}}V]] in 1534 and 1535, Spaniards tried to remove the pirates unsuccessfully. [[John of Austria]] also visited the bay during his [[Conquest of Tunis (1573)|reconquest of Tunis]] in October of 1573, following his [[Battle of Lepanto|victory at Lepanto]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=83}}

The [[Italians|Italian]] [[Christian converts to Islam|convert]], [[Ottoman corsairs|Ottoman corsair]], and [[Dey of Tunis|Tunisian dey]] [[Usta Murad]] expanded the city{{mdash}}then known as Porto{{nbsp}}Farina{{mdash}}greatly enough to consider it a second founding.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=83}} He established fortifications to prevent the harbor's use by Christian powers and attracted [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|refugee Moriscos]] by the provision of certain liberties at Porto Farina, [[Rafraf]], and [[Ras el-Djebel]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=83}} During this era, it rivaled the size and importance of [[Bizerte]].

In early 1655, an [[Commonwealth of England|English]] fleet under [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] [[blockade]]d nine warships in Porto Farina's harbor in order to pressure the [[Dey of Tunis|dey]] [[Mustafa Laz]]{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=85}} to free Englishmen held as [[slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]] and to provide compensation for English ships recently seized by local pirates. The dey offered to provide a new treaty going forward but refused emancipation or compensation for people and ships already taken. Any such action, he felt, should begin with the English, one of whose captains had recently sold a company of Tunisian troops as [[galley slaves]] to the [[Knights of Malta]] instead of transporting them to [[Smyrna]] (present-day Izmir) as arranged. When Blake maintained his blockade, the dey had his warships' rigging removed, the town's fortifications strengthened, and its garrison increased. On April 14, 1655, Blake [[Action of 14 April 1655|finally attacked]]. Dividing his fleet to attack the warships and the 20-[[cannon|gun]] fort simultaneously, he had his men storm and burn the warships in turn before declaring victory and leaving the harbor. Because his sustained assault was able to silence the town's defenses entirely, the engagement is celebrated as the first successful naval attack on shore-based fortifications.{{sfnp|Plant|2010}}

The port and its defenses were then quickly rebuilt. The [[Ottoman Empire]] erected [[Borj el-Loutani]] as a fort in 1659;{{sfnp|Morant &amp; al.|2014|p=209}} Fort Nadur and the "Genovese fort" were also raised around the same time.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=85}} Borj el-Loutani was later used as an [[artillery]] base and as a prison;{{sfnp|Morant &amp; al.|2014|p=209}} the others gradually fell into disrepair. The town began to be used by British and [[Malta|Maltese]] [[privateer]]s, as well as Turkish and local corsairs.

[[Muhammad Talak]] and [[Ali Bey of Tunis|Ali Bey]] were arrested and strangled in Porto Farina in 1682 as part of the chaotic struggles of the later [[Muradid dynasty]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=85}} Shortly afterward, three ships arriving from Turkey proper infected the town with the [[bubonic plague|plague]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=86}}

When [[Husain ibn Ali of Tunis|Husain I]] took advantage of [[Ibrahim Sharif of Tunis|Ibrahim Sharif]]'s Algerian imprisonment to usurp control of [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunisia]] in 1705, the Algerians released Sharif to return home. Husain, intent upon consolidating his power, had Sharif killed en route at Porto Farina. The former dey's tomb lies beside one of the town's forts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ibn Abi Dhiaf |title=Présent des Hommes de Notre Temps: Chroniques des Rois de Tunis et du Pacte Fondamental |volume=Vol. II |publisher=Maison Tunisienne de l'Édition |location=Tunis |date=1990 |p=115 }}. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=87}} Husain established an arsenal at Porto Farina two years later.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=87}}

Locals were calling the town Ghar el-Melh (recorded by a visiting Frenchman as "'''Gramela'''") by 1724.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=88}} [[Kingdom of France|French]] annoyance at [[Barbary pirates|piracy in the area]] prompted {{nowrap|[[Louis XV]]}} to order an attack in 1770 by [[Jean-Joseph de Rafélis de Broves|Admiral de Broves]], commanding a squadron consisting of 2 warships (bearing 74 and 50 [[cannon|guns]] respectively), 2 [[frigate]]s (24 guns each), a [[Barque|bark]] (18 guns), 2 [[schooner]]s, a [[Fluyt|flute]], and some other ships provided by [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Malta]]. The ships fired on Porto Farina for two days.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=89}} De Brove's fleet also attacked [[Bizerte]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=E.J.

Similarly, when [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] took exception to [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunisia]]n-based piracy in the early 1780s, its leaders [[Venetian bombardments of the Beylik of Tunis (1784–1788)|ordered a series of bombardments]] that included an attack by [[Angelo Emo|Admiral Emo]]'s fleet on Porto Farina on September 6, 1784.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=89}} This seems, however, to have been the last time a foreign fleet bothered the port; by 1806, it was only a winter port for the bey's warships and it was necessary to take special measures each voyage to get them over the harbor's rising [[sandbar]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=89}}

The beylik's arsenal was finally removed in 1818, but fear that a similar fate might befall its navy as [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|had Algeria's]] caused the bey to hire [[dredger]]s and workers to improve conditions.; he was again able to bring his fleet into the harbor by December.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=90}} When a severe storm destroyed the beylik's fleet at anchor off [[La Goulette]] on February 7 &amp; 8, 1821, however, such efforts were discontinued and the sandbar off Porto Farina was allowed to continue to grow.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=90}}

===Modern town===
In 1834 a large private arsenal belonging to a Maltese pirate exploded and destroyed part of the town. [[Ahmed Bey]], the last [[Bey]] of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], decided to clamp down on piracy and attempted to turn the port over to legitimate trade.&lt;ref name=marge/&gt; In 1837, he began efforts to restore the town's arsenal. Although that never proved feasible, the bey established a palace in the city and an attendant garrison.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=90}} Command was given to a favorite of the bey's, the general [[Salah Cheboul]].{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=91}} The forts were renovated, and the port cleaned and maintained.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=90}} From 1840, a community of [[Maltese people|Maltese]], [[Italians]], and [[French people|French]] settled in the locality.&lt;ref name=marge&gt;{{citation |first=Margaret Ames |last=Alexander |author2=Cécile Dulière |author3=Saïda Besrour |author4=Mongi Ennaïfer |contribution=Sheet 7: Region of Ghar el Melh (Porto Farina) |title=Archaeological Atlas of Tunisia |publisher=National Institute of Archeology and Art |location=Tunis |date=1973 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1853, however, the beylik's new frigates could no longer access the harbor and the garrison was reduced.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|p=91}}

In the early years of [[French Tunisia|Tunisia's French occupation]], the [[Bizerte Port Company]] ({{lang-fr|Compagnie du Port de Bizerte}}) made an attempt to again dredge access to Porto Farina's harbor but a storm from the northeast closed the channel almost immediately after its opening and further attempts were abandoned. The formerly prosperous town's public buildings had already fallen into disrepair and were thoroughly scavenged by locals for other purposes.{{sfnp|Molinier|1909|pp=91–2}} The prison, which was listed as a Tunisian Historic Monument in 1922, closed in 1964.{{sfnp|Morant &amp; al.|2014|p=209}} Today Ghar el-Melh is a small farming town.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/citizen59/ Ghar El-Melh's photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giovanni Lorenzo d'Anania''' or Gian Lorenzo d'Anania ({{lang-la|Johannes Laurentius Anania}}, 1545–1609) was an Italian geographer and theologian.

== Biography ==
Little is known for certain of d'Anania's life; even his dates of birth and death are uncertain. He was born in [[Taverna, Calabria|Taverna]], a city in the [[province of Catanzaro]] in [[Sila Piccola]]. He later studied natural science, languages and theology, probably in [[Naples]]. He certainly lived there for a few years and served as the teacher of the [[Archbishop of Naples|Archbishop]] Mario Carafa. At Carafa's death on 11 September 1575, d'Anania returned to Taverna where he remained until his death (between 1607 and 1609).

During d'Anania's stay in Naples, he published his most famous work, ''L'Universale fabbrica del Mondo, ovvero Cosmografia'' (1573), a [[geography|geographical]] work which consists of a preface and four volumes that provide a picture of geographical knowledge in the second half of the 16th century. A new, second edition was prepared in Venice in 1576, in which d'Anania supplemented physical geography, with history and anthropology, as well as information religious faiths.&lt;ref&gt;''L' vniuersale fabrica del mondo, ouero Cosmografia di M Gio. Lorenzo d'Anania, diuisa in quattro Trattati: ne' quali distintamente si misura il Cielo, e la Terra, &amp; si descriuono particolarmente le Prouincie, Città, Castella, Monti, Mari, Laghi, Fiumi, &amp; Fonti. Et si tratta delle Leggi, &amp; Costumi di molti Popoli : de gli Alberi, &amp; dell'Herbe, e d'altre cose pretiose, &amp; Medicinali, &amp; de gl'inuentori di tutte le cose, Di nuouo posta in luce, Con privilegio, In Venetia'' : ad instanza di Aniello San Vito di Napoli, 1576 ([https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PP1&amp;id=hDM8AAAAcAAJ on-line])&lt;/ref&gt; The longest volume of the four treatises is the first, dedicated to Europe (the regions are discussed in this order: [[Ireland]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]], [[Reno (river)|Reno]] and [[Holland]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Italy]], [[Slavonia]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Raška (region)|Raška]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Greece]], [[Poland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and the [[Arctic]]); while the remaining three treatises cover [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[West Indies]].

D'Anania also authored a theological work titled ''De natura daemonum'', first published in [[Venice]] in 1570. In it, d'Anania posits the existence of [[demon]]s, malevolent beings behind the works of [[astrology|astrologers]] and [[necromancy|necromancers]] and who are responsible for any diseases which can be cured by the [[intercession of saints]]. ''De natura daemonum'' saw many editions, including that produced by [[Aldus Manutius]].&lt;ref&gt;''De natura daemonum Io. Laurentii Ananiae tabernatis theologi, libri quatuor. Quorum I. Agit de origine &amp; differentia daemonum. II. De eorundem in homines potestate. III. De his, quae daemones per se operantur in nobis. IV. De his, quae hominum auxilio peragunt. Quae omnia tum exemplis, tum rationibus philosophicis, ac theologicis comprobantur''. Venice: Aldus Manutius, 1589 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ofky1zwwCbAC&amp;printsec=frontcover on-line])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1654 Gian Lorenzo's nephew, Marcello Anania, prepared an edition titled ''De substantiis separatis'', which contained the previously unpublished ''De natura Angelorum''.&lt;ref&gt;''De substantiis separatis, Opusculum primum De natura daemonum et occultis eorum operationibus; Opusculum secundum De natura angelorum et occultis eorum operationibus''. Roma: typis Iacobi Dragondelli, 1654&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Grotte}}
[[File:Bischofferode Grotte01.jpg|thumb|294x294px|A Marian grotto in [[Bischofferode]], [[Germany]]]]
A '''grotto''' (Italian ''grotta'' and French ''grotte'') is a natural or artificial [[cave]] used by humans in both modern times and antiquity, and historically or prehistorically. Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually flooded or liable to flood at [[high tide]]. Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as [[garden feature]]s. The ''[[Blue Grotto (Capri)|Grotta Azzurra]]'' at [[Capri]] and the grotto at the villa of [[Tiberius]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.

Whether in tidal water or high up in hills, grottoes are generally made up of [[limestone]] [[geology]], where the acidity of standing water has [[Solvation|dissolved]] the [[carbonate]]s in the [[rock matrix]] as it passes through what were originally small fissures.{{cn|date=June 2018}} See [[karst topography]], [[cavern]].
{{Wiktionary|grotto}}

==Etymology==
The word "grotto" comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''grotta'', [[Vulgar Latin]] grupta, and [[Latin]] crypta (a [[crypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' "grotto".&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also related by a historical accident to the word "grotesque". In the late 15th century, Romans accidentally unearthed [[Nero]]'s ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' on the [[Palatine Hill]], a series of rooms, decorated with designs of garlands, slender architectural framework, foliage, and animals. The rooms had sunk underground over time. The Romans who discovered this historical monument found it very strange, partly because it was uncovered from an "underworld" source. This led the Romans of that era to give it the name ''grottesca'', from which came the French ''[[grotesque]]''.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Taq-e Bostan - view of two grottoes.jpg|thumb|upright|Two vaulted grottoes called [[Taq-e Bostan]], located in Iran, [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] era]]
Grottoes were very popular in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture. Spring-fed grottoes were a feature of Apollo's oracles at [[Delphi]], [[Corinth]], and [[Clarus]].&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Elderkin, "The Natural and the Artificial Grotto", ''Hesperia'' '''10'''.2 (April – June 1941), pp. 125–137, gives numerous well-known ancient Greek examples, natural and architectural, with some details of their sites.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] city of [[Rhodes]] was designed with rock-cut artificial grottoes incorporated into the city, made to look natural.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Rice, "Grottoes on the Acropolis of Hellenistic Rhodes", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''90''' (1995), pp. 383–404.&lt;/ref&gt; At the great Roman sanctuary of [[Palestrina|Praeneste]] south of Rome, the oldest portion of the primitive sanctuary was situated on the second lowest terrace, in a grotto in the natural rock where a spring developed into a well. According to tradition, Praeneste's sacred spring had a native [[nymph]], who was honored in a grotto-like watery [[nymphaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R.A. van Aken, "Some Aspects of Nymphaea in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia" ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]'', Fourth Series, '''4'''.3/4 (1951), pp. 272–284&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiberius]], the Roman emperor, filled his grotto with sculptures to create a sense of mythology, perhaps channeling [[Polyphemus]]' cave in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The [[numinous]] quality of the grotto is still more ancient: in a grotto near [[Knossos]] in Crete, [[Eileithyia]] was venerated, even before [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-building. Even farther back in time, the [[immanence]] of the divine in a grotto is seen in the sacred caves of [[Lascaux]].

== Garden grotto history and design ==
[[File:Villa torrigiani di lucca, scalinata.JPG|thumb|Grotto entrance, [[Villa Torrigiani]]]]

The popularity of artificial grottoes introduced the [[Mannerism|Mannerist style]] to Italian and French gardens of the mid-16th century. Two famous grottoes in the [[Boboli Gardens]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]] were begun by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] and completed by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati|Ammanati]] and [[Bernardo Buontalenti|Buontalenti]] between 1583 and 1593. One of these grottoes originally housed the ''Prisoners'' of [[Michelangelo]]. Before the Boboli grotto, a garden was laid out by [[Niccolò Tribolo]] at the Medici [[Niccolò Tribolo|Villa Castello]], near [[Florence]]. At [[Villa di Pratolino|Pratolino]], in spite of the dryness of the site, there was a Grotto of Cupid (surviving), with water tricks for the unsuspecting visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Webster Smith, "Pratolino", ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' '''20'''.4 (December 1961), pp. 155–168.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fonte di Fata Morgana]] ("Fata Morgana's Spring") at Grassina, not far from Florence, is a small garden building, built in 1573–4 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa "Riposo" (rest) of Bernardo Vecchietti. It is decorated with sculptures in the [[Giambologna]]n manner.

The outsides of garden grottoes are often designed to look like an enormous rock, a rustic porch or a rocky overhang. Inside, they are decorated as a temple or with fountains, [[stalactites]] and imitation gems and shells (sometimes made in ceramic); herms and mermaids, mythological subjects suited to the space; and [[naiad]]s, or river gods whose urns spilled water into pools.  Damp grottoes were cool places to retreat from the Italian sun, but they also became fashionable in the cool drizzle of the [[Île-de-France]]. In [[Kuskovo]] in the Sheremetev estate there is a Summer Grotto, built in 1775.

Grottoes could also serve as baths; an example of this is at the [[Palazzo del Te]], in the 'Casino della Grotta', where a small suite of intimate rooms is laid out around a grotto and ''loggetta'' (covered balcony). Courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.

Grottoes have also served as [[chapel]]s, or at [[Villa Farnese]] at Caprarola, a little theater designed in the grotto manner. They were often combined with cascading fountains in Renaissance gardens.

The grotto designed by [[Bernard Palissy]] for [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s château in [[Paris, France|Paris]], the [[Tuileries]], was renowned. There are also grottoes in the gardens designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] for [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. In England, an early garden grotto was built at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s, probably by [[Isaac de Caus]].

Grottoes were suitable for less formal gardens too. [[Pope's Grotto]], created by [[Alexander Pope]], is almost all that survives of one of the very first [[Landscape architecture|landscape gardens]] in England, at [[Twickenham]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Bracher, "Pope's Grotto: The Maze of Fancy Pope's Grotto: The Maze of Fancy", ''The Huntington Library Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (February 1949), pp. 141–162; Anthony Beckles Willson, "Alexander Pope's Grotto in Twickenham", ''Garden History'' '''26'''.1 (Summer, 1998), pp. 31–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope was inspired after seeing grottoes in Italy during a visit there. Efforts are under way to restore his grotto.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/11866157/Inside-Alexander-Popes-hidden-grotto.html] Lambert, Victoria. “Inside Alexander Pope's hidden grotto”. The Telegraph.  September 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There are grottoes in the landscape gardens of [[Painshill Park]],&lt;ref&gt;Alison Hodges, "Painshill, Cobham, Surrey: The Grotto", ''Garden History'' '''3'''.2 (Spring 1975), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stowe Landscape Garden|Stowe]], [[Clandon Park]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;James Turner, "The Structure of Henry Hoare's Stourhead", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''61'''.1 (March 1979), pp. 68–77; Malcolm Kelsall, "The Iconography of Stourhead", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''46'''(1983), pp. 133–143; Kenneth Woodbridge, "Henry Hoare's Paradise," ''The Art Bulletin'' '''47'''.1 (March 1965), pp. 83–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's Grotto is a series of interconnected chambers, extending 67&amp;nbsp;ft (20 metres) into the chalk hillside on the outskirts of [[Ware, Hertfordshire]]. Built during the late 18th century, the chambers and tunnels are lined with shells, flints and pieces of coloured glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scotts-grotto.org/CMS/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513215354/http://scotts-grotto.org/CMS/index.php |archivedate=2005-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic generation of tourists might not actually visit [[Fingal's Cave]], on the remote isle of [[Staffa]] in the Scottish [[Hebrides]], but they have often heard of it, perhaps through [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s "[[Hebrides Overture]]", better known as "[[Hebrides Overture|Fingal's Cave]]", which was inspired by his visit. In the 19th century, when miniature [[Matterhorn]]s and rock-gardens became fashionable, a grotto was often found, such as at [[Ascott House]]. In Bavaria, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig]]'s [[Linderhof]] contains an abstraction of the grotto under Venusberg, which figured in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''.

Although grottoes have largely fallen from fashion since the British [[Picturesque]] movement, architects and artists occasionally try to redefine the grotto in contemporary design works. Such examples include Aranda/Lasch's ''Grotto Concept,'' (2005), Callum Moreton's ''Grotto'' pavilion (2010), ARM's post-modern ''Storey Hall'' (1995), and [[Frederick Kiesler]]'s ''Grotto of Meditation for New Harmony'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alderslade, Jessica| title=An Introduction to the Grotto and Its Place within Contemporary Design|work=  Reinterpreting the Grotto in Contemporary Design|location= Australia, |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious grottoes ==

[[File:Gua Maria Gereja Santa.jpg|thumb|Modern Marian grotto at a church in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]
Today, artificial grottoes are purchased and built for ornamental and devotional purposes. They are often used as [[shrine]]s in which to place statues of saints, particularly the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], in outdoor gardens.

Many [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] visit a grotto where [[Bernadette Soubirous]] claimed she saw apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Numerous garden shrines are modelled after these apparitions. They can commonly be found displayed in gardens and [[church architecture|churches]], among other places (see [[Lourdes grotto]]).

'''[[Joseph Conrad]]''' (born '''Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski'''; [[Berdychiv]], [[Ukraine]], 3 December 1857&amp;nbsp; – 3 August 1924, [[Bishopsbourne]], [[Kent]], [[England]]) was a [[Poles|Polish]] author who wrote in [[English language|English]] after settling in England.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In a 14 February 1901 letter to his namesake Józef Korzeniowski, a librarian at [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]], Conrad wrote, partly in reference to some Poles' accusation that he had deserted the Polish cause by writing in English:  "It is widely known that I am a Pole and that Józef Konrad are my [given] names, the latter being used by me as a [[surname]] so that foreign mouths should not distort my real surname—a distortion which I cannot stand.  It does not seem to me that I have been unfaithful to my country by having proved to the English that a gentleman from the [[Ukraine]] can be as good a sailor as they, and has something to tell them in their own language."  [[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', pp. 311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as one of the greatest writers in English,&lt;ref name="encyclo_bio"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133148/Joseph-Conrad "Joseph Conrad"]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties, and always with a marked Polish accent.  Before embarking on his writing career, he had a career sailing in the French, then the British [[merchant marine]]; of his 19-year merchant-marine career, about half that time was spent actually at sea.

Conrad wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent [[universe]].  He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Rudyard Kipling]] felt that "with a pen in his hand he was first amongst us" but that there was nothing English in Conrad's mentality:  "When I am reading him, I always have the impression that I am reading an excellent translation of a foreign author."  Cited in Jeffrey Meyers, ''Joseph Conrad:  A Biography'', p. 209.  Cf. [[Zdzisław Najder]]'s similar observation:  "He was... an English writer who grew up in other linguistic and cultural environments.  His work can be seen as located in the borderland of ''auto-translation'' [emphasis added by Wikipedia]."  [[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; tragic sensibility into English literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466681/Poland "Poland."] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. &lt;/ref&gt;  He is viewed as a precursor of [[modernist literature]]; his narrative style and [[anti-heroic]] characters have influenced many authors up to the present.  Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad's stories and novels.

Writing in the heyday of the [[British Empire]], Conrad drew on his Polish heritage and on his personal experiences in the [[Merchant navy|French]] and [[British Merchant Navy|British merchant navies]], to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world, while plumbing the depths of the human soul.

==French voyages==
Arriving in [[Marseille]] in 1874, the not quite 17-year-old [[Joseph Conrad]] was to have been looked after by a Pole who sailed in French ships, but the sailor was temporarily away and ship pilots became Conrad's first instructors in sailing. He grew to love the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], "the cradle of sailing."&lt;ref name="najder"&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]], Z. (2007) ''Joseph Conrad: A Life''. Camden House. {{ISBN|978-1-57113-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}  Conrad, who became a  professional sailor, never learned to swim.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;  
[[File:Saint-Pierre (Martinique) avec Montage Pelée.JPG|thumb|[[Saint-Pierre, Martinique]]]]

After two months at Marseilles, on 15 December 1874 Conrad, just turned seventeen, began his first sea voyage—as a passenger in a small [[barque]], the ''Mont-Blanc'', which reached [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique]], in the [[Caribbean]], on 6 February 1875.  During the ship's return passage to Marseilles (31 March – 23 May) he may have been a crew member.  His objectives for this maiden voyage were probably to promote his health and give him a closer look at sailors' work.  A month later, on 25 June, he again left in the ''Mont-Blanc'', now as an apprentice, arriving at Saint-Pierre on 31 July.  After visiting several other Caribbean ports, the ship returned to France, arriving on 23 December at [[Le Havre]].&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|50–51}}

In 1875 Conrad spent seven months at sea.  This did not seem to have stirred his enthusiasm for the seaman's profession. He gave himself six months' rest from the sea, socializing and spending in excess of the generous allowance that he received from his maternal uncle, [[Tadeusz Bobrowski]].  The uncle indulged his nephew's financial demands but sent him lengthy letters of reproof that included his usual criticisms of Conrad's improvident paternal line.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|51–54}} &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Bobrowski, in his letters to Conrad, repeatedly emphasized the contrast between the reasonable and responsible Bobrowskis and the Korzeniowskis, whom he characterized as dreamers and wastrels—in the process, whitewashing his own family, which did not lack its own madcaps and rogues.  [[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad: a Life'', 2007, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 1876 Conrad sailed for the [[West Indies]] as a steward (at a salary of 35 francs, equivalent to one-fifth the allowance he received from his uncle) in the barque ''Saint-Antoine'', making [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]] on 18 August.  The [[first mate]] was a 42-year-old [[Corsica]]n, Dominique Cervoni, who would become a prototype for the title character of Conrad's ''[[Nostromo]]'': "In his eyes lurked a look of perfectly remorseless irony, as though he had been provided with an extremely experienced soul; and the slightest distension of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look of extraordinary boldness.  This was the only play of feature of which he seemed capable, being a Southerner of a concentrated, deliberate type."  The ''Saint-Antoine'', after visiting Martinique, St. Thomas and [[Haiti]], returned on 15 February 1877 to Marseilles.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|54–55}}

In his novel ''[[The Arrow of Gold]]'', Conrad alludes to smuggling "by sea of arms and ammunition to the Carlist detachments in the South [of Spain]."  This apparently involved Dominique Cervoni.  Conrad's first biographer, [[Georges Jean-Aubry]] (1882–1950), built on this allusion a tale about Cervoni and Conrad smuggling arms to a [[Central America]]n republic.  The pre-eminent Conrad chronicler and scholar [[Zdzisław Najder]] (born 1930) is skeptical about the story and surmises that Conrad "might have heard... stories [about gun-running] from the experienced Cervoni."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|55–56}}

In December 1877 it transpired that, as a foreigner and Russian subject, Conrad could not serve on French ships without permission from the Russian consul.  And since Conrad was liable for military service in Russia, there was no chance of obtaining the consul's consent.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|59}} In consultation with his uncle, "it was decided that he should join the English Merchant Marine where there are no such formalities as in France".&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|66}}

Conrad later described, in his [[essay]] collection ''The Mirror of the Sea'' (1906) and his novel ''[[The Arrow of Gold]]'' (1919), having, during his stay in Marseilles, smuggled arms to Spain for the [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos de Borbón y de Austria-Este]], pretender to the Spanish throne.  Najder finds this, for a variety of reasons, virtually impossible.  If Conrad did participate in running contraband to Spain, it likely would have involved something other than weapons.  But in the two books written three and four decades later, he embellished his memories, probably borrowing from past adventures of Marseilles friends.  To admit that his illicit activities had been conducted for profit would have conflicted with the position that he wished to occupy in literature.  And attempts to track down the reality behind his accounts are complicated by Conrad's habit of using some external characteristics, and often the names, of actual people but of furnishing them with different life histories (as in the cases of Almayer, Lingard, Jim, and Kurtz).&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|59–61}}   Najder writes:

{{blockquote|A careful reading of "The ''Tremolino''" and ''[[The Arrow of Gold]]'' reveals that the whole Carlist plot is a sideline, an ornament that does not affect the course of action; its only function seems to be to glamorize and idealize smuggling.  Two elements overlap in these books:  the author's own recollections, modified in many respects, of the years 1877 and 1878, and his knowledge of Carlist activities and supporters in 1874 through 1876; they may prove more authentic taken separately than taken together.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|60}}  }}

Another Marseilles legend concerns Conrad's great love affair.  The story is described only in ''[[The Arrow of Gold]]'', a pseudo-autobiographical novel whose chronology is at odds with the documented dates in Conrad's life.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|61–63}}

==British voyages==
On 10 June 1878 Konrad Korzeniowski set foot on English soil for the first time, at [[Lowestoft]], having arrived on the small British steamer ''Mavis'', which he had boarded on 24 April 1878 at Marseilles.  He had probably joined the ship not as a crew member but as an unofficial apprentice.  It is not clear whether he had been on board during the Russian leg of its itinerary, which would have been hazardous for the Tsar's Polish subject.  He still planned to return to France and enlist in the French navy.  A conflict with Captain Samuel William Pipe prompted Conrad to leave the ship.  He departed for London, where he quickly went through half his ready cash.  Appealing to his uncle, he received additional funds, along with a long letter exhorting him to "think for yourself and fend for yourself... don't idle; learn, and don't pretend to be a rich young gentleman....  If you have not secured yourself a position by the age of 24, do not count on the allowance...  I have no money for drones and I have no intention of working so that someone else may enjoy himself at my expense..."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|69–72}}

Conrad returned to Lowestoft and on 11 July 1878 signed on to a coastal coal schooner, the ''Skimmer of the Sea''.  He won popularity with the crew by bearing the cost of entertainment and treats, not paid out of his [[shilling]]-a-month [[ordinary seaman]]'s earnings (the lowest permissible) but out of his uncle's allowance, 160 times higher.  "In that craft I began to learn English from East Coast chaps, each built as though to last for ever, and coloured like a Christmas card."  Having made three voyages to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and back in the ''Skimmer'', after only 73 days, on 23 September, Conrad left the schooner.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|72–73}}

[[File:Gustave flaubert.jpg|thumb|left|French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s works would influence Conrad's own painstaking creations.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|196}}]]

On 15 October 1878, in his first genuine service at sea, Conrad sailed in the [[clipper ship]] ''Duke of Sutherland'' on his longest voyage till then, around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Australia]], arriving on 31 January 1879 at [[Sydney Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;Trove: [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13428513 Shipping – Arrivals January 31] ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' 1 February 1879. Accessed 25 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained knowledge of local conditions and even of the slang, revealed later in his short story "To-morrow".  It was then that he became acquainted with the works of [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], through ''[[Salammbô]]'', and read a one-volume edition of [[Shakespeare]].  In Sydney—Bobrowski wrote Buszczyński—Conrad met a captain famous for his knowledge of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].  The unnamed captain may have become a partial prototype of Tom Lingard in ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'', ''[[An Outcast of the Islands]]'' and ''[[The Rescue (Conrad novel)|The Rescue]]'', whose namesake Conrad never met.  The ''Duke of Sutherland'' left Sydney on 6 July 1879 on its homeward voyage, and Conrad arrived in London on 19 October.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|75–78}}

Having evidently for the moment lost desire for long-distance voyages, on 11 December 1879 Conrad enlisted as an [[able-bodied seaman]] in the iron steamer ''Europa''. The next day the ship departed for [[Genoa]], [[Naples]], [[Patras]] and [[Palermo]], returning to London on 29 January 1880.  Soon after, Conrad met George Fountaine Weare Hope, an ex-merchant-service officer, then director of a London commercial firm.  This was apparently Conrad's first close contact in England and it developed into a long-lasting friendship.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

Urged on by his uncle, Conrad applied to take the examination for [[second mate]] in the British Merchant Marine.  Applicants were required to document at least four years' service at sea.  In reality, he had served only seventeen months.  But, armed with a document from Delestang that amplified his period in French service, and giving augmented figures for his British service, he signed a declaration of his statements and of the enclosed documents, risking indictment in the event that the fraud were discovered.  He attended a cram course for the examination and passed it on 28 May 1880, aged 22.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|80–82}}

===Second mate===
On 21 August 1880 Conrad enlisted as [[third mate]] on an iron clipper ship, the ''[[loch Etive#Other usage|Loch Etive]]''.  The next day the ship left London, arriving in Sydney on 24 November.  The return voyage began on 11 January 1881.  In ''The Mirror of the Sea'' (1906) Conrad would give a story, of uncertain basis, relating to this voyage—the rescue of the crew of a Danish sailing ship.  The ''Loch Etive'' arrived in London on 25 April 1881.  There Conrad's allowance from his uncle awaited him:  46 pounds for six months—over twice his earnings on the ''Loch Etive''.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|83–85}}

While waiting to enlist for another voyage, Conrad again engaged in some kind of disastrous speculation, which cost him at least his entire half-yearly allowance.  This probably gave rise to a fantastic story, with which he regaled his uncle in a letter of 10 August 1881, about an accident aboard the clipper ''Annie Frost'' (with which Conrad had no link), loss of luggage, and several days spent in hospital.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|86–87}}

Conrad had trouble finding a berth as [[second mate]].  Eventually he signed on to a small, rickety old [[barque]], the ''Palestine'', for a voyage to [[Bangkok]] at pay of 4 pounds a month.  From 15 October 1881 uncle Bobrowski was to send him only half the previous allowance, rounded up to 50 pounds a year—slightly over his new, highest salary to date.  The ''Palestine'' was manned by three officers and ten hands and commanded by 57-year-old Captain Elijah Beard.  Conrad was not too pleased with his new appointment.  The ''Palestine'' left London on 21 September 1881 and, after a stop at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], sailed north on 28 September.  Due to gales, the passage to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] took 22 days.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|89–90}}

Conrad later described his adventures on the ''Palestine'', renamed ''Judea'', in his [[short story]] "[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth]]" (1898), which he was to call "a feat of memory" and "a record of experience."  Though he preserved the names of the captain and [[Chief mate|first officer]], and though the general course of events and many details correspond with the facts, as usual a number of things are creations of Conrad's imagination.  Thus, there is no documentary evidence of a collision with a steamship at Newcastle; the story's hero is four years younger than Conrad; there was only one attempt, not several, to leave [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], as the ship was continuously under repair; and there are other, more striking discrepancies.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|90}}

The ''Palestine'', carrying a cargo of coal, left Newcastle for Bangkok on 29 November 1881.  Crossing the [[English Channel]], she met strong gales, lost a mast, and started to leak.  On 24 December she returned to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], for repairs.  Conrad nevertheless decided to keep his berth, probably in order to obtain the certificate of service as [[Second Officer (nautical)|second officer]].&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|90–91}}

Finally after nine months, on 17 September 1882, after leaving London, the ''Palestine'' sailed from Falmouth for [[Bangkok]], [[Siam]] ([[Thailand]]).  Conrad was, for the first time, fully in charge of a four-man watch—an important step forward in an officer's advancement.  The ambiguous status of a novice second mate on a small barque such as the ''Palestine'' required him to be tough and strong-minded, especially in front of the sailors.  The passage was slow, uneventful, monotonous, until 11 March 1883, when, in the Bangka Strait between [[Sumatra]] and [[Bangka Island]], a smell resembling paraffin oil was noted.  Next day, smoke was discovered issuing from the coals; water was thrown on them.  On 13 March, four tons of coals were thrown overboard and more water poured down the hold.  On 14 March, the hatches not being battened down, the decks blew up fore and aft.  The vessel headed for the Sumatra shore, and the ''Somerset'' took it in tow.  The fire increased rapidly, and the ''Somerset'' declined to tow the barque on shore.  The vessel became a mass of fire, and the crew got off into three boats, which remained by the vessel until the morning of 15 March 1883.  That evening the boats arrived at [[Muntok]].&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|92–93}}

In his story "[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth]]", Conrad dramatized the accident, stretching it out in time and space and giving a different reason for parting with the towing steamer.  In the story, the parting seems very risky; in reality, the disaster took place near shore.  And the boats did not steer for [[Java]], to the east of Sumatra, but toward the port of Muntok on Bangka Island, off the east coast of Sumatra.  Indeed, [[Richard Curle]]'s 1922 identification of Muntok as the port where the story's hero experienced his first fascinating encounter with the exotic East revealed the story's greatest exaggeration: the boats could reach shore in some dozen hours, with no need to "knock about in an open boat" for "nights and days".  Conrad had also forgotten, after all those years, that he had three, not two, sailors with him in his boat.  But the most interesting discrepancy between story and reality consisted in Conrad's extolling the crew as "[[Liverpool]] hard cases", whereas in fact there was not a single Liverpudlian in the crew, and half were non-Britons.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|93–94}}

The ''Palestine''’s Irish [[Chief mate|first officer]], H. Mahon, described him to Conrad's friend George Fountaine Weare Hope as "'a capital chap,' a good Officer, the best Second Mate he had ever shipped with."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|94}}  Conrad officially signed off the ''Palestine'' on 3 April 1883.  While he looked in vain for a job that would enable him to sail back to Europe, he explored [[Singapore]]'s harbor district, which would be the scene for many of his pages.  Eventually he returned to England as a passenger on a steamer, reaching London by the end of May.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|95}}

The 25-year-old Conrad and his uncle Bobrowski looked forward to a repeatedly postponed meeting, to take place in [[Kraków]]; nevertheless, Bobrowski again emphasized in a letter that it was important for Conrad to obtain his British [[naturalization]]:  "I should prefer to see your face a little later... as that of a free citizen of a free country, rather than earlier... as that of citizen of the world!...  It is really a matter of your looking after your own best interests."  In any case, the plans had to be changed due to the uncle's stomach troubles and rheumatism.  They finally met—for the first time in the five years since Conrad's 1878 suicide attempt in Marseilles—in July 1883 at [[Marienbad]] in [[Bohemia]]; then on 12 August they left for [[Teplice]], likewise in Bohemia, where Conrad stayed two more weeks.  Their meeting appears to have been pleasant. Bobrowski's correspondence became more affectionate and friendly, with fewer admonitions; the prevailing mood became one of intimate understanding.  Conrad's own letters from the period, to his uncle and to [[:pl:Stefan Buszczyński|Stefan Buszczyński]], in Najder's words, "allow... one to dispense with an occasionally advanced hypothesis that when [Konrad] left [Poland] he wanted to break once and for all with his Polish past."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|95–97}}

On 10 September 1883 Conrad signed on as second mate on the mainly Scandinavian-crewed British clipper ''Riversdale''.  The ship sailed from London on 13 September 1883, arriving on 6 April 1884 at [[Madras, India]].  There Captain McDonald, a Scot who kept the ship's officers at a distance and treated them "as machines, to be worked by himself when and as he pleased," suffered some kind of "attack" which Conrad described to the physician whom he fetched, as alcoholic inebriation.  After Captain McDonald learned from a friend, a steamer captain, how Conrad had represented his condition, on 15 April 1884 McDonald dismissed Conrad, with a less than satisfactory certificate, issued on 17 April 1884.  The episode seems to have subsequently inspired some of Conrad's scathing literary depictions of sea captains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/07/12/archives/conrads-writings-on-skippers-traced-to-sea-incident-of-1884.html?ref=josephconrad "Conrad's Writings on Skippers Traced to Sea Incident of 1884"]. ''[[New York Times]]'', 12 July 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Geoffrey Ursell, a critic writing in the London ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', compared the actual episode with Conrad's fiction works.  In ''[[The Mirror of the Sea]]'' Conrad wrote of a captain who "permitted no interference by his officers, nor dared they make any suggestions."  In ''[[Chance (Conrad novel)|Chance]]'' Conrad drew on McDonald's testimony that he had had his wife and family on board and did not have to "cultivate the mate's acquaintance."  Ursell pointed out the similarity between Conrad's description of the captain's sore and weak eyes in "The End of the Tether" and testimony that had been presented at Madras. Ursell added: "The similarities between this story and the facts of the ''Riversdale'' are unquestionable."&lt;/ref&gt;  A court of inquiry later judged McDonald responsible for the subsequent stranding of the ''Riversdale'', which would eventually enable Conrad to take his examination for [[chief mate|first mate]] (the Marine Board having initially delayed accepting his application, put off by McDonald's certificate).&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

Leaving the ''Riversdale'', Conrad took a train to [[Bombay]], where on 28 April he signed on as second mate of the clipper ''Narcissus'', immortalized 13 years later in the title of his first [[Nautical fiction|sea novel]], ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]'' (1897).  The ship sailed for London on 5 June 1884.  Thought to have been the original of the title Negro was Joseph Barron, aged 35, who died three weeks before the ship reached [[Dunkirk]].  Considering that Captain Archibald Duncan had had trouble with his crew only during the southbound passage—the return voyage was uneventful—Conrad seems to have incorporated into his novel the story of crew trouble heard from Duncan.  The ''Narcissus'' entered Dunkirk on 16 October 1884, and next day Conrad signed off.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|98–100}}

Having at last completed the required length of service, Conrad prepared for his [[chief mate|first officer]]'s examination.  He failed it on 17 November 1884 (he would give no hint of this in ''[[A Personal Record]]'', 1912) but, perhaps after coaching by a crammer, passed it on 3 December 1884—over four years after his examination for [[second mate]].&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|100–1}}

===First mate===
The years 1885–88 were marked by a fall in demand for new vessels, as the tonnage of individual ships grew; berths for officers fell with the number of ships.  The challenge for foreign officers was increased by Britons' resentment of the "invasion" of foreigners.  "The fact that Conrad always presented his relationship with his English superiors and employers as free of national conflict is no proof," writes Najder, "since he often smoothed out and retouched his past to render it more consistently positive..."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|101–02}}

Conrad searched nearly five months before, on 24 April 1885, in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[England]], finding a berth as second officer aboard the clipper ''Tilkhurst'', the largest sailing ship in which he served.  On 10 June the ship, with a cargo of coal, sailed from [[Penarth]], reaching [[Singapore]] on 22 September.  The crew once again was largely Scandinavian, and, exceptionally, only one crew member left the ship there.  Of the captain, Edwin John Blake, a physician's son, Conrad had the most positive recollections of all his commanders—"a singularly well-informed mind, the least sailor-like in outward aspect, but certainly one of the best seamen... it has been my good luck to serve under."  The unloading in Singapore ended on 19 October.  The ''Tilkhurst'' sailed to [[Calcutta]], arriving on 21 November.  After taking on a load of [[jute]], the ship began its homeward passage on 9 January 1886.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|102–03}}

During his stay in [[India]], 28-year-old Conrad had sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Joseph Spiridion's full name was "Joseph Spiridion Kliszczewski" but he used the abbreviated form, presumably from deference to British ignorance of Polish pronunciation.  Conrad seems to have picked up this idea from Spiridion:  in his fourth letter, he signed himself "J. Conrad"—the first recorded  use of his future [[pen name]].[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', pp. 103–04.&lt;/ref&gt;  a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at [[Cardiff]] in June 1885 just before the ''Tilkhurst'' sailed for Singapore.  These letters are Conrad's first preserved texts in English.  His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish [[syntax]] and [[phraseology]].  More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881–83.  He had departed from "hope for the future" and from the conceit of "sailing [ever] toward Poland", and from his [[Panslavism|Panslavic]] ideas.  He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge.  While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|104–05}}

Feeling "sick and tired of sailing about for little money and less consideration," Conrad sought Spiridion's advice about the feasibility of engaging in the [[whaling]] business—perhaps he hoped to obtain a loan for that purpose from Spiridion and his father.  Spiridion later told Jean-Aubry that he dissuaded his young friend from the enterprise.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|107–08}}

The ''Tilkhurst'' arrived in Dundee on 16 June 1886.  Conrad signed off the same day.  Two letters from uncle Bobrowski awaited him in London.  In one, the uncle wrote:  "I deduce from your and [Conrad's business associate Adolf] Krieger's letters [that] you intend to devote yourself to trade and stay in London."  He urged Conrad to first pass his ship master's examination and obtain British naturalization.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|108}}

On 28 July 1886 Conrad failed in his first attempt to pass the [[master mariner]]'s examination; he again never acknowledged this, to his uncle or to the reading public of his ''[[A Personal Record]]''. On 10 November, on the second attempt, he passed the master mariner's examination.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|108–11}}

===Master===
On 16 February 1887 he signed on as first mate of an iron [[barque]], the ''Highland Forest'', lying in port at [[Amsterdam]].  The ship had a crew of 18, including as many as 14 foreigners.  The captain was a 34-year-old Irishman, John McWhir (Conrad gave the same name, with an additional ''r'', to the much older master of the ''Nan-Shan'' in the 1902 novel ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]'').  The ''Highland Forest'' left Amsterdam on 18 February and ran into strong gales.  By Conrad's account, some [[Spar (sailing)|spar]]s were carried away, and a piece of one struck and injured him.  On 20 June the ship reached [[Semarang]], [[Java]], and Conrad signed off on 1 July.  Next day he boarded the steamship ''Celestial'', disembarking on 6 July at [[Singapore]], where he went for treatment to the European Hospital; Conrad would describe it in his 1900 novel ''Lord Jim'', whose hero had likewise been injured by a falling spar.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|112–15}}

The first mate of the SS ''Celestial'', which had brought Conrad to Singapore, was Frederick Havelock Brooksbank, son-in-law of the then well-known merchant and sailor William Lingard, prototype of Tom Lingard in ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'' (1895), ''[[An Outcast of the Islands]]'' (1896) and ''[[The Rescue (Conrad novel)|The Rescue]]'' (1920).  Conrad never met William Lingard but heard much about him, mainly from Lingard's nephews, James and Joshua Lingard.  It was probably through Brooksbank that Conrad met James Craig, master of the small steamer ''Vidar'', which made voyages between Singapore and small ports on [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]].  James (Jim) Lingard had been living for some years as a trading agent on Borneo, at Berau, on the [[Berau River]].  On 22 August 1887 Conrad sailed from Singapore in the ''Vidar'' as first mate; he made four voyages in her:  22 August – 26 September; 30 September – 31 October; 4 November – 1 December 1887; and the last, ending 2 January 1888.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|115–16}}

Apart from the six days at [[Muntok]] in 1883, this was Conrad's first opportunity to see the East up close.  The ''Vidar'' penetrated deep inland, steaming up the rivers.  Of the six ports of call, four lay in the country's interior, two as much as 30 miles from the sea.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|117}}

{{blockquote|Against the primeval natural background of lush, insatiable, and putrefying vegetation [writes Najder] the trading posts must have appeared either as foolish challenges to the invincible forces of the tropics, or as pathetic proof of the vanity of human endeavor.  [P]articularly grotesque must have been the impression made by white men, who, cut off from their own civilizations, often became alcoholics or hopeless cranks.  [F]our such men lived at [[Tanjung Redeb]] [on the Berau River, including the Englishman] James Lingard... and a Eurasian Dutchman, Charles William Olmeijer (or Ohlmeijer), who had lived there for seventeen years.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|117}} }}

Olmeijer, his name transcribed phonetically as "Almayer", became the protagonist of Conrad's first novel, ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'' (1895) and a hero of the second, ''[[An Outcast of the Islands]]'' (1896); he also appears in the autobiographical volume, ''[[A Personal Record]]'' (1912), where Conrad writes:  "If I had not got to know Almayer pretty well it is almost certain there would never have been a line of mine in print."  But as Jocelyn Baines observes, "This was paying Almayer too big a compliment because when someone is ready to write there will always be an Almayer to hand."  In reality, Conrad did not get to know Olmeijer well at all.  As he was to write in March 1917, "[W]e had no social shore connections.  [I]t isn't very practicable for a seaman."  A few days earlier, he had written his publisher:  "... I knew very little of and about shore-people.  I was chief mate of the S.S. ''Vidar'' and very busy whenever in harbour."  Neither the pathetic Almayer of ''A Personal Record'' nor the tragic Almayer of ''Almayer's Folly'' have much in common with the real Olmeijer.  Conrad used the names of people he met, and occasionally their external appearances, in his writings only as aids in creating a fictional world from his reminiscences, books that he had read, and his own imagination.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|116–18}}

On 4 January 1888, "J. Korzeniowski," just turned 30, signed off the ''Vidar'' at Singapore.  For two weeks, while waiting for a ship to Europe, he stayed at the Sailors' Home (for officers only), where he quarrelled with the steward, Phillips, an evangelist and temperance worker and an inspector of brothels—"in short," writes Najder, "a professional do-gooder."  Three decades later, Conrad described his stay in ''[[The Shadow Line]]'' (1917), a novel he termed "not a story really but exact autobiography"—a misleading description, writes Najder, as usual with Conrad's "autobiographical" pieces.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

[[File:Otago bark 1869.jpg|thumb|[[Barque]] ''Otago'', captained by Conrad in 1888 and first three months of 1889]]

On 19 January 1888, he was appointed captain of the [[barque]] ''Otago'' and left by steamer for [[Bangkok]], [[Siam]] ([[Thailand]]), where on 24 January he took up his first command.  The ''Otago'', the smallest vessel he had sailed in except for the coaster ''Vidar'', left Bangkok on 9 February.  After a three-day stop at Singapore, on 3 March it headed for [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], arriving on 7 May.  On 22 May, it left for [[Melbourne]]; arriving after a difficult and stormy passage, it stayed at anchor in the Melbourne roadstead till 8 June.  After taking on a load of wheat, it left for Sydney on 7 July.  Arriving five days later, it stayed until 7 August.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|122–26}}

The ''Otago'''s next voyage, with a cargo of fertilizer, soap and [[tallow]], was to [[Mauritius]], then a British possession east of [[Madagascar]] in the southwest [[Indian Ocean]].  The ship reached [[Port Louis]] on 30 September 1888, setting sail again for Melbourne on 21 November 1888 with a cargo of sugar, arriving on 5 January 1889.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|127–31}}  The ''Otago'' stayed close to the [[Australia]]n coast.  After being towed to [[Port Phillip Bay]] and visiting Port Minlacowie in [[Spencer Gulf]], the ''Otago'' sailed around the [[Yorke Peninsula]], arriving at [[Port Adelaide]] on 26 March 1889.  Soon after, Captain Korzeniowski gave up his command.  He was, Najder explains, "not a typical seaman...  [H]e did not regard his work at sea as permanent...  [A]bove all... he had exceptionally wide-ranging interests and cultural needs.  Once the first charm of commanding a ship faded, the future writer must have felt the dreariness of sailing in the [[Antipodes]]...  He must have been oppressed by a sense of being cut off from Europe, deprived of newspapers, books and current news.  Even the chances of improving his English were slight:  one of his officers in the ''Otago'' was a German and the other a Finn.  [T]he command of a small barque with a crew of nine could satisfy neither [Conrad's] ambitions nor his needs."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|131–33}}

Korzeniowski left Port Adelaide on 3 April as a passenger on the German steamer ''Nürnberg'' (listed as "Captain Conrad") and, passing through the [[Suez Canal]], disembarked on 14 May at [[Southampton, England]].&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|133}}

Conrad's success in the [[British Merchant Navy]] so far had been modest.  He had not been captain or first mate in a large vessel, nor had he worked for a firm of importance.  "His foreign origin and looks," writes Najder, "were no help to him."  Nor had he reached the highest rank in seamanship at the time (which would be discontinued a century later, in the 1990s), that of [[Master mariner#United Kingdom|Extra Master]], which required an additional examination.  For the time being, he lived on his savings and a modest income from his share in the firm of Baar, Moering &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|134}}

In the autumn of 1889 he began writing ''[[Almayer's Folly]]''.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|134}}

{{blockquote|[T]he son of a writer, praised by his [maternal] uncle [Tadeusz Bobrowski] for the beautiful style of his letters, the man who from the very first page showed a serious, professional approach to his work, presented his start on ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'' as a casual and non-binding incident...  [Y]et he must have felt a pronounced need to write.  Every page right from th[e] first one testifies that writing was not something he took up for amusement or to pass time.  Just the contrary:  it was a serious undertaking, supported by careful, diligent reading of the masters and aimed at shaping his own attitude to art and to reality.... [W]e do not know the sources of his artistic impulses and creative gifts.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|135}} }}

Conrad's later letters to literary friends show the attention that he devoted to analysis of style, to individual words and expressions, to the emotional tone of phrases, to the atmosphere created by language.  In this, Conrad in his own way followed the example of [[Gustave Flaubert]], notorious for searching days on end for ''[[mot juste|le mot juste]]''—for the right word to render the "essence of the matter."  [[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]] opines:  "[W]riting in a foreign language admits a greater temerity in tackling personally sensitive problems, for it leaves uncommitted the most spontaneous, deeper reaches of the psyche, and allows a greater distance in treating matters we would hardly dare approach in the language of our childhood.  As a rule it is easier both to swear and to analyze dispassionately in an acquired language."  Years later Conrad, when asked why he did not write in French, which he spoke fluently, would reply (puckishly?):  "Ah... to write French you have to know it.  English is so plastic—if you haven't got the word you can make it."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|136–37}}

With the chances of finding a new job in England seeming slender, Conrad made inquiries on the European Continent.  In the first half of November 1889 he traveled to [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], to meet [[Albert Thys]], the powerful deputy director of the ''Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo''.  Apparently the idea of working in Africa had occurred to Conrad for lack of something else; but it probably rekindled his old interest, recently revived by [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s expedition in search of [[Emin Pasha]].  Additionally, the work paid better than a command at sea.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|138}}

After Johannes Freiesleben, Danish master of the steamship ''Florida'', was murdered by Congo tribesmen on 29 January 1890, Conrad was appointed by Thys' company to take his place.  On 10 May 1890, at [[Bordeaux]], he boarded the SS ''Ville de Maceio'' to begin what Najder calls "the most traumatic journey of his life."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|144}}

After his November 1889 meeting with Thys, and before departing for the Congo, Conrad had again gone to Brussels, on 5 February 1890, where he made the acquaintance of a distant relative, Aleksander Poradowski, who had emigrated from Poland after the 1863 Uprising, and who died two days after Conrad's arrival.  Conrad's meeting with Poradowski's widow Marguerite, ''née'' Gachet, would prove an important event in his life.  His 42-year-old "aunt", daughter of a French historian who had settled in Belgium, was a writer whose translations from Polish, and her own fiction, mostly based on Polish and Ukrainian motifs, had been published since 1880 in the renowned ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]''.  For probably the first time since childhood, Conrad had come in direct contact with someone actively engaged in literature.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|139}}

A few days later Conrad had left for [[Warsaw]], arriving on 9 or 10 February and staying until 12 February.  Then he made a two-day visit to [[Lublin]] to see his relatives Aniela and Karol Zagórski.  On 16 February he was driven in a sleigh from Kalinówka railway station to Kazimierówka, visiting his uncle Bobrowski there till 18 April.  At social gatherings, Conrad put off some of the participants.  One of them recalled:  "He answered all questions with a strained politeness, he spoke with concentration and listened carefully but one could not fail to notice his extreme boredom.... He spoke with a hint of a foreign accent and occasional bursts of our characteristic borderland intonation."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|140–41}}  Najder interprets Conrad's demeanor:

{{blockquote|An inhabitant of London, the capital of the world's richest and most powerful country, comes to a village in the backwoods of... Ukraine.  He is a traveler who has seen a great deal and is... under contract with a huge company, which is supposed not only to profit from trade but also to civilize black Africa.  The traveler is a Pole, but without hope that his partitioned motherland will ever become free and unified; he is conscious... that in the modern prosperous and open world no one is interested in Polish affairs and very few even know where the country is, and he is aware that to be continually harping on wrongs, suffering, and oppression evokes, at best, pity mixed with repugnance.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|142}} }}

En route to the Congo, near [[Grand-Popo]], [[Benin]], Conrad saw a French [[man-of-war]], ''Le Seignelay'', shelling a native camp hidden in the jungle.  The incident would acquire symbolic import in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899).&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|148}}

On 12 June 1890 the ''Ville de Maceio'' reached [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]], 50 miles up from the [[Congo River]] estuary.  Next day Conrad boarded a small steamer for [[Matadi]], 30 miles farther up, and five miles below the last navigable point on the lower Congo River before rapids make it impassable for a long stretch upriver—the chief Congo seaport, founded as late as 1879 by [[Henry Morton Stanley]].  At Matadi Conrad was held up for 15 days and met [[Roger Casement]], who had already been working several years in the Congo.  The diary that Conrad kept uniquely for his first 67 days in the Congo&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The diary is one of Conrad's earliest known English texts.  Najder comments:  "Here and there are signs of French influence on the vocabulary, and Polish on the [[syntax]], showing that the future writer had not yet completely mastered English."  [[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad: a Life'', 2007, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that he thought very highly of Casement, the future author of a [[Casement Report|1904 report]] on atrocities perpetrated against the native Congolese population, for his own personal profit, by Belgium's King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]].&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|148–49}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Mark Twain]] would satirize Leopold's criminal malfeasance in his 1905 pamphlet, ''[[King Leopold's Soliloquy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|480–81}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;When Casement was later tried by the British in 1916 on charges of treason for supporting the Irish independence movement, Conrad hoped he would not be sentenced to death; but when Casement was condemned to hang, Conrad declined to join in the appeal for clemency signed by many English writers.  He later explained:  "Casement did not hesitate to accept honours, decorations and distinctions from the English Government while surreptitiously arranging various affairs that he was embroiled in.  In short:  he was plotting against those who trusted him."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|''Roi des Belges'', in which Conrad sailed up the [[Congo River]] (1890)]]

It was only on 28 June that Conrad could begin the tedious 230-mile overland trek to the port of [[Kinshasa]], which he completed on 2 August 1890.  The steamer ''Florida'', which he was to have commanded, had been seriously damaged and was unfit for sailing.  In any case, he could not have taken command immediately on an unfamiliar river; next day he boarded the river steamer ''Roi des Belges'' (King of the Belgians), commanded by a young Dane, Ludvig Rasmus Koch.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|151–54}}

The small, clumsy, noisy river steamer left Kinshasa on 3 August 1890, bound up the Congo River.  On the way, over a distance of more than 500 miles, Conrad spotted no more than six villages; later, says Najder, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' would "convincingly depict... the threatening atmosphere of isolation."  The country, formerly rich, had been entirely ruined by the effects of Belgian colonization.  One of the four company officials aboard the steamer was Alphonse Keyaerts, whose name Conrad would appropriate for the character Kayerts in his other African tale, "[[An Outpost of Progress]]" (1897).&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|156–57}}

On 1 September 1890 the steamer reached Stanley Falls (now [[Kisangani]]), then an important [[Congo Free State]] government center.  On 6 September, Conrad was appointed "to take over the command of the SS ''Roi des Belges''... until the recovery of Captain Koch."  This, writes Najder, "constitutes the only basis for Conrad's later claim of having commanded a 'steamer.'"  The ship probably left Stanley Falls back for Kinshasa on 7 or 8 September.  On board was Georges-Antoine Klein, a young Frenchman who had recently been appointed the company's commercial agent at Stanley Falls.  On 21 September, Klein, who had been ill with dysentery, died.  His name (later changed to "Kurtz") appears in the manuscript of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''; otherwise the Frenchman seems not to have had much in common with the novel's character.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|158–59}}

It is unknown whether or how long Conrad was in command of the ''Roi des Belges'' on the way to Kinshasa.  When the ship arrived at [[Bangala Station|Bangala]] on 15 September 1890, Captain Koch was already back in charge.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|159}}

Arriving back at Kinshasa on 24 September 1890, Conrad found a letter from Maria Bobrowska, in Poland—the daughter of his uncle [[Tadeusz Bobrowski]]'s brother, Kazimierz Bobrowski; and three letters from Marguerite Poradowska.  Conrad wrote Poradowska:

{{blockquote|I find everything repugnant here.  Men and things, but especially men.... The director is a common ivory-dealer with sordid instincts who imagines himself a merchant while in fact he is only a kind of African shopkeeper.  His name is [Camille] Delcommune.  He hates the English, and I am of course regarded as one.  While he is here I can hope for neither promotion nor a raise in salary.... I have no vessel to command....  [M]ost of all I regret having tied myself down for three years.  True, it is hardly likely that I shall last them out.  Either they will pick some groundless quarrel with me to send me home... or another attack of [[dysentery]] will send me back to Europe, if not into the other world, which would at last finally solve all my troubles!&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|159–61}} }}

[[Zdzisław Najder|Najder]] traces Conrad's conflicts with Delcommune and the other ''Société Anonyme Belge'' employees to the "sordid instincts" that motivated Delcommune and the company.  "'Unreliable' persons [such as] Korzeniowski... are not admitted to business."  Agents were paid high premiums for reducing the costs of obtaining rubber and ivory.  Massive deliveries were made compulsory; and punitive expeditions, by members of hostile tribes and cannibals, were sent against non-complying natives.  For the natives, the enforced deliveries often meant starvation, since they were left with no time to grow and harvest their crops.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

On 26 September 1890 Conrad left Kinshasa by canoe for Bamou, 30 miles down-river, to get wood cut for the construction of the local station.  There he fell ill with dysentery and fever.  On 19 October he wrote his uncle Bobrowski from Kinshasa that he was unwell and intended to return to Europe.  By 4 December he was back at [[Matadi]].  It is not known when and on what ship he returned to Europe.  In late January 1891 he appeared in Brussels; on 1 February he was in London.  His letters do not mention his recent experiences; he apparently wanted only to forget.  As would be suggested in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), Conrad was aware how close he had been to himself becoming one of the European despoilers of Africa.  His experiences there reinforced his mistrust of human nature.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|161–63}}

Conrad's African experience made him one of the fiercest critics of the "white man's mission."  It was also, writes Najder, his most daring and last "attempt to become... a cog in the mechanism of society.  By accepting the job in the trading company, he joined, for once in his life, an organized, large-scale group activity on land.... Until his death he remained a recluse... and never became involved with any institution or clearly defined group of people."&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|164–65}}

[[File:Torrens (ship, 1875) - NMM P6434.jpg|thumb|Passenger [[clipper ship]] ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|Torrens]]'', in which Conrad made two round trips as [[first mate]], from [[London]] to [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]], between 21 November 1891 and 26 July 1893]]

Conrad spent some months at loose ends and apparently depressed.  On 14 November 1891, he decided to step down in rank and accept a berth as [[first mate]] in the passenger [[clipper|clipper ship]] ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|Torrens]]''.  Seven days later the ship left London for Australia, on the way picking up passengers at Plymouth.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|166–7}}

It was possibly the finest ship ever launched (1875) from a [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] yard.  For fifteen years (1875–90), no ship approached her speed for the outward passage to Australia. On her record-breaking run to Adelaide, she covered {{convert|16000|mi|km}} in 64&amp;nbsp;days. Conrad writes of her:&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Smith, T. S. Holden, ''Where ships are born:  Sunderland 1346–1946'', 1946, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Conradian: the journal of the Joseph Conrad Society (UK)'', Volumes 32–33, The Society, 2007, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The clipper ship Torrens|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/lifestyle/columnists/alison-goulding/the_clipper_ship_torrens_1_1147795|publisher=Sunderland Echo|accessdate=30 December 2011|date=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A ship of brilliant qualities – the way the ship had of letting big seas slip under her did one's heart good to watch. It resembled so much an exhibition of intelligent grace and unerring skill that it could fascinate even the least seamanlike of our passengers.}}

It was the first time Conrad had served on a passenger boat, and it provided opportunities for social contacts with members of the educated class; Conrad made his first acquaintances with Englishmen who were not seamen.  During four long voyages in the ''Torrens'' Conrad enjoyed a much more cultivated atmosphere than on any ship he had previously served on.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|178}}

After a calm passage of a hundred days, on 28 February 1892 the ''Torrens'' arrived in [[Adelaide]].  Conrad spent over a month in [[Australia]].  While he was there, a letter from his uncle Bobrowski informed him that Conrad's cousin Stanisław Bobrowski had been accused, in essence, of social propaganda with "a tint of [Polish] nationalism" and had been jailed in the same [[Warsaw Citadel]] where Conrad's father had once been held.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|178–79}}

On 10 April 1892 Conrad left Adelaide in the ''Torrens'' and, after 145 days, with stops at [[Cape Town]], South Africa, and [[Saint Helena]], on 2 September arrived in London.  He stayed there almost two months, undecided about his future. He would have liked to have had a ship's command, but that did not seem possible.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|179–80}}

On 25 October 1892 he left London again aboard the ''Torrens''.  Sea voyages were then considered a health cure, especially for tuberculosis; two convalescing passengers died on the way.  Another, William Henry Jacques, a [[tuberculosis|consumptive]] [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] graduate who died less than a year later (19 September 1893), was, according to Conrad's ''[[A Personal Record]]'', the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of ''[[Almayer's Folly]]'', and Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel.  After a passage of 97 days, on 30 January 1893, the ''Torrens'' arrived at Port Adelaide.  Writing to Poradowska, Conrad complained of "the uniform grey of my existence" and expressed nostalgia for cultivated life and the broad intellectual interests of his correspondent's milieu.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|181–82}}

[[File:John galsworthy.jpg|thumb|[[John Galsworthy]], whom Conrad met on the ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|Torrens]]'']]

When the ''Torrens'' left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and [[New Zealand]]:  25-year-old lawyer and future novelist [[John Galsworthy]]; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at [[Elstree_School|Elstree]].  They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship.  The protagonist of one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, "The Doldrums" (1895–96), the first mate Armand, is obviously modeled on Conrad.  At Cape Town, where the ''Torrens'' remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines.  Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad.  On 26 July 1893 the ''Torrens'' docked at London, and "J. Conrad Korzemowin" (per the certificate of discharge) had, without knowing it, completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|182–83}}

In London, letters awaited him from his Uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski, who was in poor health.  They discussed Conrad's prospective visit to the uncle and informed Conrad of the trial of his cousin Stanisław Bobrowski—sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, not counting over a year spent under arrest, and sent to a [[St. Petersburg]] prison.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|184}}

Conrad resigned from the ''Torrens'', probably because he had lost hope of succeeding his friend W.H. Cope as its captain, and possibly because he was tired of the sailor's profession.  He left for [[Ukraine]] most likely in early August 1893 and remained with his mentor-uncle at Kazimierówka for over a month.  He wrote Poradowska that he had spent five days ill in bed, "nursed [by Uncle Tadeusz] as if I were a little child."  She, in a letter, made something of a jealous scene over Maria Ołdakowska, a niece of her late husband Aleksander Poradowski who was getting married.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|184–85}}

Najder writes that a graph of Conrad's sailing career would be "a broken line, but one that climbs between 1874 and 1889.... The expedition to Africa stops this upward climb and marks the beginning of a steady... decline.  After three years the captain is back to being only second mate, and in a ship going nowhere."  That ship was the 2,097-ton steamer ''Adowa'' (named for a historic [[Adowa|town]] in [[Ethiopia]]), which was to carry emigrants from France to [[Quebec]].  Conrad signed on in London on 29 November 1893.  On 4 December the ''Adowa'' put in at [[Rouen]].  She was expected to leave 9 December for [[La Rochelle]] and from there for [[Quebec City]], but passengers failed to materialize—the French showed no eagerness to join in the late-19th-century waves of emigration to the New World—and the steamer remained idle in France.  Writing Poradowska, Conrad considered the possibility of a job as a pilot on the [[Suez Canal]].  Bored at Rouen, he there began work on chapter 10 (of the 12 chapters) of ''[[Almayer's Folly]]''.  He wrote Poradowska jokingly how he was taken at the post office for a bomb-carrying anarchist; France was then the scene of many acts of violence, including bombings.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|185–86}}

On 10 January 1894 the ''Adowa'' left Rouen for London.  On 17 January 36-year-old "J. Conrad" disembarked and unknowingly ended his service at sea.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|186}}

Six months later, as one of 176 witnesses, he testified before the Board of Trade's Departmental Committee on the Manning of Merchant Ships.  He stated that the ''Adowa'' was not sufficiently manned, but considered the manning of the ''Skimmer of the Seas'', the ''Otago'' and the ''Torrens'' satisfactory.  Conrad departed from the truth in reporting the length of his service and posts held.  He maintained that he had spent 18 months on the [[Congo River]] "in command of a steamer," when in fact he had spent only six weeks on the Congo; he also added three months to his command of the ''Otago'', and claimed that he had made two voyages to [[Mauritius]] and two passages through [[Torres Strait]]; he lengthened his service in the ''Torrens'' by three months; and he alleged that he had made a transatlantic voyage in the ''Adowa''.  He was silent about his service in French ships, and about all his Continental European connections generally.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|186–87}}

In fact, during the 19 years from the time that Conrad had left [[Kraków]] in October 1874 until he signed off the ''Adowa'' in January 1894, he had worked in ships, including long periods in ports, for 10 years and almost 8 months.  He had spent just over 8 years at sea—9 months of this as a passenger.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|187}}

He had served as a crew member (steward, apprentice, [[able-bodied seaman]]) for over two and a half years (21 months of that at sea); as [[third mate]], 8 months; as [[second mate]] (his longest service), almost 4 years (only two and a half years of that at sea); as [[first mate]], two years and three months (two years of that at sea); as [[master mariner|captain]], one year and two months (half of that at sea).  Of his nearly 11 years at sea, 9 months were in steamers.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|187}}

A bequest from Conrad's uncle and mentor, [[Tadeusz Bobrowski]] (who had died on 1 January 1894)—which bequest Conrad, typically, would soon manage to lose—for the moment made it easier for him to retire from the sea and devote himself to a literary career.&lt;ref name="najder" /&gt;{{rp|203}}

The vast majority of [[mountain]]s in [[Canada]] lie in the western provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], and the [[Yukon]] Territory. Mountains can be found all over British Columbia while those in Alberta are mainly situated on the eastern side of the [[Canadian Rockies]]. The [[Saint Elias Mountains]] in the Yukon hold some of country's highest mountains, including the highest, [[Mount Logan]] at 5,959 meters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">'''Microsoft Research Maps''' or '''MSR Maps''' was a free online repository of [[public domain]] [[aerial imagery]] and [[topographic maps]] provided by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS). The site was a collaboration between [[Microsoft Research]] (MSR), [[Bing Maps]], and the USGS. It had been in operation since June 1998. It had 30,000 to 50,000 visitors per day as of January 2010. The site was renamed in 2010, prior to which it had been known as '''TerraServer-USA'''&lt;ref name="new name"&gt;[http://msrmaps.com/About.aspx?n=AboutWhatsNew&amp;b=Newsite New Web Site Name] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209194823/http://msrmaps.com/About.aspx?n=AboutWhatsNew&amp;b=Newsite |date=2010-02-09 }}. Microsoft Research Maps. January 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly '''Microsoft TerraServer''').

The site had black and white USGS aerial photographs of approximately 97% of the [[United States]].  In 2000, the USGS launched the new Urban Areas program, which will ultimately take high-resolution color aerial photographs of about 100 major American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eros.usgs.gov/ |title=USGS/EROS High Resolution Orthoimagery |access-date=2010-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106182554/http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/High_Resolution_Orthoimagery |archive-date=2010-01-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthoimagery.cr.usgs.gov/documents/listofHRO.php List of Areas with USGS High Resolution Orthoimagery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118162530/http://orthoimagery.cr.usgs.gov/documents/listofHRO.php |date=2010-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSR Maps had Urban Areas data for 40 cities.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== History ==
Though it was online as early as December 1997, the site was formally unveiled June 24, 1998, as part of an 18-month agreement between [[Microsoft]], [[Compaq]], and [[Aerial Images]] of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  It was created as a demonstration system to advertise the scalability of Microsoft's [[Windows NT]] Server and [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], and used images from the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and [[Sovinformsputnik]] (the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]]).

TerraServer was the brainchild of the Turing Award-winning researcher on database systems, [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]].  Before his death, Gray continued this work, developing [[Microsoft Virtual Earth]] and began a similar project that would become the [[Worldwide Telescope]].

In January 2000, Microsoft and Aerial Images, now TerraServer.com, Inc., split their operations, creating two parallel TerraServer websites.  The dualism caused confusion among web surfers until the Microsoft name change in 2010.  TerraServer.com, Inc., which owns the trademark&lt;ref name="trademark"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76534179 |title=USPTO Trademark Status |access-date=2010-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081834/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76534179 |archive-date=2011-06-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; TERRASERVER, filed a lawsuit&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;"[https://www.pcworld.com/article/145613/microsoft_satellite_map_project_sued_over_name.html Microsoft Satellite Map Project Sued Over Name]". ''PC World''. May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 in North Carolina federal court, seeking monetary damages and asking that Microsoft be stopped from using the TerraServer trademark.

The TerraServer name was a play on words, with 'Terra' referring to the 'earth' or 'land' and also to the terabytes of images stored on the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">The '''Minority Leader''' ({{lang-km|ប្រធានក្រុមភាគតិច}}), or the '''[[Leader of the Opposition]]''', leads the largest political party not in government in the [[National Assembly of Cambodia]]. The Minority Leader acts as a dialogue partner of the [[Prime Minister of Cambodia|Prime Minister]], and the [[Majority Leader (Cambodia)|Majority Leader]]. The official minority party must secure at least 25% of the total seats in Parliament.  

The role was officially recognized by Parliament in November 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/rainsy-get-rank-equal-pm-0|title=Rainsy to get rank 'equal' to PM|work=[[The Phnom Penh Post]]|date=29 November 2014|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Sam Rainsy the first official Minority Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.voacambodia.com/a/opposition-leader-officially-appointed-minority-leader-of-assembly/2609233.html |title=Opposition Leader Officially Appointed Minority Leader of Assembly |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to this, Rainsy had often been viewed as the ''de facto'' Leader of the Opposition. 

As in nearly every parliamentary democracy around the world, the Minority Leader comes from the political party with the largest number of seats in the Parliament yet is not in government. The Minority Leader is often seen as a Prime Minister-in-waiting.

The position was abolished by Parliament on 31 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/culture-of-dialogue-faces-official-demise-124308/|title=Culture of Dialogue Faces Official Demise|work=[[The Cambodia Daily]]|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=31 January 2017|first=Naren|last=Kuch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was launched on November 21, 2000 on a [[Delta II rocket]] from the [[Vandenberg AFB, California|Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[California]], together with two other satellites. Munin was developed by the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]] in cooperation with students from [[Luleå University of Technology]] and [[Umeå University]]. Last contact was on February 12, 2001, after a manual CPU reset; failure was probably in the boot PROM.

'''North Korea Uncovered''' is a comprehensive set of mappings of [[North Korea]]. It includes in-depth coverage of thousands of buildings, monuments, missile-storage facilities, mass graves, secret labor camps, palaces, restaurants, tourist sites, and main roads of the country, and even includes the entrance to the country's subterranean [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear test base]], the [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center]].

The mapping was the result of a two-year effort by doctoral student Curtis Melvin and other volunteers, who pored over hundreds of news reports, images, accounts, books, and maps in order to identify the geographic and political sites. The result has been called one of the most detailed maps of North Korea available to the public today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Orlando Ribeiro''' (16 February 1911–17 November 1997) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[geography|geographer]] and [[history|historian]].

==Biography==
Orlando Ribeiro was born in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

Ribeiro devoted his life to the teaching and research of [[geography]] and is often described as one of the main reformers of this science in Portugal. He graduated in Geography and History in 1932, and completed his doctorate at the [[University of Lisbon]] in 1935. Between 1937 and 1940 (during [[World War II]]), he lived in [[Paris]] and worked at the [[Sorbonne University]], alongside [[March Bloch]], [[Emmanuel de Martonne]] and A. Demangeon. In 1940 he taught at the [[University of Coimbra]], although he soon settled in his native city of Lisbon. In 1943 he founded the Centro de Estudos Geográficos (Centre for Geographical Studies). Ribeiro also lived in [[Goa]] temporarily, where he worked as a geographer for the Portuguese government.

Among his publications, one book stands out: ''Portugal, o Mediterrâneo e o Atlântico'' [''Portugal, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic''] (1945). This is one of the cornerstones in his career, as he develops a detailed study on Portugal's "dual nature", or in other words, "a country which is Atlantic by location but mostly Mediterranean in culture". Yet, this book had a wide impact, since Ribeiro deepens the concepts of [[Atlantic Europe]] and [[Mediterranean Europe]], linking central and southern Portugal to the Mediterranean culture and northern Portugal (together with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) to a pan-Atlantic European culture. In fact, Ribeiro is one of the first geographers formulating the idea of Atlantic Europe as a geographical and cultural unit (it had been partially advanced by [[Otero Pedrayo]]), an idea which would be further developed by authors such as P. Flatrès, [[Emyr Estyn Evans]], A. Bouhier, Meynier, J. García Fernández, [[Patrick O'Flanagan]], [[Barry Cunliffe]], [[Carlos Ferrás Sexto]] and [[Xoán Paredes]].

He visited the [[Fogo, Cape Verde|island of Fogo]] in Cape Verde which was a Portuguese possession and witnessed the 1951 eruption as he visited which lasted from June 2 to August, he came after the eruption started and also filmed it. He also wrote ''A Ilha do Fogo e as Suas Erupções'' (''Fogo Island and its Eruptions'') which started publications in 1954, three years after the island's eruption and was finished in 1960, it was about the previous eruptions that occurred on the island up to 1951.  On the book, he inspired a large number of pages from [[Baltasar Lopes da Silva]]'s novel ''[[Chiquinho (novel)|Chiquinho]]'' into one of its chapters. The book was awarded the [[Lopes de Rego]] Award in 1957.  A small cone made out of the 1951 eruption south of [[Pico do Fogo]] (now a volcanic hill) named Monte Orlando was named for him&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lesourd, ''Le Cap-Vert aujourd'hui'' (''Cape Verde Today''), Paris, Jaguar, coll. « Aujourd'hui », 2006, 277 p. {{ISBN|978-2-8695-0408-0}} et 286950408X, OCLC 80145890&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, he later saw the eruption in [[Capelinhos]] in the west of [[Faial Island]], Azores.

In 1966, the Centro de Estudos Geográficos began to publish the geography journal ''[[Finisterra (review)|Finisterra]]'', which soon would become the main reference of geographical science in Portugal, to the present day. 

Ribeiro was also an accomplished photographer, and he would often take the pictures himself for his works.

He died in Lisbon in 1997.

'''Rione''' ({{IPA-it|riˈoːne}}; plural: ''rioni'') is the name given to a neighbourhood in several Italian cities. A ''rione'' is a territorial subdivision. The larger administrative subdivisions in Rome are the [[Municipi_of_Rome#Municipi|Municipi]], with the rioni being used only in the historic centre. The word derives from the {{lang-la|regiones}}, the 14 subdivisions of Rome imposed by [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{it}} [http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/rione/ The word rione] in the [[Treccani]] dictionary on-line&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been adopted as a synonym of [[quartiere]] in the Italian [[comune|comuni]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

'''Shankhari Bazaar''' is one of the oldest areas in [[Old Dhaka]]. It stretches along a narrow lane, lined with richly decorated brick buildings, built during the late [[Mughal period|Mughal]] or [[British Raj|Colonial period]].&lt;ref name="mamun"&gt;{{cite book | title=Dhaka Smirti Bismiritir Nagari | publisher=Anannya | author=Mamun, Muntasir | year=2010 | pages=159–161 |language=Bengali|location=Dhaka|isbn=7-01-050355-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Location ==
Shankhari Bazar is located near the intersection of Islampur Road and [[Nawabpur Road]], a block north of the [[Buriganga River]]. The place especially belongs to the [[Bengali Hindu]]s. About 70%–80% of the area residents are [[Bengali Hindus]]. Rest Being Muslims.
[[File:Gate10001.jpg|thumb|Temple Gate]]

== Background and the name ==
The area belonged to the Shankhari Community, who borrowed their name from [[Shankha]], a decorated bangle crafted from slices of Shankha or [[conch shell]]s. Shankha is the symbol that indicates that a Hindu woman is married. In the 17th century, the Shankhari people were brought by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]], who allotted this place to them for living which later known as Shankhar Bazaar.

== Lifestyle ==
The Shankhari people are an artisan caste. Most belong to the [[Vaishnava]] branch of Hinduism, and some to the [[Shakta]] school; many are vegetarian.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book 
|author=Sharmin Naaz
|chapter=Shankhari (shell artisan)
|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shankhari
|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |year=2012 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Houses ==

[[File:Durga Puja in ShakhariBazar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Deity Durga]]
Shankhari Bazar was very famous and expensive during the 18th century. The Shankhari people were allotted with places to build houses. Shankhari Bazar is a long narrow street lined by brick buildings which are very old. The widths of buildings were about 12&amp;nbsp;ft, 70–100&amp;nbsp;ft in length and 2–3 storeys in height. The highest height of the buildings was four storeys. Every house used to have a temple room in it.

== Temples and Durga Puja ==
The Hindu temples are one of the major attractions of Shankhari Bazar. There are many temples on this narrow street. Over the ages, Shankhari Bazaar has been elevated to the level of the most popular centre for religious festivities.  As one of the most densely populated areas in the world Shankhari Bazaar also has the largest concentration of the Hindus in [[Dhaka]]. The temples are small in size but well decorated with ornamental motifs on the entrance and on the walls of the temples. The temples contain the statue of goddess [[Durga]], [[Ganesha]], [[Shiva]] etc. [[Durga Puja]] is the major festival of Hindu people. During Durga puja, people gathers in Shankhari Bazaar to worship and view goddess Durga. Besides Hindu, [[Muslim]]s also attend the [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]. In Durga puja, Shankhari Bazaar looks quite nice because of colourful feston, banner etc. Small and temporary food shops are also built during Durga puja. People from different places come to Shankhari Bazaar to see the Puja.

== Pannitola ==
[[File:Pannitola-19854.jpg|thumb|Pannitola]]
Pannitola is in the Rakhal Chandra Basak Lane of Shankhari Bazaar. The name Pannitola basically came from the first settling area of the Panniwala, people who used to make the foil of tin. The living style of the Panniwala's was similar to the Shankhari people.

== History ==
From ancient times Siddhirganj was famous for its rich textile Industry. Due to its favorable geographic location Siddhirganj was historically used as a port city and specialized in muslin production from hand looms. As a gateway to [[Dhaka]], [[Narayanganj Sadar Upazila|Narayanganj's]] economic activities were largely contributed by Siddhirganj and it was also called the [[Dundee]] of the East.

The traditional art of weaving [[Muslin|Jamdani muslin]] in Bangladesh was included in the list of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by UNESCO. In the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war of Bangladesh]], war hero [[Shafi Imam Rumi]]'s major target was to bomb the Siddhirganj Power Station.

== Power station ==

==Government and politics==
{{anchor|Structure of the autonomous region}}
Southern Sudan was governed by a '''High Executive Council''' which was led by a President of the High Executive Council. [[Abel Alier]] was the first President, holding that post between 1972 and 1978.

Legislative authority was vested in a '''People's Regional Assembly'''.

The autonomous region consisted of the three [[States of Sudan|provinces]] of [[Equatoria]], [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al-Ghazal]], and [[Greater Upper Nile (region)|Greater Upper Nile]]. [[Juba, South Sudan|Juba]] was the regional capital.

==Post-abolition==
The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished in 1983. Between 1987 and 1989 a '''Council for the South''' existed in Southern Sudan. Following the signing of the [[Khartoum Peace Agreement of 1997]], a '''Southern Sudan Coordination Council''' was established initially led by [[Riek Machar]] who was also appointed Assistant to the President of the Republic. This body was abolished in 2005 when the [[autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/South_Sudan.html#Southern-Sudan |title=Southern Sudan |website=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Square of the Victims of Fascism''' ({{lang-hr|Trg žrtava fašizma}}) is one of the central squares in [[Zagreb]]. It was designed in 1923 urban plan on the site of the former fairground that was east of Draškovića street as the new center of then new eastern part of the town that was deliberately and systematically built in the 1920s and 1930s.

Four streets lead directly to the center of the square; Rački street from the northwest, Višeslavova street from the southeast, Zvonimirova street from the east, and Dukljaninova street from the northeast.

==About==
Square form of the square was achieved by four representative residential and partly commercial buildings. Car and tram traffic flows thru the rim of the square. In the center of the square is the green area with a building called [[Meštrović Pavilion]] which has a circular layout with a colonnade around the rim and a low dome. Pavilion was built in 1938 following designs made by [[Ivan Meštrović]]. In 1941, the building was converted into a mosque. Three minarets and fountains  designed by architect Stjepan Planić were erected at the Pavilion's entrance. The minarets were removed in 1948, and the building was converted in 1949 to the Museum of the Croatian Revolution (in the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]]). At the beginning of the 1990s, the building was returned to the  [[Croatian Association of Visual Artists]] and was  restored to its original state in 2003.

On the north side of the square is the business-residential building made by architect [[Viktor Kovačić]] in 1922, while the entire south side of the square is enclosed by large five-storey residential-commercial block built in 1933 as a residential building for- the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] built by architects [[Edo Šen]] and [[Milovan Kovačević]]. Today, it is used as Student Dormitory of Ivan Meštrović, but it is currently closed for renovation.

Tram line that goes from Rački street and goes around the square to the Zvonimirova street was built in 1935.

==Former names==
Being one of the most prominent squares in Zagreb its name was often changed in accordance to political circumstances of the time:
*x&amp;ndash;1927 ''Trg N'' (Square N)
*1927&amp;ndash;1941 ''Trg Petra I. osloboditelja'' (Square of [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter I, the liberator]])
*1941&amp;ndash;1942 ''Trg III'' (Square number III)
*1942&amp;ndash;1946 ''Trg bana Kulina'' (Square of [[Ban Kulin]])
*1946&amp;ndash;1990 ''Trg žrtava fašizma'' (Square of the Victims of Fascism)
*1990&amp;ndash;2000 ''Trg hrvatskih velikana '' (Croatian Nobles Square)
*2001&amp;ndash;present ''Trg žrtava fašizma'' (Square of the Victims of Fascism)

Theodore Garbade played a significant role in the settlement between Cuba and the [[United States]] after, [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] succeeded 1913 in passing the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Revenue Act,]] also known as the Tariff Act, or the Underwood Act. The Act established the lowest rates since the [[Walker Tariff]] of 1857. Most schedules were ''ad valorem'' basis, a percentage of the value of the item. This had a profound impact for the Cuban [[Tobacco industry|Tobacco Industry]] concerning their import to the States. As President of the Union of Manufacturers of Cigars of [[Cuba]] Garbade, aided by an appointed committee, laid this out to Cuban ´s President [[Mario García Menocal]] in January 1914, insisting upon an allowance of 50 per cent on their exports of cigars as an equivalent in Cuba’s next reciprocity treaty and urging a prompt solution of this matter so vital to the Cuban cigar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/readbook/TheCubaReview_10559666#106|title=The Cuba Review|website=www.forgottenbooks.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German [[Citizenship|Citizen]] in the United States in 1916, he was considered [[prisoner of war]], and put under [[house arrest]] in his mansion in [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisko]], New York. In 1919 he moved to [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]] and in 1921 to [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] where he applied for a Swiss passport. Owner of [[plantation]]s and other properties in Cuba, he lost a great part of his fortune by [[Confiscation]] in 1960 after the [[Cuban Revolution]]. He died only one year later. Garbade was married four times. Theodor jr, is son of his first spouse Graziella Aguirre del Monte who died in 1909.

The '''transparent eyeball''' is a philosophical metaphor originated by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The transparent eyeball is a representation of an eye that is absorbent rather than reflective, and therefore takes in all that [[nature]] has to offer.  Emerson intends that the individual become one with nature, and the transparent eyeball is a tool to do that. In the book ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'', Emerson explains that the meaning behind the transparent eyeball is similar to a scientific standpoint on the [[Bible]].

==Overview==
The idea of the transparent eyeball first appeared in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay, ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'', published in 1836.&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7"/&gt; In this essay, Emerson describes [[nature]] as the closest experience there is to experiencing the presence of [[God]]. To truly appreciate nature, one must not only look at it and admire it, but also be able to feel it taking over the senses.  This process requires absolute "solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society"&lt;ref name = "EmersonNature7"&gt;{{cite web | date = Feb 2011 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= http://seniorseminarsp2011.qwriting.org/files/2011/02/Emerson-Nature-and-Circles.pdf |title= Emerson, nature &amp; circles | work = Ralph Waldo Emerson Essays and Lectures|publisher = Q Writing | origyear = The Library of America 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; to uninhabited places like the woods where—
{{quote| We return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, — no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite spaces, — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7" /&gt;}}

However, only a "few adult persons can see nature."&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7"/&gt;  For most people seeing is superficial.  It is light illuminating the [[eye]] revealing what is physically evident as opposed to sun "shine[s] into the eye and heart of the child."&lt;ref name = "EmersonNature7"/&gt; "Emerson argues that outer and inner vision merge to reveal symbols in the natural landscape. Because of the radical correspondence between visible things and human thoughts, natural facts serve as symbols of spiritual facts, so the natural world is perpetual allegory of the human spirit—an allegory to which the eye gives access."&lt;ref name="DeeperUnity9"&gt;{{cite web |page=25 |year=2004 |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/v013/13.2kohler.pdf | format = PDF | title= Dickinson's Embodied Eyeball: Transcendentalism and the Scope of Vision| last = Kohler | first = Michelle |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hello: in the midst of wild Nature, the self becomes one with being and god; differentiation, alienation and struggle cease."&lt;ref name = "DeathEmerson2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Death of Emerson: Writing, Loss, and Divine Presence |author=Atchley, J.

"For Emerson, every object rightly seen unlocks a new faculty of the soul and, while he ardently valorizes the physical eye’s potential to see in a way that discovers symbolic meaning, his most memorable metaphorical image for such potential, the transparent eyeball, posits a vision wherein the eye sloughs off its body and ‘egotism,’ merging with what it sees. It is within this transparent, disembodied state of total union with nature that Emerson claims ‘I am nothing; I see all’. The ‘all’ that Emerson seeks access is not simply harmony with nature or even knowledge, but perception of a deep unity between the human spirit and the natural world."&lt;ref name="DeeperUnity9"/&gt;

==Origin==
Emerson attended [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1825—and by 1826, had applied for a license to preach at the Middlesex Association of Ministers.  By 1832, Emerson left the Christian ministry but continued to believe in God. However, he held that God reveals his grandeur not only in scripture, but also through nature. “Emerson's reading in science soon after leaving the ministry was his effort to interpret God's natural book. As Emerson became increasingly interested in science, he eventually came to believe nature, not scripture, was the locus of [[revelation]]. His desire to become a naturalist was intimately connected to his yearning to write a new bible of [[God]]'s revelation in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = "Terrible Simplicity": Emerson's Metaleptic Style | journal = Style | type = academic journal article | last = Wilson | first = Eric | volume = 31 | number = 1 | date = Spring 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2013}} believe that the “transparent eyeball” passage is an echo of the [[Bible]]. ‘In Nature, Emerson fashions himself as a new prophet of nature, believing with [[Goethe]] that "prophetic vision" arises only in "slowpaced experiment." Vision arises from observing nature, where, as he writes in Nature, "All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature." The essay can be regarded as Emerson's attempt to make nature itself a bible. In this sense, one need not spend Sundays at church but could simply retreat to the ‘woods’ and let nature inhabit his or her consciousness.  “The reconstruction of religion in Emerson’s nature works in a number of directions. First, there is an undeniable romantic-[[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in his writings. One can and should go out into nature, into the fields and forests and be renewed. It follows, then, that Emerson’s religiosity may be read as natural and not supernatural, which may account for his centrality in a tradition of arts and letters which dates to his decisive split with organized religion.” The significance of this shift resulted in Emerson’s paradigmatic role for [[transcendentalism]].  “Transcendentalists believe that finding God depended on neither orthodox ([[Christianity]]) nor the Unitarians' sensible exercise of virtue, but on one's inner striving toward spiritual communion with the divine spirit.”{{Sfn | Wilson | 1997}}

==Application==

===In photography===
[[Walker Evans]] is a renowned American photographer, known for his visionary process of aligning “photography with Emerson's original desire to absorb and be absorbed into nature, to become a transparent rather than simply reflective eye.” Walker spent his career during the [[Great Depression]] trying to capture images that would be a mirror representation of Americans surrounded by both nature and man-made objects existing in total harmony.

Emerson's description of the “transparent eyeball” functions as a metaphor for the artist's ability to discern the essential nature of objects and as a way to stress that the transcendental is not formless.  The "transparent eyeball" reflects nature's particulars, much in the way that a [[camera]] lens exposes; and in the process illuminates… the "unrelieved, bare-faced, revelatory" facts. The transparent eyeball is about capturing and being a part of all of nature and its motion. The camera works in the same fashion. The camera exposes/illuminates all of nature in a single snapshot with more detail and visibility of nature that cannot be taken in by an unaided eye alone.
{{Quote | Just as nature has to be experienced visually for its true meaning to shine forth, the photographic eye has to be present to capture the image. Contrary to what one might think, the ‘transparent eyeball’ is not a free-floating entity, but a necessary link between the observer and the landscape surrounding him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = ‘The Transparent Eyeball’: On Emerson and Walker Evans | last = Blinder | first = Caroline | journal = Mosaic | place = Winnipeg | volume = 37 | number = 4 | date = December 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To visually experience and appreciate nature, as Emerson desired, through a transparent state, an individual has to view it. This is similar to the camera. To photograph an image, the individual must first view the scene, then capture what they see.  Thus, the “transparent eyeball” is not free from constraints, but is a tool that the individual needs to become one with nature. However, it is not to be understood that “Emerson did not believe in a fundamental god-driven unity underlying the worldly flux, but rather that art's role was to provide an insight into that unity.”{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===In literature===
According to Amy Hungerford, the influence and use of the transparent eyeball in [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Marilynne Robinson]]’s novel [[Housekeeping (novel)|Housekeeping]] is palpable.  Hungerford argues that Robinson’s protagonist Ruth narrates from the perspective of the transparent eyeball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://academicearth.org/speakers/amy-hungerford | contribution = Amy Hungerford | publisher = Academic earth | title = Speakers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
[[Annie Dillard]], a prominent critic of [[transcendentalism]], suggests a rather different kind of observer—one conscious of their own embodiment, of a "particularity" in space and time, of [[subjectivity]], of the [[constructiveness]], the "falseness" of vision.  Dillard’s vision is different from Emerson’s because she is conscious of her presence, so she can pay attention to the “falseness” of vision. In this sense, it is safer not to attain nor aim for the transparent eyeball ideal, because vision is limited, and one should “not stalk the truth” of the places where it could be seen.{{Citation needed |date=March 2015}}

[[File:Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk, on the Yenisie River.jpg|thumb|[[canal inclined plane|Inclined plane]] at [[Krasnoyarsk Dam]]]]
River steamers first came to the Yenesei River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeneisisk in 1881.

Imperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia. One boat was the SS St. Nicholas which took the future Tsar Nicholas II on his voyage to Siberia, and later conveyed Vladimir Lenin to prison.

Engineers attempted to place river steamers on regular service on the river during the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail and  parted out river steamers in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisei mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred miles in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous  for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.

The first recreation team to navigate the Yenisei's entire length, including its violent upper [[tributary]] in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001.  [[Ben Kozel]], Tim Cope, [[Colin Angus (explorer)|Colin Angus]] and Remy Quinter were on this team.  Both Kozel and Angus wrote books detailing this expedition,&lt;ref&gt;Five Months in a Leaky Boat: A River Journey Through Siberia, Kozel, 2003, Pan Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; and a documentary was produced for National Geographic Television.

A [[canal inclined plane]] was built on the river in 1985 at the [[Krasnoyarsk Dam]].&lt;ref name=ShipliftsPianc1989&gt;

==History==
Nomadic tribes such as the [[Ket people]] and the [[Yugh people]] have lived along the banks of the Yenisei river since ancient times, and this region is the location of the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian language family]]. The Ket, numbering about 1000,  are the only survivors today of those who originally lived throughout central southern Siberia near the river banks. Their extinct relatives included the Kotts, Assans, Arins, Baikots, and Pumpokols who lived further upriver to the south. The modern Ket lived in the eastern middle areas of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia during the 17th through 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
