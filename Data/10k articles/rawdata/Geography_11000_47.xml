The '''A340''' is a major road in the south of [[England]], portions of which are known as the Aldermaston Road, Tadley Hill, Basingstoke Road and Tidmarsh Road.

==Route==
Starting in the south of [[Basingstoke]], [[Hampshire]], it runs west, forming the western side of the Basingstoke ringroad, before swinging north to [[Tadley]] and then enters [[Berkshire]].  It passes the gates of the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]], before passing through the village of Aldermaston itself and then joining the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] at [[Aldermaston Wharf]]. After approximately {{Convert|2.5|mi|km}} north-east, the A340 runs further north to [[Pangbourne]], to the west of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. This section of the road is thought to follow the Roman road from [[Calleva Atrebatum]] (about {{Convert|7|mi|km}} to the south).

The '''A688''' is a [[road]] in [[County Durham]] in [[North East England]].

It begins at the junction with the [[A67 road]] in [[Barnard Castle]] and continues in a north easterly direction for {{convert|25|mi|km}}, terminating at the A181 to the east of [[Durham, England|Durham]] City.

The road passes through the village of [[Staindrop]], past [[Raby Castle]] through [[West Auckland]], [[Bishop Auckland]] and on to [[Spennymoor]]. It then continues through the [[Thinford]] intersection with the [[A167]] to Junction 61 of the [[A1(M)]] at [[Bowburn]]. The latest extension to the road from the A1(M) to the A181 was opened on 30 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/3806648.Minister_opens_new___11_4m_road_link/| title=Minister opens new £11.4m road link between Wheatley Hill and Bowburn | publisher=The Northern Echo| date=2008-10-30| accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road is single-carriageway except for a short {{convert|800|m|yd|abbr=on}} stretch of [[dual-carriageway]] at Spennymoor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2207">'''Ecosemiotics''' is a branch of [[semiotics]] in its intersection with [[human ecology]] that studies the sign relations established by culture, which deal with other living beings, communities, and landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Almo; Santolini, Riccardo; Pagliaro, Giacomo; Scozzafava, Silvia; Schipani, Ileana 2005. Ecosemiotics: A new field of competence for ecology to overcome the frontier between environmental complexity and human culture in the Mediterranean. ''Israel Journal of Plant Sciences'' 53(3/4): 167–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field was initiated by [[Winfried Nöth]] and [[Kalevi Kull]].&lt;ref&gt;*Maran, Timo 2007. Towards an integrated methodology of ecosemiotics: The concept of nature-text. ''Sign Systems Studies'' 35(1/2): 269–294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central focus of ecosemiotics concerns the role of concepts (sign-based models people have) in designing and changing the environment. Ecosemiotics includes (or largely overlaps) with semiotics of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/11557974/Landscape_semiotics Lindström, Kati; Kull, Kalevi; Palang, Hannes 2014.

'''Felipe Bauzá y Cañas''' (1764 in [[Palma de Mallorca]] &amp;ndash; 1834 in [[London]]) was a Spanish naval officer, hydrographer, and cartographer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daao.org.au/bio/felipe-bauza/ DAAO database entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on 17 February 1764 in Palma de Mallorca. He studied at the nautical college of [[Cartagena, Spain]] and qualified as a maritime pilot. In 1785 he started training as a hydrographer under cartographer [[Vincente Tofino]], whom he helped chart the Mediterranean coastline of Spain.

He was the main cartographer of the [[Malaspina Expedition]] to the Americas, Oceania and Australasia between 1789 and 1794, and [[Bauza Island]] in New Zealand is named after him. At the end of that expedition he travelled across South America by land and created a map of the Andes.

In 1797 he started working at the Hydrography Office in Madrid, of which he became director in 1815. He was highly esteemed as a cartographer, both by the Spanish government and by foreign authorities. He was honoured with the Russian [[Order of St. Vladimir|Cross of St Vladimir]] in 1816 and was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]] of London in 1819.

He was deputy for Mallorca at the [[Cortes Generales]] during the [[Trienio Liberal]] ("Three Liberal Years") of 1820-1823. In 1823 due to the renewed persecution of liberals by king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] Bauzá was sentenced to death and had to flee to London with his son, while his wife and daughter remained in Madrid. He took with him his large collection of geographical documents and maps of the Americas and Spain. In London he had contacts with many prominent English and European scientists, and sold many of his charts to the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|British Hydrographic Office]].

In 1833 his death sentence was vacated. He was planning to return to Spain, but died of a brain haemorrhage on 3 March 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Peter, ''"Riches for the geography of America and Spain": Felipe Bauzá and his topographical collections, 1789-1848'', 1986, ''British Library Journal'', [http://www.bl.uk/eblj/1986articles/pdf/article3.pdf PDF from the British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Library]] holds a collection of his maps as the Bauzá Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/maps/spanishcolonial/index.html Spanish colonial maps: Bauzá Collection], British Library&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ladderfuels.png|thumb|right|380 px|Illustration from U.S. government publication, Introduction to Wildland Fire Behavior (S-190), showing the fuel ladder]]

A '''fuel ladder''' is a [[firefighting]] term for live or dead [[vegetation]] that allows a [[fire]] to climb up from the [[landscape]] or [[forest floor]] into the tree [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. Common fuel ladders include tall [[grass]]es, [[shrub]]s, and [[tree]] [[branch]]es, both living and dead. It is also part of [[Defensible space (fire control)|Defensible Space]] 'Firescaping' practices.

==Fire precautions==
Potential fuel ladders should be removed to reduce the risk of fire bridging the gap to the canopy. To remove the ladder requires pruning any low limbs up to a minimum of 8 feet, and potentially as high as 15 feet. The required height depends on how low the branch tips hang, the steepness of slope, and the height and spacing of other nearby vegetation. 

The desired result is to create a situation in which a low-burning fire could burn to the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a tree, which is protected by its [[Bark (botany)|bark]], without having thinner, more flammable branches, [[leaf|leaves]] or [[Pine needle|needles]] within easy reach of the fire.

==Other fuel ladders==
Apart from tree limbs, anything that would help that fire move up into the tree canopy is a fuel ladder. This includes shrubs and even tall grass or weeds. Non-vegetation fuel sources such as woodpiles, wooden fenceposts and structures should also be considered. 

The intent is to maintain a break in vertical and horizontal continuity so that, if for example a woodpile caught fire, it would not be positioned next to ''[[manzanita]]'' [[shrubs]] or directly under trees that could then easily catch fire.

[[File:Corvette Galathea 1833-1861.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The corvette ''Galathea'' (1833-1861)]]
The '''Galathea expeditions''' comprise a series of three Danish ship-based scientific research expeditions in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, carried out with material assistance from the [[Royal Danish Navy]] and, with regard to the second and third expeditions, under the auspices of the Danish Expedition Foundation.  All three expeditions [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world from west to east and followed similar routes.

==First expedition==
===Preparations===
The first ''Galathea'' Expedition took place from 1845 to 1847 and had political and scientific objectives.  It was initiated by the [[Christian VIII of Denmark|King of Denmark, Christian VIII]], with its main purposes the handover of the [[Danish India|Danish colonies in India]], following their sale to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]], as well as a final Danish attempt to explore and [[colonization|recolonise]] the [[Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].  Additional aims were the expansion of trade with [[China]] and the discovery of new trading opportunities, as well as making extensive [[museum collections|scientific collections]].&lt;ref name=Balsved-1&gt;Balsved (2006-02-27).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal-1&gt;Historical Perspective: Galathea 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Galathea'' was a three-masted [[sailing ship]], a naval [[corvette]] which had been built in 1831 at the [[Gammelholm]] naval [[shipyard]] in [[Copenhagen]].  It was {{convert|43|m|abbr=on}} in length and had a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}.  When it departed on its voyage under the leadership of Captain [[Steen Andersen Bille (1797–1883)|Steen Andersen Bille]] it carried 231 seamen and scientists, 36 [[Naval artillery|guns]], and supplies for one year.

The scientists included physician and assistant botanist [[Ferdinand Didrichsen|Didrik Ferdinand Didrichsen]], botanist [[Bernhard Kamphǿvener|Bernhard Casper Kamphǿvener]], [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[Carl Emil Kiellerup]], geologist [[Hinrich Johannes Rink]] and zoologists [[Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn]] and [[Johannes Theodor Reinhardt]], not all of whom remained for the duration of the voyage, as well as [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch artist]] [[Johan Christian Thornam]] and [[Genre art|genre painter]] [[Poul August Plum]].&lt;ref name=Maule&gt;Maule (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an expensive undertaking, with a budget of nearly half a million [[Rixdollar]]s, equivalent to 3% of Denmark’s annual state revenues at the time.&lt;ref name=Gal-1/&gt;

===The voyage===
[[File:Corvette Galathea at the Nicobar Islands.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The ''Galathea'' at the Nicobar Islands in 1846]]
The ''Galathea'' left Copenhagen on 24 June 1845 and, after a provisioning stop at [[Madeira]], sailed southwards around Africa to India, where she visited [[Tharangambadi|Tranquebar]], [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].  In Calcutta an additional ship, the [[steamboat]] ''Ganges'', was purchased and the carrier ''Christine'' hired, to assist with work in the Nicobar Islands.  Considerable time and effort was expended at the Nicobars; most of January 1846 was spent in the northern Nicobar islands, and February in the southern.  As well as scientific surveys and collecting, preparations were made for a new colony based at Pulo Milu.  Several people, including the geologist Rink, remained there when the expedition departed, though the nascent colony was abandoned only two years later.&lt;ref name=Maule/&gt;

The ''Galathea'' proceeded to [[Southeast Asia]], calling at [[Penang]], [[Singapore]], [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], and [[Manila]] before heading for the Chinese coast and visiting [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Xiamen|Amoy]], and [[Shanghai]].  An attempt to stop at [[Japan]] was rebuffed by the authorities there.  The ship then crossed the [[Pacific Ocean]], visiting the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian archipelago]] and [[Tahiti]] on the way, to [[Valparaiso]], [[Callao]], and [[Lima]] in [[South America]], before rounding [[Cape Horn]].  Further visits were made to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Montevideo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Salvador, Bahia|Bahia]], following which the ''Galathea'' headed back to Denmark, anchoring in Copenhagen harbour on 24 August 1847 after a voyage of more than two years.&lt;ref name=Maule/&gt;  During the course of the voyage 20 Danish sailors had died and several others were discharged.&lt;ref name=Gal-1/&gt;

===Results===
The expedition returned with 93 containers of "zoological, entomological, botanical and geological Objects".&lt;ref name=Gal-1b/&gt;  There were also 21 boxes of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] material, a large collection from [[Java]], as well as gifts from scientists in many of the cities and ports visited by the expedition.&lt;ref name=Gal-1b&gt;Historical Perspective: Galathea 1 (1845-47) Results.&lt;/ref&gt;  The intention of Christian VIII was to sponsor the publication of the scientific results of the expedition.  However, the King died in January 1848 and the country was thrown into the [[First Schleswig War|Three Years’ War]].  Most of the boxes of collected items lay unopened for many years and, with some exceptions, were never properly processed, nor the full results formally published.  The collections subsequently served mainly as reference material.&lt;ref name=Gal-1b/&gt;

==Second expedition==
The second expedition was conceived in 1941 in discussions between journalist and author [[Hakon Mielche]] and [[oceanography|oceanographer]] and [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]] [[Anton Frederik Bruun]].  It was originally hoped to send out a second expedition on the [[centenary]] of the first; however, [[World War II]] intervened and preparations had to be postponed.  In June 1945 the two protagonists, along with explorers [[Eigil Knuth]], [[Ebbe Munch]] and [[Henning Haslund-Christensen]], decided to establish the Danish Expedition Foundation, which was to raise funds for the second Galathea, as well as other, expeditions.

The expedition eventually started in 1950, with its main purpose deep sea [[oceanography]].  For the use of the expedition a British [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]], [[HMS Leith (U36)|HMS ''Leith'']], was acquired and renamed HDMS ''Galathea''.  It was {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|11|m|abbr=on}} wide, with a draught of {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} and was powered by two [[steam turbine]]s that gave it a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn}}.  ''Galathea'' 2 left Copenhagen in October 1950 carrying a crew of about 100 seamen and scientists, visiting many of the same places the original ''Galathea'' had visited over a century earlier.  The main difference in the route taken from the earlier expedition was in using the Panama Canal, rather than the [[Drake Passage]] at the southern end of South America, to transit between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic.  From 1950 to 1952 the expedition carried out a program of scientific exploration; the highlight occurred in July 1951 when, while investigating the [[Philippine Trench]], scientists secured biological material from a record depth of {{convert|10190|m|abbr=on}}.  The expedition returned to Copenhagen in June 1952 where the ship was welcomed by a crowd of 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=Balsved-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal-2&gt;Historical Perspective: Galathea 2 (1950-52).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
The second Galathea expedition led to the discovery of, among other things, the fish species ''[[Antipodocottus galatheae]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, R. L., 1952. Description of a new genus and species of cottid fish from the Tasman Sea, with a discussion of its derivation. Vidensk. Medd. Dansk Naturh. Foren. Kjøbenhavn v. 114: 431-441.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Abyssobrotula galatheae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J.G. (1977). "The deepest living fish Abyssobrotula galatheae: a new genus and species of oviparous ophidioids (Pisces, Brotulidae)". Galathea Report 14: 41–48.&lt;/ref&gt; the snail species ''[[Guttula galatheae]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmuc.dk/inverweb/galathea/Pdf_filer/Volume_07/galathea-vol.07-pp_125-136.pdf Knudsen J. 1964. ''Scaphopoda and Gastropoda from depths exceeding 6000 meters''. Galathea Report 7: 125-136, page(s): 127-129]&lt;/ref&gt; and, above all, living [[Monoplacophora]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.jrank.org/pages/1882/Monoplacophorans-Monoplacophora-MONOPLACOPHORANS-PEOPLE.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a class of "ancestral mollusc" which until then was known only from the [[fossil record]]. The biggest sensation at the time, however, was the discovery of [[barnacle]]s on a rock from the bottom of the [[Philippine Trench]] since it had been assumed that life could not exist at this sea depth.  Dr. Claude E. ZoBell, the father of Marine Microbiology, was aboard this expedition.

==Third expedition==
[[File:Galathea 3 hjemkomst 01.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Vædderen'' being welcomed home to Copenhagen on 25 April 2007 at the end of her voyage]]
The third expedition took place during 2006–2007, using the offshore patrol [[frigate]] [[HDMS Vædderen (F359)|HDMS ''Vædderen'']], which was refitted to serve as an expedition ship.  It is a [[Thetis class frigate]] which was built at the [[Svendborg]] Shipyards in 1990 and is {{convert|112.5|m|abbr=on}} m long and {{convert|14.5|m|abbr=on}} m wide.  Although the voyage was publicised as the third Galathea expedition, the ship itself was not renamed.&lt;ref name=Balsved-1/&gt;

The expedition’s main purpose was to carry out research on climate and weather changes, [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, and [[marine biology]].  It left [[Copenhagen]] in August 2006 and visited the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]], then travelled southwards through the [[Atlantic Ocean]] along the west coast of [[Africa]] to [[Cape Town]].  It then crossed the [[Indian Ocean]] to [[Australia]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Antarctica]], before sailing northwards along the west coast of [[South America]] to the [[Panama Canal]], then sailing through the [[Caribbean]] and visiting [[New York City|New York]], before returning to [[Denmark]] in April 2007.&lt;ref name=Balsved-2&gt;Balsved (2006-12-12).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESA&gt;European Space Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mongolia'''  is a [[Landlocked country|landlocked]] country in [[Central Asia]] and [[East Asia]], located between [[China]] and [[Russia]]. The terrain is one of mountains and rolling plateaus, with a high degree of relief. The total land area of [[Mongolia]] is 1,564,116 square kilometres. Overall, the land slopes from the high [[Altay Mountains]] of the west and the north to plains and depressions in the east and the south. The [[Khüiten Peak]] in extreme western Mongolia on the Chinese border is the highest point (4,374 metres). The lowest is 518 metres, an otherwise undistinguished spot in the eastern Mongolian plain. The country has an average elevation of 1,580 metres. The landscape includes one of Asia's largest freshwater lakes ([[Lake Khövsgöl]]), many salt lakes, marshes, sand dunes, rolling grasslands, alpine forests, and permanent mountain glaciers. Northern and western Mongolia are seismically active zones, with frequent earthquakes and many hot springs and extinct volcanoes. The nation's closest point to any ocean is approximately {{convert|645|km|mi}} from the country's easternmost tip bordering northern China to [[Jinzhou]] in Liaoning province, China along the coastline of the [[Bohai Sea]].

== Mountain regions ==
{{See also|List of mountains in Mongolia|Altai-Sayan region}}
[[File:Altay-Sayan map en.png|thumb|left|[[Altai Mountains]], [[Sayan Mountains]] and [[Khangai Mountains]]]]
Mongolia has two major mountain ranges. The highest is the [[Altai Mountains]], which stretch across the western and the southwestern regions of the country on a northwest-to-southeast axis. The range contains the country's highest peak, the 4734 metre high [[Khüiten Peak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger|pid=10690|title=Tavan Bogd Uul, Mongolia/China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Khangai Mountains]], mountains also trending northwest to southeast, occupy much of central and north-central Mongolia. These are older, lower, and more eroded mountains, with many forests and alpine pastures. Much of eastern Mongolia is occupied by a plain, and the lowest area is a southwest-to-northeast trending depression that reaches from the [[Gobi Desert]] region in the south to the eastern frontier.

== Rivers and lakes ==
{{See also|List of rivers of Mongolia|List of lakes of Mongolia}}
[[File:Mongolia Topography.png|thumb|left|Topography of Mongolia]]
Some of Mongolia's waterways drain to the oceans, but many finish at [[Endorheic basins]] in the deserts and the depressions of Inner Asia. Rivers are most extensively developed in the north, and the country's major river system is that of the [[Selenga|Selenge]], which drains via [[Lake Baikal]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Some minor tributaries of Siberia's [[Yenisei River]], which also flows to the Arctic Ocean, rise in the mountains of northwestern Mongolia. In northeastern Mongolia the [[Onon River]] drains into the [[Pacific Ocean]] through the [[Shilka River]] in Russia and the [[Amur River|Amur]] (Heilong Jiang) rivers, forming the [[List of rivers by length|tenth longest]] river system in the world.

[[File:Mongolia 1996 CIA map.jpg|thumb|The southern portion of Mongolia is taken up by the [[Gobi Desert]], while the northern and western portions are mountainous.]]
Many rivers of western Mongolia end at lakes in the [[Central Asian Internal Drainage Basin]], most often in the [[Great Lakes Depression]], or at [[Hulun Lake]], [[Ulaan Lake]] or [[Ulungur Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers and Water|url=http://www.welcome2mongolia.com/archives/rivers/|website=Mongolia Travel Guide|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few streams of southern Mongolia do not reach the sea but run into lakes or deserts.

Mongolia's largest lake by area, [[Uvs Lake]] is in the Great Lakes Depression. Mongolia's largest lake by volume of water, [[Khövsgöl Nuur]], drains via the Selenge river to the Arctic Ocean. One of the most easterly lakes of Mongolia, [[Hoh Nuur]], at an elevation of 557 metres, is the lowest point in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Central Asian Review, Volume 15|date=1967|publisher=Central Asian Research Centre|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7hBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=lake+%22Hoh+Nuur%22|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the lakes and rivers of Mongolia cover 10,560 square kilometres, or 0.67% of the country.&lt;ref name="CIA Factbook Mongolia"/&gt;

== Climate ==
{{See also|Mongolia#Geography and climate|l1=Climate}}

=== Overview ===
{{refimprove|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Mongolia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Mongolia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Mongolia is high, cold, and dry. It has an extreme continental climate with long, cold winters and short summers, during which most precipitation falls. The country averages 257 cloudless days a year, and it is usually at the center of a region of high atmospheric pressure. Precipitation is highest in the north, which averages {{convert|200|to|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year, and lowest in the south, which receives {{convert|100|to|200|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. The extreme south is the [[Gobi Desert]], some regions of which receive no precipitation at all in most years. The name Gobi is a Mongol word meaning desert, depression, salt marsh, or steppe, but which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support marmots but with enough to support camels. Mongols distinguish Gobi from desert proper, although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian landscape. Gobi rangelands are fragile and are easily destroyed by overgrazing, which results in expansion of the true desert, a stony waste where not even Bactrian camels can survive.

Average temperatures over most of the country are below freezing from November through March and are about freezing in April and October. Winter nights can drop to {{convert|-40|°C|1}} in most years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Mongolia.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Summer extremes reach as high as {{convert|38|°C|1}} in the southern Gobi region and {{convert|33|°C|1}} in Ulaanbaatar. Most of Mongolia is covered by [[discontinuous permafrost]] (grading to continuous at high altitudes), which makes construction, road building, and mining difficult. All rivers and freshwater lakes freeze over in the winter, and smaller streams commonly freeze to the bottom. Ulaanbaatar lies at {{convert|1351|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level in the valley of the [[Tuul River]]. Located in the relatively well-watered north, it receives an annual average of {{convert|310|mm|in|1}} of precipitation, almost all of which falls in July and in August. Ulaanbaatar has an average annual temperature of {{convert|-2.9|°C}} and a frost-free period extending on the average from mid-may to late August.

Mongolia's weather is characterized by extreme variability and short-term unpredictability in the summer, and the multiyear averages conceal wide variations in precipitation, dates of frosts, and occurrences of blizzards and spring dust storms. Such weather poses severe challenges to human and livestock survival. Official statistics list less than 1% of the country as arable, 8 to 10% as forest, and the rest as pasture or desert. Grain, mostly wheat, is grown in the valleys of the Selenge river system in the north, but yields fluctuate widely and unpredictably as a result of the amount and the timing of rain and the dates of killing frosts.

=== Zud ===
{{main article|dzud}}
[[File:Zud 2.JPG|thumb|Goats that died as result of a dzud]]
Although winters are generally cold and clear, and livestock can survive, under various weather conditions livestock are unable to graze and die in large numbers. A winter in which this occurs is known as a ''[[zud]];'' causes include blizzards, drought, extreme cold, and freezing rain. Such losses of livestock, which are an inevitable and, in a sense, normal consequence of the climate, have made it difficult for planned increases in livestock numbers to be achieved.

=== Seasonal blizzards ===
[[Image:Mongolia.A2003355.0615.500m.jpg|thumb|right|Snow covers Mongolia in patches in this image from December 21, 2003. Snowfall is normally light and blows away quickly during the winter, so to see this much snow on the ground at once is rather unusual.]]

Severe blizzards can occur in the region. The winters of 1970–1971, 2000–2001, 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 were particularly harsh, featuring extremely severe zuds.

The [[blizzards]] of December 2011 blocked many roads, and killed 16,000 livestock and 10 people.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/weather/12/06/weather.mongolia.reut/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adrc.asia"&gt;[http://www.adrc.asia/adrc_t/view_disaster_en.php?Lang=en&amp;Key=105&amp;Frame=yes]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mongolian State Emergency Commission]] said it was the coldest winter in 30 years and, like the preceding harsh summer [[drought]],&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adrc.asia"/&gt; could have been the result of [[global warming]]. The [[United Nations]] provided major aid due to the high level of damage caused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocha.unog.ch/fts/reports/daily/ocha_R10_E13681_asof___1001131504.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[snowstorms]] between the 8 and 28 May 2008, 21 people were killed and 100 others went missing in seven provinces in eastern Mongolia.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/21%20dead%20in%20mongolian%20snowstorms/2262922]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6420239.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/enviornment/snowstorm-kills-21-in-mongolia_10053779.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The toll finally reached at least 52 people and 200,000 livestock by the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/351407/1/.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the victims were herders who froze to death along with their livestock.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"/&gt; It was the worst [[cold wave|cold snap]] since the founding of the modern state in 1922.

Snowstorms in December 2009 – February 2010 also killed 8,000,000 livestock and 60 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4205&amp;Itemid=36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Witness''' is an international [[NGO]] established in 1993 that works to break the links between natural resource exploitation, conflict, [[poverty]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], and [[human rights abuse]]s worldwide. The organisation has offices in [[London]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] Global Witness states that it does not have any political affiliation. [[Gillian Caldwell]] joined the organisation as Executive Director in July 2015 and [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)]] was appointed Chair in March 2016.

Investigation by Global Witness in April 2014 revealed there were nearly three times as many environmental defenders killed in 2012 than 10 years previously. Global Witness documented 147 deaths in 2012, compared to 51 in 2002. In Brazil 448 activists defending natural resources were killed between 2002 and 2013, in Honduras 109, Peru 58, Philippines 67 and Thailand 16. Many of those facing threats are ordinary people opposing land grabs, mining operations and the industrial timber trade, often forced from their homes and severely threatened by environmental devastation. Others have been killed for protests over hydroelectric dams, pollution and wildlife conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/15/surge-deaths-environmental-activists-global-witness-report Surge in deaths of environmental activists over past decade, report finds] The Guardian 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Witness states that its goals are to expose the corrupt [[exploitation of natural resources]] and international trade systems, to drive campaigns that end [[impunity]], resource linked conflict, and [[human right]]s and environmental abuses.&lt;ref name="markboultondesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/about_us.html|title=Global Witness|author=Mark Boulton Design|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation explores how diamonds and other natural resources can fund conflict or fuel corruption. It carries out investigations into the involvement of specific individuals and business entities in activities such as illegal and unsustainable forest exploitation, and corruption in oil, gas and mining industries.

Global Witness’ methodology combines investigative research, publishing reports and conducting advocacy campaigns. Reports are disseminated to [[governments]], [[intergovernmental organizations]], [[civil society]] and the [[News media|media]]. This is intended to shape global policy and change international thinking about the extraction and trading of [[natural resources]] and the impacts that [[Political corruption|corrupt]] and [[sustainable|unsustainable]] [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] can have upon [[human development (humanity)|development]], [[human rights]] and [[geopolitical]] and [[economic]] [[Economic stability|stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org|title=Global Witness|author=Mark Boulton Design|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

Global Witness has worked on diamonds, oil, timber, cocoa, gas, gold and other minerals. It has undertaken investigations and case studies in [[Cambodia]], [[Angola]], [[Liberia]], [[DR Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Burma]], [[Indonesia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. It has also helped to set up international initiatives such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eiti.org/supporters/civilsociety%7ctitle=Stakeholders%7cwork=eiti.org|title=Stakeholders|work=eiti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kimberley Process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/structure/working_group_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216222451/http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/structure/working_group_en.html |archivedate=2009-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Publish What You Pay coalition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/where/country/united-kingdom{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's first campaign involved work against  the trade of illegal timber between Cambodia and Thailand which was funding the [[Khmer Rouge]] guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/about-us/our-history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902042845/http://www.globalwitness.org/about-us/our-history |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Witness argues that natural resources can be, and have been, exploited to fund armies and militias who murder, rape, and commit other human rights abuses against civilians. It says that "natural resources can potentially be used to negotiate and maintain peace"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/data/files/pages/2009_annual_review.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902190622/http://www.globalwitness.org/data/files/pages/2009_annual_review.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "could be the key to ending Africa's poverty".&lt;ref name="markboultondesign"/&gt;

=== Cambodia ===

Global Witness’s first campaign was in Cambodia in the 1990s where the Khmer Rouge was smuggling timber into Thailand. ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper attributed the cessation to Global Witness's "detailed and accurate reporting".&lt;ref&gt;Observer Newspaper, "Going Underground", by John Sweeney, 26 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

After a report implicating relatives of Prime Minister Hun Sen and other senior government officials, the prime minister's brother, Hun Neng, who is also a provincial governor, was quoted in a Cambodian newspaper as saying if anyone from Global Witness returned to Cambodia, he would "hit them until their heads are broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |title=The dangers for journalists who expose environmental issues |date=September 2009 |page=2 |url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/rapport_en_md.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331092550/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/rapport_en_md.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Global Witness released ''Country for Sale'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/713/en/country_for_sale|title=Country for Sale|work=globalwitness.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208135344/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/713/en/country_for_sale|archivedate=2009-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a report on corruption in the allocation of Cambodia's natural resource licenses. In 2010 the report, ''Shifting Sand'', was published. It examined sand dredging for export to Singapore. The report claimed that the trade was "monopolised by two prominent Cambodian senators with close ties to Prime Minister Hun Sen".&lt;ref&gt;Global Witness, ''Shifting Sand, how Singapore's demand for Cambodian sand threatens ecosystems and undermines good governance'', May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blood diamonds ===
In 1998 Global Witness released the report, ''A Rough Trade—The Role of Companies and Governments in the Angolan Conflict'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/90/en/a_rough_trade|title=A Rough Trade|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the role of the international diamond trade in funding the [[Angolan Civil War]].

=== Sierra Leone ===
As part of its campaign against conflict diamonds, Global Witness helped establish the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]] (KCPS). The international governmental certification scheme  was set up to stop to trade in blood diamonds, requiring governments to certify that shipments of rough diamonds are conflict-free.&lt;ref name="globalwitness.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/campaigns/conflict/conflict-diamonds/kimberley-process|title=The Kimberley Process|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other [[Sub-Saharan African]] (SSA) countries, [[Sierra Leone]] is endowed with oil and mineral resources amid social inequality, high prevalence of poverty, and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Omeje, K., eds. ''Extractive Economies and Conflicts in the Global South Multi Regional Perspectives on Rentier Politics''. Hampshire/Burlington: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under rebel movements headed by [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who dominated the diamond industry, diamonds were being traded for guns with the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/campaigns/conflict/post-conflict/liberia/liberia-sierra-leone-and-charles-taylor|title=History of the Conflict|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rebel group alone earned as much as US$125 m. In 1998, Global Witness stated that diamonds were spurring those conflicts. Backed by investigation done by the UN in 2000, it was then verified that the gems were being smuggled out of eastern Sierra Leone through Liberia, and subsequently into the international market.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Sanctions were later imposed by the UN on Liberian diamonds in March 2001.

On July 19, 2000, the [[World Diamond Congress]] adopted at Antwerp a resolution to reinforce the diamond industry's ability to block sales of conflict diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;World Diamond Council website: DiamondFacts.org (accessed February 20, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, with growing international pressure from Global Witness and other NGOs, meetings were hosted with diamond-producing countries over three years, concluding in the establishment of an international diamond certification scheme in January 2003.  The certification system on the export and import of diamonds, known as the KCPS, was called by the resolution, imposing legislation in all countries to accept shipment of only officially sealed packages of diamonds accompanied by a KP certificate guaranteeing that they were conflict-free. Anyone found trafficking conflict diamonds will be indicted of criminal charges, while bans were to be imposed on individuals found trading those stones from diamond bourses under the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]].

The [[Kimberley Process]] (KP) in Sierra Leone was efficient in limiting the flow of conflict diamonds.  More importantly, the KP assisted in restoring peace and security in the lives of these people, and, by creating stability in these environments, it spurred their development.  It was successful at channelling larger amounts of diamonds into the international market, boosting government revenues, and consequently aiding in tackling development concerns.  In 2006, an estimated US$125 m worth of diamonds were legally exported from Sierra Leone, compared to almost none in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="globalwitness.org"/&gt;

Despite its success, nine years later, on 5 December 2011, Global Witness announced that it has left the KP, stating that the scheme's main flaws have not been mended as governments no longer continue to show interest in reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/library/global-witness-leaves-kimberley-process-calls-diamond-trade-be-held-accountable|title=Global Witness leaves Kimberley Process, calls for diamond trade to be held accountable|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil, gas, and mining ===
Global Witness campaigns for greater transparency in the oil, gas, and mining sectors. It is a founding member of the Publish What You Pay (PWYP) coalition, which advocates "the mandatory disclosure of company payments and government revenues from the oil, gas, and mining sector". Over 300 civil society groups worldwide are member of PWYP. Other PWYP founders include CAFOD, [[Oxfam]], [[Save the Children]] UK, [[Transparency International]] UK, and [[George Soros]], Chairman of the [[Open Society Institute]].

Global Witness helped establish the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] (EITI), which was announced by then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg in September 2002 and formally endorsed by the [[World Bank]] in December 2003. The EITI is a result of the efforts of the PWYP campaigners. It is now supported by a majority of the world's oil, mining and gas companies and institutional investors, in total worth US$8.3 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:20143509~menuPK:34463~pagePK:64003015~piPK:64003012~theSitePK:4607,00.html|title=News &amp; Broadcast - WBG Endorses Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Witness is a member of the EITI International Advisory Group and sits on the EITI board.

=== Democratic Republic of Congo ===
Global Witness is active on a range of issues in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC). Their website section on DRC reads, "Politicians, military and militia groups have plundered the country's natural wealth and used it to enrich themselves at the detriment of the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/democratic_republic_of_congo.html|title=Democratic Republic of Congo|work=globalwitness.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902191524/http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/democratic_republic_of_congo.html|archivedate=2010-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Witness has lobbied the UK government and the UN Security Council to stop the trade in minerals fuelling war in eastern Congo.

Global Witness defines conflict resources as "natural resources whose systematic exploitation and trade in a context of conflict contribute to, benefit from or result in the commission of serious violations of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law or violations amounting to crimes under international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/definition_of_conflict_resources.html |title=Conflict |work=globalwitness.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602192048/http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/definition_of_conflict_resources.html |archivedate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forests ===
Global Witness has done a lot of work on forests. It produced reports on how timber helped to fund the civil war in Liberia and also looked at timber smuggling from Burma into China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/137/en/timber_taylor_soldier_spy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902223624/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/137/en/timber_taylor_soldier_spy |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Global Witness launched a court case in France against DLH, a company that they allege bought timber from Liberian companies during the civil war between 2001–2003, thereby providing support to Charles Taylor's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/886/en/bankrolling_brutality_why_european_timber_company_ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902215349/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/886/en/bankrolling_brutality_why_european_timber_company_ |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Witness describes forests as the "last bastion against climate change", with deforestation accounting for 18 percent of total global carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name="forests"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/forests.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912024505/http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/forests.html |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On UN efforts to broker a deal on "Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation" (REDD) Global Witness said: "REDD carries considerable risks for forests and local communities and will only succeed if civil society is engaged as an independent watchdog to ensure that the money is used in accordance with national laws and international guidelines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0603-hance_corruption_redd.html|title=Corruption could undermine REDD|work=Mongabay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Witness criticizes the [[World Bank]]-endorsed approach of encouraging industrial export-based logging as a means to economic growth in developing countries, which, it argues, has been repeatedly shown to fail. Instead, Global Witness advocates management strategies that benefit the communities that are dependent on forests, their home countries, the environment, and treats forests as an "international asset".&lt;ref name="forests"/&gt;

==Recent==

=== Anonymous companies ===
Global Witness campaigns against [[S.A. (corporation)|anonymous companies]] and for [[Register of beneficial ownership|registers of beneficial ownership]]. Anonymous companies are a legal business practice but can be used for purposes such as laundering money from criminal activity, financing terrorism, or [[tax evasion|evading taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Wired, [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-10/17/charmian-gooch Charmian Gooch: anonymous company ownership is fuelling corruption] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507172554/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-10/17/charmian-gooch |date=2016-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banks ===
In 2009 Global Witness launched a campaign on the role of banks in facilitating corruption. Its report, ''Undue Diligence'',&lt;ref name="globalwitness.org1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/735/en/undue_diligence_how_banks_do_business_with_corrupt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902190327/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/735/en/undue_diligence_how_banks_do_business_with_corrupt |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; names some of the major banks that have done business with corrupt regimes. It argues that "by accepting these customers, banks are assisting those who are using state assets to enrich themselves or brutalise their own people" and that "this corruption denies the world's poorest people the chance to lift themselves out of poverty and leaves them dependent on aid."&lt;ref name="globalwitness.org1"/&gt;

Global Witness is on the Coordinating Committee of [[Taskforce on Financial Integrity and Economic Development]], and is a member of [[BankTrack]], and the [[UNCAC Coalition of Civil Society Organisations]]. In May 2009, Global Witness employee, Anthea Lawson, testified before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on "Capital Loss, Corruption and the Role of Western Financial Institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, 111th Congress, First Session |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/111-34.pdf|format=PDf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''The Guardian'' dated 9 February 2010, Ms Lawson accused UK banks of "demonstrated complicity" in corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/09/bae-systems-corruption-tax-havens|title=Letters: Banks, tax havens and corruption|work=The Guardian | location=London|date=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sudan ===
Global Witness has campaigned for transparency in Sudan's oil industry. Global Witness published ''Fuelling Mistrust'' in June 2009, a report that detailed discrepancies of up to 26 percent between the production figures published by the Sudanese government and those published by the main oil company operating in the region, CNPC. A peace deal between the north and the south was predicated on an agreement to share the revenues from oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/804/en/fuelling_mistrust_the_need_for_transparency_in_sud|title=Fuelling Mistrust: The need for transparency in Sudan's oil industry|work=globalwitness.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zimbabwe diamonds ===
In June 2010, Global Witness criticized Zimbabwe for large-scale human rights abuses committed in the Marange diamond fields. It published a report ''Return of the Blood Diamond'' which criticised the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for repeatedly failing to react effectively to the crisis in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/993/en/return_of_the_blood_diamond_how_the_crisis_in_zimb |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902192749/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/993/en/return_of_the_blood_diamond_how_the_crisis_in_zimb |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 Tendai Midzi, writing in The ''Zimbabwe Guardian'', accused Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada of being "but a figment of the western governments they represent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkzimbabwe.com/kimberley-process---the-new-colonial-project-cms-534 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005005450/http://www.talkzimbabwe.com/kimberley-process---the-new-colonial-project-cms-534 |archivedate=2010-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===

Global Witness exposed corruption in land deals within the administration of [[Taib Mahmud]], the chief minister of the state of [[Sarawak]] in [[Malaysia]] through the video titled "Inside Malaysia's Shadow State."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/insideshadowstate/|title=Inside Malaysia’s Shadow State|publisher=Global Witness|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video featured footage of conversations with relatives of Taib and their lawyer where Global Witness agents posed as potential investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/3/19/nation/20130319225808&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322065541/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F3%2F19%2Fnation%2F20130319225808&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-03-22|title=Taib denies cousins his land brokers, says he goes by government procedures|date=19 March 2013|work=The Star Online|accessdate=20 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income==
The majority of Global Witness funding comes from grants made by [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundations]], governments, and [[charities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/our_funders.html|title=Our supporters|work=globalwitness.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902185631/http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/our_funders.html|archivedate=2010-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their main benefactors is the [[Open Society Institute]], which also funds [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/|title=Open Society Foundations|work=soros.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Witness also receives money from the Norwegian and British governments, the Adessium Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adessium.org/|title=Adessium|work=adessium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oxfam Novib.

In an interview in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2007, Patrick Alley, one of the founding directors, rejected the claim that receiving money from governments could bias their campaigns: "Being campaign-led, rather than funding-led, means that our independence is never comprised," he argued. "The Department for Trade and Industry did once ask if we'd like to sign a confidentiality clause. We said we wouldn't take the funding under those conditions. No other government has ever tried to impose any restrictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jan/31/voluntarysector.conservation|title=Rough diamonds|author=Alison Benjamin|work=the Guardian|location=London|date=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2008 to November 2009 Global Witness's income was £3,831,831. Of this, approximately 61 percent came in the form of grants from private trusts and foundations, 33 percent from governments, three percent from multi-lateral and non governmental organisations, and three percent from bank interest and other sources. Global Witness says it spends 75 percent of its funds on campaigns, seven percent on communication and fundraising, and 18 percent on support and governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Witness Annual Report, 2009, Financial Information |page=27 |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/data/files/pages/2009_annual_review.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902190622/http://www.globalwitness.org/data/files/pages/2009_annual_review.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hilger &amp; Watts''' was a well-known British manufacturing company that made [[theodolite]]s and [[scientific instrument]]s.

==History==
It was founded on 20 February 1948 when Adam Hilger, Ltd, founded in 1874, merged with Messrs E. R. Watts and Son, founded in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v161/n4088/abs/161345a0.html Nature March 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It employed around 1,300 people in six factories in the late 1940s. It was situated on Camberwell Road ([[A215 road]]) in Camberwell, near the junction with the B214, between [[Walworth]] (to the north) and [[Camberwell]] (to the south) on the western edge of [[Burgess Park]], now part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]].  There was a factory in Highbury, together with the head office in Camden Town and a small factory situated between Margate and Ramsgate in Kent.  These locations were primarily "Hilger" products, whereas Camberwell was primarily Watts products.  Amongst other devices, the Camden location produced PDP-8 computer driven X-Ray diffractometers in the late 1960's. At least one of which is believed to be still functional at Oxford University Chemistry Dept. in 2017.

==Products==
* [[Optical instrument]]s
* [[Photometer]]s
* Theodolite and [[List of surveying instruments|surveying equipment]]
* [[Tripod (surveying)|Tripod]]s
* Computer controlled X-Ray diffractometers

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">The '''Horcón Tract''' is a small tract of land (a ''banco'') that, prior to 1905, was situated north of the [[Rio Grande]] in Texas.  As the Rio Grande formed the international border, the tract was unambiguously American territory.  In July 1906, however, the [[American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company]] dug a cutoff to shorten the course of the river, thus bypassing the tract. As a result, the {{Convert|461|acre|km2}} of the tract (including the former riverbed) became located south of the river. The company was eventually taken to court and fined for the diversion of the river, and the land was agreed to remain American territory, in accordance with the border treaty.&lt;ref name=Cantu/&gt;  In 1929 the town of [[Rio Rico, Tamaulipas|Río Rico]] was founded near the tract on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.&lt;ref name=Cantu&gt;''[http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol17/2748.pdf Matter of Cantu]'' 17 Immigration &amp; Naturalization Dec. 190, 190-91 ([[Board of Immigration Appeals|BIA]], 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Rio Grande changed its course after floods, the settlement was progressively pushed into the tract.&lt;ref name=Cantu/&gt;  The residents, being mostly of Mexican heritage, accepted the authority of the Mexican government and all parties generally acted as if the tract was Mexican territory. However, the United States never actually relinquished the land, and the issue was re-discovered decades later by a researcher.  The [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] provided for the Horcón Tract to revert to Mexico upon the completion of two new flood control projects.  Thus in 1977 the United States officially ceded the tract of land to Mexico.&lt;ref name="tshaonline"&gt;{{cite web |year= 2009 |url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrr53|title = Río Rico, Texas|publisher = [[Handbook of Texas]]| accessdate = April 10, 2012 | last= McDonald, Laurier B. |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] later determined that persons born in the Horcón Tract between 1906 and 1972 could not be deported, effectively if not technically granting citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol17/2748.pdf ''Matter of Cantu''], 17 Immigration &amp; Naturalization Dec. 190, 194 (BIA 1978)("''Either the Government has established, ... that the respondent is an alien, or it has not; if it has not, it is not incumbent upon this Board to go the additional step of determining whether he is also a citizen. That determination can be left to some future date and some other process.''")&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, a large portion of the population of Rio Rico moved to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= September 26, 1987 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/26/world/south-of-border-was-once-north.html|title = South of Border Was Once North|publisher = [[New York Times]]| accessdate = November 11, 2013 | last= Rohter, Larry |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Ibn Said was born at [[Alcalá la Real]] near [[Granada]] to a prominent family which was descended from the Companion of the Prophet [[Ammar ibn Yasir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ch.|first1=Pellat,|title=Ibn Saʿīd al-Mag̲h̲ribī|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-said-al-maghribi-SIM_3351?s.num=528&amp;s.rows=100&amp;s.start=520|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his family members were literary figures,&lt;ref&gt;''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond'', selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Marrakesh]]. He subsequently studied in [[Seville]] and stayed in [[Tunis]], [[Alexandria]], [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Aleppo]]. At the age of 30, he undertook a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond'', selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a close friend of the [[Muladi]] poet Ibn Mokond Al-Lishboni (of [[Lisbon]]). His last years were spent in Tunis, and he died there in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond'', selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==

Ibn Said al-Maghribi wrote or compiled 'at least forty works on various branches of knowledge'.&lt;ref&gt;''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond'', selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Said's best known achievement was the completion of the fifteen-volume ''[[al-Mughrib fī ḥulā l-Maghrib]]'' ('The Extraordinary Book on the Adornments of the West'), which had been started over a century before by Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥijārī (1106-55) at the behest of Ibn Said's great-grandfather ‘Abd al-Malik. Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥijārī completed 6 volumes, ‘Abd al-Malik added to them; two of ‘Abd al-Malik's sons (Ibn Said's grandfather and great uncle) added more; Ibn Said's father worked on it further; and Ibn Said completed it.&lt;ref&gt;''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond'', selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is also known as the ''Kitāb al-Mughrib'' ('book of the Maghrib'), and is midway between an anthology of poetry and a geography, collecting information on the poets of Maghreb organized by geographical origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/maghrib.html |title= Ibn Said: Book of the Maghrib, 13th Century|accessdate=2007-12-16 |work= Internet Medieval Source Book |publisher=Fordham University Center for Medieval Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the ''Mughrib'' circulated separately as ''[[Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn]]'' (''Banners of the Champions and the Standards of the Distinguished''), which Ibn Said compiled in Cairo, completing it on 21 June 1243 (641 by Islamic dating).&lt;ref&gt;''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond'', selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, in the words of Louis Cromption, 'perhaps the most important' of the various medieval Andalucian poetry anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, 'Male Love and Islamic Law in Arab Spain', in ''Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature'', ed. by Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe (New York: New York University Press, 1997), pp. 142-58 (at p. 154).&lt;/ref&gt; 'His aim in compiling the collection seems to have been to show that poetry produced in the West was as good as anything the East had to offer (and that stuff by Ibn Sa'id and his family was especially good)'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Irwin, ''The Penguin Anthology of Classical Arabic Literature'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1999), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indefatigable traveller, Ibn Said was profoundly interested in geography. In 1250 he wrote his ''Kitab bast al- ard fi 't -t ul wa-'l-'ard'' (The Book of the Extension of the Land on Longitudes and Latitudes). His ''Kitab al-Jughrafiya'' (''Geography'') embodies the experience of his extensive travels through the Muslim world and on the shores of the Indian Ocean. He also gives an account of parts of northern Europe including [[Ireland]] and [[Iceland]]. He visited Armenia and was at the Court of [[Hulagu Khan]] from 1256 to 1265.

An example of Ibn Sa'id's own poems, which he included in the ''Rāyāt al-mubarrizīn wa-ghāyāt al-mumayyazīn'', is "Black horse with a white chest", here from [[Cola Franzen]]'s translation into English of [[Emilio García Gómez|Gómez]]'s 1930 Spanish translation:&lt;ref name=gomez&gt;{{cite book|last=Gómez|first=translated by [[Cola Franzen]] from the Spanish versions of Emilio García|title=Poems of Arab Andalusia|year=1989|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEHb0lmTvS8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Poemas+ar%C3%A1bigoandaluces#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-87286-242-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Black hindquarters, white chest:&lt;br /&gt;
he flies on the wings of the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you look at him you see dark night&lt;br /&gt;

in him, and take no care for the words&lt;br /&gt;
of would-be troublemakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Men's eyes light up when they see&lt;br /&gt;
reflected in his beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
the clear strong black and white&lt;br /&gt;
of the eyes of beautiful women.

The '''International Geographical Union''' ('''IGU'''; {{lang-fr|'''Union Géographique Internationale'''}}, '''UGI''') is an international [[geography|geographical]] society. The first International Geographical Congress was held in [[Antwerp]] in 1871. Subsequent meetings led to the establishment of the permanent organization in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in 1922. 

The International Geographical Union adheres to the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and the [[International Social Science Council]] (ISSC), which it recognizes as coordinating bodies for the international organization of science.

== Objectives ==
The IGU has seven objectives or aims:

# to promote the study of geographical problems;
# to initiate and co-ordinate geographical research requiring international co-operation and to promote its scientific discussion and publication;
# to provide for the participation of geographers in the work of relevant international organizations;
# to facilitate the collection and diffusion of geographical data and documentation in and between all member countries;
# to promote International Geographical Congresses, regional conferences and specialized symposia related to the objectives of the Union;
# to participate in any other appropriate form of international co-operation with the object of advancing the study and application of geography;
# to promote international standardization or compatibility of methods, nomenclature, and symbols employed in geography.

[[Image:ITM example 2007-06-05.jpg|right|300px|thumb|ITM coordinates on an OSi map from 2006. In this example the easting and the northing are separated by a comma.]]
[[Image:ITM map of Ireland.svg|right|300px|thumb|An illustration of ITM coordinates over a map of Ireland. Eastings are on the top/bottom. Northings are on the right/left.]]
'''Irish Transverse Mercator''' ('''ITM''') is the [[geographic coordinate system]] for Ireland. It was implemented jointly by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] (OSi) and the [[Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland]] (OSNI) in 2001. The name is derived from the [[Transverse Mercator]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimised for the island of Ireland.

==History==
The older [[Irish grid reference system]] required GPS measurements to be "translated" (using [[Coordinate system#Transformations|co-ordinate transformations]]). The more precise the GPS measurements were, the more the translation process introduced inaccuracies.

While the existing [[Universal Transverse Mercator|UTM]] co-ordinate system partly fulfilled the requirement for direct GPS compatibility it had some drawbacks, including varying levels of distortion across the island due to the central meridian being at the west coast of Ireland.

The new system needed to satisfy various criteria: GPS compatibility, map distortion for the whole island of Ireland had to be minimal, it was to be [[Map projection#Conformal|conformal]] and backward compatible with existing mapping. A customised Transverse Mercator projection was chosen.

ITM and the older more established Irish Grid will (initially at least) be used in parallel. As a result ITM coordinates had to be obviously different so users would not confuse the two. This was done by shifting the ITM false origin further into the Atlantic and thereby creating substantially different co-ordinate numbers for any given location.

While OSi and OSNI intend to supply map information in the older Irish Grid format into the future, the Irish Institution of Surveyors has recommended that ITM be adopted as soon as possible as the preferred official co-ordinate system for Ireland.

==Examples==

An ITM co-ordinate is generally given as a pair of two six-digit numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[easting]] and the second is the [[northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].

The ITM co-ordinate for the [[Spire of Dublin]] on [[O'Connell Street]] is:

:715830, 734697

The first figure is the easting and means that the location is 715,830 metres east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 734,697 metres north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]])

The equivalent Irish Grid co-ordinate for the same location is:

:315904, 234671

The Spire of Dublin example provides a [[Position fixing|fix]] for a location that is accurate to 1 metre. With ITM it is possible to give a more accurate co-ordinate for a given location by using a decimal point after the initial six figure easting and northing.

The ITM co-ordinate for the passive GPS station at the OSi office is:

:E 709885.081m, N 736167.699m

This ITM co-ordinate has three digits behind the decimal point which gives a fix for a location with millimetre accuracy. Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an “E” and likewise an “N” for the northing. The fact that the co-ordinate is in metres is indicated by the lowercase m.

With ITM there is no provision for using [[Myriad (unit of area)|myriad]] letters and truncated coordinates as there is with the Irish Grid.
Every co-ordinate must be given with at least a six digit easting and northing from the false origin.

'''Israel Summer Time''' ({{lang-he|שעון קיץ}} ''{{transl|he|sha'on kayits&amp;nbsp;}}'' "Summer Clock"), also in English, '''Israel Daylight Time''' ('''IDT''') is the practice in [[Israel]] by which clocks are advanced by one hour, beginning on the Friday before the last Sunday of March, and ending on the last Sunday of October.

==History==

===Pre–1992===
Before 1992, [[daylight saving time|daylight saving]] was governed by the ''[[Time Act]]'', a law inherited by Israel from the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]], which started to use daylight saving in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=83qIZusvtXYYxP7f2arP59ARtsJmc2LVsBPnAjP0JYnyMMohxQewtfVtBWfTIUX6Yw%3D%3D|script-title=he:״שעון קיץ״|last = Tversky|first = Joshua|date = 6 April 1943|work = 'HaTzofe'|accessdate = 25 August 2014|language = Hebrew|trans-title="Summer clock"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer Time was introduced in Israel between the years 1948–1957, but the length of Daylight Saving Time has changed significantly depending on the year. In 1951–1952, it was enacted for about seven months, whereas in the years 1953–1954 it was enacted for only three months. In 1958, daylight saving time was canceled. Due to the [[1973 oil crisis|global energy crisis]] because of the aftermath of the [[Yom Kippur War]], Summer Time was enacted again from 1974–1975.

Up until 1992, daylight saving time was operated by an order of the [[Internal Affairs Minister of Israel|minister of the interior]]. In 1980 the authority of the minister for this matter was contested in an appeal to the supreme court. The supreme court decided that the minister's authority was indeed more limited than the common practice, as he may only decide on the dates of IDT while its operation is unquestionable. Following this decision the Knesset amended the Time Act so the minister will also have the authority to abolish IDT in a certain year.

===1992–2005===
The ''Law Determining the Time'' ({{lang-he|חוק קביעת הזמן}} ''{{transl|he|Hok Kvi'at Hazman}}'') is an [[Israel]] law governing Israeli [[daylight saving time]]. It was approved by the [[Knesset]] in 1992, replacing the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] time act inherited by Israel. The 1992 time zone law cancelled the Time Act, and stipulated that IDT will be operated for at least 150 days each year, and that the final dates will be decided by the minister of the Interior, subject to the approval of the Knesset committee for internal affairs. In some years the decision as to which day summer time would start or end was made at the very last minute due to political haggling and this caused disruption to international airline schedules at [[Ben Gurion Airport]].{{cn|date=December 2016}} A tragicomical demonstration of the uncertainty around IDT was in 1999 when two [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] car bombs exploded one hour too early, killing only the bombers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1999-38.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

This schedule was variable: the only requirement was that there be at least 150 days per year of IDT, and the dates were set out each year by the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/g.html#i |title=Daylight Saving Time in Middle East |publisher=Webexhibits.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2011}}

===2005–2012===
Until 2005, the start and end of IDT each year was established in an ad hoc fashion as the result of haggling between political parties representing various sectors of Israeli society. Parties representing religious groups wanted the start delayed till after [[Passover]] and the end to precede [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, while the secular parties would argue for starting it earlier and ending it later. Thus, there was no established rule that could guarantee a predictable changeover in either direction. The debates about a fixed rule for determining the dates of IDT went on for years, and resulted in a suggestion that IDT will start on the 2nd day of Passover and end on the weekend between [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. This suggestion was rejected as it stipulated an annual IDT period of only 5 months, and yet it served as the basis of the final compromise. After 2005, the annual debate has been effectively ended.

In the past, the unpredictability of IDT in Israel became frustrating enough that [[Microsoft Windows]] stopped trying to track changes and just made Israeli time be [[Greenwich Mean Time]] plus two hours (GMT+2) (and disabled the daylight saving option). This has led to various ad hoc solutions to the problem in Windows systems and other Microsoft software (e.g. [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] calendar entries are often off by an hour when shared, due to the lack of IDT support). On November 17, 2009, Microsoft released an update that has daylight saving time enabled for Israel.  However, the date for transition back to Standard Time is set as the Second Sunday of September, regardless of the Hebrew Calendar date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/KB/976098 |title=December 2009 cumulative time zone update for Microsoft Windows operating systems |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 7]] does contain correct IDT times up to 2023, but not all software makes use of this extra information.

In 2010, due to an unusually large difference between the lunar based Hebrew calendar and the solar calendar the date of the return to winter time was September 12, which was very early. This sparked protests by the more secular public, and calls for a change in the way the date is determined. Many members of the government were sympathetic to this and at one point in the ensuing row the Minister even proposed moving to winter time just for [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement and then returning to summer time. In September 2010 the argument over the dates for summer time reached new heights and some firms even refused to adopt it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grimland |first=Guy |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/high-tech-firms-refuse-clock-switch-until-late-october-1.313456 |title=High-tech firms refuse clock switch until late October - Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service |first=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/dalia-itzik-to-rabbis-find-a-solution-to-daylight-saving-time-crisis-1.312356?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Dalia Itzik to rabbis: Find a solution to daylight saving time crisis - Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2011, Internal Affairs Minister [[Eli Yishai]] announced his support for extending IDT, setting the ending time to the beginning of October. The change required the approval of the Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-to-get-a-longer-summer-1.366267 |title=Israel to get a longer summer |first=Jonathan |last=Lis |work=Haaretz |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–Present===
On November 5, 2012, the Israeli Knesset approved the bill to extend IDT to a period of 193 days, beginning on the Friday before the last Sunday in March (at 2:00 local time, or 0:00 UTC, clocks are moved forward by one hour), and ending on the first Sunday after October 1 (at 2:00 IDT or 23:00 UTC Saturday, clocks are moved back by one hour).   

If the end of IDT falls on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, then IDT will end on the first Monday after October 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/israel-dst-extend-2013.html|title=DST in Israel to be extended in 2013|work=timeanddate.com |date=5 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2013, the Israeli Knesset approved the bill to extend IDT even further. According to the bill, IDT will begin on the Friday before the last Sunday of March, and end on the last Sunday of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Knesset-votes-to-extend-Daylight-Saving-Time-319157|title=Knesset votes to extend Daylight Saving Time|work=jpost.com |date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Morris Blaut''' (October 20, 1927 – November 11, 2000), also known as '''J. M. Blaut''', was a professor of anthropology and geography at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. His studies focused on the agricultural [[microgeography]] (geographical activity of villagers), cultural ecology, theory of [[nationalism]], philosophy of science, historiography and the relations between the [[First World|First]] and the [[Third World]]. He is known as one of the most notable critics of [[Eurocentrism]]. Blaut was one of the most widely read authors in the field of geography.&lt;ref name=kmds&gt;Kent Mathewson; David Stea, [http://www.marxmail.org/BlautMemorial.pdf ''In memoriam: James M. Blaut (1927–2000)''] ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 93(1), 2003, pp. 214–222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
James Morris Blaut was born on October 20, 1927 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; He attended the [[Little Red School House]] and [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; He entered the [[University of Chicago]] in 1944 at the age of sixteen, as part of the program for advanced high-school students, and achieved two bachelor's degrees (in 1948 and 1950).&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; Next, from 1948 to 1949, he studied in the [[New School for Social Research]], from 1949 to 1950 at the [[Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture]] in [[Trinidad]], and from 1950 at [[Louisiana State University]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; After the end of the [[Korean War]], he also served in the [[US Army]], and was involved in an incident which resulted in [[court-martial]] of his commander and the dismissal of the camp’s commandant.&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt;

He received his PhD in 1958, at which time he was already working at the [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; In 1960 he moved to [[University of Puerto Rico]], where he stayed till 1963.&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; In 1964 he moved to the [[College of the Virgin Islands]].  In 1967 he returned to the United States for a position at [[Clark University]], where in 1969 he helped establish the ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode Journal]]'' and the [[Union of Socialist Geographers]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; In 1971, told that his activities and ideas were too extreme for Clark, he moved back to the [[University of Puerto Rico]], and finally to [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt;

Blaut's death in 2000 prevented him from finishing his trilogy of books criticizing Eurocentric theories of a "[[European miracle]]". (It begins with ''The Colonizer’s Model of the World'' and is followed by the ''Eight Eurocentric Historians'').&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt;

He was a member and activist of [[Henry A. Wallace]]’s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]].  He supported a variety of activists' campaigns during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt; He was also a supporter of the [[Puerto Rican independence movement]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
Blaut received several awards for distinguished service and scholarship, such as the [[Association of American Geographers]]'s Distinguished Scholarship Award in 1997.

The Cultural and Political Ecology Study Group of the Association of American Geographers issues the annual [http://www2.stetson.edu/cape/Honors/honors.htm James M. Blaut Award] in recognition of innovative scholarship in cultural and political ecology. The Socialist and Critical Geography Specialty Group of the AAG also issues a James Blaut Award and has a Memorial Lecture.

In his private life, his hobbies included [[bird watching]].&lt;ref name=kmds/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4868">'''João de Trasto''' is the name sometimes given to an obscure (and possibly fictional) [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] mariner, who is alleged to have captained the first [[exploration|exploratory]] expedition dispatched by Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] in 1415.  
 
The only record of João de Trasto or the 1415 expedition is a brief mention in the personal memoirs of [[Diogo Gomes]], a former Henrican captain.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo Gomes "De prima inventione Guineae", as first published in 1847, in J.A. Schmeller, ''Abhandlungen der Philosophisch-Philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften'', Munich, Vol. 4 (3), [https://books.google.com/books?id=-EREAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.19].&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Gomes, "Johannes de Trasto" commanded an expedition in 1415, dispatched by Henry the Navigator.  Probably departing from the port of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], the Trasto expedition was forced by foul weather to the part of the [[Grand Canary]] island subsequently called  ''Telli''.  Returning to Portugal, he again encountered a fierce [[storm]] and only with great difficulty arrived in [[port]].&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Major (1868: [https://books.google.com/books?id=x249AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64-65])&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer Diogo Gomes was not an eyewitness to the event (Gomes was not born until the 1420s) and his memoirs were dictated many decades later, at the end of his life, c.1490s, and are known to contain numerous small errors of dates and facts. As the historian R.H. Major writes, after retelling the Trasto story in his 1868 edition, "there is however so much that is manifestly inaccurate in other statements of Diego Gomes respecting the early voyages which he narrates from hearsay, that we cannot be perfectly sure that the date here applied to the earliest expedition is correct."&lt;ref&gt;Major (1868: p.65). For more on the unreliability of Diogo Gomes's memoirs, see Russell (2000: p.328-29).&lt;/ref&gt; In later editions of his work, Major removed all mention of "João de Trasto".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R.H. Major (1877). Any such passage would have come after [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrkEAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.53].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, most historians have doubted the existence of 'João de Trasto' and this expedition.   It is usually omitted in modern scholarly histories of the [[Portuguese discoveries]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Diffie and Winius (1973), Russell (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have suggested that Diogo Gomes probably meant to refer to D. [[Fernando de Castro]], who is indeed recorded to have led a failed expedition to [[Gran Canaria]] for Henry the Navigator in 1424.&lt;ref&gt;Arruda (1932: lxiv); Peres (1943: p.46); Cortesão (1969: p.95)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it seems "Trasto" is a mistranscription in the first (1847) printed edition of Diogo Gomes's letter, that the original manuscript actually read "Crasto" (probably meaning "Castro").&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Pereira, 1899, ''Boletim da Sociedade de Geographia de Lisboa'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=-USdAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA264-IA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.264], 270). This reading is adhered to by later historians, e.g. Peres, Cortesão, Diffie &amp; Winius, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro did have a brother named João, and that might have been the source of confusion,&lt;ref&gt;Diffie &amp; Winius (1973: p.58). João de Castro is briefly mentioned fighting alongside his brother Fernando de Castro in [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]]'s account of the [[battle of Ceuta]] (Ch. 86), but he is nowhere to be found in Zurara's chronicle of the discoveries.&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively, Gomes's interpreter or transcriber simply misheard "João" for "Fernão".

[[File:India Khandesh locator map.svg|thumb|Area comprising the Khandesh region of Maharashtra.]]

'''Khandesh''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]:खानदेश) is a geographic region in [[Central India]], which forms the northwestern portion of [[Maharashtra]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khandesh.com/info/ |title=Welcome to Khandesh! |publisher=Khandesh.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Khandesh lies in [[Central India]] on the northwestern corner of the [[Deccan Plateau]], in the valley of the [[Tapti River|Tapi River]]. It is bounded to the north by the [[Satpura Range]], to the east by the [[Berar Division|Berar]] ([[Vidarbha]]) region, to the south by the Hills of Ajanta (belonging to the Marathwada region of Maharashtra), and to the west by the northernmost ranges of the [[Western Ghats]].

The principal natural feature is the [[Tapi River, India|Tapi River]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Unlike the rest of the Deccan, whose rivers rise in the Western Ghats and flow eastward to the [[Bay of Bengal]], the Tapi flows westward from headwaters in southern Madhya Pradesh to empty into the [[Arabian Sea]]. The Tapi receives thirteen principal tributaries in its course through Khandesh. None of these rivers is navigable, and the Tapi flows in a deep bed which historically made it difficult to use for irrigation. Most of Khandesh lies south of the Tapi and is drained by its tributaries: the [[Girna River|Girna]], [[Bori River|Bori]] and [[Panzara|Panjhra]]. The alluvial plain north of the Tapi contains some of the richest tracts in Khandesh, and the land rises towards the Satpuda hills. In the centre and east, the country is level, save for some low ranges of barren hills. To the north and west, the plain rises into rugged hills, thickly wooded, and inhabited by the tribal [[Bhil]] people.

== History ==

=== Delhi dynasties ===
In 1295, Khandesh was under the [[Chauhan]] ruler of Asirgarh when [[Ala-ud-din Khilji]] of Delhi wrested control.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001869096|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India|last=|first=|publisher=Superintendent of Government Printing|year=1909|isbn=|volume=Provincial Series: Bombay Presidency Vol. 1|location=Calcutta|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|418}} Various Delhi dynasties controlled Khandesh over the next century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|418}} From 1370 to 1600, the [[Faruqi dynasty]] ruled Khandesh with the capital at [[Burhanpur]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|418}} The foundation of Khandesh as an independent kingdom was laid by Malik Raja, son of Khanjahan Faurki. [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] had initially appointed Malik Raja as the commander-in-chief of Khandesh region, but he declares himself independent after the death of Firoz Tughlaq and ruled until 1399.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Atlas|last=Goyal|first=S. P.|publisher=Upkar|isbn=978-81-7482-752-4|location=Agra|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mughal rule ===
The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] arrived in 1599, when Akbar's army overran Khandesh and captured [[Asirgarh Fort|Asirgarh]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|418}} For a period of time, Khandesh was renamed as Dandesh in recognition of Akbar's son [[Daniyal Mirza|Daniyal]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbUBAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|last=|first=|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1880|isbn=|volume=Volume XII: Khandesh|location=Bombay|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Daniyal|{{Rp|248}}]] {{circa|1640}}, [[Todar Mal]]'s revenue settlement system was introduced in Khandesh by [[Shah Jahan]] (this system was used until British rule in 1818).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|250}} The mid-17th century has been described as the time of Khandesh's "highest prosperity" owing to trade in cotton, rice, indigo, sugarcane, and cloth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|250}} Mughal rule lasted until the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] captured Asirgarh in 1760.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|418}}

=== Maratha rule ===
Maratha raids into Khandesh began in 1670 and the following century was a period of unrest as Mughals and Marathas competed for control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|418}}  In 1760, the [[Peshwa]] ousted the Mughal ruler and gained control of Khandesh, following which portions were granted to [[Holkar]] and [[Scindia]] rulers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|418}} [[Baji Rao II]] surrendered to the British in June 1818, but sporadic war continued in Khandesh which was among the last of the Peshwa's former territories to come under complete [[British Raj|British control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=1987|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|9}}

=== British rule ===
[[File:KhandeshDistrict-1878.png|thumb|Khandesh District (1878)]]
Khandesh was a district in the [[Bombay Presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://storage.lib.uchicago.edu/pres/2014/pres2014-0779-1911-07-01.pdf|title=Census of India, 1911|last=|first=|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1912|isbn=|volume=Volume VII, Bombay: Part 1, Report|location=Bombay|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the district was divided into two districts: East Khandesh, headquartered at [[Jalgaon]], had an area of {{convert|4544|sqmi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, while West Khandesh, headquartered at [[Dhule]], had an area of {{convert|5497|sqmi|abbr=on|order=flip}}; their respective populations were 957,728 and 469,654 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khandesh.com/info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46:khandesh-information&amp;catid=29:overview&amp;Itemid=37 |title=Khandesh |publisher=Khandesh |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent India ===
After India's independence in 1947, Bombay province became [[Bombay State]], and in 1960 was divided into the linguistic states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]]. East Khandesh became [[Jalgaon district]], and West Khandesh became Dhule district, both in Maharashtra state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commercial Activities and Rural Development in South Asia: A Geographical Study|last=Jamkar|first=A.G.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1988|isbn=81-7022-194-3|editor-last=Shrivastava|editor-first=V.K.|location=New Delhi|pages=134|chapter=Origin and Evolution of Periodic Market Places in Dhule District (Maharashtra)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was further divided into [[Dhule district|Dhule]] and [[Nandurbar district]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/136532|title=An Inventory on Agrobiodiversity and Homestead Gardens in Tribal Tehsils of Khandesh Maharashtra|last=Patil|first=M.V.|publisher=North Maharashtra University|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 6-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Khandesh has a rich cultural and literary heritage.

=== Languages ===
[[Marathi language|Marathi]] is the official and most-spoken language in Khandesh. [[Ahirani]] and [[Gujari]] are spoken in the Girana basin of West Khandesh; these languages are dialects of Marathi with Gujarati and Hindi influence. [[Khandeshi language|Khandeshi]] is spoken in the eastern part of Khandesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santronix Computers pvt.

[[File:Shev Bhaaji.JPG|thumb|Shev [[Bhaaji]], a typical Khandesh dish]]
In the 13th century, Mukta Bai, the younger sister of Dnyaneshwar, lived at Muktainagar, near where the great yogi Changdeva lived. There was also a strong presence of Kabir Panth in Khandesh due to the proximity of [[Burhanpur]], the seat of Kabir Panth.

[[Bahinabai Chaudhari]], regarded as one of the greatest female poets in Marathi literature, belonged to a Khandeshi family. Her son, Kavi Sopandeo Choudhary, was also a well-known poet. Trambak Bapuji Thombre, commonly known as [[Balkavi]], is from Jalgaon. Dr. V.B. Kolte, a noted scholar of Marathi, hailed from Khandesh; he was the top authority on Mahanubhav literature.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Well known Marathi writers from Khandesh region, include Dr. Bhalchandra Nemade, [[N. D. Mahanor]], Dr. T. T. Mahajan and Dr. Sharad Rane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">The '''order of succession''' to the throne of [[Tonga]] is laid down in the 1875 constitution. The crown descends according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]]. Only legitimate descendants through legitimate line of King [[George Tupou I]]'s son and grandson, Crown Prince [[Tēvita ʻUnga]] and Prince [[ʻUelingatoni Ngū]], are entitled to succeed. A person loses his or her right of succession and deprives his or her descendants of their right of succession if he or she marries without the monarch's permission.

== Line of succession ==

The current line of succession is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.to/state-funeral/the-monarchy/3539-succession-to-the-tongan-throne|title=Succession to the Tongan Throne|publisher=Tonga Government Portal|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-06-25}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page is a '''list of Christmas dishes''' as eaten around the world. These food items are traditionally eaten at or associated with the [[Christmas]] season.

== Albania ==

*Byrek me kungull dhe arre – This is a traditional Albanian pumpkin and walnut pie cooked usually on Christmas Eve, especially in Catholic families. The ingredients are wheat flour, pumpkin, walnuts, vegetable oil (if fasting is considered) or butter, a pinch of salt and black pepper. Sometimes oregano is added. The pastry layers are traditionally homemade, filled with baked pumpkin mixture, which contains butter, salt and pepper. On top of the mixture, chopped walnuts are sprinkled. Layers are then folded up, put on a flat baking dish in a circular shape and baked. It makes a very delicious and light side dish for Christmas or any other occasion.

== Argentina ==
{{see also|Argentine cuisine}}
[[File:Vitello tonnato.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vitello tonnato]] is a very popular Christmas dish in Argentina, where it is known as vitel toné. The [[Piedmont]]ese dish is valued during the summer for its cold serving temperature, and is the legacy of the large [[Italian Argentines|Italian immigration]] to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://entremujeres.clarin.com/entremujeres/rincon-gourmet/vitel_tone-las_fiestas-navidad-ano_nuevo-mesa_navidena-recetas-rincon_gourmet_0_BJtuP9FwQg.html |title=Vitel toné: la receta de un clásico para las Fiestas |language=Spanish |last1=Fumarola|first1=Leonardo |last2= |first2= |date=December 17, 2015 |work= |publisher=Clarín.com |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Panettone]] (known locally as ''pan dulce'') and [[turrón]] are the most popular Christmas sweets in Argentina regardless of [[socioeconomic status]], with 76% of Argentines choosing the former and 59% the latter in 2015.&lt;ref name="elcronista"/&gt; [[Mantecol]], a typical peanut dessert, is also popular, being favored by 49% of Argentines in the same survey.&lt;ref name="kantar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/ar/Noticias/Que-dulces-no-pueden-faltar-en-estas-fiestas|title=¿Qué dulces no pueden faltar en estas fiestas?|date=December 23, 2016|publisher=Kantar Worldpanel|access-date=June 1, 2017|language=Spanish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190700/https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/ar/Noticias/Que-dulces-no-pueden-faltar-en-estas-fiestas|archivedate=October 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sparkling wine]]s, [[cider]]s and [[frizzante]]s concentrate most of their sales during Christmas season; sparkling wine is mostly consumed by small families with high and medium socioeconomic status living in [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and [[The New York Times|the]] country's largest cities, while cider and frizzantes are popular among lower classes and large families.&lt;ref name="kantar"/&gt;

The traditional meal (served as dinner on [[Christmas Eve]]) consists of either [[fish soup]], [[mushroom soup]], [[cabbage soup]], [[lentil soup]], [[pea soup]] and [[fried fish]] (traditionally [[carp]]) served with [[potato salad]]. Cabbage soup almost always contains mushrooms and may contain smoked meat or sausage. The recipe for potato salad differs slightly among every Czech or Slovak family. The main ingredients are: potato cooked with jacket, canned peas, onions, cooked carrots, parsley and celery, pickled gherkins, cooked eggs and mayonnaise. Some families may add grated apples or [[salami]]. The best potato salad is prepared a day before Christmas Eve so that all the ingredients can "mellow" for a day. The Christmas dinner should be the first food consumed that day. Those who do not break the Christmas shrove are believed to be able to see a golden pig.

Before the Christmas holidays, many kinds of sweet biscuits are prepared. The Christmas cookies are then served during the whole Christmas period and exchanged among friends and neighbours. Very popular is also a preparation of small ginger breads garnished by sugar icing.

Ten or eleven species of [[reptile]]s occur in [[Great Britain]]: three&lt;ref name=ARG/&gt; [[snake]]s and three [[lizard]]s, which were established at the time of the last ice age. Additionally, Britain has a number of [[introduced species]] which have become [[naturalize]]d in their new environments such as tortoises.

[[Sea turtles]] have been recorded as coastal [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]] and the [[red-eared terrapin]] occurs as an introduced species.

A '''supercentenarian''' (sometimes hyphenated as '''super-centenarian''') is someone who has lived to or passed their 110th birthday. This age is achieved by about one in 1,000 [[centenarian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maier|first=H., Gampe, J., Jeune, B., Robine, J.-M., Vaupel, J. W.

This is an incomplete list of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] [[supercentenarian]]s (people from [[Europe]] who have attained the age of at least 110 years).

The oldest European person, and the world's oldest person, ever was [[List of French supercentenarians|French]] woman, [[Jeanne Calment]], who died at the age of 122 years, 164 days. The oldest European man ever was [[List of Danish supercentenarians|Danish]] [[Christian Mortensen]] who emigrated to the [[United States]] where he died at the age of 115 years, 252 days  (the oldest non-emigrant man was [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] [[Joan Riudavets Moll]] who died at the age of 114 years, 81 days).

== Asian supercentenarians ==

This is an incomplete list of Asian [[supercentenarian]]s (people from [[Asia]] who have attained the age of at least 110 years). According to the [[Gerontology Research Group]], the verified oldest Asian person ever is [[Nabi Tajima]] of [[Japan]], who died on 21 April 2018, aged 117 years, 260 days.&lt;ref name=GRG/&gt; The [[List of the verified oldest men|verified oldest man]] is [[Jiroemon Kimura]], also from Japan, who died on 12 June 2013, aged 116 years, 54 days. As of {{date}}, there are 14 [[List of the oldest living people|verified living Asian supercentenarians]].&lt;ref name="GRG3"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.grg.org/Adams/TableE.html|title = Validated Living Supercentenarians - Table E|publisher = [[Gerontology Research Group]]|accessdate = 13 August 2015|date = 13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{date}}, the oldest living person in Asia is Kane Tanaka of Japan, born 2 January 1903, aged {{age in years and days|1903|1|2}}.

The vast majority of verified Asian cases of supercentenarians come from Japan, which has kept birth records for more than a century, while other Asian countries have historically been less meticulous about keeping such records. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', China and India have many supercentenarians, but none are confirmed, as their governments did not track births prior to the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cigarette smoking Brazilian man may be world’s oldest person at 126 years old|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/07/16/cigarette-smoking-brazilian-man-may-be-worlds-oldest-person-at-126-years-old/|publisher=The Washington Post|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been 3 verified emigrant supercentenarians from Asia, the oldest of whom is Indian woman Lucy d'Abreu who died in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2005, aged 113 years, 197 days.

All known cases are found at [[List of Japanese supercentenarians]], except for [[Yisrael Kristal]] (Israel, 113 years and 330 days), [[Shivakumara Swami]] (India, {{ayd|1907|04|01}}), [[Zhou Youguang]] (China, 111 years and 1 day) and [[Qin Hanzhang]] (China, {{ayd|1908|02|19}}).

==Overview==
The highway is expected to improve cross-border trade, tourism, socio-economic development and promote regional integration. The project is being handled directly by the [[East African Community]]. The road is also expected to ease the movement of traffic from both Mombasa and Tanga ports, destined for the land-locked countries of [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[South Sudan]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]].&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite web|

==Upgrade to double carriageway==
The upgrade to class II bitumen and widening to double carriageway will be jointly funded by he EAC and [[African Development Bank]].
The construction cost is budgeted at US$751.3 million, with 70 percent borrowed from the AfDB, and each country funding 30 percent of the work in its territory.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt;

In April 2018, the [[Business Daily Africa]] newspaper reported that construction delays on the Kenyan side were attributed to changes in road design from single carriageway to double carriageway, along a section of the highway.&lt;ref name="When"/&gt;

==Upgrade and funding==
Beginning circa 2006,&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt; the [[government of Kenya]], through Kenya National Highway Authority began upgrading this road from bitumen surface to class II bitumen with shoulders, culverts and drainage channels. Sometime prior to February 2016, the Mariakani to Kaloleni section was upgraded to bitumen surface. The ongoing upgrade of the Kaloleni to Mavueni section, is expected to conclude later in 2016. Work is contracted to ''MuljiDevraj &amp; Brothers Limited'' at a contract price of KSh 2.3 billion (approx. US$231 million), fully funded by the Kenyan government.&lt;ref name="This"/&gt; *&lt;small&gt;Note: US$1.00 = KSh99.58 on 7 April 2016&lt;/small&gt;

The '''Moqua Well''' is a small [[underground lake]], in [[Nauru]].

==History==
During [[World War II]], Moqua Well was the primary source of drinking water for inhabitants of Nauru.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;[http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/Nauru/Nauru/MoquaCaves.htm "Moqua Caves and Moqua Well"], Gatis Pāvils, 30 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the body of water is referred to as a [[water well|well]] instead of a lake.&lt;ref name=iexplore&gt;[http://www.iexplore.com/travel-guides/australia-and-south-pacific/nauru/attractions "Nauru – Attractions"], iExplore.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Nauruan authorities decided to put up a fence to prevent accidents, after an alcohol-related drowning in the same year.&lt;ref name=wondermondo/&gt;&lt;ref name=iexplore/&gt;

==Location==

The well is located below the [[Yaren district]]. The '''Moqua Well''' is not well known, one of a few [[attractions]] in Nauru.

===Linguistic disambiguation===

The name of the well 'Moqua' (sometimes referred to as 'Makwa') is derived from the former name by which [[Yaren district|Yaren]] was known.

===Other feature===

Nearby are the [[Moqua Caves]], a series of underground [[cave]]s below Yaren.

'''Municipal annexation''' is a process by which a municipality expands its boundaries into adjacent areas not already incorporated into the municipality. This has been a common response of cities to [[urbanization]] in neighboring areas. It may be done because the neighboring urban areas seek municipal services or because a city seeks control over its [[suburb]]s or neighboring unincorporated areas.

In the [[United States]], all local governments are considered "creatures of the state" according to [[John Forrest Dillon#Dillon's Rule|Dillon's Rule]], which resulted from the work of [[John Forrest Dillon]] on the law of [[municipal corporation]]s. Dillon's Rule implies, among other things, that the boundaries of any [[jurisdiction]] falling under state government can be modified by state government action. For this reason, examples of municipal annexation are distinct from [[annexation]]s involving [[sovereign state]]s.

==Unusual annexations==

===Crossing county lines: Atlanta ===
In 1909 the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], then located only in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], annexed part of neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], from which Fulton County had originally been divided. Because the original county borders retain legal significance, the expansion into two counties generated some problems, such as when police arrest suspects on charges set forth in Georgia [[U.S. state|state]] law and city police must determine to which county's jail they must be taken.

===Merging by referendum: New York===
Following referenda in 1874 and 1895, the [[City of Greater New York|City of New York]] annexed portions of southern [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and in 1898, after another referendum, the city annexed all of [[Brooklyn|Kings]], [[Staten Island|Richmond]], and most of [[Queens]] counties. The annexed portion of Westchester County is now [[The Bronx|Bronx]] county; the unannexed portion of Queens County is now Nassau County.  As a result, Westchester County does not currently include any portion of the City of New York and Queens County is entirely within the City of New York.

==Shoestring annexation==
[[Image:LA in LA County map.png|thumb|right|300 px|A map of [[Los Angeles County]] with the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in red, showing the Shoestring Strip annexation, which reaches south to the San Pedro area and the [[Port of Los Angeles]].]]

A "shoestring annexation" is a term used for an annexation by a [[city]], [[town]] or other [[municipality]] in which it acquires new territory that is contiguous to the existing territory but is only connected to it by a thin strip of land.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9vQTxyeb04EC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0HmVkonY3ZzHjCa3Bca9wN5w9cIg#PPA46,M1 Annexation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zxUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called a "flagpole annexation" because the territory resembles a flagpole, in which the connection is the "pole" and the annexed territory the "flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |title=Flagpole annexation in Colorado |access-date=2010-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020101213353/http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |archive-date=2002-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===
In some states, municipalities are prohibited from annexing land not directly connected to their existing territory.  A shoestring or flagpole annexation allows the municipality to do so.

Such annexations are sometimes used when a municipality seeks to acquire [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] developed land, such as a newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] separated from it by undeveloped open space. They may also be used when a municipality desires to annex a commercial or industrial area without taking over intervening residential areas, so as to collect tax revenues from the businesses or industry without having to provide services (such as [[electricity]] and [[waste|garbage]] collection) to residents. Such uses of the technique are often criticized and derided as a form of [[gerrymandering]], and have in fact been used for the purpose of manipulating vote distribution among election precincts and districts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

A related strategy is called strip annexation, which involves annexing a narrow strip that encloses a large block of unincorporated land. Strip annexation was widely used by the municipalities of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] during the 1970s to preemptively gain control of large areas of land before other municipalities, without having to annex more than a thin strip surrounding a large so-called [[county island]]. The strip protected the county island from being annexed by other municipalities, thus giving the strip-annexing municipality the ability to slowly annex portions of the county island over time. One such annexation by [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] in 1974 spurred nearby [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]] to create the largest county island to date by annexing a strip no more than 200 feet wide that enclosed 51 square miles of unincorporated [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]]. The annexation was challenged in court and, although found legal, eventually led to legislation in 1980 outlawing strip annexation. Some municipalities rushed to annex before the law took effect, such as [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], which annexed a 10 foot wide strip enclosing an 86 square mile county island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/55/ |title= Border Wars: Tax Revenues, Annexation, and Urban Growth in Phoenix |last= Heim |first= Carol E. |publisher= University of Massachusetts Amherst |pages= 18–27, 54 |accessdate= 27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
[[Image:US-IL-Chicago.png|thumb|right|300 px|A map of the city of [[Chicago]] showing the connection into [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] for O'Hare International Airport.]]
{{norefs|section|date = March 2018}}

===Port of LA===
The [[Port of Los Angeles]] together with the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]] and [[Harbor City, Los Angeles, California|Harbor City]] neighborhoods of [[Los Angeles]], are connected to the main part of the city by what is called locally the "[[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, California|Shoestring Strip]]" between [[Figueroa Street]] and [[Vermont Avenue]] and between [[Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Western]] and [[Normandie Avenue|Normandie]] avenues to the south.

===O'Hare Airport===
[[O'Hare Airport]] is municipally connected to the city of [[Chicago]] via a narrow strip of land, approximately 200 feet wide, along Foster Avenue from the [[Des Plaines river]] to the airport. This land was annexed in the 1950s to assure the airport was contiguous with the city to keep it under city control.  The strip is bounded on the north by [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and the south by [[Schiller Park, Illinois|Schiller Park]].&lt;ref&gt;http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/41st.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allston-Brighton===
The [[Boston]] neighborhoods of [[Allston]] and [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] were part of an independent town of Brighton before being annexed by Boston.  At the time [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] extended to the [[Charles River]] and separated Boston and Brighton.  As a result, a shoestring annexation was obtained by Boston from Brookline when Brighton joined Boston.  This was made necessary by [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873|Brookline's refusal to join Boston]] a year before Brighton's annexation.

===South San Diego===
[[South San Diego]], located next to the [[Mexico–United States border]], is physically separated from the rest of [[San Diego]] by the cities of [[National City, California|National City]] and [[Chula Vista]]. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of [[San Diego Bay]] connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.

Trails around '''[[portage]]s in North America''' usually began as animal tracks and were improved by tramping or blazing. In a few places iron-plated wooden rails were laid to take a handcart. Heavily used routes sometimes evolved into roads when sledges, rollers or oxen were used, as at [[Methye Portage]].  Sometimes railways were built ([[Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad]]). The basic purpose of most canals is to avoid portages.&lt;ref&gt;Eric W. Morse,'Fur Trade Canoe Route of Canada /Then and Now',1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Places where portaging occurred often became temporary and then permanent settlements (such as [[Hull, Quebec]]; [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]]; [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]]; and [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]). The importance of free passage through portages found them included in laws and treaties. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] says "The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States..." The [[Treaty of Greenville]] between the U.S. and the Indian tribes of the area includes: "And the said Indian tribes will allow to the people of the United States a free passage by land and by water, as one and the other shall be found convenient, through their country,..." Then four portages are mentioned specifically. Portages are also used in the treaty to set boundaries ("The general boundary line between the lands of the United States and the lands of the said Indian tribes, shall begin at the mouth of Cayahoga river, and run thence up the same to the portage..."). One historically important [[fur trade]] portage is now [[Grand Portage National Monument]]. Recreational canoeing routes often include portages between lakes, for example, the [[Seven Carries]] route in [[Adirondack Park]]. [[Algonquin Park]], [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] and [[Sylvania Wilderness]] have famous portage routes. 

Numerous portages were upgraded to carriageways and railways due to their economic importance. The [[Niagara Portage]] had a gravity railway in the 1760s. The [[Chicago Portage|passage between the Chicago and Des Plaines Rivers]] (and so between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River systems) was through a short swamp portage which seasonally flooded and it is thought that a channel gradually developed unintentionally from the dragging of the boat bottoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoportage.org/synopsis.htm The Chicago Portage - Historical Synopsis], prepared by Wm. E. Rose and Associates, Inc., for the [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County]], June 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 1835 [[Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad]] connected the cities of New York and Montreal without needing to go through the Atlantic. The passage between Lake Superior and Lake Huron was by a portage dragway of greased rails with capstans until a railway was built in 1850 and a canal in 1855. The 5-mile-long [[Nosbonsing and Nipissing Railway]] was built just to carry logs between lakes on their way to the sawmill. [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]] and [[Morris Canal]] both used [[canal inclined plane]]s to pass loaded boats through portages. 

==Settlements named for being on a portage==
Sometimes the settlements were named for being on a portage. Some places in the United States and Canada so named are:
*[[Cranberry Portage, Manitoba]]
*[[Giscome Portage]], [[British Columbia]]
*[[Grand Portage (community), Minnesota|Grand Portage, Minnesota]]
*[[Portage, Indiana]]
*[[Portage, Michigan]]
*[[Portage, Montana]]
*[[Portage, Nova Scotia]]
*[[Portage, Pennsylvania]]
*[[Portage, Wisconsin]]
*[[Portage Bay]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]
*[[Portage County, Ohio]]
*[[Portage County, Wisconsin]]
*[[Portage Park, Chicago]]
*[[Portage-du-Fort, Quebec]]
*[[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba]] (portage between the Assiniboine River and Lake Manitoba)
*[[Kenora|Rat Portage]], [[Ontario]]
*[[Seton Portage, British Columbia]]
*[[Bayou Portage, Louisiana]]

Names with ''portage'' appear on various other geographical features, including road and lakes, as in [[Portage Lake (disambiguation)|Portage Lake]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;. In [[Hull, Quebec]] a major street is named ''promenade du Portage'' as the city is the head of uninterrupted navigation from [[Montréal]] on the [[Ottawa River]] and one must portage around the Chaudière Rapids.

{{Politics of Eritrea}}
The '''regions of Eritrea''' are the primary geographical divisions through which [[Eritrea]] is administered. Six in total, they include the [[Maekel Region|Maekel/Central]], [[Anseba Region|Anseba]], [[Gash-Barka Region|Gash-Barka]], [[Debub Region|Debub/Southern]], [[Northern Red Sea Region|Northern Red Sea]] and [[Southern Red Sea Region|Southern Red Sea]] regions.

At the time of independence in 1993 [[Eritrea]] was arranged into ten [[Provinces of Eritrea|provinces]]. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (''zobas''). [[Gash-Barka Region]] was the largest and the most densely populated region and is called the "bread-basket".

The [[People’s Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ) (originally [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]]), an authoritarian government, rules the country and the region. The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. No parties or groups other than PFDJ are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PDFJ.

==History==
At the time of independence in 1993 [[Eritrea]] was arranged into ten [[Provinces of Eritrea|provinces]]. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (''zobas''). The boundaries of these new regions are based on catchment basins. Critics of this policy contend that the Government of Eritrea was erasing the historical fabric of Eritrea while proponents believe that these new Regional boundaries would ease historical land disputes. Furthermore proponents of this policy argue that basing boundaries on an important natural resource would ease the planning of its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title = Eritrea to have 6 administrative regions | publisher = Eritrea Profile | date = 20 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Each region has a locally elected regional assembly while the local administrator is appointed by the [[President of Eritrea]]. During [[Cabinet of Ministers of Eritrea|Cabinet]] meetings the President also meets with the Regional Administrators who report on the activities of their regions. The Regional Assemblies are charged with developing a budget for local programs and hearing the concerns of the local populations. Local programs included cultural events, infrastructure such as feeder roads, and to promote afforestation. Eritrea has a one party national Assembly governed by [[People’s Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ) (originally [[Eritrean Liberation Front]]) , an authoritarian government. From the time of independence since 30 May 1991, the country has been continuing with a transitional government elected during the elections in April 1993. The scheduled elections in 2001 has been postponed indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections in Eritrea|url=http://africanelections.tripod.com/er.html|publisher=African Elections|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021524/http://africanelections.tripod.com/er.html|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional and local elections are conducted on a periodic basis on a restricted framework. All men and women of any ethnic or religious background are eligible to vote. No parties or groups other than PFDJ are allowed to contest and the elections are presided by representatives from PDFJ. Policy decisions should be centered around the party mandate and opposition and dissenters have been imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2007/eritrea|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112143830/https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2007/eritrea|archivedate=12 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Assab volcanic field.jpg |225px|thumb|A volcanic field|left]]
The topography of the regions on the Western side, namely, Anseba, Central and  has highland plateau, which are cooler than the regions around the coastal plains. There are two rainy seasons, the heavier one during summer and the lighter one during spring. The climate and geography of the region along with other regions of Eritrea is similar to the one of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=eritrea+geography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg3sCJxKLQAhUHwI8KHS1lBy0Q6AEIJjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=eritrea%20geography&amp;f=false|page=300|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9780816072293|first=R.

The hottest month is May recording temperatures up to {{convert|30|°C| °F|abbr=on}}, while the coldest month is December to February when it reaches freezing temperature.

There are a number of flora and fauna species in the high plateau regions in the West. Notably this was historic habitat for the endangered [[painted hunting dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''), a canid which is now thought to be [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=C.

[[African wild dog]] was also found in the coastal region, but their present condition is unknown.

'''Skåneland''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]) or '''Skånelandene''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]) is a region on the southern [[Scandinavian peninsula]]. It includes the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[provinces of Sweden|provinces]] of [[Blekinge]], [[Halland]] and [[Skåne|Scania]]. The [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Bornholm]] is sometimes also included.&lt;ref name="Popularhistoria2"&gt;For popular usage, see for example the publication Populärhistoria:  [http://www.popularhistoria.se/o.o.i.s?id=51&amp;vid=47 Hjälpreda om Skåneland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225180514/http://www.popularhistoria.se/o.o.i.s?id=51&amp;vid=47 |date=2009-02-25 }}: "Skåneland, d v s Halland, Skåne och Blekinge", [http://www.popularhistoria.se/o.o.i.s?id=54&amp;vid=159 Fredsfördraget firas i Altranstädt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225204033/http://www.popularhistoria.se/o.o.i.s?id=54&amp;vid=159 |date=2009-02-25 }}: "Sverige ingick mot slutet av århundradet i en västeuropeisk allians med Holland och England och kunde därigenom stoppa Danmarks revanschplaner för förlusten av Skåneland", [http://popularhistoria.se/artiklar/ett-liv-fyllt-av-skandaler Ett liv fyllt av skandaler]: "År 1660, då Marie Grubbe anlänt till Köpenhamn, satt Fredrik III på Danmarks tron. Det var han som hade förlorat Skåneland till Sverige vid Roskildefreden 1658".&lt;/ref&gt; Skåneland has no official recognition or function and the term is not in common usage. Equivalent terms in English and Latin are "the Scanian provinces" and "Terrae Scaniae" respectively.

The provinces making up Skåneland were part of Denmark from at least the 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;"Skånelandene havde altid været en rig og god del af riget og hørt til det siden i hvert fald 800-årene, så det er ikke sært." http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarkshistorien/Velstands_krise_og_tusind_baghold/Velstands_krise/Nye_veje/Jysk_opr%C3%B8r_og_nye_krige?highlight=Sk%C3%A5nelandene&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as the "Eastern Provinces"; since a 12th-century [[civil war]], Denmark has been a kingdom with a single king.&lt;ref name="hoffmann"&gt;Hoffmann, Erich (1981).

Museum Tusculanum Press, {{ISBN|87-88073-30-0}}. (On p. 101, Dr. Hoffmann, Professor at University of Kiel, argues that the contemporary descriptions of Scania as an autonomous polity had merit; Scania was often disagreeing in the choice of kings, which resulted in several, simultaneously elected kings in the early Danish state. Scania became officially integrated as a province in the late 12th century, with the Treaty of Lolland.&lt;/ref&gt; The provinces were part of the territory ceded to Sweden in 1658 under the [[Treaty of Roskilde]], but after an uprising on Bornholm, that island was returned to Denmark in 1660, under the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]].
The last peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark in which Skåneland was a main issue was signed on 3 July 1720 in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;http://sok.riksarkivet.se/bildvisning/R0000328&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Skåneland'' is first recorded in print in the year 1719.&lt;ref&gt;Svenska Akademiens Ordbok: ''Skåneland (består) uti af skillde och nog synlige delar af skog och slättmark. 2RA 1: 4 (1719)''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what area is meant. Later (1751) [[Carl Linnaeus]] uses it, meaning the province of [[Scania]].&lt;ref name="SAOB"&gt;[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/255/65056.html#SKÅNELAND Skåneland] in Svenska Akademiens Ordbok (SAOB) on the Internet, and [http://runeberg.org/nfce/0701.html Skåneland] in Nordisk Familjebok.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern use of the denomination as a short form for ''De skånska landskapen'' (''"The Scanian provinces"''), for the combined area of the provinces of Blekinge, Halland and Scania, was launched by the Swedish historian and [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] [[Weibull|Martin Weibull]] in ''Samlingar till Skånes historia'' (six volumes) 1868-73 in order to illuminate the common Danish history of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland.

The term is mostly used in historical contexts and not in daily speech. In Danish, ''Skånelandene'' is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a [[geopolitical]] entity but a [[cultural region]], without officially established political borders. In some circumstances, the term Skåneland, as opposed to the terms Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, can also be used as a [[figure of speech]] for the province Scania.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Weibull used the term as a combined term for the four provinces where the [[Scanian Law]] had its jurisdiction, as well as the area of the [[archdiocese]] of [[Lund]] until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1536, later the Danish [[Lutheran]] [[diocese]] of Lund. This form of Skåneland was then used in the regional historical periodical ''Historisk tidskrift för Skåneland'', beginning in 1901, published by Martin's son, [[Lauritz Weibull]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Swedish National Encyclopedia]] article ''Skånelandskapen''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
An earlier administrative and political function of the area was to serve as a core area for one of the three provincial [[thing (assembly)|things]] that together elected the [[king of Denmark]]. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]] (''herreder'' in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units,&lt;ref&gt;Helle, Knut, ed. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PFBtfXG6fXAC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=herreder+denmark&amp;sig=qXNJMslBFtVvkhF1FRwDTtA--Sc The Cambridge History of Scandinavia]. Cambridge University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-521-47299-7}}, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted by an increase in royal power during the [[High Middle Ages]]. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in [[Jutland]], where they replaced previous administrative units called ''syssel''. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Birgit and P. H. Sawyer (1993). ''Scandinavia: From Conversion to Reformation, Circa 800-1500''. U of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|0-8166-1739-2}}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, a new [[finance|fiscal]] system was introduced and the hundreds were gradually included into larger administrative units called ''[[Len (Norway)|len]]'', with a castle serving as the administrative center. This new administrative development was a result of the increased power of the [[aristocracy]]. In each ''len'', a [[nobility|noble]] man was put in charge, with the title ''lensmand''.&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, Richard (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JfkroPor9jUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=danish+len&amp;source=web&amp;ots=VGnoSVHjdB&amp;sig=uNg1znZPgN3uAU_giktRELGYulk&amp;hl=en Economic Systems and State Finance]. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-820545-7}}, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the four provinces of Skåneland had representation in the Scanian Thing, which, along with the other two Things of the Danish state (Jutland and Zealand), elected the Danish king.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The four Scanian provinces were joined under the jurisdiction of the [[Scanian Law]], dated 1200–1216,&lt;ref&gt;Damsholt, Nanna. "Women in Medieval Denmark". In Skyum-Nielsen, Niels and Niels Lund, eds. (1981). ''Danish Medieval History, New Currents''. Museum Tusculanum Press, {{ISBN|87-88073-30-0}}: p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest Nordic provincial law. In the chapter "Constitutional history" in ''Danish Medieval History, New Currents'', the three provincial Things are described as being the legal authority that instituted changes suggested by the elected king. The suggestions for changes submitted by the king had to be approved by the three Things before being passed into law in the Danish state.&lt;ref name="hoffmann" /&gt;

=== Status today ===
Skåneland is strictly a historic and cultural region.  The name has long appeared as a term used in historical contexts in a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, Tina L. (2001). ''Landscapes of Power, Landscapes of Conflict: State Formation in the South Scandinavian Iron Age''. Kluwer Academic, NY, {{ISBN|0-306-46320-2}}. "Scania—Skåneland, Cultural Region in Scandinavia and in Europe", p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The southern part of Sweden, including Skåneland, is considered to be included in [[Götaland]], one of three historic "[[lands of Sweden]]". The "land" Götaland bears the same name used for the historic province Götaland (a province referred to as "Gothia" on the 17th-century maps); the inclusion of Skåneland is described as "historically inaccurate" by the Swedish [[Nationalencyklopedin]].&lt;ref name="nationalencyklopedin1"&gt;"Götaland" (2007). Nationalencyklopedin, 5 February 2008, (in Swedish): "Ehuru historiskt oegentligt, kom även Skåne, Halland, Blekinge och Bohuslän att räknas dit." (Although historically inaccurate, Scania, Blekinge and Bohuslän came to be counted [as part of Götaland]".&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other [[cultural region]]s, regionalism in Scania sometimes has a base in regional [[nationalism]] and sometimes in a more general opposition against [[Centralization|centralized]] [[state nationalism]] or  [[Expansionist Nationalism|expansionist nationalism]].  As noted about regionalism in Norway, Scandinavian regionalism is not necessarily separatist.&lt;ref&gt;Vikør, Lars S. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22regionalism%22+scania&amp;sig=3L4JaFbk6ZyXWFwZJFzPb0X_gCM "Northern Europe"]. In ''Language and Nationalism in Europe''. Eds. Stephen Barbour, Cathie Carmichael. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-823671-9}}, p. 117: "Norway is a country were regionalism has always been strong, [...] a regionalism without any traces of separatism. The idea of unity in diversity has always been exceptionally strong in Norway".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern usage ===
There are a number of minor organisations promoting the use of the term, mainly active online, e.g. ''Föreningen Skånelands Framtid''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skanelandsframtid.org/ |title=Vägen framåt » Skånelands Framtid |publisher=Skanelandsframtid.org |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Skåneländsk Samling'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/skanelandsksamling/ |title=Skåneländsk Samling |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Skåneland Football Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skanelandsfotbollsforbund.com/ |title=Skånelands Fotbollsförbund |publisher=Skanelandsfotbollsforbund.com |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203044347/http://www.skanelandsfotbollsforbund.com/ |archivedate=2011-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Stiftelsen Skåneländska Flaggans Dag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skaneflaggan.nu/ |title=Stiftelsen Skåneländska Flaggans Dag |publisher=Skaneflaggan.nu |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed January 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO) from 1993 to 2011, representing Skåneland under the name of [[Scania]].

== History ==
[[File:Scania Churchlaw.jpg|right|thumb| [[Anders Sunesøn]]'s 13th-century version of the [[Scanian Law]] and Church Law, containing a comment in the margin called the "Skaaningestrof" (the Scanian stanza): "''Hauí that skanunga ærliki mææn toco vithar oræt aldrigh æn''." (Let it be known that Scanians are honorable men who have never tolerated injustice.)]]

=== Population and settlements ===
The earliest Danish historians, writing in the 12th and 13th century, believed that the Danish Kingdom had existed since king [[Dan I of Denmark|Dan]], in a distant past. Eighth century sources mention the existence of Denmark as a kingdom. According to 9th century Frankish sources, by the early 9th century many of the chieftains in the south of Scandinavia acknowledged Danish kings as their overlords, though kingdom(s) were very loose confederations of lords until the last couple medieval centuries saw some increased centralization. The west and south coast of modern Sweden was so effectively part of the Danish realm that the said area (and not the today Denmark) was known as "Denmark" (literally the frontier of the [[Daner]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Scandinavia'', by Bridget and Peter Sawyer, University of Minnesota Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kings and Vikings'', by P.H. Sawyer, Routledge, 1982. (Sawyer considered sources such as [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] but validated their material against contemporary primary documents of the period).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Svend Estridsen]] (King of Denmark 1047 – ca.&amp;nbsp;1074), who may have been from Scania himself, is often referred to as the king who along with his dynasty established Scania as an integral, and sometimes the more important, part of Denmark.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===From 1397 to 1658===
When the [[Kalmar Union]] was formed in 1397, the union was administered from Copenhagen. By 1471 Sweden rebelled under [[Sture]] family leadership. In 1503, when [[Sten Sture the Elder]] died, eastern Sweden’s independence from Denmark had been established.&lt;ref name="Stiles"&gt;''Sweden and the Baltic, 1523 - 1721'', by Andrina Stiles, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1992 {{ISBN|0-340-54644-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 Denmark controlled virtually all land bordering on [[Skagerrak]], [[Kattegat]], and [[Øresund|the Sound]]. The current Swedish provinces of [[Skåne]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]] were Danish and the province of [[Bohuslän]] was Norwegian. Skåneland became the site of harsh fighting, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, as Denmark and Sweden confronted each other for control of the Baltic.&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;''A History of Sweden'' by Ingvar Andersson, Praeger, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Bache "&gt;''Nordens Historie'', ved Hiels Bache, Forslagsbureauet i Kjøbenhavn, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;''The Northern Wars, 1558-1721'' by Robert I.

[[File:Lemke Scanianwar.jpg|thumb|right|Painting by Swedish-German artist [[Johan Philip Lemke]] of the 1676 [[Battle of Lund]] during the [[Scanian War]], the bloodiest battle ever fought between Denmark and Sweden]]
Sweden intervened in the Danish civil war known as the [[Count's Feud]] (1534–1536),  launching a highly destructive invasion of Skåneland as the ally of later king [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], who upon his coronation [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|introduced Protestantism]] to the provinces. Subsequently, in the period between the breakup of the Kalmar Union and 1814, Denmark and Sweden fought in Skåneland in 11 separate wars and other border provinces: the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] (1563–70), [[Kalmar War]] (1611–1613), [[Torstenson War]] (1644–1645), [[Second Northern War]] (1657–1658 and 1659–1660), [[Scanian War]] (1674–1678), [[Great Northern War]] (1700 and 1709–1720), [[Theater War]] (1788), and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1808–1809 and 1814).&lt;ref name="Frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moberg"&gt;''Min Svenska Historia II'', by Vilhelm Moberg, P.A. Nordstedt &amp; Söners Förlag, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], attacks were launched on Sweden from Danish [[Halland]] in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of [[Halland]] and [[Skåne]] in 1565 and 1569. In 1570 peace was finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to Danish Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and [[Gotland]], while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.&lt;ref name="Frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathisen"&gt;''Fra Bondeoppbud til Legdshær'' by Trygve Mathisen, Guldendal Norsk Forlag, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Torstenson War]], a theater of the [[Thirty Years' War]], extensive combat took place in the Danish provinces of Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge. By the [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)]] Denmark ceded the Norwegian provinces of [[Jämtland]] and [[Härjedalen]] and agreed Sweden was to occupy the Danish province of [[Halland]] for 30&amp;nbsp;years as a guarantee of the treaty provisions.&lt;ref name="Frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisk" /&gt;
* During the [[Second Northern War]] (1655&amp;ndash;1658), Danish attempts to recover control of [[Halland]] ended in a serious defeat administered by Sweden. As a result, in the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] (1658), which was largely confirmed by the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)]], Denmark ceded the provinces of Skåne, Blekinge and Halland (i.e., Skåneland).&lt;ref name="Frost" /&gt;

Vilhelm Moberg, in his history of the Swedish people, provides a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by both sides in the struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, [[Vilhelm Moberg|Moberg]] compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by [[Gustavus Adolphus]] celebrating the 24&amp;nbsp;Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.&lt;ref name="Moberg" /&gt;

===Assimilation with Sweden===
[[File:Scaniaemap.jpg|thumb|right|Map from 1710 of "Scaniae" (Skåneland), consisting of the provinces "Scania, Hallandia et Blekingia"]]
[[File:DanmarkSydslesvigSkaaneland.png|thumb|Today's Denmark and the former Danish provinces Southern Schleswig, Skåne, Halland and Blekinge.]]
Following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658 – but in direct contradiction of its terms – the Swedish government in 1683 demanded that the leading social groups of Skåneland accept Swedish customs and laws. Swedish became the only language permitted in Church liturgy and in schools, religious literature in Danish was banned, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be Swedish. However the last Danish bishop, [[Peder Winstrup]] remained in charge of the Diocese of Lund until his death in 1679. To promote further Swedish assimilation, the [[University of Lund]] was inaugurated in 1666; the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in [[Copenhagen University]] until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=" Ambrius "&gt;''Skånelands historia'', ved Ambrius, J,  1997 {{ISBN|91-971436-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population initially opposed the Swedish reforms, as can be ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the [[Östra Göinge Municipality|Göinge]] district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as [[Snapphane|snapphanar]], a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits.. The punishments included the use of [[impalement]] [[breaking wheel|breaking on the wheel]], as well as the nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, it could take four to five days before the victim died.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Lindquist (1995). ''Historien om Sverige – storhet och fall''. Norstedts Förlag, 2006 ({{ISBN|91-1-301535-4}}) (In Swedish),  Sixten Svensson (2005). ''Sanningen om Snapphanelögnen''. ({{ISBN|91-975695-1-8}}) (in Swedish), and Sten Skansjö (1997). ''Skånes historia''. Lund ({{ISBN|91-88930-95-5}}) (in Swedish).&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model could not be effected quickly or easily. In the first fifty years of the transition, the treatment of the population was quite harsh. Denmark made several attempts to recapture the territories, the last in 1710, but ultimately conceded the territories as lost.&lt;ref name="Andersson" /&gt;

Before 1658, one of the provinces of Skåneland, [[Scania]] proper, had consisted of four counties: the counties of Malmøhus, Landskrone, Helsingborg and Christianstad. When Skåneland was annexed by Sweden, one of the counties of Scania, Kristianstad County, was merged with Blekinge to form one of a total of three Blekinge counties.

===Bornholm rebellion===
In 1658, shortly after the Swedish general Printzenskiöld was sent to Bornholm to start the assimilation process, the population of Bornholm rebelled. Led by [[Jens Kofoed]] and [[Poul Anker]], the rebellion formed in the town of [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], north of the largest city, [[Rønne]]. Before the rebel army reached the Swedish headquarters in Rønne, Printzenskiold was shot by [[Willum Clausen]] in the street of Sølvgade, in central Rønne.
The Swedish fled the island as a result of the confusion and fear amongst the conscripts; Jens Kofoed installed an intermediate rule and sent a message to King [[Frederick III of Denmark]] that Bornholm had liberated itself, and wished to return to Danish rule. This was confirmed in the 1660 peace settlement between Denmark and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} ''[http://www.bornholminfo.dk/Historie/481we.aspx?langId=2 The Swedish Period - revolt against the Swedes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301094949/http://www.bornholminfo.dk/Historie/481we.aspx?langId=2 |date=2009-03-01 }}'' - from bornholminfo.dk, a website of [[TV 2 (Denmark)]]-Bornholm and Destination Bornholm - an organisation for tourist enterprises on Bornholm.

===Klågerup riots in 1811===
The last Swedish assault on the civilian population occurred as late as 15. June 1811, when Swedish military killed "around 30" and wounded "around 60" peasants in Klågerup. The Swedish army units also arrested 395 people of which 2 became beheaded at "Stortorget" (a square) in [[Malmö]] at 4. November 1811

=== Swedish administration ===
{{further|Swedish Governors-General}}
[[File:Gustaf Otto Stenbock.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Gustaf Otto Stenbock, Swedish field marshal]]
Sweden appointed a [[Governor General]], who in addition to having the highest authority of the government, also was the highest military officer. The first to hold the post of Governor General was [[Gustaf Otto Stenbock]], between 1658 and 1664.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson, Harald (2003). "Att göra svenskar av danskar? Den svenske integrationspolitikens föreställningsvärld 1658-1693". [http://www.hist.lu.se/dkstud/docs/ostdanmarkboken.pdf Da Østdanmark blev Sydsverige. Otte studier i dansk-svenske relationer i 1600-tallet]. Eds. Karl-Erik Frandsen and Jens Chr.V. Johansen. Narayana Press. {{ISBN|87-89224-74-4}}, p. 35-60.&lt;/ref&gt; His residence was in the largest city, [[Malmö]].

The office of Governor General was abandoned in 1669, deemed unnecessary. However, when the [[Scanian War]] erupted in 1675, the office was reinstated, and [[Fabian von Fersen]] held the office between 1675 and 1677, when he died in the defence of [[Malmö]].

He was replaced by [[Rutger von Ascheberg]], in 1680, who held it to his death in 1693. It was during Ascheberg's time in office that the stricter policy of Swedification was initiated, as a reaction to the threats of war and possible Danish repossession.

Following the death of Ascheberg, the Governor Generalship was dismantled into a separate county governor for each of the Swedish provinces Blekinge, Halland and Scania. However, a Governor Generalship was reinstated in the province of Scania during the [[Napoleonic War]], when [[Johan Christopher Toll]] became the last Governor-General in the region, a post he held 1801–09.

===Recent history===
The complete history of Skåneland was not taught for a long time in schools in Skåneland, especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt. Instead a Swedish-centric history was taught, and the Scanian history before 1658, for instance concerning the list of monarchs, was disregarded as a component of Danish history. In reaction, a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland. The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history.&lt;ref name=" Ambrius " /&gt;

{{main|Districts of the Gambia}}
[[The Gambia]] is divided into five administrative '''Regions''' (until 2007 these were known as "divisions") and one City. The divisions of the Gambia are created by the Independent Electoral Commission in accordance to Article 192 of the [[Constitution of the Gambia|National Constitution]].&lt;ref name='gambiacon'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html#Govt |title=The Gambia - Government |publisher=[[The World Factbook]] |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per 2013 census, Western region was the most populated with a population of 699,704, while Lower River was the least populated with 82,361. The maximum density of population was seen in Western with 396.59 persons per sq. km, while it was lowest in Lower River with 50.90 persons per sq. km. The maximum number of households was in Western region with 45,396 households as of 2003. Lower River had the highest infant mortality rate of 96 for every thousand births and under-five mortality of 137 per every thousand births. The poverty gap ratio was maximum in Central River with 36.45 per cent as of 2003 and lowest in Lower River with 19.80 per cent.

The Local Govemment Act passed in 2002 superseded the previous local government acts like Local Government Act (Amended 1984), Local Government (City of Banjul) Act (Amended 1988), The Kanifing Municipal Council Act 1991 and the Provinces Act. There were six local governments defined each subdivided into districts and wards. The Mayor who is the chairperson of the council and the council members of each council is elected by people of the area.

The Gambia is also additionally divided into eight Local Government Areas, of which two are the City of [[Banjul]] and the Municipality of [[Kanifing LGA|Kanifing]]; these two collectively form Greater Banjul, although the latter now extends to parts of [[Brikama LGA]], the former Western Division. The other six LGAs comprise the former five Divisions, although the Central River Division was divided into two LGAs, [[Janjanbureh LGA]] in the east and [[Kuntaur LGA]] in the west. The Local Government Areas are further subdivided into 43 [[Districts of the Gambia|districts]]. Of these, Kombo Saint Mary (which shares [[Brikama]] as a capital with the [[Brikama LGA]]) may have been administratively merged with the Greater Banjul area.&lt;ref&gt;

==Local administration==
The Gambia, along with modern day Senegal, were colonies of France and Britain until 1894 when it became a British colony. Both the countries gained independence in 1965 and operated in a federation called Senegambia from 1982. During 1989, the confederation collapsed. In a bloodless coup, Lieutenant Yahya Jamme in 1994 and went on to win multi party elections in three subsequent elections. He has also defeated coups successfully and unlike the West African countries, the Gambia has a relative stable governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gambia country profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13376517|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Local Government Act passed in 2002 superseded the previous local government acts like Local Government Act (Amended 1984), Local Government (City of Banjul) Act (Amended 1988), The Kanifing Municipal Council Act 1991 and the Provinces Act. There were six local governments defined, each subdivided into districts and wards. The Mayor who is the chairperson of the council and the council members of each council are elected by people of the area. The legislation indicating the roles was not clearly defined, but the council is responsible for finance, services and planning for each sector under it. Around 25 per cent of the budget is provisioned by the central government. The council also has a ''Alkalo'' or ''Seyfo'' representative, a Chief representative, a youth nominee, a woman nominee and other nominated members of local interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023265.pdf|page=7|title=Republic of The Gambia, Public Administration and Country profile|format=PDF|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city and area council elections were last held during April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 April 2002 Local Elections in The Gambia|url=http://africanelections.tripod.com/gm_2002local.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|publisher=African Elections Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tidal course''' is any elongated indentation or [[valley]] in a [[wetland]] originated by tidal processes, or having another origin, along which water flows pumped by tidal influence.

A tidal course is a general denomination that includes a series of indentations within a wide spectrum of sizes (width, length and depth) and with at least two levels of inundation. Examples of tidal courses are tidal rills, tidal grooves, tidal gullies, tidal creeks and tidal channels. The first three are small features that normally do not contain water even during neap low tide, whereas  creeks and channels have water permanently.

'''WEAP:''' the Water Evaluation And Planning system is a Windows-based decision support system for integrated water resources management and policy analysis.  WEAP is a model-building tool, used to create simulations of water demand, supply, runoff, evapotranspiration, infiltration, crop irrigation requirements, instream flow requirements, ecosystem services, groundwater and surface storage, reservoir operations, and pollution generation, treatment, discharge and instream water quality, all under scenarios of varying policy, hydrology, climate, land use, technology and socio-economic factors.  WEAP can dynamically link to the USGS [[MODFLOW]] groundwater flow model and the US EPA [http://www.epa.gov/Athens/wwqtsc/html/qual2k.html QUAL2K] surface water quality model.

WEAP was created in 1988[http://www.weap21.org/index.asp?action=219], and continues to be developed and supported by the [[Stockholm Environment Institute US Center|U.S. Center]] of the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]], a non-profit research institute based at [[Tufts University]] in Somerville, Massachusetts.  It is widely used for climate change adaptation studies, and has been applied by researchers and planners in hundreds of organizations worldwide.  

WEAP is distributed at no charge to non-profit, academic and governmental organizations based in developing countries.
