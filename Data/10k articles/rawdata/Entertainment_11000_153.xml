'''''3 Minutes''''' is an action-oriented [[short film]] that was released on January 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3minutes-film.com/ |title=3 MINUTES |publisher=3minutes-film.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production on the film commenced in 2010, with director [[Ross Ching]] at the helm, alongside producers [[Don Le]] and [[George Wang (producer)|George Wang]].  The film stars [[Harry Shum, Jr.]], [[So You Think You Can Dance (season 4) finalists#Stephen "twitch" Boss|Stephen "tWitch" Boss]], [[Katrina Law]], and Thaine Allison Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rossching.com/3-minutes |title=3 Minutes « ross:ching |publisher=Rossching.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[special effects]] work was provided by David Adametz and the score composed by Paul Dateh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rossching.com/3-minutes |title=3 Minutes « ross:ching |publisher=Rossching.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film centers on the unnamed main character (Harry Shum) receiving a handgun from an old man (Thaine Allison Jr.) and being told he has to complete an unspecified task within three minutes. Shum's character then rushes into a storage yard in pursuit of "Steve" (Stephen Boss), who evades Shum's gunshots and hides. Steve finds a dead body (Nicholas Acosta) holding a [[lightsaber]], and uses the weapon to disarm Shum, who draws his own lightsaber. After a short battle, Shum [[decapitation|decapitates]] Steve and runs back to the old man, where he is told that his time was three minutes, eighteen seconds. Shum panics and runs away. A fourth unnamed character (Katrina Law) comes forward and receives a pistol from the old man who repeats his "three minutes" instruction. Law's character then leaves the garage, presumably in pursuit of Shum.

The project is part two of a projected trilogy of short films including a prequel and sequel.  The film was originally designed as a vehicle to showcase a wider range of acting skills for the two leads, Harry Shum Jr. and Stephen "tWitch" Boss, especially outside of the singing and dancing sphere. ''3 Minutes'' has received coverage from the official [[Star Wars]] site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starwarsblog.starwars.com/index.php/2011/01/11/glee-goes-geek-in-3-minutes/ |title=The Official Star Wars Blog » Glee Goes Geek in 3 Minutes |publisher=Starwarsblog.starwars.com |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223035927/http://starwarsblog.starwars.com/index.php/2011/01/11/glee-goes-geek-in-3-minutes/ |archive-date=2011-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired News|Wired]].com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Curtis |last=Silver |url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/01/intense-lightsaber-combat-in-3-minutes/ |title=Intense Lightsaber Combat in "3 Minutes" &amp;#124; GeekDad |publisher=Wired.com |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Gizmodo]],&lt;ref&gt;https://gizmodo.com/5729991/if-you-got-three-minutes-watch-3-minutes&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ''[[New York Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/minutes_for_harry_shum_to_save_the_AsCNRHeuKW5cPw7YEbpoLM |title=Harry Shum &amp; Stephen "tWitch" Boss star in "3 Minutes" |first=Jaret |last=Wieselman |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2011-02-14 |work=New York Post |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112223454/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/minutes_for_harry_shum_to_save_the_AsCNRHeuKW5cPw7YEbpoLM |archivedate=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magazine |first=Seventeen |url=http://www.seventeen.com/cosmogirl/harry-shum-jr-3-minutes-film |title=Harry Shum Jr Movie - 3 Minutes Movie - Harry Shum Jr |publisher=Seventeen |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-02-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210144550/http://www.seventeen.com/cosmogirl/harry-shum-jr-3-minutes-film |archivedate=10 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Audrey (magazine)|Audrey]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audreymagazine.com/harry-shum-jr/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109175729/http://audreymagazine.com/harry-shum-jr/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-09 |title=Harry Shum Jr.’s "3 Minutes" |publisher=Audrey Magazine |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelapa.com/2011/01/3-minutes-teaser-with-harry-shum-jr.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.angryasianman.com/2011/01/harry-shum-jr-in-3-minutes-teaser.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and ''[[Hyphen (magazine)|Hyphen]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/archive/2011/01/screen-scene-la-miss-chinatown-fashion-show |title=On Screen &amp; On Scene: The LA Miss Chinatown Fashion Show &amp;#124; Hyphen magazine - Asian American arts, culture, and politics |publisher=Hyphen magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also featured on [[Vimeo]]'s Staff Pick of the Day on its debut day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=O'Reilly |url=http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks#18612518 |title=Vimeo Staff Picks on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315063629/http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks |archivedate=15 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analog '''high-definition television''' was an [[analog video]] [[broadcast television system]] developed in the 1930s to replace early experimental systems with as few as 12-lines.  On 2 November 1936 the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular analog high-definition television service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm Teletronic – The Television History Site&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of television broadcasting as we know it today.  [[John Logie Baird]], [[Philo T. Farnsworth]], and [[Vladimir Zworykin]] had each developed competing TV systems, but resolution was not the issue that separated their substantially different technologies,  it was [[Interference proceeding|patent interference]] lawsuits and deployment issues given the tumultuous financial climate of the late 1920s  and 1930s.

Most patents were expiring by the end of World War II leaving no worldwide standard for television. The standards introduced in the early 1950s stayed for over half a century.

(NOTE: Although UK's [[405-line television system|405-line system]] was advertised as "high definition", due to it being higher than low-lined televisions, the picture quality isn't even close to standard definition and there were already higher resolutions available at the time)

== {{anchor|819-line}} French 819-line system==
When [[Europe]] resumed TV transmissions after [[World War II|WWII]] (i.e. in the late 1940s and early 1950s) most countries standardized on a [[576i]] (625-line) television system. The two exceptions were the British [[405-line television system|405-line system]], which had already been introduced in 1936, and the [[France|French]] 819-line system. During the 1940s [[René Barthélemy]] already reached 1015-lines and even 1042-lines. On November 20, 1948, [[François Mitterrand]], the then Secretary of State for Information, decreed a broadcast standard of 819-lines developed by [[Henri de France]]; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition.

This was arguably the world's first [[high-definition television system]], and, by today's standards, it could be called 737i (as it had 737-lines active)&lt;ref&gt;Report 308-2 of the XIIth Pleniary Assembly of the CCIR - Characteristics of Monochrome Television Systems&lt;/ref&gt; with a maximum theoretical resolution of 408×368-[[line pair]]s (which in digital terms can be expressed as equivalent to 816×736 pixels) with a 4:3 aspect ratio (and thus a slightly wide effective "pixel aspect ratio" of 6:5, square pixel recording needing approx 980x736 instead). It was used only in France by [[TF1]], and in [[Monaco]] by Tele Monte Carlo. However, the theoretical picture quality far exceeded the capabilities of the equipment of its time, and each 819-line channel occupied a wide 14&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] of [[VHF]] bandwidth.

By comparison, the modern 720p standard is 1280×720 pixels, of which the 4:3 portion would be 960×720 pixels, while PAL DVDs have a resolution of 720×576 pixels.

System E implementation provided very good (near HDTV) picture quality but with an uneconomical use of bandwidth; a 625/50 signal providing the same clarity as an 819-line image, but matted down 4:3 with the same number of lines, would still need nearly 6mhz for the vision carrier alone (vs typical 5 to 6mhz in actual use), and 5mhz for 525/60 (vs typical 4.2mhz), although a 405/50 transmission could get away with only 2.5mhz (typical ''3mhz'', as [[System A]] made no allowance for the [[Kell factor]] and thus had a "narrow pixel"/"tall line" appearance). Thus even an unusually crisp "standard" definition (or slightly soft 405-line) image only needed half, or even one-quarter the vision bandwidth of the 819-line system to give a "balanced" appearance, despite their lower overall resolution still seeming perfectly clear on the more affordable small-screen receivers often used in the pre-color era. With the usual additions of sound carrier and vestigial sideband the result was a combined signal that demanded approximately two to three times the bandwidth of more moderately specified standards, even when colour was added to them (as the color subcarrier resides ''within'' the luma signal space).

System F was an adapted 819-line system used in Belgium and Luxembourg as an answer to this problem, with only half the vision bandwidth and approximately half the sound carrier offset. It allowed French 819-line programming to squeeze into the 7&amp;nbsp;MHz VHF broadcast channels used in those neighbouring countries, albeit with a substantial loss of horizontal resolution (408×737 effective, with what would now be considered extra-wide 12:5 aspect ratio pixels); although this still offered approximately twice the actual clarity of 405-line System A (twice the lines, roughly the same horizontal definition), the contrast between vertical and horizontal resolution would have made it seem perceptually worse. Use of System F was discontinued in Belgium in February 1968, and in Luxembourg in September 1971.

Despite some attempts to create a color [[SECAM]] version of the 819-line system (which would have then also had the highest pre-HDTV colour signal resolution, with lines of FM encoding alternately centred on 8.82 and 8.5mhz, if arranged similarly to 625-line SECAM), France abandoned it in favor of the Europe-wide standard of 625-lines ([[576i50]]), with the final 819-line transmissions from Paris in 1984. TMC in Monaco were the last broadcasters to transmit 819-line television, closing down their System E transmitter in 1985.

However, between 1976 and 1981 when French channel [[TF1]] was switching area by area to the new analog 625-lines UHF network with SECAM color, some transmitters and gapfillers broadcast the 819-line signal in UHF.&lt;ref&gt;TDF:situation des émetteurs au 31 December 1980&lt;/ref&gt; When switching to 625-lines, most gapfillers did not change UHF channel (e.g. many gapfillers using this transmission located in French Alps near Grenoble, Mont Salève and Geneva began broadcasting on UHF channel 42, and continue to use this frequency to this day). They were switched to 625-lines in June 1981.

==Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding system (MUSE)==
{{Main|Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding}}

Japan had  the earliest working HDTV system, with design efforts going back to 1979. The country began broadcasting wideband analog [[high-definition video]] signals in the late 1980s using an interlaced resolution of 1035 or 1080-lines active (''1035i'') or 1125-lines total supported by the [[Sony HDVS]] line of equipment.

The Japanese system, developed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] in the 1980s, employed filtering tricks to reduce the original source signal to decrease bandwidth utilization. MUSE was marketed as "Hi-Vision" by NHK.

* Japanese broadcast engineers rejected conventional vestigial sideband broadcasting.
* It was decided early on that MUSE would be a satellite broadcast format as Japan economically supports satellite broadcasting.

In the typical setup, three picture elements on a line were actually derived from three separate scans.  Stationary images were transmitted at full resolution. However, as MUSE lowers the horizontal and vertical resolution of material that varies greatly from frame to frame, moving images were blurred in a manner similar to using 16&amp;nbsp;mm movie film for HDTV projection. In fact, whole-camera pans would result in a loss of 50% of horizontal resolution.

MUSE's "1125-lines" are an analog measurement, which includes non-video "scan lines" during which a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]'s electron beam returns to the top of the screen to begin scanning the next field.  Only 1035-lines have picture information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Geoff|title=Communications Technology Handbook|date=1996|isbn=0-240-51461-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDcqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=Multiple+sub-nyquist+sampling+Encoding+system&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HZyOOtGCKw&amp;sig=TABBmV7zPusCRyCkbRRNeYV6ccI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE4_iCq6fbAhXvIDQIHeX4BG44FBDoAQg7MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Multiple%20sub-nyquist%20sampling%20Encoding%20system&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital signals count only the lines (rows of pixels) of the picture makeup as there are no other scanning lines (though conversion to an analogue format will introduce them), so NTSC's 525-lines become 480i, and MUSE would be 1035i.

Shadows and multipath still plague this analog frequency modulated transmission mode.

Considering the technological limitations of the time, MUSE was a very cleverly designed analog system.
Though Japan has since switched to a digital HDTV system based on [[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting|ISDB]], the original MUSE-based BS Satellite channel 9 (NHK BS Hi-vision) was still being broadcast {{As of|2007|lc=on}}. It broadcast the same programs as BS-digital channel 103, but transmission ended on November 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soumu.go.jp/joho_tsusin/eng/Releases/Telecommunications/news060208_3.html|title=MIC(Press Release-Telecom)|author=|date=|website=www.soumu.go.jp|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsampling lives on in modern [[MPEG]] systems based  on [[JPEG]] coding, as JPEG offers Chroma sub-sampling. High quality HD television has a sampling structure approximating 4:2:1 (Luma : Chroma : Saturation) for reference images (I-Frames), though 4:0.75:0.65 is probably typical for multi-channel delivery.

==HD-MAC==
{{Main|HD-MAC}}

'''HD-MAC''' was a proposed [[television standard]] by the [[European Commission]]  in 1986 (MAC standard) . It was an early attempt by the [[European Community|EEC]] to provide [[High-definition television|HDTV]] in [[Europe]]. It was a complex mix of [[analog signal]] ([[Multiplexed Analog Components]]) multiplexed with digital sound.  The video signal (1250 (1152 visible) lines/50 frames in [[16:9]] aspect ratio) was encoded with a modified [[D2-MAC]] encoder.

[[File:Multiplexed Analogue Components transmission (simulation).jpg|300px|right|thumb| HD-MAC test pattern similar to the B-MAC test pattern]]

In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] experimental HD-MAC broadcasting took place. 100  HD-MAC receivers (in that time, [[retroprojector]]s) in Europe were used to test the capabilities of the standard. This  project was financed by  the [[European Union]] (EU). The PAL-converted signal was used by mainstream broadcasters such as [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]], [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] and [[3Sat]].

The HD-MAC standard was abandoned in 1993, and since then all [[European Union|EU]] and  [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] efforts have focused on the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] system (''Digital Video Broadcasting''), which allows both SDTV and HDTV.

'''Arkady Isaakovich Raikin''' ({{lang-ru|Аркадий Исаакович Райкин}}; {{OldStyleDate|24 October|1911|11 October}} – 17 December 1987) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[stand-up comedian]], theater and film actor, and stage director. He led the school of Soviet and Russian humorists for about half a century.

==Biography==
Raikin was born into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Riga]], in the [[Governorate of Livonia]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Latvia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Charny, Vitaly. [http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/newsletter/Raikin.htm "Arkady Raikin, 1911-1987"]. JewishGen. December 2004. Retrieved 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the Leningrad Theatrical Technicum in 1935 and worked in both state theatres and variety shows. In 1939, he founded his own theatre in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where he used [[sketch comedy|skit]]s and [[impersonation]]s to ridicule the inefficiency of [[Communist]] [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] way of life. In the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[police state]] this was prone to danger, as it was not uncommon to get [[Great purge|purged]] not only for telling a casual joke, but even for [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|not reporting it to the authorities]]. He also appeared in several comedies during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]].

[[File:Arkady Raikin PSE Russia 2011 Crop3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The roles played by Raikin (from left to right): The Foreigner, Agnessa Pavlovna, [[Charlie Chaplin]]]]
Raikin was the creator of a whole array of unforgettable satirical characters, and a living legend of his time and his country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Some of the brilliant satirical and lyrical images created by Raikin acquired their second life in the serial TV film ''People and Mannequins''.

Raikin is often compared with [[Charlie Chaplin]]. His fame in the Soviet Union, and throughout Central and Eastern Europe, was such that he was invited to participate in the opening night of [[BBC Two]] television in 1964, although the broadcast had to be postponed for one day due to a power failure. His trip to London for the BBC broadcast—during which he was reunited with his British cousin, distinguished pianist Bruno Raikin—marked the first of only two times when the Soviet government permitted him to perform in the West. Arkady Raikin also maintained good working relationships with [[Marcel Marceau]] and some other foreign actors.

Three years before his death, Raikin finally moved to [[Moscow]], where he opened the [[Satyricon (theatre)|Satyricon Theatre]], now run by his son [[Konstantin Raikin]], also an acclaimed actor. His wife, Roma, played a major role in guiding his career, and his daughter, Ekaterina, also had a successful career as a Moscow actress. For a month during the summer of 1987, Raikin hosted his American cousin, Washington D.C. attorney Steven Raikin, as a guest in his Moscow flat.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Washington Post, "Love &amp; Glasnost; An East-West Romance With Comic Relief." 5 September 1987, p. C1, by Elizabeth Kastor.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1987 the Soviet Ministry of Culture finally permitted Raikin to visit the United States, where, with his son and daughter, he gave emotional farewell performances in several cities to adoring audiences of Russian émigrés.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/cinema-and-theater/arkady-raikin/|title=Arkady Raikin – Russiapedia Cinema and theater Prominent Russians|website=russiapedia.rt.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Raikin was awarded the title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1968, the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1980, and the [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] award in 1981.

A [[minor planet]] [[4518 Raikin]] discovered on [[April Fools' Day|1 April]] 1976, is named after him.

The company's first title was ''[[Armies of Exigo]]'', developed with the financial backing of [[Andy Vajna]], published by [[Electronic Arts]] and released in the end of 2004. The team has developed ''[[Warhammer: Mark of Chaos]]'' and ''[[Warhammer: Battle March]]'', an expansion for ''Mark of Chaos'', which were released on November 14, 2006 and September 16, 2008, respectively, for the [[Personal computer|PC]].

'''Bloomsday''' is a commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer [[James Joyce]], observed annually in [[Dublin]] and elsewhere on 16 June, the day his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' takes place in 1904, the date of his first outing with his wife-to-be, [[Nora Barnacle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2 July 2012|title=Silence, exile, punning|author=Louis Menand|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/silence-exile-punning|quote=They walked to Ringsend, on the south bank of the Liffey, where (and here we can drop the Dante analogy) she put her hand inside his trousers and masturbated him. It was June 16, 1904, the day on which Joyce set “Ulysses.” When people celebrate Bloomsday, that is what they are celebrating.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named after its protagonist [[Leopold Bloom]].

== Name ==

The English [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]] ''Bloomsday'' is usually used in Irish as well, though some publications call it '''[[:ga:Lá Bloom|Lá Bloom]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dast.gov.ie/publications/release.ie.asp?ID=100101{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First celebration==
[[File:Firstbloom.James.Joyce.Ryan.Cronin.O'Nolan.Kavanagh.Joyce.jpg|thumb|'' Firstbloom'': [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Brian O'Nolan]], [[Patrick Kavanagh]] and Tom Joyce (James Joyce's cousin); Sandymount, 1954]]

The first mention of such a celebration is to be found in a letter by Joyce to Miss Weaver of 27 June 1924, which refers to "a group of people who observe what they call Bloom's day&amp;nbsp;– 16 June".&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Gilbert, ed., ''Letters of James Joyce'', New York 1957, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 50th anniversary of the events in the novel, in 1954, [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]] (artist, critic, publican and founder of ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]'' magazine) and the novelist [[Brian O'Nolan]] organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the ''Ulysses'' route. They were joined by [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Anthony Cronin]], Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce's cousin, represented the family interest) and AJ Leventhal (a lecturer in French at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]). Ryan had engaged two horse-drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, in which in ''Ulysses'' Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to Paddy Dignam's funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. Cronin stood in for Stephen Dedalus, O’Nolan for his father Simon Dedalus, John Ryan for the journalist Martin Cunningham, and A.J. Leventhal, being Jewish, was recruited to fill (unknown to himself according to John Ryan) the role of Leopold Bloom. They planned to travel round the city through the day, starting at the [[Martello tower]] at [[Sandycove]] (where the novel begins), visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which in 1967 he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom's front door), having rescued it from demolition. A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by John Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Link to an account of this day: [http://members.ozemail.com.au/~maelduin/firstbloom.html An account of the first Bloomsday]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openculture.com/2013/07/the-first-bloomsday.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BloomsdayGtGeorgeSt.jpg|thumb|left|Street party in North Great George's Street, 2004]]

===Dublin===
The day involves a range of cultural activities, including ''Ulysses'' readings and dramatisations, [[pub crawl]]s and other events, some of it hosted by the [[James Joyce Centre]] in North Great George's Street. Enthusiasts often dress in [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] costume to celebrate Bloomsday, and retrace Bloom's route around Dublin via landmarks such as [[Davy Byrne's pub]]. Hard-core devotees have even been known to hold marathon readings of the entire novel, some lasting up to 36 hours.

The [[James Joyce Tower and Museum]] at Sandycove, site of the opening chapter of ''Ulysses'', hosts many free activities around Bloomsday including theatrical performances, musical events, tours of the iconic tower and readings from Joyce's masterpiece.

[[File:James Joyce Tower and Museum2.JPG|thumb|Reading from ''Ulysses'' on top of [[James Joyce Tower and Museum]], 16 June 2009]]
"Every year hundreds of Dubliners dress as characters from the book ... as if to assert their willingness to become one with the text. It is quite impossible to imagine any other masterpiece of modernism having quite such an effect on the life of a city."&lt;ref name="Kiberd on Bloomsday"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/16/jamesjoyce-classics | title=Ulysses, modernism's most sociable masterpiece | publisher=Guardian.co.uk | date=16 June 2009 | accessdate=28 June 2011 | author=Kiberd, Declan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Bloomsday 1982, the centenary year of Joyce's birth, Irish state broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] transmitted a [[Ulysses (broadcast)|continuous 30-hour dramatic performance of the entire text of ''Ulysses'']] on radio.

A five-month-long festival, ReJoyce Dublin 2004, took place in Dublin between 1 April and 31 August 2004. On the Sunday before the 100th "anniversary" of the fictional events described in the book, 10,000 people in Dublin were treated to a free, open-air, full [[Full breakfast|Irish breakfast]] on [[O'Connell Street]] consisting of [[sausage]]s, [[Bacon|rashers]], [[toast]], [[bean]]s, and [[black pudding|black]] and [[white pudding]]s.

The 2006 Bloomsday festivities were cancelled, the day coinciding with the funeral of [[Charles Haughey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sorcha|last=Griffith|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/charlie-wouldnt-have-cancelled-bloomsday-26379583.html|title=Charlie 'wouldn't have cancelled Bloomsday'|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=15 June 2006|accessdate=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Bloomsday has also been celebrated since 1994 in the Hungarian town of [[Szombathely]], the fictional birthplace of Leopold Bloom's father, Virág Rudolf, an emigrant [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jew]]. The event is usually centred on the Iseum&amp;nbsp;– the remnants of an [[Isis]] temple there from [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]]&amp;nbsp;– and the Blum-mansion, commemorated to Joyce since 1997, at 40–41 Fő street, which used to be the property of an actual Jewish family called Blum. Hungarian author László Najmányi in his 2007 novel, ''The Mystery of the Blum-mansion'' (A Blum-ház rejtélye) describes the results of his research on the connection between Joyce and the Blum family.

Bloomsday in [[Melbourne]] has a proud history of engagement with the work of James Joyce. Since 1994, a small committee of Joyceans has read and re-read Joyce and mounted theatrical events designed to communicate the joy of Joyce to its loyal patrons.&lt;ref name="Melbourne Bloomsday"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bloomsdayinmelbourne.org.au | title=Melbourne Bloomsday | accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Bloomsday commenced in Auckland in the year 2000 with a radio transmission of Ulysses on Access Radio from midnight to 6{{nbsp}}am, June 16 — the first Bloomsday celebration of the new millennium anywhere in the world. A cabaret show with Linn Lorkin and the Jews Brothers Band followed next year, 2001, and there has been a Jews Brothers Bloomsday ever since on June 16, with Brooklyn musician Hershal Herscher as a Woody Allen Bloom and Dublin actor Brian Keagan reading from Ulysses. Currently this three-hour show is hosted by the Thirsty Dog, on Karangahape Rd. Guest Molly Blooms have included top NZ performers Robyn Malcolm, Noelle McCarthy, Carmel McGlone, Lucy Lawless, Geraldine Brophy and Jennifer Ward-Lealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=2046310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/06/bloomsday-james-joyce-ulysses&lt;/ref&gt;

On Bloomsday 2011, ''@Ulysses'' was the stage for an experimental day-long [[Twitter|tweeting]] of ''Ulysses''. Starting at 0800 (Dublin time) on Thursday 16 June 2011, the aim was to explore what would happen if ''Ulysses'' was recast 140 characters at a time. It was hoped that the event would become the first of a series.&lt;ref name="2011 Tweeting Ulysses"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://11ysses.wordpress.com/our-tweaders/ | title=Ulysses meets Twitter 2011 | accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cinémathèque Française''' ({{IPA-fr|sinematɛk fʁɑ̃sɛːz}}) is a French film organization that holds one of the largest archives of film documents and film-related objects in the world. Based in Paris, the archive offers daily screenings of worldwide films.

==History==

The collection emerged from the efforts of [[Henri Langlois]] and [[Lotte H. Eisner|Lotte H Eisner]] in the mid 1930s to collect and screen films. Langlois had acquired one of the largest collections in the world by the beginning of [[World War II]], only to have it nearly wiped out by the German authorities in occupied France, who ordered the destruction of all films made prior to 1937. He and his friends smuggled huge numbers of documents and films out of occupied [[France]] to protect them until the end of the war.

After the war, the French government provided a small screening room, staff and subsidy for the collection, which was first relocated to the Avenue de Messine. Significant French filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s, including [[Robert Bresson]], [[René Clément]], [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]] and [[Jacques Becker]] frequented screenings at the Cinémathèque. Directors of the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] (''la Nouvelle Vague'') school &amp;mdash; [[Alain Resnais]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Roger Vadim]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]], and [[Pierre Kast]] &amp;mdash; also received much of their film education by attending the collection's screenings.

==The events of May 1968==
{{main|May 1968 in France}}

In June 1963, the Cinémathèque had moved to the [[Palais de Chaillot]] with funds provided by [[André Malraux]], Minister of Culture, and became subject to the government. In February 1968, under pressure from the Ministry of Finance, Malraux required changes in the management of the Cinémathèque and dismissed Henri Langlois.

A defence committee was formed, uniting the cream of French filmmakers ([[Alexandre Astruc]], [[Claude Berri]], Robert Bresson, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, [[Jean Eustache]], [[Georges Franju]], [[Abel Gance]], Jean-Luc Godard, [[Joris Ivens]], Pierre Kast, [[Chris Marker]], Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, [[Eric Rohmer]], [[Jean Rouch]], François Truffaut) together with major actors ([[Jean-Pierre Léaud]], [[Claude Jade]], [[Jean Marais]] and [[Françoise Rosay]]). Foreign filmmakers such as [[Charles Chaplin]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]] added their support. Protests were organized.

Confrontations followed between young people, largely students, and what they saw as an authoritarian centre-right government, out of touch with the concerns of the younger generation. These demonstrations were precursors of and merged into the widespread student revolt that erupted from March 1968 onwards, escalating into nationwide unrest in May. Before then, the government had backed down over the Cinémathèque, reinstating Langlois as head in April 1968.

==Location==

After numerous incidents — including multiple relocations from one small screening room to another through the 1950s and a fire in its last premises — the Cinémathèque Française moved to 51, rue de Bercy in the [[12th arrondissement of Paris]] and reopened its doors in a [[postmodern]] building designed by [[Frank Gehry]], an American architect.   A restaurant on the lower level is open to the public.

The Bibliothèque du Film, which was created in 1992 to show the history of cinema, its production, impact and artistic strength, has recently merged with the Cinémathèque Française.

Cinémathèque Française operates the [[Musée de la Cinémathèque]], formerly known as Musée du Cinéma – Henri Langlois, in the new building.

==Tributes==
In celebration of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Centennial of the Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the Museum and the [[City Center of Music and Drama]] in New York co-sponsored "Cinémathèque at the Metropolitan Museum." The exhibition showed seventy films dating from the medium's first seventy-five years on thirty-five consecutive evenings from July 29 to September 3, 1970. The films were selected by [[Henri Langlois]] for their significance and contributions to the history of filmmaking, including work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors. The program was the most diverse film exhibition held in the United States to date, and was the Museum's first major undertaking in film.

The Cinémathèque's closing is noted in [[François Truffaut|Truffaut]]'s ''[[Stolen Kisses]]''. The Cinémathèque also appears in the [[Paul Auster]] novel ''[[The Book of Illusions]]'' and the [[Harvey Danger]] song "Private Helicopter."

The Cinématèque and the events surrounding the dismissal of [[Henri Langlois]] in 1968 features heavily in [[Gilbert Adair]]'s Novel ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]'' also known as ''The Dreamers'' and in its [[The Dreamers (film)|film adaptation]] by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].

[[File:Cowardy_custard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Cowardy Custard'' book and album with the same image of Coward. The programme has the Mermaid Theatre's standard cover.]]
'''''Cowardy Custard''''' is a musical [[revue]] and was one of the last [[Noël Coward]] shows staged during his life. It was devised by Gerard Frow, Alan Strachan and Wendy Toye. A book, also titled ''Cowardy Custard'', was published in connection with the revue, similarly celebrating the Coward image.

The biographical revue premiered in London in 1972, running for 405 performances. A revised version toured in the UK in 2011.

The term "cowardy custard" is a taunt used by children in the UK equivalent to "scaredy cat" in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|authorlink=Leslie Dunkling|title=A Dictionary of Epithets and Terms of Address|publisher=Routledge
|year=1990|isbn=0-415-00761-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The working title of the show was ''Cream of Coward'', but [[Noël Coward|Coward]] cabled the producers three months before the opening from his home in [[Jamaica]] suggesting ''Cowardy Custard''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' Diary, 3 May 1972, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He vetoed an alternative suggestion, ''This Is Noël Coward'', which he said was too close to "This ''Was'' Noël Coward".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' Diary, 11 July 1972, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Telling the story of Coward's life through song and biographical snippets, the revue was billed as "An entertainment featuring the words and music of Noël Coward". The Coward numbers featured are songs and scenes from Coward's works of the 1920s to the 1960s, including "[[Shadow Play (play)|You were there]]", "[[Mad About the Boy]]"; "The Stately Homes of England", "I Wonder What Happened to Him?" and, perhaps most memorably, [[I Went to a Marvellous Party|"Marvellous Party"]] (sung by [[Patricia Routledge]] in the original production).&lt;ref&gt;The reviewer in ''The Times'', Charles Lewsen, said "Miss Routledge was in glorious voice last night. Her 'Marvellous Party' threatened to stop the show." ''The Times'', 11 July 1972, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The revue also contains previously unpublished material, excerpts of plays and dialogues, material from Coward's autobiographies and some of his poems. Sketches featured include scenes from ''[[Shadow Play (play)|Shadow Play]]''.

The original production opened at the [[Mermaid Theatre]], London, on 10 July 1972 as part of the 1972 [[City of London Festival]] and ran for over a year for a total of 405 performances. It was directed by Wendy Toye and employed a cast of twelve (six men and six women), featuring Routledge, [[Derek Waring]], John Moffatt, [[Elaine Delmar]], [[Una Stubbs]], Jonathan Cecil, Peter Gale, Anna Sharkey, [[Geoffrey Burridge]], Laurel Ford, Tudor Davies and Olivia Breeze. The musical director was John Burrows. After its run in London, the show toured the UK with different cast members. It has since been produced by amateur groups. Also in 1972, a revue on similar lines, ''[[Oh, Coward!]],'' played in New York at the New Theatre, achieving 294 performances.

A recording of the original London production of ''Cowardy Custard'' was made by [[RCA]]. The production also spawned a book called ''Cowardy Custard: The World of Noël Coward''.&lt;ref&gt;Coward, Noël; John Hadfield (ed).  [http://www.a1wdb.com/cgi-bin/women/13539 ''Cowardy Custard: The World of Noël Coward'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, London: Heinemann (1973) {{ISBN|0-434-31090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of the show, revised by Strachan, was toured in the UK in spring 2011, starring [[Dillie Keane]] and [[Kit and The Widow]], with Stuart Neal and [[Savannah Stevenson]]. It included unpublished material and excerpts from Coward's diaries and memoirs, as well as the songs and scenes.&lt;ref name=cc2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artswrap.co.uk/event/cowardy-custard-tour-2011 "Cowardy Custard – Tour – 2011"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811214309/http://artswrap.co.uk/event/cowardy-custard-tour-2011 |date=11 August 2011 }}.

Among a handful of original Characters, the game also includes unlockable and downloadable ([[Downloadable content|DLC]]) Characters. Characters from the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'', ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' horror franchises are featured.

A spiritual successor, Identity V, developed by [[NetEase]] and co-developed by Behaviour Interactive, was released for mobile devices in China in early 2018, and was released worldwide in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www-newsweek-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.newsweek.com/identity-v-mobile-horror-game-review-asymmetrical-multiplayer-dead-daylight-1010283?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;amp=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fidentity-v-mobile-horror-game-review-asymmetrical-multiplayer-dead-daylight-1010283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:DBD Gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|270x270px|The player repairing a generator with other Survivors|alt=]]
A group of up to four Survivors must elude one Killer. The Survivors' perspectives are [[Third-person view|third-person]], while the Killer's perspective is [[First-person (video games)|first-person]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Survivors===
Players assume the role of one of the 14 Survivors, Dwight Fairfield, Meg Thomas, Claudette Morel, Jake Park, Nea Karlsson, [[Laurie Strode]], [[Left 4 Dead|William 'Bill' Overbeck]], Ace Visconti, Feng Min, David King,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3388271/dead-daylight-4-2/|title=New 'Dead by Daylight' Footage Introduces the Killers - Bloody Disgusting!|last=Dodd|first=Adam|date=April 21, 2016|website=Bloody Disgusting!|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/25/dead-by-daylight-halloween-dlc-released/|title=Dead By Daylight Gets Halloweenie In New DLC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Quentin Smith|Quentin Smith]], [[David Tapp]], Kate Denson, Adam Francis or Jeff Johansen. The goal of the Survivors is to escape the enclosed area, which can be done in one of two ways: either by repairing a certain number of disabled [[Engine-generator|Generators]] (always one Generator more than the amount of Survivors that spawned into the trial) to provide power to the switch boxes of two Exit Gates leading out of the trial grounds; or by escaping through the Hatch. The Hatch appears when the number of repaired Generators exceeds the number of Survivors that are still alive by one, and opens only when there is only one Survivor remaining in the trial. The Survivors will need a key to open the Hatch if there are more than one person alive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/06/15/e3-dead-by-daylight-wants-to-kill-you/|title=E3: Dead By Daylight Wants To Kill You|last=Johnston|first=Rich|date=June 15, 2016|website=Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News|publisher=|access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Survivor's movement options consist of sprinting, walking, crouch-walking or crawling. They must elude the Killer by losing their line of sight in a chase or by successfully hiding from them.

===Killers===
As the Killer, players assume the role of either the Trapper, the Wraith, the Hillbilly, the Nurse, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|the Shape]], the Hag, the Doctor, the Huntress, [[Leatherface|the Cannibal]], [[Freddy Krueger|the Nightmare]], [[Amanda Young|the Pig]], the Clown, the Spirit or the Legion. Most Killers only have one form of locomotion, moving at a fast pace, which is moderately faster than the pace of a sprinting Survivor. When hunting the Survivors, the Killer must capture them by either striking them twice with their Weapon (the first hit reduces the Survivor to the Injured State and pushes them a short distance ahead of the Killer, while the second hit drops them to crawling on the ground) or grabbing them in one move by either catching them inside Lockers, while attempting to vault over Pallets or through Windows (these work only when the Survivor is injured), while repairing a Generator, trying to rescue a fellow Survivor from a Hook or attempting to escape through the Hatch. Some Killers have secondary attacks that deal double-damage and put Survivors into the Dying State in one strike.

The Killer's goal is to sacrifice Survivors to the Entity, a malevolent being which rules over the Realm in which Dead by Daylight takes place. Caught Survivors are put onto Meathooks located throughout the trial grounds, which starts the sacrifice process, which will take 2 minutes to complete without any outside influences. Some special Add-ons, Perks or the 'Memento Mori' Offerings allow the Killer to bypass the sacrifice process and kill a Survivor directly, with a special animation.

The first time a Survivor is hooked, they enter the first phase. In this phase only, the Survivor can try for a low (4 %) chance of escaping from the Hook at the cost of tremendously accelerating the sacrifice process upon failure to escape. Hooked Survivors can also be rescued by fellow Survivors. If the Survivor escapes or is saved and eventually hooked a second time, they will enter the 'struggle phase', in which the Survivor has to resist the Entity trying to stab them by rapidly pressing the Spacebar, X, or A, depending on the platform, until they are either saved by an ally or killed by the 'Entity'. If the Survivor is saved during the 'struggle phase' and is hooked a third time, they will die instantly with no opportunity of survival.

The Killer, despite walking at a fast pace, is slower than Survivors in most other movements: after striking a Survivor, the Killer will slow their movement to wipe the blood off of their Weapon. The Killer is also slower in vaulting through Windows and cannot leap over Pallets Survivors can throw down into their path, but instead have to go around the spot or spend some time destroying them.

The Killer also has an Aura-reading ability, constantly revealing the location of Generators, Hex Totems and in case of carrying a Survivor, Hooks across the Map. A new mechanic was added in Patch 1.5.0, which introduced 'Bloodlust'. 15 seconds into a chase, the Killer receives a boost of 0.2&amp;nbsp;m/s to their base movement speed; 30 seconds into a chase grants the Killer a 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s boost; and finally, if a chase lasts for 45 consecutive seconds, the Killer receives a 0.6&amp;nbsp;m/s boost. Bloodlust only lasts until a chase ends after which the movement speed boost will degrade at a rate of 10 % per second spent not chasing a Survivor, with breaking a Pallet or injuring a Survivor instantly removing it completely.

===Perks===
Survivors and Killers each have the option to utilise up to four Perks in their load-out, that give their Characters special abilities. Each Survivor starts off with a set of three Perks that are unique to them and must first be unlocked before the other Survivors can use them. There are also Perks that can be obtained by any Character, such as Kindred, Small Game, etc. These perks can be unlocked and upgraded in the Bloodweb using Bloodpoints and each Bloodweb can only hold up to two perks. These perks can range from giving a burst of speed when running from the Killer, to being able to self-heal without a first aid kit, to unlocking the ability to sabotage meat hooks without a toolbox. There are also a multitude of 'universal' perks that are available to unlock by any Survivor.

===General Gameplay===
In dealing with the Killer, Survivors can also make use of a handful of Items – searching Chests inside buildings will sometimes yield Med-Kits (which allow the Survivors to heal themselves rather than wait for a teammate), Flashlights (which can be used to temporarily blind the Killer and rescue a Survivor that the Killer is carrying), Toolboxes (which can be used both to repair Generators faster and to temporarily sabotage Hooks and Bear Traps), Keys (do a variety of things depending on their Add-ons and may be used to open the Hatch), Maps (which track objectives and reveal their Auras). One resource that Survivors can use are massive wooden Pallets, which are placed upright, and can be pulled down when a Survivor runs past them – if the Killer is right behind them, the Pallet will momentarily stun the Killer if it successfully hits them.

Other technical advantages that Survivors have include the ability to see the Aura of downed and hooked teammates – thus easily drawing them to their location for a rescue – and can similarly see the locations of newly repaired Generators and the Exit Gates for a short period of time once all necessary Generators are repaired. When the Killer is near, the Survivors will hear a heartbeat, and eventually tense music, both of which increase in intensity with proximity to the Killer. They can also see a red light (called the "red stain") emanating from the Killer's head, which reveals the direction which they are facing.

===Objectives===
Interacting with most objects and actions in the game causes random Skill Checks to trigger. Right before a skill check triggers, the player will receive a noise notification, and a needle within a circle will then appear on-screen. The player must hit the action button, when the needle is within a certain randomly chosen section of the circle before the needle passes it. The player can hit either a Good Skill Check or A Great Skill Check. Hitting a Good Skill Check grants 50 Bloodpoints, and a Great Skill Checks grants 150 Bloodpoints and an instant 2 % bonus to progression on the generator. Failing a Skill Check has multiple consequences based on the action being taken.

Repairing each Generator takes a lengthy period of time and makes a rather small mechanical noise during the process. Failing a repair Skill Check will cause an explosion that will set the progress of the Generator repair back and make a loud noise alerting the Killer to the Survivor's location. Killers have the ability to damage Generators, which will regress them over time.

Sabotaging a Hook takes a significantly shorter amount of time than repairing a Generator but is considerably louder. To sabotage a Hook, Survivors must be equipped with a 'Toolbox’ or have the Saboteur Perk active. Skill Checks are more common during this action than when repairing a Generator. Failing a Sabotage Skill Check makes a loud banging sound, momentarily halting progress and alerting the Killer. Sabotaged Hooks will respawn after three minutes have elapsed. Special Event Hooks and the Basement Hooks cannot be sabotaged.

Healing yourself or your allied Survivors can take drastically different lengths of time depending on multiple factors such as if they have a Med-Kit, certain Perks active, Killer de-buffs and whether the Survivor is healing themselves or an ally. Skill Checks are as common as when repairing but have a slightly less severe consequence when failed. Failing a Healing Skill Check still reduces the progress of the action but the wail made by the Survivor being healed is quieter than the other explosions and bangs, but still alerts the Killer of the location within a certain range.

If a Survivor is caught by the Killer, they are picked up and usually carried to the nearest Hook. During this time they can attempt to wiggle out of the Killer's grasp before they reach the Hook, and attempt to run away. If the Killer succeeds in impaling a Survivor on one of the many Hooks in the area, a teammate can rescue the impaled Survivor or, more rarely, the impaled Survivor (with a 4 % chance) can rescue themselves from the Hook (although attempting this is likely to backfire and injure the Survivor further, drawing them closer to death).

Once all Generators are repaired, a Survivor must find a switch next to one of two Exit Gates and hold it for 20 seconds in order to open the door. The game only ends when all Survivors have either escaped or have been killed – thus, while some Survivors may escape and finish early, those still inside must keep playing. Players who have escaped or died have the ability to observe the remaining players through the game's conclusion, or return to the menu and join a new game.

If only one Survivor remains then repairing Generators can become nearly impossible. An alternative escape method would be to use the 'Hatch', which spawns in a random area after the number of Generators repaired equals one more than there are Survivors left alive in the game (i.e. three Generators repaired with only two Survivors still living). The Hatch spawns closed but when only one Survivor remains then it will open automatically. While closed it can be opened if one Survivor has a 'Dull Key' or a 'Skeleton Key' and will remain open for 30 seconds, allowing any remaining Survivors to hop in and escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com/en/game/informations/gameplay|title=Dead by Daylight - Manual|website=deadbydaylight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bloodweb===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Bloodweb mechanic in the game "Dead by Daylight".jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Bloodweb mechanic that is used to acquire items, add-ons, offerings and perks as well as leveling up characters. ]] --&gt;
Both Survivor and Killers are able to unlock Items, Perks, Add-ons and Offerings through the Bloodweb. Every action performed in a trial awards the player a number of Bloodpoints, and the sum are added to the player's total at the end of the trial. Each level of the Bloodweb is procedurally generated, and gets larger as the Character gains levels. The rewards are connected to each other in a [[radial tree]], and players must purchase rewards along the progression path to gain access to others. Once every reward on the tree has been purchased, the Bloodweb will generate a new level for the player to progress to, increasing that Character's level. Once the Character reaches Level 50, they will be given the option to prestige. While given the option, they will still be able to buy things from the Bloodweb, but will not further increase their Level. Once prestiged, Characters will reset their progression and receive one of their default customisation options in a blood-splattered variation. One can prestige their Character up to three times.

The Bloodweb may contain Items and their Add-ons, Offerings that can be spent at the start of the round to influence the trial's conditions, and Perks that make the Character more powerful. Offerings and Add-ons may only be used in one trial, whereas Items can be re-used until the player dies, uses up all the charges of an Item or gives it to another player. Items can also be acquired from Chests on the map, but this does not affect the Character's Bloodweb.

==Setting==
===Realms===
The game takes place across eleven Realms which are based on the places the Killers became murderers: The MacMillan Estate (Trapper), Autohaven Wreckers (Wraith), Coldwind Farm (Hillbilly), Crotus Prenn Asylum (Nurse, Clown)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.deadbydaylight.com/chapter1/|title=The Last Breath: Dead by Daylight|work=Dead by Daylight|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Halloween (franchise)|Haddonfield]] (Shape),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com/halloween/|title=The Halloween Chapter - Dead by Daylight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backwater Swamp (Hag),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com/chapter3/|title=Of Flesh and Mud - Dead by Daylight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Léry's Memorial Institute (Doctor)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.deadbydaylight.com/chapter4/|title=Spark of Madness|work=Dead by Daylight|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Red Forest (Huntress)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.deadbydaylight.com/chapter5/|title=A Lullaby for the Dark - Dead by Daylight|work=Dead by Daylight|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Springwood/Badham Preschool (Nightmare)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.deadbydaylight.com/chapter7/|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street - Dead by Daylight|work=Dead by Daylight|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Gideon Meat Plant (Pig)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.deadbydaylight.com/chapter8/|title=The SAW® Chapter - Dead by Daylight|work=Dead by Daylight|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Yamaoka Estate (Spirit), and the Ormond Slopes Resort (Legion). Over time, the evilness of their actions accumulated there until it attracted the attention of the Entity, an unknown force of darkness from a place with no name. Most Realms are split into multiple Maps with similar features but small variations.

===Buildings===
Every Realm and Map features a map-specific building or landmark that remains in the same place in the map every game. Every map also features a building known as 'The Shack' which is the same throughout all maps and appears a different one of a few predetermined locations in the map, with the exception of the two indoor maps, Léry's Memorial Institute and Gideon Meat Plant. Every new game, a room known as the 'Basement' is placed under either the map-specific building or the shack.

The Basement is a special room consisting of one item chest for the Survivors to scavenge in, and four cabinets for them to hide in. It's also home to a special four-pointed hook that cannot be destroyed or tampered with in any way by Survivors. The basement only has one way in and one way out, making it a very secure place for Killers to bring their victims without fear of other Survivors saving them. Because of this danger, Survivors are awarded a small number of points for even venturing into the basement.

==Plot==
The Entity, a supernatural being hailing from the ancient blood web, is awakened from its slumber whenever it is summoned by actions of great violence and malice. The Killers, exclusively serial murderers, are pulled out of reality by it and convinced to do its bidding. In order to maintain its existence, the Entity requires sacrifices, and demands that they hunt and kill the Survivors so it can feed off their hope and steal a piece of their soul upon death. Then they are brought back to life to repeat the trial, endlessly attempting to escape.

The Survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander too close to the places the Killers were taken from, disappearing from the real world without a trace. They end up at a lonely campfire, where they rest between trials, until a Killer pursues them again. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas from where the Killers were taken. The Survivors' only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape. If the Killer has killed all but one Survivor, the Entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch. Escaping from the grounds always takes the Survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the Entity's favour. Since the Entity feeds off the hope of the Survivors to escape, it helps them just as much as the Killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt, stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks.

==Downloadable Content==
Behaviour Interactive has as of December 2018 released 11 individual DLC's in total. Each DLC has included both a new Survivor and Killer except for two that separately introduced one killer and one new survivor respectively (Left Behind and LeatherFace DLC). The DLC's release with an average of three months interval between each one. Prior to the release of every DLC, a so-called Public Test Build (PTB) is discharged, which allows the developers of the game to test and receive community feedback on the major upcoming changes. Once the PTB has been out for roughly two weeks, it is removed for further maintenance, e.g. bug fixing, adding missing features etc. before the DLC gets released. The estimated time span between the opening of the Public Test Build and a new DLC's release is approximately 2-3 weeks.

5 out of the 11 currently released DLC's have featured licensed Killers and Survivors from both popular horror franchises and other video games. The DLC's can be acquired in two ways; by either purchasing them normally through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] or buying them through an item-shop within the game using an in-game currency called Iridescent Shards. This alternative way of obtaining the DLC's was introduced in the 2.0 update (Curtain Call DLC). Each DLC has its own trailer and a so-called "spotlight" that exhibits the Killer and Survivor as well as a new in-game map that gets released along with the new characters.

==Cosmetics==
Along with the Curtain Call DLC that was released on June 12, 2018, the developers also released a cosmetics store which allows you to use Iridescent Shards or Auric Cells. In the store, players can use the Iridescent Shards or Auric Cells to buy cosmetics for their Survivors or Killers. They would be able to buy a set chosen by the developers for a discount instead of individually buying it. Licensed Survivors and Killers (Shape, Cannibal, Pig, David Tapp and Laurie Strode etc.) will not have any cosmetics released for them.
Although this procedure may seem like a way to make their Survivors or Killers more presentable, Auric Cells can only be bought with real money. If the player wants to use Iridescent Shards, it would take a longer time.

'''DisneyQuest''' was a [[Retail chain|chain]] of indoor interactive [[theme park|theme parks]] in the United States operated by the [[Disney Regional Entertainment]] subsidiary of [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]. 

The DisneyQuest project was designed as a way for the Disney brand to reach populations that may not have the chance to travel to its various theme park destinations.&lt;ref name="Cancelled"&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= May 19, 2017|title= Cancelled - Disney Quest|medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuNRWOeWz_s|access-date= December 16, 2017|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= YouTube video|time= |location= |publisher= Bright Sun Films|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was meant to target large cities and urban areas. Had the project continued, Disney had plans to construct locations in many major cities in the [[United States]], like [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]]. However, only two locations were built; one in [[Walt Disney World]] and a much shorter-lived one in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=baltsun1998&gt;{{cite news |last=Gunts |first=Edward |title=Disney to build Philadelphia theme park 'DisneyQuest' to be centerpiece of Market St. Development |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-12-10/business/1998344128_1_walt-disney-disney-regional-disneyquest |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=December 10, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DisneyQuest first opened on June 19, 1998, as part of a major expansion of the Downtown Disney entertainment district (today [[Disney Springs]]) at Downtown Disney West Side, and was intended as the first of a larger chain of similar facilities.&lt;ref name="Pecho Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pecho|first1=Bruce|title=Virtual Reality Rules At Disney's Newest Theme Park|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-05-31/travel/9805310289_1_virtual-jungle-cruise-disneyquest-virtual-reality|accessdate=April 18, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=May 31, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427202108/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-05-31/travel/9805310289_1_virtual-jungle-cruise-disneyquest-virtual-reality|archivedate=April 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first DisneyQuest outside of a resort was opened in Chicago on June 16, 1999 with plans for more locations worldwide.&lt;ref name="Chicago opening"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bigness|first=Jon|title=Disney's Daring Concept|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-16/business/9906160311_1_virtual-jungle-cruise-disney-regional-entertainment-disney-theme-park-experience |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 16, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago location was in a development, North Bridge, where [[ESPN Zone]], a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened about a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney's double plans: Disney Regional Entertainment said...|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-04/news/9903050455_1_indoor-interactive-theme-park-disney-regional-entertainment-espn-zone|accessdate=October 23, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 4, 1999|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On December 9, 1998, Disney Regional announced Philadelphia as new location as a tenant of the Pavilion at Market East project developed by Goldenberg Group on the former location of a [[Gimbels]] Department Store.&lt;ref name=baltsun1998/&gt; 

The Chicago location permanently closed on September 4, 2001 due to low attendance as well as other, broader issues. However, the location was generating income just not enough for Disney.&lt;ref name="Chicago closing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-16/features/0107160127_1_disneyquest-family-entertainment-entertainment-companies|title=What went wrong at DisneyQuest?|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427185933/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-16/features/0107160127_1_disneyquest-family-entertainment-entertainment-companies|first= Robert |last=Elder|archivedate=April 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of DisneyQuest Chicago, the DisneyQuest project was officially brought to an end. Construction that had begun in Philadelphia was scrapped, leaving a giant hole in its place for several years; the hole has since been filled and the space later became a parking lot.&lt;ref name=Defunctland&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Perjurer, Kevin |date=2018-09-04 |title=Defunctland: The Failure of Disney's Arcade Chain, DisneyQuest |trans-title= |medium= |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZQGtnEL2xs |access-date=2018-11-23 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format=YouTube video |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A DisneyQuest at [[Disneyland Resort]] in California never proceeded past the planning stage. Disney announced another location to be built in downtown [[Toronto]] but the project was canceled. After the closure of the Chicago location, [[Disney Regional Entertainment]] turned over control of the remaining location to Walt Disney World operations.&lt;ref name="Cancelled" /&gt;

On June 30, 2015, Disney officials announced that the Walt Disney World location would close in 2016 as part of the continued redevelopment of Downtown Disney into Disney Springs.&lt;ref name="DQ-Close"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disneyquest-closing-20150630-story.html |title=DisneyQuest closing at Downtown Disney |author=Sandra Pedicini |work=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=Tribune Newspapers |date=June 30, 2015 |accessdate=June 30, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701110331/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disneyquest-closing-20150630-story.html |archivedate=July 1, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the labor unions that represent Disney employees who work at DisneyQuest stated that displaced workers will be relocated to other positions.

They further stated that they had no update on the status of the NBA attraction other than it was still planned for the site.&lt;ref name="DQ-2017"/&gt; On January 30, 2017, the Disney Parks announced that DisneyQuest would close after July 2, 2017 so work on the NBA Experience attraction could begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tavss|first1=Jeff|title=Walt Disney World's DisneyQuest to close in July|url=http://www.local10.com/theme-parks/walt-disney-worlds-disneyquest-to-close-in-july|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=WPLG|date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DisneyQuest's final day of operation was on July 2, 2017.&lt;ref name="July 2 closure"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skambis|first1=Chip|title=DisneyQuest to close Sunday|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/local/disneyquest-to-close-sunday/547091610|website=[[WFTV]]|publisher=Cox Media Group|accessdate=July 2, 2017|date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the redemption and the video arcade games were removed from the facility in January 2015 and July 2017 as a cautionary measure, in response to a state law that Disney believed made the games illegal under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=vt-disneynoredemption&gt;{{cite web |title=Disney Is Removing Redemption Games And Crane Machines From Its Florida FECs |url=http://www.vendingtimes.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?nm=Vending+Features&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;tier=4&amp;id=890D02F308C24348A8A8C2F81C635501 |website=Vending Times |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy''''' is a 2013 [[Adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|point-and-click adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Koalabs Studio]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[OS X]]. It was published on all systems by [[Anuman]] under their [[Microïds]] brand. In 2014, the game was released on [[GOG.com]] and [[Steam (software)|Steam]], bundled with its prequel, ''[[Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gog.com/news/release_dracula_4_5 | title=Release: Dracula 4 + 5 | publisher=[[GOG.com]] | date=April 24, 2014 | accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dracula.microids.com/data/cp/463/pr-sortie-steam-dracula-4-5-en.pdf | title=Microïds launches "Dracula 4 &amp; 5 - Special Steam Edition" on PC and Mac | publisher=[[Microïds]] | date=June 3, 2014 | format=PDF | accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game follows 2000's ''[[Dracula: Resurrection]]'' and ''[[Dracula 2: The Last Sanctuary|Dracula: The Last Sanctuary]]'', 2008's ''[[Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon]]'' and 2013's ''Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon''. The plot is unrelated to ''Resurrection'' and ''Last Sanctuary'', but is instead the second of a two-part loose sequel to ''Path of the Dragon'', continuing the story of [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] [[Art restoration|art restorer]] Ellen Cross and her investigation into a mysterious [[portrait]] of [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]. Ellen's journey leads her from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Istanbul]] to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]], bringing her into contact with an ancient [[secret society]] founded by [[Vlad Tepes]]' brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], and placing her in the middle of a 500-year-old conflict between the society and Dracula's followers.

''The Blood Legacy'' received very little attention in the mainstream gaming press, with limited coverage from professional critics, and what reviews it did receive were negative. As with ''Shadow of the Dragon'', the biggest criticism of the game was its length, but critics were also unimpressed with the plot, the [[Video game graphics|graphics]], and the identical [[gameplay]] to the previous game.

==Gameplay==

[[Gameplay]] in ''The Blood Legacy'' is identical to ''Shadow of the Dragon''. The game is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[Adventure game#Point-and-click_adventure_games|point-and-click adventure game]], with a minimalist [[Head-up display|HUD]]; a quick-access item holder, which allows the player to use an item without entering their inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dracula.microids.com/data/cp/411/pr-dracula-4-en.pdf | publisher=[[Microïds]] | title=Dracula 4: The Prince of Darkness expands his grip over iOS and Android devices | date=November 5, 2013 | format=PDF | accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main inventory is accessible by clicking on the hand icon beside the quick-access holder. As well as the inventory, the player has access to a list of objectives, records of all conversations, records of all documents seen and collected, a summary of relevant information acquired, and options for the player to quit their game, or load a previously saved game. The game employs an [[autosave]] feature, which is activated at certain predetermined spots, or whenever the player quits to the main menu.&lt;ref name="AdvGamers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/26094 | title=Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy (PC) Review | publisher=[[Adventure Gamers]] | date=March 10, 2014 | last=Franklin | first=Rob | accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game uses a basic point-and-click interface to move the player around and manipulate the game world, with player's perspective controlled by the [[Computer mouse|mouse]], although the game is also fully [[touchscreen]] operable on compatible [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref name="Diary 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3TNPgcIPdM | title=Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon Developers Diary #2: Mechanics of a Rebirth | publisher=[[Microïds]] | date=May 15, 2013 | accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each screen, the player is free to look around 360 degrees. As the player moves the [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a mouth (the player can speak to the character over whom the option appears), an eye (an area or object can be examined in more detail), a hand (the player can take the object), a cog (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction with the object), a left-right horizontal arrow (the object can be moved left and right), and an up-down vertical arrow (the object can be moved up and down).&lt;ref name="ACG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/837/ | title=Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy (PC) Review | publisher=[[Adventure Classic Gaming]] | date=December 27, 2013 | last=Graham | first=Mervyn | accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gameplay mechanic not seen in the previous ''Dracula'' games (until ''Shadow of the Dragon'') is a [[Health (gaming)|health system]]. The [[player character]] (Ellen Cross) suffers from a rare blood disorder which must be managed with medication. During the game, Cross' health continually decreases, and if it goes below a certain level, she becomes unable to move or perform tasks. The player has access to various types of medication throughout the game and can experiment with combinations to continually top off her health.&lt;ref name="Diary 2"/&gt;

The game can be played in either "Adventure Mode" or "Casual Mode". In Casual Mode, interactive zones are automatically shown on-screen. Also in Casual Mode, after a set period of time elapses, players are given the option to skip [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]].&lt;ref name="Boomers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gameboomers.com/reviews/Dd/Dracula5/Dracula5.htm | title=Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy Review | publisher=GameBoomers | date=December 28, 2013 | author=Jenny100 | accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also features a points system and a series of in-game [[Achievement (video gaming)|trophies]], both of which are inactive if the player is playing in casual mode.&lt;ref name="iOS &amp; Android"/&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon#Plot}}

The game begins with the final scene from ''Shadow of the Dragon''; Ellen Cross, an [[Art restoration|art restorer]] from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], opening the uncatalogued sixteenth painting from the Vambery collection, which she believes to be a [[portrait]] of [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]. Ellen is shocked, however, to instead see a portrait of Vambery's assistant, Adam Stoker, [[Bram Stoker]]'s great-grandson, which suddenly comes to life, as Adam grows fangs and lunges at Ellen. However, this is revealed to have been a [[nightmare]]. In reality, Ellen has returned to [[New York City|New York]] with the painting unopened. Back at the Met, Phillips tells her the Turkish police found no body at Yanek's, who probably cleaned out his apartment after discovering Ellen had broken in. As such, they still have no idea who Yanek is working for, and why he was in possession of several of the lost Vambery paintings. Meanwhile, Ellen opens the painting to find it has been [[tar]]red over with a black cross. Her colleague Gerry Berowski tells her people used to paint crosses in black tar on their doors to ward off [[vampire]]s. As Vambery seemed to have been afraid of the painting, Gerry speculates Vambery himself may have painted the cross.

Ellen removes the tar, revealing the portrait of Dracula. She puts the painting in storage, and then reads an unpublished [[biography]] of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepes]], which portrays him in a more positive light than usual. The book says Vlad's brother, [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], was responsible for the suicide of Vlad's wife, telling her Vlad had been killed in battle and giving her a knife with which to kill herself. Vlad never recovered from her death, and turned to [[evil]] soon thereafter. The book explains Radu hated Vlad because when they were held prisoner by [[Murad II|Sultan Murad II]], Vlad had been released fourteen years prior to Radu. The book also reproduces a letter written by Radu in which he says "since you've refused to give me the gift you have thanks to me, my death is only the beginning of your torture. My blood will remain restless for as long as my vengeance goes unsatisfied, and throughout your lifetime, danger hangs over you."

Adam arrives to see Ellen, and back in her apartment, they sleep together. The next day, she finds a note from Adam promising to see her soon. She heads to the museum, but the painting has been stolen. Checking the surveillance footage, she sees Adam taking it. Meanwhile, a [[librarian]] friend of Gerry's leaves him a message telling him whilst she was researching Radu, she found a poem he had written called "The Shadow of the Dragon." Ellen reads the poem, which seems to offer instructions on how to find the headquarters of a [[secret society]] formed by Radu with the express purpose of gaining revenge against Vlad. Ellen realizes the poem is a guide to the headquarters of the society, and leads to the [[Basilica Cistern]] in [[Istanbul]]. She then gets a phonecall from a woman telling her Gerry is dead, and advising her to be careful, as powerful agents are working against her investigation. The woman also says her master knows the painting is missing, and would be very grateful if Ellen could bring it to him.

She heads to Turkey, and finds the headquarters. In display cases, she finds several items, including the diary of Fr. Arno Moriani (the protagonist of ''Path of the Dragon'') and notes on a series of [[eugenics]] experiments called "Operation D" (referred to in the final scene of ''Path of the Dragon''). The dagger used by Vlad's wife to kill herself, allegedly one of the few items capable of harming Dracula, is also supposed to be there, but is missing. Ellen learns the present day leader of the society is Adam, who is a direct descendent of Radu. She concludes Adam plans to kill Dracula using the dagger, and stole the painting as a way to draw Dracula out. With no other leads to follow, she returns to see Yanek.

He reveals he is a vampire, serving Dracula, who has forbidden his followers to harm Ellen. Yanek explains he is really Kaneyek, the painter of the portrait, which is more than just a painting. In fact, it allows Dracula to see through it, which was why Vambrey was so afraid of it, and why he covered it with tar. He tells her Dracula became a vampire by drinking his dead wife's blood, but because all vampires originate from Dracula, no vampire can harm him. Only a vampire born independently of Dracula can destroy him, and the only way for the creation of such a vampire is if someone else were to drink his wife's blood, which he wears in a vial around his neck. He also tells her she is pregnant with Adam's child. Yanek and Ellen conclude this must be Adam's goal, and with Yanek's instructions, Ellen heads to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] to meet Dracula.

In an underground castle, he tells her Adam is imprisoned nearby, and asks her to retrieve his portrait. She goes to Adam, and tells him about the baby. He promises that if she saves him, he will give her the portrait, and they can escape together. She opens his cell, but faints. Adam carries her body to Dracula, and tries to stab him with the knife. However, Dracula avoids the attack, and knocks Adam out. Impressed with Ellen, he offers her his wife's blood to drink. The player is given the choice as to whether to accept it or not. If the player does so, Ellen becomes a vampire. If the player does not, Dracula kills her. However, unseen by Dracula, Adam is able to drink some of his wife's blood.

==Development==
''The Blood Legacy'' was first announced on August 23, 2013, at [[Gamescom]], when [[Anuman|Anuman Interactive]] revealed the game was under development by [[Koalabs Studio]] and would be published under Anuman's [[Microïds]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dracula.microids.com/data/cp/385/pr-corpo-dracula5-gc2013-en.pdf | title=Microïds, Anuman Interactive's adventure game label, unveils the first details about Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy on PC, Mac, iOS and Android | publisher=[[Anuman|Anuman Interactive]] | date=August 23, 2013 | format=PDF | accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the game's story, the character of Professor Vambery was partly inspired by [[Ármin Vámbéry]], a [[Turkology|Turkologist]], who stayed with [[Bram Stoker]] in London prior to the composition of ''[[Dracula]]'', and is said to have influenced many elements of the novel, including the depiction of [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] himself.&lt;ref name="Universe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dracula.microids.com/EN/game-dracula-5/universe-references | title=Dracula 5 Official Site: Universe and References | publisher=[[Microïds]] | accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Dracula's wife killing herself after being tricked into thinking he had died was taken primarily from [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1992 film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''.&lt;ref name="Universe"/&gt; The captivity of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepes]] and his brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]] by [[Murad II|Sultan Murad II]], with Radu remaining with the Sultan longer than Vlad, and their imprisonment driving a wedge between the brothers, is very loosely based on historical fact.&lt;ref name="Universe"/&gt; In reality, in 1442, [[Vlad II Dracul]] took his two eldest sons, Vlad and his half-brother [[Mircea II of Wallachia|Mircea]], to meet Murad, who had supported Dracul in securing the throne of [[Wallachia]]. However, Murad took them prisoner. Both brothers were released in 1448, by which time their younger brother, Radu had earned the nickname "Radu cel Frumos" ("Radu the Handsome") and become friends with Murad's son, [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmet]], earning Vlad's enmity, due to his hatred of the Turks. Radu eventually converted to [[Islam]] and entered [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] service, alienating Vlad even more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=In Search of Dracula: The History of Dracula and Vampires | last1=McNally | first1=Raymond | last2=Florescu | first2=Radu | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1994 | edition=Revised | orig-year=1992 | location=New York, NY | pages=21–30 | isbn=9780395657836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blood Legacy'' received little attention in the gaming press, garnering very limited coverage from professional critics. What reviews it did receive were negative, with the PC version holding an aggregate score of 45% on [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt;

[[Adventure Gamers]]' Rob Franklin scored the game 1.5 out of 5, calling it "simply the second half of a game that should have shipped as a complete ''Dracula 4''." Of the [[gameplay]], he wrote "[[Puzzle video game|Puzzles]] are painfully obvious from the outset, with little to no challenge as you proceed." He concluded "For anyone who enjoyed ''Dracula 4'', the final half of this two-part adventure is more of the same. ''The Blood Legacy'' won't give you any sense of closure in its own right, but it will at least resolve the unsatisfactory [[cliffhanger]] from the previous instalment. For everyone else, this is merely a second incomplete ''Dracula'' game that can only be taken seriously when paired with its predecessor."&lt;ref name="AdvGamers"/&gt;

[[Adventure Classic Gaming]]'s Mervyn Graham scored the game 3 out of 5, writing "''Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy'' plays neither as a standalone game nor as a true sequel to the series. Instead, it plays more like the second part of a full game that begins with the previous game." He was critical of several aspects, including the linearity of the gameplay, and the [[Video game graphics|graphics]], calling the character animations "abysmal," and criticising the lack of [[lip sync]]ing. He concluded "despite being better than ''Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon'', ''Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy'' still leaves much to be desired."&lt;ref name="ACG"/&gt;

GameBoomers' Jenny100 gave the game a C, making a similar point about the length of the game; "It's essentially Part 2 of ''Dracula 4'', takes about the same time to play, and has the same shortcomings. Both ''Dracula 4'' and ''Dracula 5'' together are still shorter than the games we used to get from [[Kheops Studio|Kheops]] and older companies that used to make first person games."&lt;ref name="Boomers"/&gt;

A '''film distributor''' is responsible for the marketing of a film. The distribution company is usually different from the [[production company]]. Distribution deals are an important part of financing a film.

The distributor may set the [[film release|release date]] of a film and the method by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing; for example, directly to the public either theatrically or for home viewing ([[DVD]], [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]], [[download]], [[television program]]s through [[broadcast syndication]] etc.). A distributor may do this directly, if the distributor owns the theaters or [[film distribution]] networks, or through theatrical exhibitors and other sub-distributors. A limited distributor may deal only with particular products, such as DVDs or Blu-ray, or may act in a particular country or market. The primary distributor will often receive credit in the film's [[Billing (filmmaking)|credits]], [[one sheet]] or other marketing material.

==Theatrical distribution==
If a distributor is working with a theatrical exhibitor, the distributor secures a written [[contract]] stipulating the amount of the [[revenue|gross]] ticket sales the exhibitor will be allowed to retain (usually a percentage of the gross). The distributor collects the amount due, [[audit]]s the exhibitor's ticket sales as necessary to ensure the gross reported by the exhibitor is accurate, secures the distributor's share of these proceeds, surrenders the exhibitor's portion to it, and transmits the remainder to the production company (or to any other [intermediary], such as a film release agent). 

The distributor must also ensure that enough film [[Print (filmmaking)|print]]s are struck to service all contracted exhibitors on the contract-based [[opening day]], ensure their physical delivery to the theater by the opening day, monitor exhibitors to make sure the film is in fact shown in the particular theatre with the minimum number of seats and show times, and ensure the prints' return to the distributor's office or other storage resource also on the contract-based return date.  In practical terms, this includes the physical production of [[release print]]s and their [[shipping]] around the world (a process that is being replaced by [[digital distribution]] in most developed markets) as well as the creation of [[poster]]s, newspaper and magazine [[advertisement]]s, [[television commercial]]s, trailers, and other types of ads.

The distributor is also responsible for ensuring a full line of advertising material is available for each film which it believes will help the exhibitor attract the largest possible audience, create such advertising if it is not provided by the production company, and arrange for the physical delivery of the advertising items selected by the exhibitor at intervals prior to the opening day. Film distributors spend between $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion a year in the United States alone on direct buys of advertising such as TV commercials, billboards, online banner ads, radio commercials and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingmovies.net Article on Kantar Media movie advertising estimates]&lt;/ref&gt; That distributor-spending figure doesn't include additional costs for publicity, film trailers and promotions, which aren’t classified as advertising but also market films to audiences.

Distributors typically enter into one of the two types of film booking contracts. The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the sliding scale deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run.&lt;ref&gt;Marich, Robert. ''Marketing To Moviegoers: Third Edition'' (2013), SIU Press, p.277-78&lt;/ref&gt; The sliding scale actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep—often called “the house nut”—after which the sliding scale kicks in for revenue generated above the house nut. However, this sliding scale method is falling out of use. Whatever the method, box office revenue is usually shared roughly 50/50 between film distributors and theaters.

==International distribution==
{{Anchor|Foreign Distribution}}
If the distributor is handling an imported or [[foreign film]], it may also be responsible for securing [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitling]] for the film, and securing [[censorship]] or other legal or organizational "approval" for the exhibition of the film in the country/territory in which it does business, prior to approaching the exhibitors for booking. Depending on which studio that is distributing the film, the studio will either have offices around the world, by themselves or partnered with another studio, to distribute films in other countries. If a studio decides to partner with a native distributor, upon release both names will appear. The foreign distributor may license the film for a certain amount of time, but the studio will retain the copyright of the film. 
&lt;ref&gt;Levison, Louise. (2007) "FILMMAKERS AND FINANCING".  Burlington, MA: Focal Press. p. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;
When a film is produced and distributed by an independent production company and independent distributor (meaning outside the studios), generally an international sales agent handles the licensing of international rights to the film. The international sales agent will find a local distributor in each individual international territory (meaning outside of the US for a US independent film) and license the exclusive rights to the film for a certain amount of time but in the same case as the studios described above, the production company will retain the copyright of the film.  This means that this distributor in a certain territory has the exclusive right to exploit the film in various media (theatrical, tv, home entertainment, etc) for a certain amount of time.

==Early distribution windows==
Although there are now numerous distribution techniques, in the past the studios and networks were slow to change and did not experiment with different distribution processes. Studios believed that new distribution methods would cause their old methods of revenue to be destroyed. With time, the development of new distribution did prove to be beneficial. The studios revenue was gained from myriad distribution windows. These windows created many opportunities in the industry and allowed networks to make a profit and eliminate failure.  These new distribution methods benefited audiences that were normally too small to reach and expanded the content of television. With the new age of technology, networks accepted the fact that it was a consumer demand industry and accepted the new models of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda. The Television Will Be Revolutionized&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-theatrical distribution==
This term, used mainly in the [[British film industry]], describes the distribution of feature films for screening to a gathered audience, but not in theatres at which individual tickets are sold to members of the public. The defining distinctions between a theatrical and a non-theatrical screening are that the latter has to be to a closed audience in some way, e.g. pupils of a school, members of a social club or passengers on an airline, and that there can be no individual admission charge. Most non-theatrical screening contracts also specify that the screening must not be advertised, except within the group that is eligible to attend (e.g. in a membership organisation's [[newsletter]] or an [[in-flight magazine]]).

Non-theatrical distribution includes the [[In flight movie#In-flight movies|airlines]] and [[Film society|film societies]]. Non-theatrical distribution is generally handled by companies that specialise in this market, of which Motion Picture Licensing Company (MPLC) and Filmbankmedia are the two largest:

[http://www.themplc.co.uk/ Motion Picture Licensing Company]
[http://www.filmbankmedia.com/ Filmbankmedia]

Representing the major Hollywood studios and independent producers. Home video media is sold with a licence that permits viewing in the home only. Until these technologies were widespread, most non-theatrical screenings were on [[16 mm film|16mm film]] [[release print|prints]] supplied by the distributor. Today, the most common [[business model]] is for a distributor to sell the exhibitor a licence that permits the legal projection of a copy of the film, which the exhibitor buys separately on a home video format. These licences can either be for individual, one-off screenings, or cover an unlimited number of screenings of titles represented by that distributor for a specified time period. The latter are often purchased by [[public house|pubs]] and [[students' union]]s, to enable them to show occasional feature films on a TV in their bars.

==Home video distribution==
Some distributors only handle home video distribution or some sub-set of home video distribution such as DVD or Blu-ray distribution. The remaining home video rights may be licensed by the producer to other distributors or the distributor may sub-license them to other distributors.

If a distributor is going to distribute a movie on a physical format such as DVD, they must arrange for the creation of the artwork for the case and the face of the DVD and arrange with a DVD replicator to create a glass master to press quantities of the DVD.

Some movie producers use a process called "DVD-on-demand."  In DVD-on-demand, a company will burn a DVD-R (a process called "duplication") when a copy of the DVD is ordered, and then ship it to the customer.

A distributor may also maintain contact with wholesalers who sell and ship DVDs to retail outlets as well as online stores, and arrange for them to carry the DVD. The distributor may also place ads in magazines and online and send copies of the DVD to reviewers.

==Distribution credits==
The primary distribution companies will usually receive some billing for the film. For example, [[Gone_with_the_Wind (film)|''Gone With the Wind'']] was shown on the [[one sheet]] as "A [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Release". A modern example, [[Jurassic Park (film)|''Jurassic Park'']], would be the credit "[[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] presents &amp;hellip;". The Universal [[production logo]] also opened the film's [[film trailer|trailer]]. In some cases, there is split distribution as in the case of [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'' (1997)]]: "[[20th Century Fox]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] present &amp;hellip;". Both companies helped to finance the film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11776">The '''film industry in Florida''' is one of the largest in the [[United States]]: in 2006, [[Florida]] ranked third in the U.S. for film production (after [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]) based on revenue generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funandsun.com/1tocf/film/floridafilms.html 2006 Florida Film Commission Data]&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent 2009-2010 data no longer show Florida among the top four states.&lt;ref name=fw&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://filmworks.filmla.com/2011/06/24/californias-top-five-competitors-for-film-tv-production-dollars/ |title=Film Works L.A.; Note that California, #1 is not included in the chart |access-date=2012-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415232947/http://filmworks.filmla.com/2011/06/24/californias-top-five-competitors-for-film-tv-production-dollars/ |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production activity has been generally concentrated in two regions, South and Central Florida ([[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]).  The South Florida region is famous for large projects like [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]'s ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' film series and Neal Moritz's ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]''. The Central Florida area has been featured in ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', starring [[John Travolta]], and Adam Sandler's ''[[The Waterboy]]''.

The state of Florida has a long film history thanks to its [[Climate of Florida|year-round sunshine and moderate climate]].  Film classics were filmed throughout the state, such as ''[[Moon Over Miami (film)|Moon Over Miami]]'' (1941) and [[Esther Williams]]' ''Easy to Love'' (1953).

==Orlando==
In the early 1990s Orlando experienced a great boom in film production. The construction of the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] and [[Universal Studios]] production facilities attracted many filmmakers to the area. Films like Ron Howard's ''Parenthood'' and [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated television shows]] like ''[[Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' led the pack. Soon, the Steven Spielberg series ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' and Tom Hank's ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' called Florida home. During this period Orlando acquired the nickname "Hollywood East" because of its surging film industry.

Just as film production appeared to be on the decline in Florida, the phenomenal success of 1998's ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' led to another boom. While this film was filmed in [[Maryland]], its director and entire crew were [[University of Central Florida]] [[film school]] graduates. This cult [[independent film]] has led to a new wave of film production for the area.

==Celebrity residents==
Florida is also the home of many famous actors.  Celebrity residents of Florida include [[Burt Reynolds]], [[James Best]], [[John Travolta]], [[Michael Winslow]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Carrot Top|Scott "Carrot Top" Thompson]], [[Will Smith]], [[Allan Meade]], and [[Sylvester Stallone]].  There are also quite a few successful film directors located in the state including [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[George A. Romero]].

[[File:Fum nero italiano.jpg|thumb|Some characters from the ''Fumetti neri'' genre]]
'''''Fumetti neri''''' (Italian for "black comics") is a subgenre of [[Italian comics]], born in Italy with the creation of the ''[[Diabolik]]'' character (1962).

==Overview==
The "Fumetti neri" name  comes from "cronaca nera", the Italian name for crime news. Among the inspirations of the genre there were the Gothic literature, the French ''[[feuilleton]]'' and the Italian horror cinema. In a local market characterized from comics devoted to a young audience, the immediate commercial success of ''Diabolik'' revealed a niche of adult readers interested in adult and sometimes exploitive themes characterized by violence and sex references.&lt;ref name=xejxie&gt;Simone Castaldi. ''Drawn and Dangerous: Italian Comics of the 1970s and 1980s''. University Press of Mississippi, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-60473-749-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heroes of ''fumetti neri'' were more [[anti-hero]] or [[villain]] than traditional heroes, and Diabolik himself was very loosely based on the French'' [[Fantômas]]'' character. The subsequent main characters in these comics were all inspired on Diabolik and often had a '''K''' in their names. They included ''[[Kriminal]]'' (a more violent version of Diabolik by [[Roberto Raviola|Magnus]] and [[Max Bunker]]),  ''[[Satanik (Italian comic book)|Satanik]]'' ( a female version of Diabolik by the same authors but with supernatural and horrific elements) and ''[[Sadik (comics)|Sadik]]''.&lt;ref name="xejxie"/&gt;

The large success of this genre led in 1965 to public campaigns against them, and even to trials and judicial seizures. As a result, from 1966 some comics remarkably reduced violence and erotic situations, and tried to open themselves to a younger and wider audience, while others, the so-called "vietati ai minori" ("restricted to the minors") exploited their status, increasing the levels of sex, and sometimes becoming openly pornographic.&lt;ref name="xejxie"/&gt;

In [[France]], these comics were published in [[digest size]] editions by the likes of [[Elvifrance]].

==Legacy&lt;!--'Fumetti d'autore' redirects here--&gt;==
It was in the scene set by the ''fumetti neri'' that '''''fumetti d'autore'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA)--&gt;/[[auteur comics]] - comics published in magazines such as ''[[linus (magazine)|linus]]''&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; (1965[[wikt:ff.|ff.]]),  ''[[Il Sergente Kirk]]'' (July 1967 – December 1969), ''[[Eureka (Italian magazine)|Eureka]]'' (November 1967 – November 1967), ''[[Il Mago (magazine)|Il Mago]]'' (April 1972 – December 1980) and ''[[Frigidaire (magazine)|Frigidaire]]'' (December 1980ff.) - found a favorable ground for development in Italy in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gino Moliterno (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture'', Routledge, 2002: "comics".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George N. Christy''' (born '''George Harrington''') (November 6, 1827 – May 12, 1868) was one of the leading [[blackface]] performers during the early years of the blackface [[minstrel show]] in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, 1993, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], his career began as a star performer with his stepfather [[E. P. Christy]]'s troupe [[Christy's Minstrels]]; in two and a half years with them he earned $19,680, a fortune for those times.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, 1993, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belcher.&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Comer credits him with inventing "the line", the structured grouping that constituted the first act of the standardized 3-act minstrel show, with the [[Interlocutor (music)|interlocutor]] in the middle and "Mr. Tambo" and "Mr. Bones" on the ends.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible that he has him confused with E.P. Christy.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[New York City]] from [[cerebral edema]] in 1868.

'''''Hey, Shipwreck''''' is the name of a series of [[Machinima]] [[Parody|spoofing]] the [[Submarine|Silent Service]], that is serving aboard a [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]].&lt;ref name='Navy Times 14 May 2007'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Futuristic 'Shipwreck' spoofs Navy|journal=[[Navy Times]]|date=2007-05-14 print issue date|first=Philip|last=Ewing|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|page=10|id= |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2007/05/navy_shipwreck_070507w/|format=|accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animations are rendered using the [[Blender (software)|Blender]] [[game engine]], and can be watched in-browser in [[YouTube]] format, or downloaded in a variety of other formats. The title comes from the common Navy phrase: "Hey, [[Shipmate]]!" referring to a fellow [[sailor]]. Substituting "[[wikt:Appendix:U.S. Navy slang#S|Shipwreck]]" makes it an insult. Similar to saying "Hey Dirtbag."

The cartoons are set in the future in a fictional [[space navy]], with the [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s looking vaguely like submarines. The heroes, Thresher and Seawolf, are seen on the spaceship [[watchstanding|standing watch]]. Because of the boredom of standing watch, they spend their time complaining about such staples of navy life as [[Naval rating#United States Navy|ratings]] mergers (that is combining two dissimilar job specialties into a single job [[community]]). The cartoons imagine the natural successor to the Navy's current [[smoking cessation]] program by implementing a "swearing cessation program", with sailors' speech regulated by a computer. The heroes amuse themselves by creating ways to defeat the [[profanity filter]]. The heroes also combat such routine tasks as training new [[sailors]] (this is a spoof on how [[Submarine Warfare insignia#Basic enlisted submarine qualifications|notoriously strict]] the training for new sailors is on submarines).

In an interview with Navy Times, the author of the cartoons, former [[Electronics Technician|ET1]] [[Patrick Hrabe]], admits the limited scope of his audience&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northkitsapherald.com/entertainment/39444559.html&lt;/ref&gt; by saying: "the average viewers will not understand what's being talked about at all...[S]ubmariners and Navy guys who watch it get this thing." Patrick Hrabe says former [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy]] [[Terry D. Scott]] wrote him and said he was "still laughing" after viewing the cartoons.

She was [[nickname]]d '''the Black Widow''' by her friends because, in spite of her sweet demeanor, she would "eat people alive" when she got to a pool table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/american-chopper/the-jeanette-lee-black-widow-bike/episode/1311661/summary.html Reference to her nickname]&lt;/ref&gt; Jeanette is an American of Korean descent.

She was three times runner-up at the World Nine-ball Championships ([[List of WPA World Nine-ball champions #Women's champions|women's]]), from 1993–96. In addition to many top finishes on the WPBA Tour, she won the [[gold medal]] for the United States at the 2001 [[World Games]] in [[Akita, Japan]], and won the ladies' {{US$}}25,000 winner-take-all Tournament of Champions twice, in 1999 and 2003. Lee also wrote ''The Black Widow's Guide to Killer Pool''.

'''Nouvelle Manga''' ({{lang-fr|La nouvelle manga}}) is an artistic movement which gathers Franco-Belgian and Japanese [[comic]] creators together. The expression was first used by Kiyoshi Kusumi, editor of the Japanese [[manga magazine]] ''Comickers'', in referring to the work of [[France|French]] expatriate [[Frédéric Boilet]], who lived in Japan for much of his career but has since returned to France in December 2008.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Boilet adopted the term for himself and encouraged other artists to participate.

==History==
The Nouvelle Manga movement was born of several observations. Whereas [[European cinema]] often bases its theme on everyday life, French/Belgian ''[[bande dessinée]]'' has, for a long time, been restricted to stereotyped genres such as science fiction or westerns. Japanese authors on the other hand exploit daily life extensively – but these are often the least likely to be widely translated.

For the participants of Nouvelle Manga there are bridges to build between the comics of all nationalities, not least between the comics ''d'auteur'' in each country.

People often restrict Nouvelle Manga to the world of alternative comics, yet there are many examples of Nouvelle Manga authors publishing in all kinds of arenas. For instance, Boilet himself has been published in mainstream [[Seinen]] magazines like ''Big Comics'' in Japan as well as in alternative editorial structures such as ''Spore'' in Japan, [[Ego Comme X]] in France and, more recently, [[Fanfare (publisher)|Fanfare]] / [[Ponent Mon]] in the US. 

Boilet prefers to refer to Nouvelle Manga as being in the French feminine form (''la'') as opposed to the French masculine form (''le'') which is used for the very mainstream action-oriented [[manga]] that is more usually published in [[France]].

Examples of artists who are associated in varying degrees with the outputs and debates surrounding Nouvelle Manga are:
[[Moyoco Anno|Moyoko Anno]], [[Aurélia Aurita]], [[David B.]], [[Matthieu Blanchin]], [[Frédéric Boilet]], [[Nicolas de Crécy]], [[Étienne Davodeau]], [[Yoji Fukuyama]], [[Emmanuel Guibert]],  [[Kazuichi Hanawa]], [[Daisuke Igarashi]], [[Little Fish (mangaka)|Little Fish]], [[Taiyō Matsumoto]], [[Fabrice Neaud]], [[Loïc Néhou]], [[Benoît Peeters]], [[Frédéric Poincelet]], [[David Prudhomme]], [[François Schuiten]], [[Joann Sfar]], [[Kiriko Nananan]], [[Hideji Oda]], [[Kan Takahama]], [[Jiro Taniguchi]], [[Yoshiharu Tsuge]], [[Vanyda]] and [[Naito Yamada]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.boilet.net/am/biographie.html], http://www.boilet.net/am/biographie.html &lt;/ref&gt;

A great exhibition and a cycle of debates were held in [[Tokyo]] in September and October 2001, notably at the Tokyo Museum of Fine Arts and at the French-Japanese Institute.

Nouvelle Manga has extended to other media with '''Nouvelle Manga Digitale''', a creation of the multimedia author [[Fred Boot]].

__NOTOC__
"'''Lifesigns'''" is the 35th episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the 19th episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 2)|second season]]. It has an average fan rating of 4.2/5 on the official Star Trek website as of September, 2009.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]'' during its journey home to Earth, having been stranded tens of thousands of [[light-year]]s away. The episode centers on a [[Vidiian]] woman whom [[Doctor (Star Trek)|the Doctor]] works to save.

This episode was previously known as "''Untitled Doctor''" and "''Magnetism''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=J.|title=Inventory|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/lilly/mss/index.php?p=taylorjinv|website=Lilly Library|publisher=Public Services Department, Lilly Library, Indiana University|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finally adopted title has a dual meaning: the lifesigns the doctor finds in the body of Danara, the Vidiian woman, and his own growing self-awareness as a sentient life form through the experience of romance.

==Plot==
Paris arrives late to the bridge as a distress call is picked up. ''Voyager'' beams aboard the dying body of a Vidiian woman. [[Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]] works to save her in Sickbay. He creates a holographic body of her to assist him; a hologram which looks and acts the way she would if she were healthy. Her name is Danara Pel and she is a physician, ready and able to help heal the disease-ravaged body on the bed. The Doctor soon realizes he is falling in love with Dr. Pel, but has trouble sorting out his feelings toward the vibrant hologram and the real, dying patient.

Torres' past mistreatment at the hands of the Vidiians causes her to be reluctant to help Dr. Pel—Klingon DNA has been shown to be resistant to the Phage, the disease afflicting the Vidiians— but she soon relents.

Sandrine's bar makes a reappearance, a long-standing holo-location that many members of the crew enjoy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83061">These are the lists of the '''music artists''' that have '''the highest [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] record sales in [[Finland]]''' (and/or '''sales explicitly confirmed''' by [[Musiikkituottajat &amp;ndash; IFPI Finland]] in their database). The lists consist of albums and singles (vinyl, CD, digital) and music DVDs, certified or confirmed by Musiikkituottajat.{{r|FINBestSellDomAlbums}}{{r|FINBestSellDomSingles}}{{r|FINBestSellForAlbums}}{{r|FINBestSellForSingles}}

Musiikkituottajat deals in sales of digital and physical albums and singles and music DVDs. Excepting some sales figures of uncertified records given by Musiikkituottajat from the 2000s, these best-seller lists are largely based on total accumulated ''certifications'' given per artist and therefore may not reflect the true physical and digital sales obtained by these artists,&amp;mdash;that is, the combined sales of uncertified records before the 2000s, those uncertified in and after the 2000s and certified sales of all time. Since the release of the October 3, 2007, [[The Official Finnish Charts|Singles Chart]], digital downloads of tracks have been included in the singles sales figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findance.com/pnikuutiset.php?id=2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

These lists exclude certifications of recordings by artists in collaboration with others as part of a single artist's total.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31746">This page is a '''list of the experimental [[television station]]s''' before 1946. After 1945 (in the [[United States]]) the television frequencies were opened up to commercialization and regular broadcasts began. Regular broadcast television start dates vary widely by country; in many regions, initial broadcast video deployment was delayed due to mobilisation for [[World War II]].

(Note: The listing of current broadcast channels for these stations is not up-to-date as many [[Band I|low-VHF]] stations have moved to [[UHF]] frequencies as a result of [[digital television transition]]. This is less of an issue in the [[United Kingdom]] because of its all-UHF system, but most early US broadcasters were on affected channels before analogue shutdown. Very few full-service North American broadcasters remain on physical channels VHF 2-6 digitally due to [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]] problems and strict limits on maximum transmitted power at these frequencies.)

'''Manhattan Beach''' was a former amusement park in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], USA, (1881-1914). It was built near Denver on the shore of [[Sloan's Lake]] in [[Edgewater, Colorado]], and was the first [[amusement park]] created west of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Sloan's Lake"&gt;[http://www.brekus.org/wheelmen/sloanscentury.htm A Brief History of Sloan's Lake] - Sloan's Century&lt;/ref&gt; Open to the public for the first time on 27 June 1881,&lt;ref name="Pam Grout 2006"&gt;Pam Grout, ''Colorado Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff'' (Globe Pequot 2006) {{ISBN|0-7627-3978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had a [[roller coaster]], a [[dance hall]], a [[Ferris wheel]], [[boating]] attractions, [[hot air balloon]] rides, [[wrestling]] [[bear]]s, [[contortionist]]s, [[aerialist|aerial acts]] (including a [[human cannonball]]), a man who walked on [[ceiling]]s, and exhibits displaying more than 40 species of animals, but its primary draw was [[Roger the Elephant]] (real name: Rajah), who was a popular children's ride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffco.k12.co.us/elem/edgewater/history.htm Edgewater history]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - Jefferson County Public Schools - Jefferson County, Colorado&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors reached the park by [[streetcar]], [[boat]]s, and [[wagon]]s.

A large theater at the park was opened on June 27, 1891. It featured everything from [[comic opera|light opera]] to [[vaudeville]].

While Manhattan Beach was a popular destination, competition (from nearby [[Elitch Gardens]] and [[White City (Denver)|White City]], the latter eventually becoming [[Lakeside Amusement Park]]) and mishaps marked its existence. Roger the Elephant was spooked by the sound of a hot-air balloon, bucked passengers and stepped on the head of a six-year-old boy; George W. Eaton (son of Pressley Jr. and Harriett Eaton, brother of Clayton Arnold "Jack"  Eaton).&lt;ref name="Pam Grout 2006"/&gt; In 1908, Manhattan Beach was destroyed by [[fire]]; later that year, it was rebuilt and reopened as '''Luna Park'''. It closed for the final time in 1914.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Sloan's Lake"/&gt;

[[File:Maruni with madale.jpg|300px|thumb|Maruni dancing with madale]]
'''Maruni''' is a  Nepali Dance of Western and Eastern [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Darjeeling]]. It is the most famous and oldest dance of Nepalese community residing in this region. Earlier, this festival was related to the  [[Tihar (festival)|festival of Tihar]], which is the same as [[Diwali]] in North [[India]]. This festival also celebrates the return of Lord Rama to [[Ayodhya]] after 14 years of exile. With time, Maruni was performed even during many personal events, especially marriages. Maruni is performed by both men and women who dress themselves in colorful clothes, shining ornaments and nose rings. The dancers are usually accompanied by a clown who is called 'Dhatu Waray' which means liar but acts as comedian/joker. In of the many forms of Maruni, nine unique instruments are used with the dance and this is called the 'Naumati Baja'.

It is basically performed at western and mid western hills of Nepal. According to the place the styles of this dance varies. It is purely a part of Nepalese culture. Dance has different category and styles depending on songs. The song lyrics have purely based on their life and culture.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 197547 Students from Townsville Grammar School performing A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1907.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Robin Starveling as Moonshine (second from right), with thorn-bush and dog, in a 1907 student production]]
A '''mechanical''' is any of six characters in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' who perform the [[story within a story|play-within-a-play]] ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]''. Named for their occupations as [[mechanic|skilled manual laborers]], they are a group of [[amateur]] and mostly incompetent [[actor]]s from around [[Athens]], looking to make names for themselves by having their production chosen among several acts as the courtly entertainment for the royal wedding party of [[Theseus]] and [[Hippolyta]]. 

The biggest ham among them, [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]], becomes the unlikely object of interest for the fairy queen [[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]] after she is charmed by a love potion and he is turned into a monster with the head, eyes and ears of an [[donkey|ass]] by the servant-spirit [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]].

==Peter Quince==
{{main|Peter Quince}}
Peter Quince's name is derived from "quines" or "[[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]]", which are wooden wedges used by carpenters.

===Playwriting===
Quince's amateurish playwriting is usually taken to be a parody of the popular [[mystery play]]s of the pre-[[Elizabethan era]], plays that were also produced by craftspeople.{{sfn|Montrose|1996|p=185}} His [[Metrical rhythm|metrical]] preferences are references to vernacular ballads. 

Despite Quince's obvious shortcomings as a writer, [[Stanley Wells]] argues that he partly resembles Shakespeare himself. Both are from a craftsmanly background, both work quickly and both take secondary roles in their own plays.{{sfn|Wells|1990|pp=60–63}} Robert Leach makes the same point.{{sfn|Leach|2008|p=119}}

In performing the play, Quince recites the prologue but struggles to fit his lines into the meter and make the rhymes. The noble audience makes jocular comments, whilst the rest of the mechanicals struggle (all except Bottom, who rather confidently improvises).

===Characterization===
Traditionally, Peter Quince is portrayed as a bookish character, caught up in the minute details of his play, but as a theatrical organizer.{{cn|date=October 2015}} However, in the [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999 film)|1999 film version]] of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', he is portrayed by [[Roger Rees]] as a strong character extremely capable of being a director. It is he who leads the search party looking for [[Nick Bottom]] in the middle of the play. 

Many interpret Quince to be an author surrogate, representing William Shakespeare, albeit a comical version of himself.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Cultural references===
The character is named in the title of a [[Wallace Stevens]] poem, "[[Peter Quince at the Clavier]]", which is written in the first person as if spoken by Quince.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The character also inspired the name of Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the 1999 film ''[[Galaxy Quest]]''.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Snug as Lion - Louis Rhead (before 1918).jpg|thumb|Snug playing the Lion in the [[play-within-the-play]] ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', within [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Illustration by [[Louis Rhead]] for an edition of [[Charles Lamb|Charles]] and [[Mary Lamb]]'s ''[[Tales from Shakespeare]]'' (1918).]]
Snug is a minor character in the play. He is a [[joiner]] from [[Athens]] who is hired by [[Peter Quince]] to play the part of the lion in [[Pyramus and Thisbe]]. When he is first assigned the part, he is afraid it may take him a while to finally remember his lines (even though the lion's role was nothing but roaring originally). [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] offers to play the part of the lion (as he offers to play all other parts), but he is rejected by Quince, who worries (as do the other characters) that his loud and ferocious roar in the play will frighten the ladies of power in the audience and get Quince and all his actors hanged. In the end, the lion's part is revised to explain that he is in fact not a lion and means the audience no harm.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=47–48}}

Snug is often played as a stupid man, a manner describing almost all of the Mechanicals.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=47}}

Snug is the only Mechanical to whom the playwright did not assign a first name.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=156}}

In [[Jean-Louis Supervielle|Jean-Louis]] and [[Jules Supervielle|Jules Supervielle's]] french adaptation, ''[[Le Songe d'une nuit d'été (1959 play)|Le Songe d'une nuit d'été]]'' (1959), Snug is renamed to {{lang|fr|Gatebois}}, where [[Georges Neveux|Georges Neveux's]] [[Le Songe d'une nuit d'été (1945 play)|1945 adaptation]] used the English names.{{sfn|White|1960|p=344}}

On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Snug and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with [[Titania|Titania's]] four fairy escorts: Moth, Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.{{sfn|Weiner|1971|p=339}}

==Nick Bottom==
{{main|Nick Bottom}}
[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli - Titania liebkost den eselköpfigen Bottom.jpg|thumb|right|''Titania adoring the Ass-headed Bottom''. Oil on canvas by [[Henry Fuseli]], c. 1790]]
Nick Bottom provides [[comic relief]] throughout the play. A weaver by trade, he is famously known for getting his head transformed into that of a donkey by the elusive [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]]. Bottom and Puck are the only two characters who converse with and progress the three central stories in the whole play. Puck is first introduced in the fairies' story and creates the drama of the lovers' story by messing up who loves whom, and places the donkey head on Bottom's in his story. Similarly, Bottom is performing in a play in his story intending it to be presented in the lovers' story, as well as interacting with [[Titania]] in the fairies' story.

==Francis Flute==
{{main|Francis Flute}}
Francis Flute's occupation is a [[bellows]]-mender. He is forced to play the female role of Thisbe in "[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]", a [[play-within-the-play]] which is performed for [[Theseus]]' marriage celebration.{{sfn|Brooks|1979}}

In the play Flute (Thisbe) speaks through the wall (played by [[Tom Snout]]) to Pyramus ([[Nick Bottom]]).{{sfn|Brooks|1979}}

Flute is a young, excited actor who is disappointed when he finds he is meant to play a woman (Thisbe) in their interlude before the duke and the duchess.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=46}}

Flute's name, like that of the other mechanicals, is [[metonym|metonymical]] and derives from his craft: "Flute" references a [[church organ]], an instrument prominently featuring the [[bellows]] a bellows-mender might be called upon to repair.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=43}}

In [[Jean-Louis Supervielle|Jean-Louis]] and [[Jules Supervielle|Jules Supervielle's]] french adaptation, ''[[Le Songe d'une nuit d'été (1959 play)|Le Songe d'une nuit d'été]]'' (1959), Flute is renamed to {{lang|fr|Tubulure}}, where [[Georges Neveux|Georges Neveux's]] [[Le Songe d'une nuit d'été (1945 play)|1945 adaptation]] used the English names.{{sfn|White|1960|p=344}}

On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Flute and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with [[Titania|Titania's]] four fairy escorts: Moth (also spelled Mote), Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.{{sfn|Weiner|1971|p=339}}

==Tom Snout==
{{main|Tom Snout}}
[[File:MIDSUMMER-MECHANICALS-SMALL.jpg|thumb|Nick Bottom (left), Francis Flute (right), and Tom Snout (background) playing Pyramus, Thisbe, and Wall in a 1978 [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] production]]
Tom Snout is a [[Tinker (profession)|tinker]], and one of the Mechanicals of Athens.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=43}}

In the [[play-within-a-play]], Tom Snout plays the wall which separates Pyramus' and Thisbe's gardens. In ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the two lovers whisper to each other through Snout's fingers (representing a chink in the wall). Snout has eight lines under the name of Tom Snout, and two lines as ''The Wall''. He is the Wall for Act V-Scene 1.

Tom Snout was originally set to play Pyramus's father, but the need for a wall was greater, so he discharged ''The Wall''. Snout is often portrayed as a reluctant actor and very frightened, but the other mechanicals (except [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] and [[Peter Quince|Quince]]) are usually much more frightened than Tom Snout.

Snout's name, like that of the other mechanicals, is [[metonym|metonymical]] and derives from his craft: "Snout" means a nozzle or a spout, a feature of the kettles a tinker often mends.{{sfn|Blits|2003|p=43}}

==Robin Starveling==
{{main|Robin Starveling}}
Robin Starveling plays the part of Moonshine in their performance of ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]''.  His part is often considered one of the more humorous in the play, as he uses a lantern in a failed attempt to portray Moonshine and is wittily derided by his audience.

The''' NCAA Cheerleading Competition''' previously known as '''NCAA Cheerdance Competition''' is an annual one-day event of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] for [[cheerleading]]. However, it does not count in the tabulation to determine the [[NCAA General Championship|NCAA Overall Champion]].

It was sponsored by [[Nestlé]] in 2004 and 2005 and was known as the NCAA Nestlé Non-Stop Cheerdance Competition. In 2007, the competition was sponsored by [[Samsung]] and was called as Samsung NCAA Cheerdance Competition. The event was also sanctioned by [[Cheerleading Philippines Federation]] (CP) and thus adopted the official scoring criteria used in international cheerleading. The name of the competition was changed in 2008. The criteria for the 2009 Samsung NCAA Cheerleading Competition was patterned with the [[National Cheerleading Championship]] or NCC. The judges also came from the said competition. This gives NCAA a special privilege where NCC granted slots for the 2010 NCC Finals for the top three winners. In the 87th season of the NCAA, cheerleading has been upgraded to a regular sport which means it will contribute points in the overall championship race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/sportshub/ncaaseason87/ncaaarticle.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=69&amp;articleid=681140 Lions-Altas kicks off 'NC' Season 87] November 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The company represents a merger in 2004 of several midway companies, including part of [[Conklin Shows]], the former [[Farrow Shows]] from [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and [[Thebault-Blomsness]] ([[Astro Amusements]] and [[All Star Amusements]]). Later acquisitions were [[Mid America Shows]] and part of [[Cumberland Valley Shows]].

North American Midway Entertainment was acquired by [[Townsquare Media]] of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] in August 2015. Current management and operations of the company will remain the same.&lt;ref name="TOWNSQUARE"&gt;[http://www.namidway.com/name-acquired-by-townsquare-media-llc/ North American Midway Entertainment, ''NAME Acquired By Townsquare Media, LLC''], Retrieved Oct. 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Gormley''' (c. 1920 &amp;ndash; 8 May 1998) was an Australian born [[artist manager]] who guided the early careers of many recording artists, including [[Frank Ifield]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[The Shadows]], [[Marvin Welch &amp; Farrar]], [[Labi Siffre]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]].

During the early 1970s the British Music press (NME ''et al.'') sarcastically coined the phrase "The Gum Leaf Mafia" to describe Australian clients of Peter Gormley who arrived en masse in London in the late 1960s e.g. [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[The Seekers]], [[The New Seekers]], [[Kevin Peek]], [[Terry Britten]], [[Alan Tarney]], [[Trevor Spencer]], [[John Farrar]], [[Barrie Guard]], etc.

In Australia Gormley founded the Festival record label on which [[Olivia Newton-John]] released all her original studio albums in that country from 1971 onwards until her last album produced by [[John Farrar]] called [[Warm and Tender (Olivia Newton-John album)|Warm and Tender]] in 1989. 

In 1980 [[Brian Goode]] of Outrider Management took over management for [[The Shadows]] and [[Labbi Siffre]]. [[Cliff Richard]] set up his own management company [[The Cliff Richard Organisation]]. [[Lee Kramer]] took over management for [[Olivia Newton-John]] in 1975 in the USA.

Gormley died on 8 May 1998, having been in retirement for some five years when he died of [[colon cancer]], two years after the death of his wife, Audrey. He was survived by a daughter, Robyn, and by nieces [[Miriam Gormley|Miriam]] and [[Clare Gormley]], both of whom are opera singers.

Billboard, an American music industry newspaper, printed a tribute to Gormley in its edition dated May 30, 1998.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4248">'''Plasticville''' is a brand of [[plastic]] [[toy train]] building sold in the [[United States]], made by formerly [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]-based [[Bachmann Industries]] since 1947 (although they were first advertised in 1946). In 1984, '''Plasticville''' as well as the entire line was taken over by [[Kader]] Industries of [[Dongguan]], [[China]] and made entirely in [[China]].

Plasticville buildings are a simple design, made of walls that snap together, permitting them to be assembled without glue and easily disassembled again for storage. Out of the box, Plasticville buildings are usually two-tone, with building walls of one color and the doors, windows and roof molded out of a different colored plastic. With few exceptions, Plasticville buildings are styled after 1950s suburban buildings, and the product line has not changed since the late 1950s.

Most Plasticville buildings are 1:64 scale with 1:48 scale doors, a design compromise that allows them to be used with [[O gauge]], O27 gauge, or [[S gauge]] train layouts without looking far off-scale. This allowed one product line to serve [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]]'s low-end and high-end product lines as well as [[American Flyer]]'s product line in the 1950s. Later, as [[HO scale]] gained popularity, Bachmann produced a line of 1:87 scale buildings for that standard.

== History ==
The first Plasticville product was a plastic fence, first marketed as a [[Christmas tree]] accessory. When Bachmann found out consumers were using its product on train layouts, it also added some other accessories such as trees, bushes, and bridges. By 1950, Bachmann had added houses and stores to the product line, and Plasticville quickly became the most popular brand of train buildings on the U.S. market. Bachmann added several buildings to the product line every year until 1958. Some of these buildings were of Bachmann design, but others came from competing product lines that Bachmann absorbed in the mid-1950s.

In the late 1950s, mass-market interest in trains declined, with other pastimes, such as [[slot car]]s, gaining at their expense. Bachmann responded in 1963 by introducing a line of accessories for slot car track.

Although not all pieces were manufactured every year, the Plasticville line has remained commercially available since the 1950s.

In 1984, Plasticville as well as the entire line OF [[Bachmann Industries]] was taken over by [[Kader]] Industries of [[Dongguan]], [[China]] and made entirely there in [[China]].

== Collecting ==
The only way to accurately date many Plasticville buildings is by examining its packaging. A Plasticville building has its highest collectible value when accompanied by its original box and in an unglued and unpainted state. Glued Plasticville structures are worth about 20% as much to a collector as an unglued piece, although a Plasticville piece that is nicely glued and painted will have value for use in a train layout, rather than as a collectible.

The plastic used in modern Plasticville has slightly different texture from vintage Plasticville and although Bachmann uses the same molds today as in the 1950s, it uses different colors in an effort to not diminish the collector value of its old pieces. Re-issues produced after 1997 are marked "Made in [[China]]."

Variations in common buildings can drive up the value. The common Plasticville one-story ranch house is worth about $5, but a variation using dark blue plastic is worth about $200.

Many Plasticville collectors join the Plasticville Collectors Association (PCA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticvilleusa.org PCA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the association is to promote a sense of fellowship among Plasticville, USA collectors and to serve as an accurate source of information regarding all aspects of Plasticville collecting for its members and the general public.

With declining values, collectors are becoming somewhat scarce since it was taken over by [[Kader]] Industries in 1984.

The '''Portsmouth and District Magic Circle (PDMC)''' is a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]s' society based in [[Portsmouth]] in the English county of [[Hampshire]]. It is one of the largest magic societies in the UK with nearly 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Mischa (11 January 2012 ). [http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/lifestyle/now-that-s-magic-1-3405614 "Now that's magic!"], ''Portsmouth News''&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded in 1938 at a meeting in the Talbot Hotel in Portsmouth. Amongst its founding members were the close-up magician [[Lewis Ganson]] and the master illusionist [[Will Ayling]], author of ''The Art of Illusion'' and ''Oriental Conjuring and Magic''.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, John (27 February 1993).

Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|0313233977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early member was the engineer and illusionist Donald Stevenson who worked for the American magician [[William Ellsworth Robinson]] and created mechanical illusions in a workshop he shared with Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;''Portsmouth News'' (8 January 2010). [http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/the-search-is-on-to-find-houdini-s-plane-1-1245459 "The search is on to find Houdini's plane"]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Stevenson wrote articles about his memories of Robinson for the PDMC's magazine, ''Top Hat'', extracts of which are reproduced in ''The Glorious Deception: The Double Life of William Robinson''.&lt;ref&gt;. See pp. 293-294 and 324-325 of Steinmeyer, Jim (2006).

Da Capo Press. {{ISBN|078671770X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society organizes an annual event called "Jumbo Day" in which magicians from around the UK gather to trade and sell magic equipment and paraphernalia and attend workshops and demonstrations. The event closes with a gala magic show in the evening. According to the PDMC, "Jumbo Day" is southern England's "largest annual one-day magic event."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouthmagic.co.uk PDMC official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Members also raise money for the [[Anthony Nolan Trust]] with "Magic Trek", a sponsored walk from the headquarters of the PDMC in Portsmouth to the headquarters of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] in London, stopping off at various magic societies along the route. The first "Magic Trek" took place in 2009 led by PDMC member Sean Lobban dressed in a giant bunny costume accompanied by an [[escapologist]], a [[juggler]], a magician, and several other entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;''Portsmouth News'' (3 March 2009).

The '''ship's cat''' has been a common feature on many [[Merchant vessel|trading]], [[History of research ships|exploration]], and [[naval ship]]s dating to [[ancient times]]. Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons, most importantly to control rodents. [[Vermin]] aboard a ship can cause damage to ropes, woodwork, and more recently, electrical wiring. Also, rodents threaten ships' stores, devour crews' foodstuff, and could cause economic damage to ships' cargo such as grain. They are also a [[Vector (epidemiology)|source of disease]], which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. [[Oriental rat flea|Rat flea]]s are carriers of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and rats on ships were believed to be a main spreader of the [[Black Death]].

Cats naturally attack and kill rodents,&lt;ref name="bruzelius"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bruzelius | first = Lars | title = Sailing Ships | work = Stevens: ‘Vermin’, 1894 | publisher = The Maritime History Virtual Archives | year = 2005 | url = http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Seamanship/Stevens%281894%29_S1156.html | accessdate = April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their natural ability to adapt to new surroundings made them suitable for service on a ship. In addition, they offer companionship and a sense of home, security and camaraderie to sailors away from home.

== History ==

The domestication of cats is believed to date back to around 9,000 years ago on farms in the [[Near East]]. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board [[Nile boat]]s to catch birds in the [[thicket]]s along the riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paintings from the Tomb-chapel of Nebamun|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/egypt-art/new-kingdom/a/paintings-from-the-tomb-chapel-of-nebamun|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/famous/simon.html | contribution = Simon of HMS Amethyst | title = Purr’n’fur | place = UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study suggests that cats spread from [[ancient Egypt]] along maritime trade routes a few thousand years after first being domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briggs|first1=Helen|title=How cats conquered the ancient world|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40306897|accessdate=19 June 2017|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary results of a genetic study published in September 2016 concluded that cats were carried on trading ships to control rodents, and that practice was adopted by traders from many nations, including [[Vikings]] in northern Germany around the [[8th century|8th]] to [[11th century|11th]] centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cats sailed with Vikings to conquer the world, genetic study reveals|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/cats-sailed-with-vikings-to-conquer-the-world-genetic-study-reveals|website=www.sciencealert.com|date=23 September 2016|publisher=Science Alert|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norwegian Forest cat]] is a [[natural breed]] believed to have been developed from Viking ships' cats. [[Sailing ship]]s spread the domestic cat throughout much of the rest of the world during the [[Age of Discovery]] in the [[15th century|15th]] through [[18th century|18th]] centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mason|editor1-first=Ian L.|title=Evolution of domesticated animals|date=1984|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=0-582-46046-8|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cats and superstition ==
Sometimes [[Cats in ancient Egypt|worshipped as deities]], cats have long had a reputation as [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] animals and numerous [[myth]]s and [[superstition]]s sprang up among the unusually superstitious seafaring community.&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were considered to be intelligent and lucky animals, and a high level of care was devoted to keeping them happy. Some sailors believed that [[polydactyl cat]]s were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Laura |title=11 things you didn't know about polydactyl cats |url=https://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/11-thing-didnt-know-polydactyl-cats |website=MNN |publisher=Mother Nature Network |quote= [Polydactyl cat's] large feet were thought to make them superior mousers, as well as provide better balance on the high seas. |language=en |date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places polydactyl cats became known as "ship's cats".

Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep [[black cat]]s at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea. It was believed to be lucky if a cat approached a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it only came halfway, and then retreated.  Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included, if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a [[hail]] [[storm]] was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.

Some of these beliefs are rooted in reality. Cats are able to detect slight changes in the weather, as a result of their very sensitive inner ears, which also allow them to land upright when falling. Low [[atmospheric pressure]], a common precursor of stormy weather, often makes cats nervous and restless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Margot|title=How Do Cats React to Barometric Pressure?|url=http://pets.thenest.com/cats-react-barometric-pressure-12401.html|website=The Nest|publisher=XO Group Inc.|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable examples ==
The prevalence of cats on ships has led to them being reported on by a number of noted seafarers. The outbreak of the [[Second World War]], with the spread of mass communication and the active nature of the world's navies, also led to a number of ship's cats becoming celebrities in their own right.&lt;ref name="Famous ships cats and their lives"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/featuring/war02.html | title = Famous ships cats and their lives | publisher = Purr’n’fur | place = United Kingdom}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blackie ===
Blackie was [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']]'s ship's cat. During the Second World War, he achieved worldwide fame after ''Prince of Wales'' carried [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] across the Atlantic to [[Naval Station Argentia|NS Argentia]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], in August 1941, where he secretly met with the [[United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for several days in a secure anchorage. This meeting resulted in the declaration of the [[Atlantic Charter]], but as Churchill prepared to step off ''Prince of Wales'', Blackie approached. Churchill stooped to bid farewell to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.rjerrard.co.uk/royalnavy/rnbooks/rncats.htm | title = Royal Navy | contribution = Cats | publisher = R Jerrard | place = UK | type = book}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackie survived the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'']] by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] later that year, and was taken to [[Singapore]] with the survivors.  He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and his fate is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Churchill’s Feline Menagerie|author1=Fred Glueckstein|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/837-churchills-feline-menagerie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429121822/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/837-churchills-feline-menagerie|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 April 2010|publisher=The Churchill Centre|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camouflage ===
Camouflage was the ship's cat aboard a US Coast Guard [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]] in the Pacific theater, WWII. He was known for chasing enemy [[Tracer ammunition|tracer rounds]] across the deck.&lt;ref name="USCG mascots"&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/Mascots_2.asp | place = US | publisher = Coast Guard | title = History | contribution = Mascots}}.{{Dead link|date=July 2018|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chibley ===
Chibley was the ship's cat aboard the [[tall ship]] [[Barque]] [[Picton Castle (ship)|''Picton Castle'']]. She was rescued from an animal shelter and [[circumnavigated]] the world five times. ''Picton Castle''’s role as a training ship resulted in Chibley being introduced to a large number of visitors and becoming a celebrity in her own right. Chibley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Captain Daniel Moreland|title=Captain's Log|url=http://www.picton-castle.com/captains_log/category/chibley/|website=www.picton-castle.com|accessdate=23 April 2018|location=Archive for the 'Chibley' Category|language=en|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convoy ===
[[File:Convoy cat.jpg|thumb|right|Convoy asleep in a hammock aboard HMS ''Hermione'']]
Convoy was the ship's cat aboard [[HMS Hermione (74)|HMS ''Hermione'']]. He was so named because of the number of times he accompanied the ship on [[Escort Group|convoy escort]] duties. Convoy was listed in the ship's book and provided with a full kit, including a tiny [[hammock]] in which he slept. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when ''Hermione'' was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by [[German submarine U-205]].

=== Emmy ===
Emmy was the ship's cat on {{RMS|Empress of Ireland}}. She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy jumped ship while in port in Quebec City. The crew returned her to the ship, but she left again, leaving her kittens behind.  The ''Empress of Ireland'' left without her, which was regarded as a terrible omen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blatchford|first1=Andy|title=Empress of Ireland, ‘Canada’s Titanic,’ finally getting its due after 100 years|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/empress-of-ireland-canadas-titanic-finally-getting-its-due-after-100-years/article18819164/?page=all|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=The Canadian Press|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Early the next morning ''Empress of Ireland'' collided with {{SS|Storstad}} while steaming through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and rapidly sank, killing over 1,000 people.

=== Felix ===
Felix was the ship's cat aboard ''[[Mayflower II]]'' when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957 to symbolize the solidarity between the UK and the US following World War II. He was given his own life jacket and once suffered a broken paw after a mishap. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. Photos and stories about Felix appeared in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Yankee (magazine)|Yankee]]'' magazine after his arrival in the US. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. He was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The current captain of the ''Mayflower II'' wrote a children's book about Felix entitled ''Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{isbn|9780979334818}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at [[Plimoth Plantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.plimoth.org/features/mayflower-2/journey/felix.php | title = The Journey of the Mayflower II | contribution = Felix | publisher = Plimoth}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halifax ===
Halifax was the name given to Alvah and Diana Simon's ship's cat who was found in the port of Halifax, on their way to winter at Tay Bay in 1994, on ''Roger Henry''. The cat spent all of the time iced in on the boat with Alvah, when Diana had to leave for family purposes. Alvah's book ''North To The Night''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Alvah|title=North to the Night: A Year in the Arctic Ice|date=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill [u.a.]|location=Camden, ME |isbn=0-07-058052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes his adventure in the ice with Halifax the cat, who ended up losing half an ear to frostbite.

=== Jenny ===
Jenny was the name of the ship's cat aboard {{RMS|Titanic|3=2}} and was mentioned in the accounts of several of the crew members who survived the ocean liner's [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|fateful 1912 maiden voyage]]. She was transferred from ''Titanic''{{'}}s sister ship {{RMS|Olympic|3=2}} and gave birth in the week before ''Titanic'' left Southampton. The galley is where Jenny and her kittens normally lived, cared for by the [[victualling]] staff who fed them kitchen scraps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=John P.|last2=Haas|first2=Charles A. |others= foreword by William MacQuitty|title=Titanic: A Journey Through Time|date=1999|publisher=Patrick Stephens|location=Sparkford|isbn=1-85260-575-8|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewardess [[Violet Jessop]] later wrote in her memoir that the cat "laid her family near Jim, the [[wikt:scullion|scullion]], whose approval she always sought and who always gave her warm devotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellegrino|first1=Charles|authorlink=Charles R.

Jenny and her kittens went down with the ship.

=== Kiddo ===
[[File:M. Vaniman and cat.jpg|thumb|left|upright|M. Vaniman and Kiddo]]
Kiddo seemed to have stowed away on the [[airship]] [[America (airship)|''America'']], when she left from [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], in an attempt to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1910. Kiddo was upset at first by the experience, but settled in and evidently, was better at predicting bad weather than the [[barometer]]. The airship's engines failed, and the small crew and Kiddo abandoned the ''America'' for [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] when they sighted the [[Royal Mail Ship|Royal Mail steamship]] ''[[SS Trent|Trent]]'', near [[Bermuda]]. Kiddo then was retired from being a ship's cat and was taken care of by Edith Wellman Ainsworth, the daughter of the American [[journalist]], [[explorer]], and [[aviator]], [[Walter Wellman]], who made the daring attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Janus | first = Allan | title = Animals Aloft: Photographs from the Smithsonian National Air &amp; Space Museum | publisher = Bunker Hill Publishing | date = October 15, 2005 | isbn = 1-59373-048-9}}, 128 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mrs Chippy ===
{{Main|Mrs Chippy}}
[[File:Mrschippy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mrs Chippy]], a tiger-striped male [[tabby]] ship's cat]]
Mrs Chippy (actually a male) was the ship's cat aboard [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], the ship used by Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] for his [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]]. When the ship was lost, having become trapped and eventually crushed in pack ice, Shackleton ordered the sled dogs and Mrs Chippy shot, as Shackleton had decided that the animals could not be kept during the arduous journey ahead.

=== Nansen ===
Nansen was the ship's cat on {{ship|RV|Belgica|1884|2}}, which was used for the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]]. He was brought on board by cabin boy Johan Koren, and was named after [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. He died on 22 June 1898,&lt;ref name = Lewis&gt;{{cite book |title=Ship's Cats in War and Peace |last=Lewis |first=Val |year=2002 |publisher= Nauticalia | location =Shepperton |isbn=0-9530458-1-1|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref name=Cool&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/antarctic_whos_who_belgica.htm | first = Adrien | last = de Gerlache | title = Belgica Belgian Antarctic Expedition 1897–1899 | publisher = Cool Antarctica | accessdate = 5 October 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101009092129/http://coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/antarctic_whos_who_belgica.htm | archivedate = 9 October 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peebles ===
[[File:Peebles the cat.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Commander R H Palmer [[OBE]], [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve|RNVR]] plays with Peebles, the ship's cat, who leaps through his clasped arms on board HMS ''Western Isles'' at [[Tobermory, Mull]]]]
Peebles was the ship's cat aboard [[HMS Western Isles|HMS ''Western Isles'']]. Another cat who became a favourite of the ship's crew, he was known to be particularly intelligent and would shake the hands of strangers when they entered the [[wardroom]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Pooli ===
[[File:Pooli (cat).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Pooli in uniform on July 4, 1959, her 15th birthday]]
Pooli served aboard a United States [[attack transport]] during the Second World War.

=== Rinda ===
Rinda was the ship's cat on the Norwegian cargo ship {{SS|Rinda}}, which was torpedoed and sunk during World War II. When the surviving crew realized that their beloved ship's cat was not on board the lifeboat, they rowed around in the night until they finally heard a pitiful "miauu" in the distance. "We rowed as hard as we could and laughed and cried when we lifted the sopping wet furball aboard". The cat became the ship's cat aboard the rescue ship, the [[Trawlers of the Royal Navy|British armed naval trawler]] {{HMT|Pict|FY132|6}}, and was given the name Rinda after the previous ship.&lt;ref name=Rinda&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.warsailors.com/singleships/rinda.html |title=D/S Rinda |publisher=War sailors |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Simon ===
{{Main|Simon (cat)}}

Simon was the ship's cat of [[HMS Amethyst (F116)|HMS ''Amethyst'']] during the [[Yangtze Incident]] in 1949, and was wounded in the bombardment of the ship which killed 25 of ''Amethyst''’s crew, including the commanding officer. He soon recovered and resumed killing rats and keeping up the crew's morale. He was appointed to the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon and became a [[celebrity]] after the ship escaped the Yangtze and returned to Britain. He later succumbed to an infection and died shortly after. Tributes poured in and his [[obituary]] appeared in ''[[The Times]]''. He was posthumously awarded the [[Dickin Medal]], the only cat ever to earn the award, and was buried with full naval honours.

=== Tarawa ===
Tarawa was a kitten rescued from a [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]] during the [[Battle of Tarawa]] by the [[United States Coast Guard]]. She was a mascot aboard an [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]], but did not get along with the LST's other mascot, a dog named Kodiak, and jumped ship ashore.&lt;ref name="USCG mascots" /&gt;

=== Tiddles ===
[[File:Tiddles cat.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tiddles at his station aboard HMS ''Victorious''. Despite a long tradition, there are no longer ships' cats aboard Royal Navy vessels]]
Tiddles was the ship's cat on a number of [[Royal Navy]] [[aircraft carrier]]s. He was born aboard {{HMS |Argus|I49|6}}, and later joined {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}. He was often seen at his favourite station, on the aft [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]], where he would play with the bell-rope. He eventually travelled over {{convert |30000|mi|km}} during his time in service.

=== Trim ===
{{Main|Trim (cat)}}
Trim was the ship's cat on a number of the ships under the command of [[Matthew Flinders]] during voyages to circumnavigate and map the coastline of Australia during 1801–1803. He became a favourite of the crew and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. He remained with Flinders until death. He has been the subject of a number of works of literature, and statues have been placed in his honour, including one that sits on a window sill at the [[State Library of New South Wales]] in Sydney.

=== Unsinkable Sam ===
{{Main|Unsinkable Sam}}
Previously named Oscar, he was the ship's cat of the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']]. When she was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 out of a crew of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer [[HMS Cossack (F03)|HMS ''Cossack'']] (one of the ships responsible for destroying ''Bismarck''). ''Cossack'' herself was torpedoed and sunk a few months later, on 24 October, killing 159 of her crew, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to [[Gibraltar]]. He became the ship's cat of [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], which was torpedoed and sunk in November that year. Oscar was again rescued, but it was decided at that time to transfer him to a home on land. By now known as Unsinkable Sam because of surviving the three ship sinkings, he was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General's of Gibraltar office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him exists in the private collection of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Georgina Shaw|title=Item #PAJ2744: ''Oscar, Cat From the German Battleship Bismarck'' - Private Collections of the National Maritime Museum|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/203480.html|website=Royal Museums Greenwich|location=London, UK|format=Framed drawing in pastel, 785 x 610 mm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==

The [[Royal Navy]] banned cats and other pet animals from all ships on the ocean in 1975 on [[hygiene]] grounds;&lt;ref name="Famous ships cats and their lives" /&gt; however, cats are still common on many private ships.

One notable example is ''Toolbox'' (a feral kitten born in a toolbox), the senior ship's cat, official warrant officer and "Captain's Assistant" aboard [[Kalmar Nyckel#The modern Kalmar Nyckel|the modern ''Kalmar Nyckel'']]. A celebrity in her own right, she is the subject of two books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayers|first1=Barbara|title=Toolbox: Ship's Cat on the Kalmar Nyckel|date=2007|publisher=Bay Oak Publishers, Limited|isbn=9780974171395|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Toolbox.html?id=q3LvHwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles E. Ireland, Jr.|title=Toolbox|date=2006|publisher=Cedar Tree Books|url=http://cedartreebooks.com/catalog/1-books/29-toolbox|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, American sailor [[Robin Lee Graham]] was the youngest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe, beginning in 1965.  A number of ship's cats were included in the chronicles for the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' (1968–1970) and detailed in the 1972 book ''Dove'', which was adapted into the 1974 film ''[[The Dove (1974 film)|The Dove]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== In fiction ==
There are at least two books called ''The Ship's Cat'':  [[The Ship's Cat|a 1977 children's book]] by [[Richard Adams]] and [[Alan Aldridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-224-01441-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2000 novel by [[Jock Brandis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0595129973}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Matthew Flinders' Cat]]'' is a 2002 novel by [[Bryce Courtenay]] featuring tales about [[Trim (cat)|Trim]], the ship's cat that circumnavigated Australia. In ''Fish Head'', a 1954 children's book by [[Jean Fritz]], the eponymous cat unwittingly becomes a ship's cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fritz | first = Jean | title = Fish head | url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jean-fritz/fish-head/ | journal = Kirkus Reviews}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a central episode in [[Jan de Hartog]]'s novel ''[[The Captain (1967 novel)|The Captain]]'', taking place on board a ship engaged in the dangerous [[Murmansk Convoy]]s in the [[Second World War]], a young officer is killed in an effort to save the ship's cat and her playful kittens during a [[Luftwaffe]] attack on the ship. This profoundly affects the main protagonist, the ship's captain, and is one of the factors leading to his later becoming a [[conscientious objector]].

In [[science fiction]], the role of the ship's cat has been transferred to spaceships. Notable examples include [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s 1955 short story "[[The Game of Rat and Dragon]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29614/29614-h/29614-h.htm | last = Smith | first = Cordwainer | title = The game of Rat and Dragon | journal = Galaxy Science Fiction |date=October 1955 | publisher = Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andre Norton]]'s 1968 novel ''The Zero Stone''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ZERO STONE by Andre Norton|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/andre-norton/the-zero-stone/|website=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|publisher=Kirkus Media|accessdate=19 April 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a telepathic mutant feline named Eet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Zero Stone (#1)|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1183868.The_Zero_Stone|website=www.goodreads.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On film,  ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) and the sequel ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1989) feature Jones ("Jonesy") aboard USCSS ''Nostromo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burton|first1=Bonnie|authorlink1=Bonnie Burton|title=Ripley and her cat make 'Aliens' look cuddly|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ripley-cat-jonesy-aliens-alien-sci-fi-movie-sigourney-weaver/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=19 April 2018|language=en|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blueprint 3''''' is the eleventh [[studio album]] by American rapper [[Jay-Z]], released September 8, 2009, on [[Roc Nation]], through distribution from [[Atlantic Records]]. It is the third ''Blueprint'' album, preceded by ''[[The Blueprint]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; The Curse|The Blueprint&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: The Gift &amp; The Curse]]'' (2002). Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at several recording studios and was handled by [[Kanye West]], [[No I.D.]], [[The Neptunes]], [[Jeff Bhasker]], Al Shux, [[Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]],  The Inkredibles, [[Swizz Beatz]], and [[Timbaland]]. This is the third
''Blueprint'' album in the ''Blueprint'' trilogy, as well as the first Jay-Z album since ''[[Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter]]'' (1999)  to not feature production from [[Just Blaze]].

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 476,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z's eleventh US number-one album, breaking the record he had previously shared with [[Elvis Presley]], and produced five singles that achieved chart success. Upon its release, ''The Blueprint 3'' received generally positive reviews from music critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1265290/jay-z-and-the-beatles-dominate-album-charts |title=Jay-Z And The Beatles Dominate Album Charts |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The earliest hype over ''The Blueprint 3'' came when [[DJ Clue]] released in January 2008 a [[mixtape]] song called "Ain't I", produced by [[Timbaland]]. In the intro, Clue says, "Off that ''Blueprint 3'' baby!" However, a spokesperson for Jay-Z said that it was an old, unreleased song and that the recording of ''The Blueprint 3'' had not yet started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New Jay-Z Song Leaks -- Is Blueprint 3 In The Works? | last = Reid| first = Shaheem | author-link =| publisher = MTV| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1580691/20080131/jay_z.jhtml| date = January 30, 2008| accessdate = July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 20, Timbaland, a frequent contributor to previous Jay-Z albums, told [[MTV News]] that he would be producing the whole album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Timbaland On Producing Jay-Z's Next LP: 'It'll Be A Monster'| last = Reid| first = Shaheem | author-link =| publisher = MTV| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590927/20080715/timbaland.jhtml| date = July 16, 2008| accessdate = July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But in an interview with the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Jay-Z called the statement "premature".&lt;ref name = "Rolling Stone Interview"&gt;{{cite news | title = Jay-Z Teaming with Kanye West on Next Album  | last = Van Dril| first = E. | author-link =| publisher = TheCelebrityCafe| url = http://thecelebritycafe.com/features/18543.html | date = September 1, 2008| accessdate = July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, Jay-Z confirmed ''The Blueprint 3'' as the album's title during an interview with radio station [[Shade 45]].&lt;ref name = "GITD"/&gt;

By November 2008, he had finished the album but with lengthy negotiations with Def Jam, he went on to reworking it.&lt;ref name = "Billboard"&gt;{{cite news | title = Jay-Z: He's A Business, Man | last = Concepcion| first =Mariel | author-link =| publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''| url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268021/jay-z-hes-a-business-man| date = July 20, 2009| accessdate = July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Jay-Z confirmed continued production of the album and admitted the leak of several songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jay-Z Taking His Time With Blueprint 3 To Make It 'Beyond And Above' | last = Rodriguez| first = Jayson |last2 = Calloway|first2 = Sway J. | author-link =| publisher = MTV| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1603222/20090121/story.jhtmljay_z.jhtml| date = January 22, 2009| accessdate = July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jay-Z Explains Blueprint 3 Delays: 'I'll Be Axl Rose Out Here!' | last = Reid| first = Shaheem| publisher = MTV| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1605288/20090218/jay_z.jhtml?rsspartner=rssBloglines| date = February 18, 2009| accessdate = July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine interview, Jay-Z confirmed "What We Talkin' About", the album's intro, "Thank You", and "Already Home" as song names and collaborations with [[Australian]] dance group [[Empire of the Sun (band)|Empire of the Sun]], rappers [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] and [[Kid Cudi]] and singer [[Rihanna]].&lt;ref name = "Billboard"/&gt; He also mentioned in an interview with [[DJ Semtex]] that his favorite song on the album is "Empire State of Mind".&lt;ref name="Semtex"&gt;[http://nahright.com/news/2009/07/24/audio-jay-z-interview-w-dj-semtex/ Jay-Z Interview w/ DJ Semtex]. Nah Right. Retrieved on July 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The official track list for ''Blueprint 3'' was revealed on August 18, confirming the guest appearances from [[Kanye West]], [[Rihanna]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[J. Cole]], [[Alicia Keys]], and more.&lt;ref name="Blueprint 3 Tracklist"&gt;{{cite web | author=Dombal, Ryan | title=Jay-Z's Blueprint 3: The Tracklist | url=http://pitchfork.com/news/36262-jay-zs-iblueprint-3i-the-tracklist/ | work=[[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] | publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc | date=August 19, 2009 | accessdate=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Artwork==
The cover consists of a large amount of all-white instruments and recording tools stacked in a corner, with three red lines across the image. Rather than simply using photoshop, the album's design team carefully stacked all the equipment in a corner then used a projector to create the bars. They then painted red onto the equipment where the projection of the bars was, and replaced the projector with a camera to achieve the correct perspective for the image. ''Blueprint 3'' would be Jay-Z's first album cover that did not feature his face on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/09/best-rap-album-covers/the-blueprint-3 |title=50.

==Recording==
Most of the album's recording sessions took place in [[Hawaii]] at Avex Honolulu Studio,&lt;ref name="liner"/&gt; in an effort to avoid leakage. West's protégé [[Mr Hudson]] explained to ''[[The Times]]'' that he "won't get bothered there" compared to a major city such as [[New York City|New York]] or [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="timesonline1"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mr Hudson Goes 'Supernova' with Kanye| last = Crerar| first = Simon | author-link =| publisher = Times Online| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6660915.ece| date = July 8, 2009| accessdate = July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions for the album took place during 2008 to 2009 at Avex Honolulu Studio and several other recording studios, including Germano Studios, Oven Studios, and Roc The Mic in [[New York City]], Kingdom Studios and Lava Studios in [[Cleveland]], Midnight Blue Studios and South Beach Studios in [[Miami]], The Holy Chateau in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]], and Westlake Studio in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="liner"&gt;''The Blueprint 3'' liner notes [[Roc Nation]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7987186|title=Jay-Z The Blueprint 3 CD|publisher=CD Universe|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Yasha Mazur ([[Alan Arkin]]) is a turn-of-the-20th-century Jewish stage magician, womaniser, conman, and mystic. His great ambition is to figure out how to fly – an ambition he eventually achieves but not as a magic trick.  He tours the western reaches of the old Russian Empire.

Yasha is married to Esther ([[Linda Bernstein]]), but he is rarely home in Lublin to see her and they have not been able to have any children.  On the road, however, there are plenty of women to keep Yasha company.  Among many others, there is the zaftig Zeftel [[Valerie Perrine]] and the Polish Catholic assistant, Magda [[Maia Danziger]], who tours and performs with him.  Magda's brother is Bolek ([[Zachi Noy]]), who is incompetent; and their mother is Elzbieta ([[Shelley Winters]]), who is desperate.  Magda herself, it transpires, is mentally unstable.

But the great loves of Yasha's life, and the great ambition of his love, are the aristocratic but poor widow, Emilia ([[Louise Fletcher]]), whom he would marry; and her daughter, Halina ([[Lisa Whelchel]]), whom he adores as if she were his own.  But Halina is ill and needs medical care, that Emilia knows Yasha will never be able to provide; so she must keep herself free to marry someone who ''can'' pay for the medical treatment her daughter needs.

But Yasha's big break looms.  In addition to demonstrating a Houdini-style escape from a tank of water while shackled, Yasha convinces his manager/impresario, Wolsky ([[Lou Jacobi]]), that he can fly.  So Wolsky arranges for a booking at the prestigious Alhambra theatre in [[Warsaw]].  Yasha will at last make it big!

But then Zeftel arrives unexpectedly and innocently announces she is emigrating to America – to Buenos Aires – where a man has promised her work.  But Yasha knows that Buenos Aires is in Argentina, and that man who is going to take her there is a pimp who is selling her into sexual slavery.  What else can Yasha do, but perform a special show of magic and card tricks for the pimp and give him money, to save Zeftel.

Thus he misses his big break – and discovers the next morning that Zeftel had lied to him, after he attempts to burglarise the home of Count Zaruski to steal the money Emilia needs to take Halina to Italy for her cure, and so that Emilia will marry him instead of the Count.  His attempt at burglary fails because he has a vision of blood and death that distracts him. He manages to escape, using his cape as wings to glide him safely to the ground.  But he is emotionally fragile, knowing that he has lost Emila and Halina, as well as his career.

But real horror awaits.  He makes it back to his rooms and discovers that Magda did not go to the theatre the night before.  She stayed at home, dressed her face in a clown makeup, chopped her hair with a razor, and then hanged herself.

Now fully broken, Yasha returns home to Esther.  His mystic vision of death having come true, he encloses himself in a brick hut with only a window, through which to receive food and communicate with people as a holy man, dispensing wisdom and blessings.  Wolsky arrives, having read in the Warsaw papers about the holy man of Lublin who lives in a grave.  He has brought Emilia with him, who asks Yasha's forgiveness and asks him to pray for her.  She is now the Countess Zaruski, and Halina is at least in a sanitorium in Italy receiving treatment.

Another visitor from away has also come.  She is a widow, heavily veiled in black mourning, who has also heard of the holy man in the brick hut, who spends his days in prayer and study of the torah, comes to seek his advice what to do.  She is mourning the loss of her daughter who killed herself for love of a man, and she cannot forgive the man.

Suddenly she pulls back her veil and reveals that she is Elzbieta, come with Bolek and some friends to avenge Magda's death by killing Yasha.  A battering ram is brought and attacks the brick hut, again and again, until its walls collapse and the hut is opened.  Elzbieta and Bolek are ready to kill the man they blame for Magda's suicide.

But Yasha is not inside the brick hut when it is open.  He is nowhere to be seen but neither could he possibly have escaped.  All fall back dumbfounded by an apparent miracle, and then they see a skein of geese in the sky – and one goose in particular, chasing after it.

Yasha truly ''had'' learned to fly.

'''''Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life''''' is a non-fiction book by Indian-American economist [[Avinash Dixit]] and [[Barry Nalebuff]], a professor of economics and management at [[Yale School of Management]]. The text was initially published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] on February 1, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393029239|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title=Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book discusses issues of strategic behaviour, decision making, and [[game theory]]. The authors present the main concepts, such as [[backward induction]], [[auction theory]], [[Nash equilibrium]], noncooperative bargaining, to a general audience. Each concept is illustrated by examples from common life, business, sports, politics, etc.—as applying game theory to real life may be the best way of crystallizing the best options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2138835?uid=3738936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106298406241|publisher=[[jstor.org]]|title=Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote|Today our writers and critics nominate the books they have enjoyed reading most over the last twelve months. No rules were imposed but, as you will see, all have been encouraged to be adventurous and broaden their interests away from their usual subjects

''Thinking Strategically'' by Avinash Dixit &amp; Barry Nalebuff (W W Norton) offers essential training in making choices and weighing possibilities not only in business but in daily life. Reading it is a trip to the gym for the reasoning faculties. It presents game theory and business strategy as understandable, usable and everyday tools for living with others. Its examples of tactics in action range from King Lear to Maradonna. And the case studies make great bit-reading in queues or waiting-rooms. I also much enjoyed Howard Rheingold's ''Virtual Reality'' (Secker &amp; Warburg), which describes the computer-created world waiting around the corner of the century, and Simon Schama's ''Dead Certainties'' (Granta), which sent a bright spark between history and fiction: illuminating.}}

'''''Tickety Toc''''' is an American, British and South Korean children's animated CGI series produced by The Foundation, part of [[Zodiak Media Group]] and FunnyFlux Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nick-u-s-finds-times-for-zodiaks-tickety-toc/&lt;/ref&gt; The first series consist of 52 episodes, each 11 minutes long, but is shown as twenty-six blocks, each containing two episodes in some countries.

The first series was acquired by Nick Jr. as part of a global deal. ''Tickety Toc'' aired across Asia from 19 April 2012 and was subsequently rolled out internationally with localised dubs. ''Tickety Toc'' aired for the first time on British TV on 23 April 2012 as the number 1 Nick Jr. show,&lt;ref&gt;BARB, C&amp;S homes, K4-15, Nick Jr., April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and became the number 1  daytime show on Nick Jr. US&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Oct-Nov '12&lt;/ref&gt; for the first 3 months when it launched  September 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartoonbrew.com/biz/new-nickelodeon-preschool-series-tickety-toc-launches-sept-10-69406.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Nick Jr. global acquisition, the show has been sold to free-to-air television partners internationally.  Launching on Channel 5's Milkshake slot 1 November 2012, other broadcasters who have picked up the 52-episode series include TG4 in Ireland and Family Channel in Canada. Jolly Roger (Amusement Rides LTD) made a kiddie ride based on Pufferty the train, featuring the main characters Tommy &amp; Tallulah. It features a [[mirror]] so you can see yourself on Pufferty, the Tickety Toc theme tune and 4 funny sound effects.

In the US, ''Tickety Toc'' originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]]'s preschool block, but was later burned off to [[Nick Jr.]] on weekdays.

==Plot==
In a clock shop, there is a fun-styled cuckoo-like clock called the Tickety Toc Clock. As every hour passes, two figures come out near the top: a boy named Tommy playing his drums, and a girl named Tallulah playing her trumpet. A dog-shaped train named Pufferty also runs around on the clock's rails. However, unlike most clocks, it features a magical world called Tickety inside it; thus Tommy, Tallulah, and Pufferty would come alive and hang out there with their friends between the hours. Things don't always run smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel5.com/shows/tickety-toc&lt;/ref&gt;

The show centres on Tommy &amp; Tallulah and their remarkable friends, as they race against time to keep the clock ticking and to perform their duty of chiming in the time. Through Tommy &amp; Tallulah's madcap adventures, ''Tickety Toc'' explores concepts of teamwork, social responsibility &amp; problem solving in a fun and engaging way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/tickety-toc&lt;/ref&gt;

Every show starts with Pufferty dropping off the twins after they've finished Chime Time. Tommy &amp; Tallulah then unintentionally set off a chain of events which will ultimately threaten to prevent Chime Time from happening. With the help from one or more of the eclectic Tickety Town residents, the twins develop ways of overcoming the emotional or physical jeopardy that has been caused.  Once the problem is resolved, Pufferty takes Tommy &amp; Tallulah to the Tickety Toc Clock so Chime Time can take place again.

==Characters==

=== Main ===
*Tommy &amp; Tallulah do everything with utmost enthusiasm, commitment and positivity - even if that gets them further and further into trouble. They share that "I want it to happen now" impatience of all preschoolers, but they are 8 years old. Tommy and Tallulah love each other, back each other up and egg each other on—a convincing "Well if you're sure, then I'm sure," is all it takes to confirm both their commitments to a course of action. This 'can do' spirit can often produce a calamitous outcome, but their individual approach to a sticky situation and joint resourcefulness always shines through and saves the day. &lt;br&gt; Tommy is funny and always ready for adventure. His 'act now think later' approach often lands the twins in a spin. He is practical and resourceful but his confidence sometimes outweighs his own ability with comedic effect. However, when things go wrong, he can always turn to his twin sister, Tallulah, for help. &lt;br&gt; Tallulah is the more creative half of this duo. She is much more of a thinker and inevitably comes up with the plan to solve the problem they face. She has a big imagination and is not afraid to use it - but she knows she can always rely on Tommy for practical advice and know-how when faced with a problem she can't solve. Tommy has been voiced by [[Koda Gursoy]] and Talullah by [[Isabelle Seratch]] in the American version. [[Toby Ross Ralph]] and Ruby Love voice Tommy and Tallulah, respectively in the UK version.
*Pufferty is a very excitable puppy-dog train who helps the citizens of Tickety Town to get around. At the mere mention of his name, he can (and often does) appear out of the blue like a puppy who has heard the word "walkies". His greatest excitement however is reserved for "Chime Time", when he has the honour of delivering Tallulah and Tommy, on time, for their hourly duty. He is voiced by Julianne Grossman and Luke Cawley in the American version.
*McCoggins is the Tickety Town maintenance man and there's nothing he can't fix. He is also known as the "Clock Doc". An enthusiastic, amateur inventor, he has many weird and wonderful creations. He is a kindly, gentle soul and is surprisingly ponderous.
*Hopparoo is enthusiastic yet accident-prone, Hopparoo is the madcap bunny of Tickety Town. He spends his days eating carrots, looking for mischief or sleeping on his hammock. Occasionally McCoggins will call upon his DIY skills for maintenance in the town although his hyperactive nature often means that mayhem is never far behind when he's involved.

===Supporting===
*Chikidee is Tickety Town's weather chick. She sits on top of the weather vane at the top of the Clockhouse and reports the weather to anyone who'll listen. Chikidee dreams of glamour and being in the limelight – but is often let down by her scatty lack of coordination. Voiced by [[Patricia Rodriguez (voice actress)|Patricia Rodriguez]] in the American version
*Madame Au Lait is a larger than life character with a huge heart, enormous amounts of energy and approaches life with immeasurable gusto and enthusiasm. She mothers the Tickety Town residents – especially Tommy &amp; Tallulah, who live with her in the Clockhouse. When she's not knocking up a feast in the kitchen, Madame Au Lait can often be found playing Ping Pong – at which she is almost unbeatable – or practicing her taekwondo. Also voiced by Patricia Rodriguez in the American version.
*Battersby runs the Bell Shop &amp; General Store, a remarkable store which is the go-to place for any item, however obscure, that the residents of Tickety Town might need. Battersby often falls asleep at inopportune moments and always crashes to the floor from his rafters when customers call in to his shop and wake him up. He is easily startled, but utterly loveable and helpful. Voiced by [[Eric Meyers (actor)|Eric Meyers]] in the American version.
*Lopsiloo is Tickety Town's fruit and vegetables delivery snail. She is a fast snail and zips around town pulling her cart festooned with her beautifully displayed produce. When not on her rounds, Lopsiloo can be found tending her white picket-fenced vegetable garden. Lopsiloo is delightfully sweet natured, but with a charmingly ditsy take on the world. She is voiced by Larissa Murray.
*Tooteroo is a curious, inquisitive little owl who seems forever cursed by terrible luck. Tooteroo is completely silent, but it is able to clearly communicate its feelings to the audience with its comedic mannerisms.
*Spring Chicks are Tickety Town's resident family of free roaming chickens. Mother Spring Chick keeps her three chicks in check – although when they are off the leash, her three baby chicks are like three cute little [[velociraptors]] – chasing food and wreaking havoc wherever they can.

==Merchandise==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10121">The '''Triniscope''' was an early [[color television]] system developed by [[RCA]]. It used three separate video tubes with colored phosphors producing the [[primary color]]s, combining the images through [[dichroic filter|dichroic mirrors]] onto a screen for viewing.

As a consumer system it was enormous, expensive, impractical, and dropped as soon as the [[shadow mask]] system was successful. However, the Triniscope idea was used commercially in several niche roles for years, notably as a color replacement for the [[kinescope]], from which it took its name.

The term can also be applied to any [[projection television]] system using three tubes, but this use is rare in the literature.

==History==
===Color television===

Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or "[[Color gel|gel]]") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from [[CBS]] as their color broadcast in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html "CBS Field Sequential Color System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105183213/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html |date=2010-01-05 }}, 24 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RCA]] worked along different lines entirely, using the [[YUV|luminance-chrominance system]]. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it first combined the RGB signals from the camera into one overall brightness figure, the "[[luminance]]". The luminance signal closely matched the existing black and white broadcasts, and would display properly on existing sets. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the broadcast signal at high-frequency. On a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets, a decoder would notice the signal, filter it out from the luminance, and then process it to retrieve the color again.

Although RCA's system had enormous benefits over CBS's, it had not been successfully developed because it proved difficult to produce the display tubes. Compared to the CBS system, where the color changed once a frame at 144 times a second, RCA's system changed the color continually across the line, thousands of times a second, far too fast for a mechanical filter like the CBS design. Instead, the system required small dots of colored phosphor to be deposited on the screen, instead of the even coating used in conventional sets or mechanical color systems. These dots were far too small to be accurately hit by an [[electron gun]].

If a single tube could not be built with the required performance, an obvious solution is to use multiple tubes, one for each color. A wide variety of systems attempted to use this concept, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the images for display.

===Triniscope===
RCA's solution was to use three conventional black and white tubes with filters on the front to produce the three primary colors. The tubes were arranged with the green-filtered tube at the bottom of the chassis, facing up. Above it and to one side was the blue-filtered tube This was aimed at right angles to the green, so light from the two crossed in space between them. At the crossing point, a dichromic mirror was positioned to reflect the blue light up, while allowing the green light to pass through unchanged. Both "beams" were now traveling toward the top of the tube.&lt;ref name=dev&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/RCALabs_Rcvrs.html "RCA Laboratories Developmental Color Receivers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526040048/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/RCALabs_Rcvrs.html |date=2011-05-26 }}, 18 January 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A third tube and mirror completed the system by adding red to the image. A suitable red phosphor was not available at the time; instead, a red [[Wratten number|Wratten filter]] was placed over a tube with bright yellow phosphor, and then neutral filtered to get the proper brightness in relation to the other two tubes. All three signals then shone onto a mirror at the top of the chassis, which reflected the light forward toward the viewer.&lt;ref name=dev/&gt;

There were numerous problems with the arrangement. The first, and most difficult to solve, was that the resulting system was enormous. One example system using three 10-inch [[kinescope]] monitors, was 40-inches high, 38-inches wide and 21-inches deep.&lt;ref name=dev/&gt; This was the smallest of the Triniscope models produced with a reasonable display size; others had smaller chassis, but only at the cost of much smaller displays.

The signal was decoded by filtering out the color portion of the signal and sending the left-over luminance signal to all three tubes evenly. The color signal was then used to gate each color tube to the correct brightness levels. This required separate circuits for each tube, and even the most developed example required a total of 44 [[vacuum tube]]s in four separate chassis units. The system was expensive, both to build and to keep running. Given the cost and complexity, RCA also built prototype units using a two-color system, orange and cyan. Similar systems had been used to produce low-cost color films as early as the 1920s.&lt;ref name=rca&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_RCA.html "RCA Dot Sequential Color System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107142004/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_RCA.html |date=2010-01-07 }}, 28 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===NTSC===
During the early color meetings hosted by the FCC, the selection board made it clear they did not consider the Triniscope to be an acceptable solution. They allowed RCA to use the system in order to illustrate the dot-sequential system, but stated that only a system with a single display tube would be selected.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;George Harold Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hdE1AQAAIAAJ "And part of which I was: recollections of a research engineer"], Augus Cupar Publishers, 1982, pg. 197&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, RCA's displays never produced a reasonable image in testing.

As the FCC meetings evolved into the [[NTSC]], other researchers at RCA were hard at work on the competing [[shadow mask]] concept. By the time the next set of presentations was ready, shadow mask tubes using one or three guns were available. These did not fare any better in viewing tests, but critically, it was due to the signaling system, not the tubes. By that point, RCA had abandoned further development of the Triniscope.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

===Further use===
Although the shadow mask worked, it had a number of practical drawbacks. Notable among these was the dim images it produced as a side-effect of the mask blocking off most of the power from the [[electron gun]]s. Development of other solutions to the color problem continued throughout the 1950s and 60s, including commercial development of the Triniscope.

The Triniscope was first used as a color analog of the existing [[kinescope]] systems it was originally developed from. [[NBC]] and [[Pathé]] demonstrated a working system as early as 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TR8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 "NCB Ready With 35-MM. Color Kine"], ''Billboard'', 1 May 1954, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; However, in tests the system proved to be only "resonsable" so development continued in order to improve the quality.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson &amp; Sterling, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the same period the first [[video tape]] systems were being introduced, and the expense of the color printing used in the Triniscope made it an expensive option. Improvements in color film technology improved the system and work on the concept continued into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson &amp; Sterling, pg. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The Triniscope also saw limited development for consumer television use. One example is the Mitsubishi 6CT-338, which used three 5-inch CRTs arranged behind a faux screen on the front of the display. The image was viewable as a small image centered within the larger faux screen. Using three separate tube resulted in image brightness no shadow mask set could match, but because the image was "behind" the front of the display, the system had a limited display angle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labguysworld.com/ETF_2010.htm "LabGuy's World: Early Television Foundation Convention 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VEB Plasticart''' was a [[Plastic model|model]] and [[toy]] manufacturer established in 1958 in [[Zschopau]], [[East Germany]].

VEB Plasticart produced around 40 different kits and a few games (e.g. the [[mancala]] game "Badari") made of plastic. Most kits were static models and used scale 1/100 for airliners, [[1:50 scale|1/50]] and later [[1:72 scale|1/72]] for smaller aircraft. They also produced a model of the Soviet spaceship [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]] (scaled 1/25) and the [[Energia]] rocket with the Soviet space shuttle [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] (1/288). Many of them are today valued collector items.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== History ==
VEB Plasticart was established in 1958 in Zschopau, East Germany. VEB ([[Volkseigener Betrieb]]) was a Communist-era designation, meaning "company owned by the people". The company was called ''KVZ'' from 1958-1969, ''MPKAB'' from 1969-1973, ''VEB Plasticart Zschopau'' from 1973-1989 and ''Mastermodell GmbH'' from 1989-1991. After a two-years break the company was sold in 1993 by the German [[Treuhand]] (an organization which privatized state owned enterprises of the [[East Germany|GDR]]) to Manfred Wader. It is today called ''Plasticart''. In 1993 the company had only 37 workers left. A new factory was constructed in Elterlein, [[Saxony]], and now{{When|date=August 2014}} the company counts over 70 workers. They no longer make kits, but playthings for toddlers. In late 2012 German company ''Reifra'' has resumed production of the some former Plasticalt model kits.

The "VEB" title was applied to a range of small semi-autonomous businesses in the GDR that made goods especially for export. The GDR needed to export as much as possible to earn foreign "hard" currency as its own "soft" [[East German mark|Ostmark]] was not freely convertible and could only be obtained and used within the GDR. Consequently, VEB Plasticart was able to sell cheap, but well designed, plastic construction kits to the Western countries in exchange for much-needed Western currencies.

The factory was located in August-Bebel Strasse 2, 936 Zschopau, [[German Democratic Republic]].

For a long time the name "VEB" has stood with modelers for plastic construction kits from East Germany. The company changed its name several times.
;KVZ ("VEB Kunststoff-Verarbeitung Zschopau"): This name lasted until 1969 and is translated as  "Plastic Processing Zschopau". The kits had very nice packaging, usually made of thicker cardboard and a great cover image. The company logo was at that time the snake.
;MPKAB ("VEB Modell -und Plastspielwaren Kombinat Annaberg-Buchholz"): This very long name was used from 1969-1973 and stands for "VEB model and plastic toys combine Annaberg-Buchholz". The kits of this period, were packed in the classic familiar blue standard boxes, but, no company logo.
:In this era the combined company released 1:87 scale die-cast car and military vehicle models. "ESPEWE MODELLE" logo was used on the package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallscaleworld.blogspot.jp/2009_03_01_archive.html Small Scale World, March 11, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
;VEB Kombinat Plasticart Annaberg-Buchholz: This name was used for die-cast vehicle models. "PLASTICART modelle" logo was used on the package.
;VEB Plasticart Zschopau: That was the last name as "VEB" from 1973 to 1989, the packaging was the same as from 1969/70 but from 1973 they then received a company logo. From 1987, some kits appeared in a very novel black box, with a picture of a constructed model on the cover.
;Mastermodell GmbH: From 1989 to 1991 they were produced as a limited company under that name.

In addition to these company names, two more brand names were used by UK importers: "Playfix" from the mid-1980s and "Nu-Bee" from the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Burns, ''The Collectors Value Guide for Scale Model Plastic Kits'', Sixth Edition, 1994, P.134 and P.142&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
Starting in a modest way with a [[Ilyushin Il-14]] airliner in HO scale, then dabbling in the odd 1/40th scale for an [[Aero 45]] twin engine low wing monoplane Plasticart soon progressed to something more ambitious, a scale model of the first jet turbine airliner to be produced by the GDR. This was the extraordinary [[Baade 152]], the last development in a line of aircraft that sprung from the former [[Junkers]] works in [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]] (both then in the GDR). Next up was the stalwart of Interflug's European network, the four-engined [[Ilyushin IL-18]] turboprop.

The first of the famous Soviet airliner series to appear, in 1963, was the [[Tupolev Tu-104]], the first medium haul jet aircraft to go into regular sustained airline service. The early Plasticart Tu-104 set the standard for all the kits that followed. It was scaled at 1:100 which whilst not common for aircraft kits at the time, was close to [[Frog (models)|FROG models]]' 1:96 scale and matched well with contemporary East German [[TT scale|TT]] trains such as [[Berliner Bahn]]. In addition, the kit set a standard for being simple to assemble, with a minimal number of parts, sturdy landing gear and a full decal sheet. Instructions were a let-down though – often printed in German, Russian, Polish and Czech, these were aimed squarely at consumers in the [[Comecon]] countries, were Plasticart kits were both affordable and plentiful. There was an exploded diagram, but no English instructions.

Because the drawings were easy to obtain, Plasticart began to introduce a comprehensive range of detailed models of Soviet airliners and other [[Warsaw Pact]] aircraft. Whilst the Tu-104 had only been available with [[Aeroflot]] markings, the new introductions mostly came with Interflug decals – markings of the state airline of the GDR.

The latest airliners soon made it into the range, including the [[Tupolev Tu-134]], [[Tu-154]], Ilyushin's [[Ilyushin Il-62|Il-62]] long range airliner, the Antanov design bureau's [[Antonov An-24|An-24]] twin engine short hauled feeder-liner and the Czech-built [[Let L-410 Turbolet]] twin prop commuter aircraft. Later additions included the remarkable [[Yakovlev Yak-40]] tri-jet short-haul "hot &amp; high" jet and the awesome [[Tu-144]] supersonic jet, known as the Charger or as "Concordski" more generally. A very interesting mix of Soviet fighter aircraft and especially, helicopters, was also produced including the giant [[Mil Mi-10]] flying crane and the famous [[MiG-21]] "Fishbed" (1/100) and [[Sukhoi Su-7]] "Fitter" fighters (1/72 scale).

But it is the Western airliners that are most sought after by collectors today. The eclectic choice commenced with a very large kit indeed, the [[Douglas DC-8]]-54 series. The DC-8 was in early [[KLM]] stripes livery and is today very sought after. It was subsequently re-issued with an updated KLM decal sheet.
One of the most pleasing box arts was completed for the [[De Havilland]] [[De Havilland Comet|DH106 Comet 4]] airliner, depicted departing from [[Hong Kong]] [[Kai Tak airport]]. Full [[BOAC]] decals are included. The [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|SE210 Caravelle]] was also released in this era. Then the [[Boeing 727-100]] got the Plasticart treatment with good box art in [[Pan-Am]] colours. Plasticart then added the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] and the [[Dassault Mercure]] of French airline [[Air Inter]].

Later models, such as the 1/72 scale [[Junkers G 24|Junkers G23/24]] tri-motor corrugated aluminium airliner were detailed and well moulded. Western fighter jets also made an appearance with the introduction of the delta-wing [[Saab Draken]] in 1/100 to complement the MiG-21. Along with the aircraft and helicopter kits, VEB Plasticart also produced a model of the first manned spaceship Vostok 3KA (1/25) and the Soviet [[Energia]] rocket with Buran (1/288). The Vostok kit is almost the same size as [[Revell]]'s Vostok, and the box artwork is also very similar, but the two are completely different. Revell's Vostok is actually 1/24 scale and it was initially released in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Revell Catalog 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Turtle''' (also referred to as the '''Cosmic Turtle''' or the '''World-bearing Turtle''') is a [[mytheme]] of a giant [[turtle]] (or [[tortoise]]) supporting or containing the world. The mytheme, which is similar to that of the [[World Elephant]] and [[Jörmungandr|World Serpent]], occurs in [[Hindu mythology]], [[Chinese mythology]] and the [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The "World-Tortoise" mytheme was discussed [[comparative mythology|comparatively]] by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1878:341).

The World Turtle in Hindu mythology is known as ''Akupāra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अकूपार), or sometimes ''Chukwa''. An example of a reference to the World Turtle in Hindu literature is found in [[Jñānarāja]] (the author of ''Siddhāntasundara'', writing c. 1500): "A vulture, which has only little strength, rests in the sky holding a snake in its beak for a prahara [three hours]. Why can [the deity] in the form of a tortoise, who possesses an inconceivable potency, not hold the Earth in the sky for a ''[[Kalpa (aeon)#Hinduism|kalpa]]'' [billions of years]?"&lt;ref&gt;Toke L. Knudsen, [http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1004&amp;L=indology&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;F=PP&amp;P=1612 Indology mailing list].

&lt;/ref&gt;
The British philosopher [[John Locke]] made reference to this in his 1689 tract, ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', which compares one who would say that properties inhere in "substance" to the Indian, who said the world was on an elephant, which was on a tortoise, "but being again pressed to know what gave support to the broad-backed tortoise, replied—something, he knew not what".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', Book II, Chapter XXIII, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'' lists, without citation, ''Maha-pudma and Chukwa'' as names from a "popular rendition of a Hindu myth in which the tortoise Chukwa supports the elephant Maha-pudma, which in turn supports the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]], 15th ed., revised by Adrian Room, HarperCollins (1995), p. 1087. also 14th ed.

In Chinese mythology, the creator goddess [[Nüwa]] cut the legs off the giant sea turtle [[Ao (turtle)|Ao]] ({{zh|c=鳌|p=áo}}) and used them to prop up the sky after [[Gong Gong]] damaged [[Mount Buzhou]], which had previously supported the heavens.&lt;ref name="YangAn2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Lihui|last2=An|first2=Deming|author3=Jessica Anderson Turner|title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUwTxocaOGsC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533263-6|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lenape mythology|Lenape]] myth of the "Great Turtle" was first recorded between 1678 and 1680 by [[Jasper Danckaerts]]. The myth is shared by other [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]], notably the [[Iroquois mythology|Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2800081 Why the World is on the Back of a Turtle] - Miller, Jay; ''Man'', Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, New Series, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Jun., 1974), pp. 306–308, including further references within the cited text)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Jesuit Relations]]'' contain a [[Huron mythology|Huron]] story concerning the World Turtle:

'When the Father was explaining to them [some Huron seminarists] some circumstance of the passion of our Lord, and speaking to them of the eclipse of the Sun, and of the trembling of the earth which was felt at that time, they replied that there was talk in their own country of a great earthquake which had happened in former times; but they did not know either the time or the cause of that disturbance. "There is still talk," (said they) "of a very remarkable darkening of the Sun, which was supposed to have happened because the great turtle which upholds the earth, in changing its position or place, brought its shell before the Sun, and thus deprived the world of sight."'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_12.html|title=Front Page|date=11 August 2014|website=puffin.creighton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
