The '''2014 Medina hotel fire''' was a hotel fire that occurred in a hotel in [[Medina, Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dhabi|first=Abu|title=Fifteen pilgrims die in Saudi Arabia hotel fire: report|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/08/us-saudi-fire-idUSBREA170OP20140208|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire killed at least 15 people and another 130 were wounded.

==History==
Around seven hundred pilgrims from different countries were staying at the hotel in Medina to perform the [[Umrah]]. An electrical short circuit caused a fire to break out in the hotel. According to a local government statement the fire was first reported at 6:30 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]], and the blaze was contained by 9:00 pm ET.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/08/world/meast/saudi-arabia-fire/index.html|title=At least 15 killed in hotel fire in Saudi Arabian city of Medina - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Mohammed Jamjoom and Greg Botelho,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen Egyptian pilgrims were killed and one hundred and thirty other pilgrims were injured as a result of the fire. Preliminary indications suggested that those who were killed died of [[Asphyxia|suffocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-arabia-fire-at-medina-hotel-kills-15/|title=Saudi Arabia: Fire at Medina hotel kills 15|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian consul general in the city of [[Jeddah|Jiddah]], told reporters that most of the injured were Egyptians and that two children were among the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fire-at-medina-hotel-in-saudi-arabia-kills-15-injures-130-550209|title=Fire at Medina hotel in Saudi Arabia kills 15, injures 130|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took the rescue teams around two hours to put out the fire completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At least 15 pilgrims killed in Saudi Arabia hotel fire|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26105944|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AIR Worldwide''' is an American risk modeling and data analytics company headquartered in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], with customers in insurance, reinsurance, financial services, and government markets. AIR specializes in [[catastrophe modeling|catastrophe modeling software]] and services to manage the probability of loss from natural catastrophes, terrorism, pandemics, casualty catastrophes, and cyber incidents. It is led by current President Bill Churney and operates nine offices internationally.

==History==
Karen Clark, the developer of the first commercial hurricane catastrophe model, founded Applied Insurance Research in 1987, with CATMAP as its first product introduced later that same year. &lt;ref&gt;"Catastrophe Modeling Pioneer Clark Advises on Insurers' Best Practices", Insurance Journal, November 6, 2007. Accessed April 19, 2018 [https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2007/11/06/84787.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; CATMAP provided a catastrophe loss analysis system for treaty insurers and reinsurers in particular. &lt;ref&gt;"The AIR Hurricane Model", State Board of Administration of Florida, January 2006. Accessed April 18, 2018. [https://www.sbafla.com/method/portals/methodology/modelsubmissions/2006/2006_air_fchlpm_2006_standards_%20revised_20070418_no_track.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In late August of 1992, AIR published results from its U.S. Hurricane Model that estimated insured losses for Hurricane Andrew's landfall in southern Florida could come to surpass USD 13 billion. The estimate, which was met with skepticism at the time, was later validated by insurance claims and renewed interest in catastrophe modeling for estimating risk due to extreme events "almost overnight."  Over ten major insurance companies faced insolvency as a result of Hurricane Andrew alone. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Eric J., "Smith: Private insurance industry ready to step up on flood protection", Houston Chronicle, March 11, 2018. Accessed April 16, 2018. [https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Smith-Private-insurance-industry-ready-to-step-12744659.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied Insurance Research was privately held until it was acquired by [[Verisk Analytics| ISO]] in 2002 and renamed AIR Worldwide Corp. &lt;ref&gt;"ISO ACQUIRES AIR TO DELIVER NEW DECISION-MAKING TOOLS AS INSURERS AND REINSURERS FACE INCREASING EXTREME-EVENT RISK", Verisk Analytics, May 14, 2002. Accessed April 11, 2018. [https://www.verisk.com/archived/2002/iso-acquires-air-to-deliver-new-decision-making-tools-as-insurers-and-reinsurers-face-increasing-ext/]&lt;/ref&gt; Analyze Re, a software analytics provider for the reinsurance and insurance industries, became a part of AIR's operational domain in 2016, and then Arium, a company specializing in liability risk modeling, followed in 2017. &lt;ref&gt;"Verisk Analytics Buys Canadian Real-Time Analytics Firm Analyze Re", Insurance Journal, October 24, 2016. Accessed April 16, 2018. [https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2016/10/24/430233.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Verisk Analytics Acquires Arium For Casualty Risk Modeling", Seeking Alpha, January 17, 2017. Accessed April 16, 2018. [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4038822-verisk-analytics-acquires-arium-casualty-risk-modeling]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
AIR Worldwide developed Touchstone, a risk management platform intended to provide companies with assessments of their estimated exposure to loss from extreme events. Results are used in pricing, underwriting, and risk management. AIR released its fifth version of the Touchstone platform in 2017. Touchstone Re, a separate application for assessing the risk to reinsurance portfolios, industry loss warranties, and insurance-linked securities, has been announced for August 2018. &lt;ref&gt;"Touchstone Re - AIR Worldwide", AIR Worldwide, March 23, 2018. Accessed May 10, 2018. [https://www.air-worldwide.com/Software-Solutions/Touchstone-Re/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The company received the 2016 Data Analytics Project of the Year/ The Bedrock Award from Digital Insurance Awards &lt;ref&gt;"Post Digital Insurance Awards 2016", PostEvents, November 23, 2016. Accessed April 12, 2018. [http://www.postevents.co.uk/insurtechawards/static/winners]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Risk Modeler of the Year in 2017 from Reactions. &lt;ref&gt;"Reactions unveils North America winners!", Reactions, September 29, 2017. Accessed April 12, 2018. [https://reactionsnet.com/articles/3590586/reactions-unveils-north-america-winners-]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11976">The  '''Anniversary Days Observance Act''' (22 Vict. c. 2; formal [[long title]] '''An Act to repeal certain Acts and Parts of Acts which relate to the Observance of the Thirtieth of January and other Days''') was an [[Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which repealed several laws mandating "political services" or "state services": observance by the [[Church of England]] and [[Church of Ireland]] of certain anniversaries from [[17th century England|17th-century political history]].

==Provisions==
The laws and observances abolished were specified by various Acts of the [[Parliament of England]], [[Parliament of Great Britain]], or [[Parliament of Ireland]]. These acts were repealed in full where they had no other purpose than establishing the relevant observance, and otherwise repealed only in relation to the observance.

==Legislative history==
The political and religious aspects of Anglican identity began to separate after [[Catholic emancipation]] culminated in the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacey 2003, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, moves to increased [[religious toleration]] included the [[Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855]] and the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]]. These changes were reflected in June and July 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prior|first=David|date=July 2005|title=Remember, Remember, the Fifth of November|journal=History Today |quote=In 1859, in an atmosphere of growing religious toleration, the 1606 Act was abolished.|volume=55|issue=7|pages=4–5|url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-prior/remember-remember-fifth-november|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[House of Lords]] and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] respectively passed [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s making [[loyal address]]es to [[Queen Victoria]] to remove certain "occasional forms of prayer" from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].&lt;ref name="hl_motion1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1858/jun/28/motion-for-address  |work=Hansard |title=Political services of the Church of England.

Second reading. |page=HC Deb vol 152 cc148-50 |nopp=Y |date=7 February 1859  |accessdate=5 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the 1858 petitions had related only to observances in the English Book of Common Prayer, the 1859 bill additionally deleted the 23 October prayer from the Irish Book of Common Prayer.&lt;ref name="hc_bill1"/&gt; In the House of Lords the bill was renamed the ''Anniversary Days Observance Bill''.&lt;ref name="hl_bill2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1859/feb/25/second-reading|title=Occasional forms of prayer bill.

The 1859 act was itself repealed as [[spent enactment|spent]] by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1875]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1875/act/66/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Statute Law Revision Act 1875 [38 &amp; 39 Vict c 66]|date=11 August 1875|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Schedule |nopp=Y|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In the House of Lords, the 1858 resolution was supported by most bishops;&lt;ref name="hc_motion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lacey 2003, pp.244–245&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and bishops [[Bishop of London|of London]], [[Bishop of Oxford|of Oxford]], and [[Bishop of Cashel and Waterford|of Cashel]] spoke in favour, while the [[Bishop of Bangor]] opposed it.&lt;ref name="hl_motion2"/&gt; The [[Anglo-Catholic]] liturgist [[Vernon Staley]] in 1907 described the deletions as ''[[ultra vires]]''&lt;ref&gt;Staley 1907, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; because they were done without first obtaining the consent of the [[Convocations of Canterbury and York]]; he called them "a distinct violation of the compact between Church and Realm, as set forth in the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] which imposed the Book of Common Prayer in 1662".&lt;ref&gt;Staley 1907, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Stump Music and Arts Festival''' (called 'Black Stump,' 'Black Stump Festival' or just 'Stump' for short) was a four-day [[Christian]] festival that is held in the Greater [[Sydney]] Metropolitan region over the [[Labour Day]] [[long weekend]], often the first weekend in October, from 1985 to 2014.

==Features==
Although the format of the festival changed slightly from year to year, there were some constant features including:

'''Main Stage''' (called '''Big Top''' 1995-2006, 2011-) - the primary venue used for Saturday morning, Sunday night and Monday Morning Bible Studies, Worship &amp; Music. During the nights it is the venue used for headline and international acts.

'''Fools Theatre''' (formerly '''Off Broadway''')  - interaction and comedy venue.

'''Sacred Space''' - [[Alternative worship]]. 
 
'''The Village''' - food and service venues and addition performance space.

'''The Supper Club''' - small stage for music with cafe style tables and food.

'''Metro''' - primary Rock venue

==History==
Black Stump was held annually since 1985 with the exception of four years: 1987, 1995, 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Cusic 175"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Cusic (ed.)|first1=Don|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music: Pop, Rock, and Worship|place= |publisher=Greenwood Publishing|page=175|year = 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3jqjSKHKcwC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=%22Black+Stump%22+festival+Sydney&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HyNcUuy9OeG_0QWKnIHQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Black%20Stump%22%20festival%20Sydney&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-313-34426-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of its existence Black Stump has been held at Cataract Scout Park, [[Appin]] NSW, [[Australia]] and before that at [[Cattai]].

===Early history===
The first festival was held to coincide with [[International Youth Year]] and was inspired by Pebblebrook in New Zealand and the [[Greenbelt Festival]] in the UK. It was organised by individuals from [[Baptist]], [[Church of Christ]], [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting]] and [[Anglican]] churches as well as other youth orientated Christian organizations.

The first and second festivals were held in 1985 and 1986 at [[Cattai]]&lt;ref name="Cusic 175" /&gt; (at the former Paradise Gardens site).

From 1988 it was then held at Cataract Scout Park until 2007.

===Gap years===
The festival was not held in 1987 in order to plan to make it a regular festival, and to plan the relocation to Cataract Scout Park.

The intended 1995 festival was cancelled due to a significant financial shortfall resulting from the 1994 festival.

The festival was not held in 2000 because the Sydney Olympics ended on the October Long weekend.

The festival was not held in 2010 due to projected ticket sales being too low to meet increasing operating costs at the venue.

===Equestrian Centre years===
In 2008, Black Stump moved to the [[Sydney International Equestrian Centre]] in [[Horsley Park]], due to ageing facilities at Cataract Scout Camp. From 2011 Black Stump returned to a rejuvenated Cataract Scout Park.

===Beyond Festival===
After the final Black Stump in 2014, some of its organizers went on to launch '''Beyond Festival'''. Considered the successor to Black Stump, but with an emphasis on promoting social justice from a Christian standpoint, Beyond Festival has been held at Greenhills Centre in [[Canberra]] on the Labour Day long weekend (first weekend in October) in 2015 and 2016. It was not held in 2017, with the next festival to take place at [[Kangaroo Valley, New South Wales]] on 23-25 November 2018.

==Notable performers==
Many artists have appeared at Black Stump and then gone onto wide popularity in the Christian or secular world. These include the [[Newsboys]], [[Rebecca St James]], [[David Butts]] ([[Hooley Dooleys]]), [[Tim Harding (musician)|Tim Harding]] ([[Hi-5 (Australian band)|Hi-5]]), [[Sarah Blasko]], [[Butterfly Boucher]] and [[Paul Colman]].&lt;ref name="Cusic 175" /&gt;

{{short description| A theoretical concept in resource allocation to explain economic decision-making }}
The '''Commonize Costs–Privatize Profits Game''' (or '''CC–PP Game''') is a concept developed by the [[ecologist]] [[Garrett Hardin]] to describe a "game" (in the [[game theory]] sense) widely played in matters of [[resource allocation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hardin, G. (1985). ''Filters Against Folly, How to Survive despite Economists, Ecologists, and the Merely Eloquent'', Viking Penguin, {{ISBN|0-670-80410-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is Hardin’s interpretation of the closely related phenomenon known as the [[tragedy of the commons]],&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, G. (1968).  The Tragedy of the Commons.  ''Science'' '''162''', 1243–1248. {{doi|10.1126/science.162.3859.1243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is referred to in political discourse as "privatizing profits and socializing losses."

The CC–PP Game originally appeared in Hardin’s book titled ''Filters against Folly: How To Survive Despite Economists, Ecologists, and the Merely Eloquent'' which was published in 1986.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Players of the CC–PP Game aim to [[Common ownership|commonize]] the costs (or [[externality|externalities]]) generated by their activities across the wider community, while privatizing all [[profit (economics)|profit]]s ([[Gain (finance)|financial]] or otherwise) to themselves. The individual does not broadcast that they are playing the game in order to continue profiting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hardin related the CC–PP Game to [[ecological]] problems such [[mining]], [[groundwater]] overdraft, cattle [[ranching]] and other actions that cause the depletion of [[natural resource]]s or an increase in [[pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26586955|title=Living within limits : ecology, economics, and population taboos|last=1915-2003.|first=Hardin, Garrett,|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195093852|location=New York|oclc=26586955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tragedy of the Commons and the CC–PP Game ==
The CC–PP Game is used to explain how individuals utilize [[public good]]s, specifically [[Scarcity|scarce]] [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loaiciga|first=Hugo|date=April 2004|title=Analytic game—theoretic approach to ground-water extraction|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2004.04.006|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume= 297, Iss. 1-4|pages=22–33|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goods include resources such as clean [[air]], [[river]]s, [[forest]]s and [[groundwater]]. These are [[public good]]s because they are both [[Excludability|non-excludable]] and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rival]]. It is very difficult to assign [[property rights]] to public goods, which results in many people using the resource and the resource's subsequent depletion or the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hardin uses the original conception of the commons as a "village pasture used for grazing sheep or cattle in [[preindustrial]] [[England]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aram|first=John|date=April 1989|title=The Paradox Of Interdependent Relations In The Field Of Social Issues in Management|url=http://ccl.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ccl.idm.oclc.org/docview/210948824?accountid=10141|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume= 14, Iss. 2|pages=266–283|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pasture]] was a public space for any villager to use to grave their livestock. Villagers gained profit from each additional animal on the pasture, but did not have to pay the costs of the animals depleting the grass.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The village as a whole took on the cost of overgrazing the pasture. This represented the CC–PP Game for Hardin in which the [[incentive]] to create individual profit was greater than the cost of [[overgrazing]] the field since it was spread out between many individuals.

In a more modern example of the CC–PP Game, Hardin attributes the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahel]] desert to "unmanaged access and overuse."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

John D. Aram summarized the tragedy of the commons and the CC–PP Game stating, “Tragic macro effects result from a structure of micro incentives that allows unmanaged access to a fixed resource.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Game Theory and the CC–PP Game ==
[[File:CC-PP Game.png|thumb|364x364px|Pay-off matrix for water extraction in CC-PP Game]]
The CC–PP Game is an example of a non-cooperative equilibrium or [[Nash equilibrium|Nash Equilibrium]] in which the parties in the game do not cooperate and are incentivized to deplete natural resources, resulting in an [[Inefficient markets|inefficient]] outcome.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The CC–PP Game refers to the market for a [[Scarcity|scarce]] natural resource, for example groundwater. Groundwater is scarce because it can be extracted from the ground at a much higher rate than it can be replenished naturally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, clean groundwater in many areas is limited. Groundwater is a natural resource that can be difficult to assign property rights to and is needed by all individuals.

Private firms as well as everyday consumers will extract groundwater for their own use. Private firms gain profits from using the water to produce a good or directly selling the water. Individual consumers gain [[utility]] or satisfaction from drinking the water or using it in their homes. Both the private firm and the individual have an incentive to take water from the ground and receive a gain in utility from taking that water (privatized profits).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The water supply is diminished, resulting in a tragedy of the commons and a loss of utility for everyone that uses the groundwater (communized costs).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since an individual user does not have to pay for the cost of water depletion, but is still gaining the utility or profit from using the water, the individual will continue to use the water. Every individual will come to this same conclusion and the natural resource will be depleted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This can be seen in a [[Payoff Matrix|pay-off matrix]]. Where there are two individuals making separate choices to defect by [[Privatization|privatizing]] benefits and commonizing costs, or to cooperate and refrain from personal gain in order to preserve a resource. If Individual A decides to preserve water while Individual B does not then Individual A will only receive $20 while Individual B gains $80. This is true vice versa if Individual B decides to preserve water and Individual A decides to extract. Both individuals have an incentive to defect and extract water to gain $50, so as rational consumers they will extract water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, if neither party extracted water then they would actually gain $50 more in profit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a case of the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner’s Dilemma]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, unlike the Prisoner’s Dilemma that only has two people, CC–PP Game is an aggregate of many individuals, making it harder to see the effects of a single person’s decisions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Real Life Examples ==

==== Fisheries ====
[[Fishery|Fisheries]] are a prime example of the CC–PP Game. Companies gain a profit for every fish that they catch and are incentivized to continue catching fish. However, their overfishing depletes the amount of fish in the ocean, hurting the environment and other individuals. All individuals pay for the cost of a decrease in the amount of fish.

==== Mining ====
[[Mining]] companies participate in the CC–PP Game by depleting their worker’s health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hardin argues that the owners of mining companies profit from their workers, while workers suffer the negative health effects of mining such as [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] damage, chronic [[lead poisoning]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease,]] and poisoning by [[Radon|radon gas]] in [[Uranium mining|uranium mines]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hardin states, "Until the development of nationalized schemes of compensation in the twentieth century the costs of deteriorated health were "paid" by the miner himself, partly in medical bills but even more in reduced capacity to work and enjoy life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Intangible Assets ====
Hardin also included "intangible assets" such as “worker safety, stabilizing the cost of healthcare, and economic efficiency" as instances of tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These assets can also deteriorate if individuals choose to privatize benefits and communize costs.

== Policy Applications ==
Hardin proposed several solutions to the CC–PP Game in his books and essays.

In Hardin’s early works, he expressed his belief that they only way to protect natural resources was by limiting individual’s [[Political freedom|freedoms]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He stated that preserving the commons would only be possible by “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Today, this would be considered [[command and control regulation]]. Hardin believed that individuals needed regulation or systems in place to force them to stop depleting resources. He rejected the option of people volunteering to not ruin common goods because of individual's lack of will power and lack of incentives to limit themselves. He believed that voluntary self-restraint was not a solution to avoiding the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However later in his career, Hardin argued that a strict individual responsibility could preserve the commons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He described systems of accountability for policy makers in order to preserve the commons for their constituents. This puts the responsibility for preserving the commons onto the [[political system]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ideally Hardin wanted all costs and benefits to be privatized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; John D. Aram argues that Hardin would be in favor of a [[flat tax]] structure and elimination of public [[Subsidy|subsidies]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Cheddikulam massacre''' was a massacre of [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] civilians in the village of [[Cheddikulam]], located on the border of the [[Vavuniya District|Vavuniya]] and [[Mannar District|Mannar]] districts. It was among the first of the series of massacres carried out by the [[Sri Lankan armed forces]] during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|country's Civil War]].&lt;ref name="NESHOR"&gt;{{cite book| last =| first =| authorlink = NESHOR| title = Massacres of Tamils(1956-2008)| publisher = Manitham Publications| series =| volume = | edition = | location = Chennai| date = 2009| page = 15| doi =| isbn = 978-81-909737-0-0 | mr =| zbl =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COV"/&gt;

==Massacre==
On December 2, 1984, the Sri Lankan military imposed a curfew throughout [[Cheddikulam]] and the adjoining villages and towns. The military began cordoning off the village at 5.30 a.m. Most of the its inhabitants were still asleep, when armed personnel entered the village and took away the males of the village for 'inquiries'.&lt;ref name="COV"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7F-dUh5_j8C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=cheddikulam+massacre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0rkBiCVP6d&amp;sig=7GngqakwFPust8jxyvAeeu2STGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tMyJUoCDDsizrAfqi4CgCA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=cheddikulam%20massacre&amp;f=false | title=Cycles of Violence: Human Rights in Sri Lanka Since the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement | publisher=Asia Watch Committee | accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

52 men were reportedly bundled into military vehicles, and taken to the [[Anuradhapura District]] and killed. The locals allege that the 52 men were taken to a Sinhalese settlement near [[Medawachchiya]], and were chopped up with sharp knives and later heavy vehicles were run over them. As a result, the villagers say all the 52 men died.&lt;ref name="NESHOR"/&gt;

===Witness Accounts===
T Yesuthasan, teacher at Cheddikulam Mahavidyalayam, says,&lt;ref name="NESHOR"/&gt;
{{quote|Following the incident people displaced to Vanni, [[Madhu, Sri Lanka|Madhu]] and [[India]]. Among the 52 people killed were my younger brother, my brother-in-law and two more people in our family.}}

'''Classical reenactment''' tends to focus on portrayals of the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]], and especially on modern recreations of [[Roman legion]]s and ancient Greek [[hoplite]]s.

==Roman reenactment==
[[Image:Wells 0706 054.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Reenacters portraying 1st-2nd century AD Roman legionaries]]
Most groups that concentrate on Roman reenacting focus on one particular Roman legion; nearly all of the legions portrayed actually existed historically, and the reenactors strive to recreate the legion as accurately as possible.  This attention to realism generally extends to the [[:Category:Ancient Roman legionary equipment|equipment]] worn and displayed, and to behavior displayed to each other and especially to the public; indeed, many public demonstrations attempt to recreate Roman military drills, marches, and even stage [[combat reenactment|mock battles]].

Roman reenactment groups usually welcome women and children, in an effort to both accommodate entire families and to portray Roman civilian life.  Additionally, it is not unknown for older male reenactors (who might have previously played [[Roman legionary|Roman legionaries]]) to portray [[consul]]s, [[Roman Senate|senators]], or even a [[Roman emperor]].   

The Roman Army did not remain static and, whilst sometimes demonstrating these changes in displays of the evolving equipment and appearance of the legionary, most groups also focus on a particular time period. The most popular period is probably the 1st-2nd century, with legionaries wearing the characteristic segmented armour illustrated on [[Trajan's Column]].  However, some groups portray the [[Roman legion#Late Empire|Late Roman legion]], after the army reforms of [[Diocletian]].
A minority of groups depict the eastern continuance of the empire after the fall of Rome in the west, known popularly as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Roman reenacting is popular in both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

===Roman gladiator reenactment===

A smaller subset of Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman [[gladiator]] troupes.  Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general.  These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.

== Ancient Greek reenactment ==

[[Image:Therm2007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Reenacters portraying 5th century BC Greek hoplites]]
Greek reenacting groups concentrate mostly on classical era [[hoplite]]s, though the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]], [[Hellenistic]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] eras are becoming popular as well. Most reenactors focus on Greek hoplites and tend to depict the [[classical antiquity|classical]] era, particularly the period around the [[Peloponnesian war]]s, but accurate depictions of Greeks in the earlier [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] and other eras has becoming increasingly more common, especially the era of Persian War and reenactments of the [[Macedonian phalanx]]. Aside from groups, there are also individuals who sometimes reenact the heroes of [[ancient Greece]].

International conventions are now being held, with the first being in Watford, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the summer of 2006.

Some groups stage [[combat reenactment|mock battles]] such as the [http://www.spartanwarband.com/ Spartan warband] that equips its members with durable [[aspis]] and other period equipment, reenacting [[Phalanx formation]] tactics to their fullest extent by depicting two hoplite squads of reenactors clashing with each other. The [[Spartan Army]] is very popular as a theme, as can be evidenced by the group called [http://300spartanwarriors.com/ The Hellenic Warriors], who appear at museums, schools, and universities on the east coast of the United States.

Greek reenacting is popular in the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]] and whose members from around the world will gather at the [http://www.300spartanwarriors.com/ 2010 International Ancient Greek Hoplite Festival].

== Celtic reenactment ==

Continenal and insular [[Celts]] and [[Gauls]] are the subjects of some reenacting groups, with a focus on anything from tribal warfare to even domestic re-enactment of Pre-Roman Celtic societies. Many specific tribes are being re-enacted, as are important events such as battles and festivals. Typically, Celtic groups are sister groups to a Roman legion, and are sometimes created originally to portray the Roman invasion of [[Gaul]] under [[Julius Caesar]].

'''Control fraud''' occurs when a trusted person in a high position of responsibility in a [[company]], [[corporation]], or [[state (polity)|state]] subverts the organization and engages in extensive [[fraud]] for personal gain.  The term "control fraud" was coined by [[William K. Black]] to refer both to the acts of fraud and to the individuals who commit them.

==Concept==
The concept of control fraud is based on the observation that the CEO of a company is uniquely placed to remove the checks and balances on fraud within a company such as through the use of selective hiring and firing. These tactics can position the executive in a way that allows him or her to engage in accountancy fraud and embezzle money, hide shortfalls or otherwise defraud investors, shareholders, or the public at large.  A control fraud will often obtain "investments that have no readily ascertainable market value",&lt;ref&gt;Black (2005, p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; and then shop for appraisers that will assign unrealistically high values and auditing firms that will bless the fraudulent accounting statements.&lt;ref&gt;Black(2005, pp. 51, 251, 253)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some control frauds are reactive in the sense that they turn to fraud only after concluding that the business will fail.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2005, pp. 5, 7, 8, 60, 282)&lt;/ref&gt;  Opportunistic control frauds, by contrast, are attracted to a criminogenic environment where it is harder to detect fraud, e.g., as a result of [[deregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Black (2005, pp. 5, 7, 8, 11, 37-38, 61)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example would be when an insolvent company publishes accounts showing massive profits. This will cause the stock to rise beyond its actual value, and those exercising the control fraud will cash in their stocks before the reality is known by others.&lt;ref&gt;Black (2005) 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=SI3F8wEuT24C&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=UjO33n9Tof&amp;dq=Control%20fraud%20theory&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=Control%20fraud%20theory&amp;f=false The best way to rob a bank is to own one]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, companies can lobby for changes to weaken the law or accompanying regulation.  This can be particularly effective with large campaign contributors like [[Charles Keating]], who with other control frauds in the United States League of Savings Institutions, was able to get his own people placed on the board of the primary regulatory agency, the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB).  With the assistance of people like Speaker of the House [[Jim Wright]] and the [[Keating Five]], he was able to convert [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association]] into a [[Ponzi scheme]], making millions for himself, while suppressing the investigative and regulatory functions of the FHLBB.  Eventually, the Ponzi collapsed, as all Ponzis must, but with a massive cost to the taxpayers and unsecured investors.  

Control fraud can also occur in a political situation, for example by the leader of a country who can use their position to embezzle public funds and turn the country into a [[kleptocracy]].

Examples of control fraud include [[Enron]], the [[savings and loan crisis]], and [[Ponzi scheme]]s such as that of [[Bernard Madoff]].

'''Credit card hijacking''' is a form of [[credit card fraud]] and the term is used when a person’s [[credit card]] is used by an unauthorized person (e.g. a thief or overaggressive vendor) to buy goods or services.  The credit card owner usually has trouble reasserting control over the card, because usually he or she doesn't find out immediately, and the owner must distinguish legitimate purchases from illegitimate in a credible manner.

==Identity theft==
The first form of credit card hijacking is basically [[identity theft]], which is the deliberate use of another person's [[Personally identifiable information|identity]].  Identity theft is usually the result of serious breaches of [[privacy]] and often involves the victim compromising a great deal of [[financial]] and personal information&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre30.shtm FTC - ID Theft, whats it all about?]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the thief to charge an existing credit card account or open up new credit card accounts in the name of the victim. Methods of identity theft for credit card hijacking have involved mail interception or skimming of credit card data. The growth of online subscriptions and transactions have also brought along a variety of different [[phishing]] and the use of [[spyware]] and [[botnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threatmetrix.com/fraud-control-device-fingerprint/resources/article-identity_theft/identity_theft.html Identity Theft Defeats Credit Card Authorization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924071410/http://www.threatmetrix.com/fraud-control-device-fingerprint/resources/article-identity_theft/identity_theft.html |date=2008-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods Used==
Radio-frequency identification [[RFID]] uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. There have been several demonstrations on how credit card fraud can committed through RFID scanners. Although the possibility of credit fraud using an RFID scanner is rare, it is possible for it to happen. There are more occurrences with credit card fraud that happen through PoS or [[point of sale]] that has been compromised with malware. The malware is typically installed by someone who hacks into the system from another location &lt;ref&gt;[https://usa.visa.com/support/small-business/fraud-protection.html?ep=v_sym_cisp]&lt;/ref&gt; if not always, installed through hacking by. Another well known tactic for credit card fraud is the placement of skimmers on an ATM by the person or persons committing the credit fraud. &lt;ref&gt;[https://money.howstuffworks.com/atm-skimming.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cancellation barrier==
Another form of credit card hijacking is the continued charging of a person’s credit card for a [[subscription]] to goods or [[Service (economics)|services]] no longer desired by the credit card owner. This type of credit card hijacking was pioneered by major [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], credit monitoring services and [[online dating]] services, are perfectly [[legal]], and are still common today in a wide range of subscription based goods and services. Credit card hijacking of this type came about as online subscription based [[marketers]] realized that traditional subscription systems, such as the annual subscriptions that paper [[magazines]] use, were an impediment to enrolling customers. For instance, a subscription that is US$24.95 per month, is US$299.40 annually. By breaking the subscription period into small units like months or quarters, and allowing direct monthly charging of the subscriber’s credit card, the psychological and economic conflicts subscribers see are greatly reduced. 

The issue which makes one subscription system a hijacking of the credit card is not how often it's billed, but the organization creating barriers that make it more difficult for subscriptions to be cancelled. Organizations which use credit card hijacking as part of their marketing strategy make online registration for the subscription easy, enforce default automatic renewal policies. In comparison to traditional subscription based system such as paper magazines where the subscriber has to periodically proactively reauthorize the subscription. Instead of an automatic renewal. The most common subscription exit barrier is to not provide any online subscription cancellation mechanism at all, but to instead require the user to cancel by telephone or by "on-line chats". Such organizations often add the additional barrier of making any subscription cancellation information difficult for the user to even find, thus creating an additional delay in the subscription cancellation. This is very common with internet service providers, who know the psychological barrier to making the call, which the subscriber anticipates will be unpleasant, is very high. It also allows the marketing organization to talk the subscriber into changing their minds and not cancelling the subscription. Another common subscription cancellation barrier is to have a relatively long subscription period, a no refund policy, and to require the user upon cancellation to forfeit all money covering the present subscription period. This is very common with [[online dating]] services. 

This second form of credit card hijacking was created by marketers who recognized that subscription based services generally have relatively low periodic billing amounts which will generally go unnoticed on any given credit card statement. So what happens is that long after the user loses interest in the subscription, they forget to cancel the subscription and because the periodic billing is so low, they don’t tend to notice it on their credit card statement.

A simple solution to this problem is to call the credit card company, request a new card with a different account number, and cancel the previous account.  They will transfer the debt amount from the old account to the new account. This makes companies that have the credit card information unable to continue charging the credit card of the person. 

==Negative option billing==
[[Negative option billing]] is the practice of sending goods automatically and billing the recipient unless the recipient is proactive in declining the goods before they are sent. Negative option billing reverses the usual direction of sales transactions. It assumes that unless you say 'no', you've agreed to have bought the goods. This is the common practice used in book clubs, record clubs, and magazine subscriptions with automatic renewal. Some practitioners of negative option billing prefer to call it "advance consent marketing".

==Billing for membership rather than services==
If a customer cancels services provided by a vendor, the vender would be committing fraud if they bill for services not provided (for example internet access).  Some venders avoid this problem by billing monthly for a "membership", even though no services are used by the former customer.  By retaining the membership number in an active status, the vendor makes it difficult for the customer to prove that the membership was cancelled. This is a form of credit card fraud that is not often regarded as such.

===''Beauty and the Beast''===
{{main|Beauty and the Beast (musical)}}
The show began previews in New York City on March 9, 1994 and officially opened at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] on April 18, 1994.

'''''Dr. Freud Will See You Now, Mrs. Hitler''''' is an [[alternate history]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy]] writing duo [[Laurence Marks (British writer)|Laurence Marks]] and [[Maurice Gran]].&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;Andrew Billen [http://www.newstatesman.com/200704090044 "Now, lie down on this couch"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 9 April 2007. Retrieved on 26 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play is an "alternate history" dramatisation based on reports that [[Adolf Hitler]], then aged 6, was referred to [[Sigmund Freud]] for therapy at the latter's pædiatric psychotherapy clinic in [[Vienna]], but did not go to meet him; the [[point of divergence]] is that this meeting went ahead.

The play was broadcast on 31 March 2007 in cut-down form by the [[BBC]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as part of ''[[The Saturday Play]]''.&lt;ref name="CNJ"&gt;[http://www.thecnj.com/review/051007/feat051007_02.html?headline=Writers_give_the_little_Hitler_a_Freudian_trip "Writers give the little Hitler a Freudian trip"], ''Camden New Journal'', 10 May 2007.

The '''Ebor Festival''' is a four-day race meeting held at [[York Racecourse]] in [[York]], England, each August. The 2017 Ebor Festival is due to take place from 23 to 26 August&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkracecourse.co.uk/racing-fixtures.html|title=2017 Fixtures &amp; Pricing|website=www.yorkracecourse.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Ebor festival was established in 1843 with the first running of the Ebor Handicap.

Each of the four days has feature races:

*Wednesday is called Juddmonte International Day and features the [[International Stakes|Juddmonte International]], the [[Great Voltigeur Stakes]] and the [[Acomb Stakes]].
*Thursday is Ladies' Day and features the [[Lowther Stakes]] and the [[Yorkshire Oaks]].
*Friday is Nunthorpe Day and features the [[Nunthorpe Stakes]], the [[Gimcrack Stakes]] and the [[Strensall Stakes]].
*Saturday is Ebor Day and features the [[Ebor Handicap]] and the [[Lonsdale Cup]].

The 2008 Ebor Festival was abandoned after wet weather left the course waterlogged and unfit for racing. It was the first time in the event's history that the entire card had to be scrapped due to bad weather.

As one of the last major race meetings of the [[flat racing|flat season]], it attracts racegoers from all over the UK and overseas.

'''Factitious diarrhea''' is a condition in which a person deliberately produces [[diarrhea]], most commonly by surreptitious [[laxative]] abuse. 

These people tend to have persistent and unexplained watery diarrhea that is high in volume and frequency and, despite extensive evaluation, the cause may remain unknown. Many cases may mimic [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[malabsorption syndromes]].&lt;ref&gt;Oster JR, Materson BJ, Rogers AI.

:''For the Spoleto Festival USA, see [[Spoleto Festival USA]] and for the Spoleto Festival Melbourne see [[Melbourne International Arts Festival]]''.

The '''''Festival dei Due Mondi''''' '''(Festival of the Two Worlds)''' is an annual summer music and [[opera]] festival held each June to early July in [[Spoleto]], Italy, since its founding by composer [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] in 1958. It features a vast array of concerts, opera, dance, drama, visual arts and roundtable discussions on science.

The "Two Worlds" in the name of the festival comes from Gian Carlo Menotti's intention to have the worlds of American and European culture facing each other in his event; this concept would then be strengthened by the fact that it was held in conjunction with its "twin", the [[Spoleto Festival USA]] held annually in May/June in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. That twinning lasted some 15 years and, after growing disputes between the Menotti family and the board of Spoleto Festival USA, in the early 1990s a separation occurred. Under Menotti's direction in 1986, a third installment in the Spoleto Festival series was held in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Melbourne's Spoleto Festival changed its name to the [[Melbourne International Arts Festival|Melbourne International Festival of the Arts]] in 1990.

Following Menotti's death in 2007, changes occurred in the administration with the result that the Italian Minister of Cultural Affairs appointed a new Artistic Administrator who continues to run the Festival.

==The Italian Festival's location and activities==
Because Spoleto was a small town, where real estate and other goods and services were at the time relatively inexpensive, and also because there are two indoor theatres, a Roman theatre, and many other spaces, it was chosen by Menotti as the venue for an arts festival. It is also fairly close to Rome, with good rail connections.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Changes in administration==
Following Menotti's death in February 2007, the city administrations of Spoleto and Charleston started talks to re-unite the two festivals, which resulted in the Mayor of Spoleto, Massimo Brunini, attending the opening ceremony of Spoleto Festival USA in May 2008.

However, at the time of the 2007 Festival, the President and Artistic Director was Menotti's adopted son, [[Francis Menotti|Francis "Chip" Menotti]] and, in the fall of 2007, the Italian Minister of Cultural Affairs, [[Francesco Rutelli]]—after unsuccessful negotiations with Menotti—removed him from his position&lt;ref&gt;Wakin, ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and named Giorgio Ferrara new artistic director of the festival. This has resulted in continuing controversy between representatives of the "old" and "new" managements of the Festival, as exemplified by the maintenance of a website critical of the former management, which can be seen below.

'''Festival of Trees''' is the name taken by a number of (apparently independent) charity events/organizations that hold annual events around [[Christmas]] time to raise money for some local charity many for children hospitals and other organizations  (often, but not always, a hospital or more specifically, a children's hospital) These events seem to be becoming more common in North America as of this writing and are centered on the decoration and display of [[Christmas tree]]s.

The general outline of the event is as follows, although details may vary from location to location.
* Sponsors are obtained who agree to cover costs of advertising, hiring a hall or convention center, obtaining undecorated trees (or wreaths or other traditional holiday decorations) or the cost of a particular tree's decorations, producing a program, or covering other costs.
* Designers are engaged to decorate/design the trees. Often elaborate theming is employed. Sometimes clubs, schools or other organizations participate as well as professional designers.
* The hall is opened to the designers or organizations who decorate and arrange the trees.
* The hall is opened to the general public, often for an admission charge. The public may be able to bid or buy raffle tickets for the trees or other decorations, or for prizes also donated. (typically one of the event goals is to sell every tree that is on display)
* At some point there may be a [[black tie]] gala for contributors or supporters. Presentations about the charity supported are often made.
* The event usually gets a lot of local media attention before and during the public visitation period
* There may be other attractions such as children's play areas, craft areas, visits with Santa and so forth
* The event winds down and the purchasers of the trees pick them up or make arrange for delivery

Depending on the size of the municipality where the Festival of Trees is held, there may be several hundred trees of all sizes on display, and the amounts raised can be in the millions of USD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivaloftreesutah.org/factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Forgery Act 1830''' (11 Geo 4 &amp; 1 Will 4 c 66) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It consolidated into one Act all legislation imposing the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]] for [[forgery]] (except for counterfeiting coins). (It did not apply to Scotland or Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Section 29&lt;/ref&gt;) Two years later the death penalty was abolished for most of these offences,&lt;ref&gt;[[Forgery, Abolition of Punishment of Death Act 1832]]&lt;/ref&gt; and for the remaining offences in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forgery Act 1837]] (7 Will.4 &amp; 1. Vict. c.84)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==
The whole Act, except for section 21, was repealed on 1 November 1861 by section 1 of, and the Schedule to, the [[Criminal Statutes Repeal Act 1861|24 &amp; 25 Vict c 95]]. This Act was repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by sections 2 and 3 and Part 4 of [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0028/sched2.html#sched2 Schedule 2] to the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2007]].

==Section 2 - Forging the Great Seal, Privy Seal, Privy Signet, Royal Sign Manual etc, treason and capital==
This section replaced the corresponding provisions in the [[Treason Act 1351]] and the [[Treason Act 1553#Other treason legislation|1 Mary Stat 2 c 6]]. (This form of treason was reduced to [[felony]] when section 2 was replaced by the [[Forgery Act 1861]].)

==Section 21 - Rector etc not liable to any penalty for correcting, in the mode prescribed, accidental errors in the register==
This section read:

{{Blockquote|Provided always, and be it enacted, That no [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|Rector]], [[Vicar]], [[Curate]], or officiating Minister of any [[Parish]], [[District-Parish]], or [[Chapelry]], who shall discover any Error in the Form or Substance of the Entry in the Register of any Baptism, Marriage, or Burial respectively by him [[solemnized]], shall be liable to any of the Penalties herein mentioned if he shall within One Calendar Month after the Discovery of such Error, in the Presence of the Parent or Parents of the Child baptized, or of the Parties married, or in the Presence of Two Persons who shall have attended at any Burial, or in the Case of the Death or Absence of the respective Parties aforesaid, then in the Presence of the [[Churchwarden]]s or the [[Chapelwarden]]s, correct the Entry which shall have been found erroneous, according to the Truth of the Case, by Entry in the Margin of the Register wherein such erroneous Entry shall have been made, without any Alteration or Obliteration of the original Entry, and shall sign such Entry in the Margin, and add to such Signature the Day of the Month and Year when such Correction shall be made; and such Correction and Signature shall be attested by the Parties in whose Presence the same are directed to be made as aforesaid: Provided also, that in the Copy of the Register which shall be transmitted to the Registrar of the Diocese, the said Rector, Vicar, Curate or officiating Minister shall certify the Corrections so made by him as aforesaid.}} 

Nothing contained in the Act 24 &amp; 25 Vict c 95 in any manner altered or affected any power or authority given by this section to alter or amend any register of births, baptisms, marriages, deaths or burials.&lt;ref&gt;24 &amp; 25 Vict c 95, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMw0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false section 4]&lt;/ref&gt; This section was repealed by section 26(2) of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukcm/1978/2/schedule/4 Schedule 4] to, the [[Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978]] (No 2).

Altın Mikrofon was a milestone in Turkish music. Although Hürriyet gave up organizing the contest  after 1968, two other newspapers tried to continue: ''[[Günaydın (newspaper)|Günaydın]]'' in 1972 and Saklambaç in 1979. But these later contests unlike the earlier contests, didn’t attracted much attention and they too gave up.  The results of these were as follows:

'''''I Remember Mama''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]], lyrics by [[Martin Charnin]] and [[Raymond Jessel]], and music by [[Richard Rodgers]]. The musical ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1979.

==Origins==
''I Remember Mama'' originated as a [[memoir]] by [[Kathryn Forbes]] titled ''Mama's Bank Account''. It was adapted for the stage by [[John Van Druten]] as a [[I Remember Mama (play)|play]], which ran on Broadway from 1944 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1586 "I Remember Mama Broadway, 1944-1946"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] were the producers. It was filmed in [[1948 in film|1948]], and served as the basis for a 1950s television series, titled ''[[Mama (TV series)|Mama]]''. Every incarnation basically was the same, a series of heartwarming [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] centering on a family of [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[immigrants]] living in [[San Francisco]] in the early 20th Century. At its core is the oldest daughter, Katrin, who yearns to be a published writer and conspires to meet renowned author Dame Sybil Fitzgibbons, a guest at the Fairmont Hotel, for professional advice and guidance. It is through Katrin's eyes the struggles, hopes, and dreams of the Hansens unfold.

==Production==
The musical adaptation was beset with problems from the beginning. Rodgers and Charnin had composed a full score before the libretto was written, so they ended up having to replace a significant number of songs throughout rehearsals. The original director, Charnin, was replaced by [[Cy Feuer]] after tryouts in Philadelphia, with producer [[Alexander H. Cohen]] saying "they had to go 'for radical surgery' ".&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, William.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSPfjWK_b2YC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=%22Ullmann%22+%22I+Remember+Mama%22+Rodgers&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ullmann%22%20%22I%20Remember%20Mama%22%20Rodgers&amp;f=false "I Remember Mama"], ''Richard Rodgers'' (1998), (books.google.com), Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}, p. 306-8&lt;/ref&gt; The original choreographer, [[Graciela Daniele]], was replaced by [[Danny Daniels]].&lt;ref&gt;Block, Geoffrey.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=YJxYg6ctHtMC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=%22Ullmann%22+%22I+Remember+Mama%22+Rodgers&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ullmann%22%20%22I%20Remember%20Mama%22%20Rodgers&amp;f=false "I Remember Mama"] ''Richard Rodgers'' (2003), (books.google.com), Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-09747-6}}, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical, produced by Alexander H. Cohen and [[Hildy Parks]] opened on Broadway on May 31, 1979 at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where it closed on September 2 after 108 performances and 40 previews. Directed by [[Cy Feuer]], the opening cast featured [[Liv Ullmann]], [[George Hearn]], [[Dolores Wilson]], and [[George S. Irving]].
The spectacular and clever set was designed by the late David Mitchell (of "Annie" fame).

==Reception==
By 1979, Broadway audiences had become accustomed to edgier musicals such as ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' and ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. Critics found ''Mama'' to be old-fashioned and corny, and all were quick to describe the musically disinclined Ullmann as miscast. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote: "At the end of its much-postponed and choppy progress...this big and expensive musical had buried most of the strengths it possesses under a mass of cliches and a pervading, forced cuteness.... Miss Ullman is unsuited to it."&lt;ref&gt;Eder, Richard. "Theater Review", ''The New York Times'',  June 1, 1979, p. C3&lt;/ref&gt;

Show business insiders dubbed the Rodgers' production "I Dismembered Mama." A different musical version starring Celeste Holm played several regional theaters and was better received by audiences and reviewers alike but was prevented from coming to New York.

Advance box office sales, particularly for [[wikt:matinée|matinée]] performances, had been strong enough to keep the show alive in its early weeks, but attendance quickly dropped in numbers dramatic enough to warrant closing. It was Rodgers' last musical.

An [[cast album|original cast album]] was never recorded, but a studio recording with Hearn and Irving reprising their stage roles and [[Sally Ann Howes]] replacing Ullmann was released in 1985.

==Canadian premiere==
The first Canadian production of the musical came in 2004.  Produced by the Toronto Civic Light Opera Company, the production was designed and directed by Joe Cascone.  Starring Caroline Moro-Dalicandro as Mama, David Haines as Papa, Larry Westlake as Uncle Chris and Andrea Strayer as Katrin.  This production took a few minor liberties with the script and score, but was a very big success for the company.  The show ran over the Christmas season and garnered rave reviews and tremendous audience reception.  Quoted one member of the original Broadway production staff, "The show is a hit at last!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.CivicLightOperaCompany.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights''' (FIFDH) is one of the most important international events dedicated to cinema and human rights, located in the heart of [[Geneva]], "international capital of human rights". The inspiration and impetus behind the International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights came from human rights defenders active in NGO’s, filmmakers, media representatives and the University of Geneva.
The FIFDH coincides with the UN Human Rights Council’s main session. This simultaneous event makes the Festival a Free Platform for discussion and debates on a wide variety of topics concerning human rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fifdh.org/site/le-festival&lt;/ref&gt;
It was created by [[Léo Kaneman]] and co-founded by Yäel Reinharz Hazan, Pierre Hazan and Isabelle Gattiker in November 2002. Its first edition took place in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooperationinternationalegeneve.ch/fr/11-me-dition-du-fifdh-rencontre-avec-son-directeur-l-o-kanenman&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film festival ==
 
With its concept « A film, A subject, A debate », the FIFDH aims to underline human rights violations through films and debates, in the presence of filmmakers, human rights defenders, politicians and recognized specialists. Its programme is designed to increase public awareness and inspire people to reinforce their commitment to universal values. In 2014, more than 25’000 visitors attended the Festival’s screenings and debates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ge.ch/solidarite-internationale/newsletter/2014-05/fifdh.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== An international forum on human rights ==
As a genuine Forum on Human Rights, the Festival informs and firmly denounces violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights wherever they occur. In the heart of Geneva, the « human rights international capital », the FIFDH is a relay for human rights defenders active on the field. It offers debates as well as unscreened films and solidarity actions.&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.euronews.com/2014/03/17/fifdh-cinema-et-droits-humains/&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Invalid Litter Dept.'''" was the third single released from [[At the Drive-In]]'s album ''[[Relationship of Command]]''. The CD release in March 2001 came in a variety of international formats, including the standard two CDs in the United Kingdom. The Australian release included the United Kingdom b-sides from the two CD releases.

The song's lyrics and music video deal with the [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|Juárez murders]], a series of rapes and murders in [[Cd. Juárez]] of young women who worked in factories called [[maquiladora]]s.  Cd. Juárez is located just across the [[U.S.-Mexican border]] from [[El Paso, Texas]], At the Drive-In's home town.  The song explicitly criticizes the [[federales]], or Mexican police, for their lack of response to these cases.

"Lamacq version" tracks originally broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''The Evening Session'' with [[Steve Lamacq]], week beginning 11 September 2000, and produced/mixed by Simon Askew.

'''Jeûne genevois''' (meaning Genevan fast) is a public holiday in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], Switzerland which occurs on the Thursday following the first Sunday of September. It dates back to the 16th century.

==Background==
In Europe, beginning in the 15th century, people [[fasting|fasted]] as a way of remembering [[famine]]s, plagues and wars. The [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Federal Diet]]s of 1480 and 1483 talked about national [[Fast Day]]s of penitence and thanksgiving but in the end, left these to the cantons. With no [[Federation|federal]] law, fast days became pilgrimages, processions, litanies and fasts.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Santschi, ''La mémoire des Suisses'', Association de l'Encyclopédie de Genève, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1522 [[Huldrych Zwingli]], who helped stir [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Reformation in Switzerland]], said fasting laws were only human notions which had nothing to do with the [[Holy Writ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Ulrich Zwingli | encyclopedia = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | volume = XV | publisher=The Encyclopedia Press | year = 1913 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15772a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the plagues of [[Basle]] (1541) and [[Berne]] (1565 and 1577) were followed by days of [[penitence]] and [[fasting]], asking God for [[clemency]] and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Fatio, ''Le Jeûne genevois, réalité et mythe'' (BSHAG&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;), 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Began before St. Bartholomew's Day massacre===
[[Geneva]] was a cradle of Protestantism and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. There was a Geneva-wide fast in the beginning of October 1567 as a sign of friendship with Protestants undergoing [[religious persecution|persecution]] in [[Lyon]], France and this was most likely the first ''Jeûne genevois'' (Genevan fast). Five years later, news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] and the slaughter of several thousand [[Huguenot]]s beginning on 24 August 1572 triggered a fast throughout Geneva on the following 3 September, which could be why the date of later yearly fasts was shifted back by almost a month.

By 1640, through sway of the reformed cantons, the fast had become yearly and was carried on even after the Genevan revolution of 1792. ''Jeûne genevois'' later became a patriotic holiday, symbolizing both Geneva's proud identity and its [[Protestantism]]. By the beginning of the [[Helvetic Republic]] folklore had thoroughly linked ''Jeûne genevois'' with the widely remembered St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and fasting in Geneva as the slaughter of whole Protestant families carried on throughout France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneve.ch/FAO/2002/20020904.asp FAO de Genève] 250th Year, # 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Geneva==
In 1831 the Federal Diet decreed a ''Jeûne Fédéral'' (federal fast) for all cantons, fixing the date at 8 September. This was later made the third Sunday in September but for Geneva, which fixed the day of its own ''Jeûne genevois''.

In 1869 Geneva decreed that the holiday was no longer official, but ''Jeûne genevois'' was celebrated unofficially until 1965, slowly losing its religious significance. On 1 August 1966 it was again declared a public holiday and the date fixed as the Thursday following the first Sunday of September.

The religious fasting of ''Jeûne genevois'' is not widely followed. Banks and post offices along with many shops, restaurants and bars close for the day. However, unlike [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] in the U.S., which also falls on a Thursday, a four-day weekend is not usually taken and most businesses are open on Friday.

===Plum pie===
[[File:Tarte pruneaux 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Plum pie, a symbol of Jeûne genevois]]
Plum pie&lt;ref&gt;Geneva lunch.com, ''[http://genevalunch.com/savouring-switzerland/2010/09/09/plum-pie-that-annual-geneva-favourite-french-lesson-included/ : Plum pie recipe: that annual Geneva favourite]'', 9 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;(''tarte aux pruneaux'') is often served as dessert in Geneva homes on ''Jeûne genevois''. Any knowledge as to how this tradition began seems to have been lost, although it may have come about as a means to allow women and housekeepers a way to spend the day in prayer, having cooked plum pies the day before (area plums being in season), with these plum pies the only food eaten in many Geneva households on ''Jeûne genevois''.&lt;ref&gt;ge.ch, ''[http://www.ge.ch/fao/2007/20070905.asp Jeûne genevois: qu'est-ce qui se cache derrière la fameuse tarte aux pruneaux?]'', 5 September 2007, retrieved 9 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kaname Harada'''|原田要||11 August 1916&amp;nbsp;– 3 May 2016}} was a Japanese [[flying ace]] of [[World War II]]. He was credited with shooting down as many as 19 Allied aircraft between late 1941 and when he was himself downed in October 1942. After recovering from the injuries sustained in this incident, Harada served as a flying instructor for the remainder of the war.

Following the end of hostilities in 1945, Harada worked as a farmer, before founding a nursery for children in 1965 and later a kindergarten. He was an anti-war activist from 1991, and remained a prominent speaker until late in his life.

==Biography==
===Military service===
Harada was born in the village of Asajawa in [[Nagano Prefecture]] on 11 August 1916.&lt;ref name="Hata_Stackpole_383"&gt;Hata, Izawa and Shores (2011), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt; After completing school, he joined the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s naval infantry force in 1933, aged 17. He later transferred to the Navy's aviation branch, and graduated first in the 35th pilot training class in February 1937.&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hata_Stackpole_271"&gt;Hata, Izawa and Shores (2011), p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Harada was posted to China in October that year during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], but was not involved in any aerial combat.&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt;&lt;ref name="JT Zero"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shibun|first1=Chunichi|title=Zero fighter pilot to offer 'food for thought' in upcoming documentary|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/22/national/zero-fighter-pilot-to-offer-food-for-thought-in-upcoming-documentary/#.VR8eFvmUd8E|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=Japan Times|date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in China he witnessed Japanese military personnel indiscriminately killing Chinese civilians in the mistaken belief that they were soldiers in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Son of Zero pilot skeptical of Abe’s Pearl Harbor visit|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/27/national/son-zero-pilot-skeptical-abes-pearl-harbor-visit/#.WGSbKvl96Uk|accessdate=29 December 2016|work=Japan Times|date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December he took part in the strike on the {{USS|Panay|PR-5|2}} which led to [[USS Panay incident|increased tensions with the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/valr/learn/historyculture/upload/KanameHarada.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Harada was sent back to Japan in January 1938, and subsequently served in several training positions.&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], Harada was a [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']], which formed part of the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Air Fleet]].&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt; In this role, he took part in the 1st Air Fleet's series of operations during the initial months of the war. On 7 December 1941, he flew protective patrols over the fleet during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], and did not see any combat.&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt; Harada also escorted the aircraft which [[Bombing of Darwin|attacked the Australian port of Darwin]] on 19 February 1942.&lt;ref name="The Australian quest for redemption"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Rick|title=WWII Japanese pilot's quest for redemption|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/wwii-japanese-pilots-quest-for-redemption/story-e6frg6so-1226738528772|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=The Australian|date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Indian Ocean raid]], he was confirmed to have shot down three British fighters over [[Colombo]] on 5 April, and claimed another two as "probables". Four days later, he downed two British [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers which were attempting to attack the Japanese fleet.&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt;

During the [[Battle of Midway]], Harada shot down either three&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt; or five&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot" /&gt; American aircraft. He landed on the last surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']], after ''Sōryū'' was sunk by United States aircraft. Harada was in the air at the time of ''Hiryū''{{'}}s sinking later in the battle, and was rescued by a warship after ditching into the sea.&lt;ref name="JT Zero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot"/&gt;

In July 1942, Harada was reassigned to the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyō|''Hiyō'']]. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan to take part in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]]. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at [[Rekata Bay]] on [[Santa Isabel Island]], and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with his bare hands.

===Later life===
[[File:Kaname Harada 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Harada in 2010]]

Following World War II, Harada initially worked as a dairy farmer, but suffered from nightmares in which he saw the faces of the American airmen he had downed during the war.&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot"/&gt; In 1965, he founded a nursery for children with his wife after she asked him "if you want to atone for the lives you have taken, what better way is there than to nurture new lives?" The couple opened a kindergarten in 1969.&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt; He continued as a principal of the kindergarten until his retirement.&lt;ref name="JT Zero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot"/&gt; In a 2013 interview with ''[[The Australian]]'' Harada said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first incarnation of my life was as a ruthless killer. I still live with a sense of sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down—such a horrible thing to do. Now, I go to the kindergarten every day and interact with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them.&lt;ref name="The Australian quest for redemption" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace [[Joe Foss]] who is believed to have been the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hata_Stackpole_271 /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Australian quest for redemption" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot"/&gt;

Harada was an anti-war activist from 1991.&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot"/&gt; He began giving public talks about his combat experiences and the need to avoid wars that year after overhearing young Japanese discussing the bombing which took place during the [[Gulf War]] as if it formed part of a video game.&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot" /&gt; In 2015, ''The New York Times'' reported that Harada, aged 98, was a "highly sought-after public speaker", who was motivated by a desire to pass on his experiences as a warning to the current generations of Japanese who he believed were unaware of the nature of warfare.&lt;ref name="NYT Pilot" /&gt; He opposed efforts by conservative members of the Japanese government to change the country's pacifist constitution, saying that "these politicians were born after the war, and so they don’t understand it must be avoided at all costs. In this respect, they are like our prewar leaders".&lt;ref name="NYT obit" /&gt; A documentary named ''Each and Every Battlefield'' covering Harada's life was released in Japan in March 2015.&lt;ref name="Shimbun Film immortalizes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okado|first1=Yuki|title=Film immortalizes wartime fighter pilot's turns with death and life|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201503150012|accessdate=4 April 2015|work=The Asahi Shimbun|date=15 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407015843/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201503150012|archivedate=7 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kyodo News|title=Ex-fighter pilot and anti-war activist Kaname Harada dies at 99|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/05/07/national/ex-fighter-pilot-anti-war-activist-kaname-harada-dies-99/#.V4s53_l96Uk|accessdate=17 July 2016|work=The Japan Times|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">The '''European Bowl''' was the [[Korfball]] European Championship "B", played by the countries that have not qualified for the [[European Korfball Championship]]. The best teams of these tournaments often won the right to participate in the next European Korfball Championship and/or Korfball World Championship.

In 2005, the [[International Korfball Federation]] named the trophy for the European Bowl championship after [[Jan Hanekroot]], one of its longest serving development officers and promoters, who died earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korfball.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=605&amp;Itemid=47 The European Bowl Tournament Trophy named after Jan Hanekroot - International Korfball Federation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournament was last held in 2013, when the [[International Korfball Federation]] decided to create a new system which will be in force from 2018, reducing the number of teams taking part in the [[European Korfball Championship]] from 16 to 8 but splitting the championship up in two levels with a relegation/promotion system to be carried out between the so-called "A-Championships" (the current European Korfball Championship) and the "B-Championships". The European Bowl therefore ceases to exist and will be replaced by the "B-Championships", to be first held in [[2018 IKF European Korfball B-Championship|2018]].

'''LANcouver''' is a [[LAN party]] first hosted on the North Shore of [[Metro Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.  It was started in January 2004 and has hosted seven successful events, with the last event in July 2011.  The event has attracted an average of approximately 50–120 attendees per event.  LANcouver is a ''BYOC'' (Bring Your Own Computer) event, which means that everyone attending brings their own PC desktop or laptop.  Network resources (such as [[network switch|switches]] and [[Category 5 cable|network cable]]) and power connections are supplied and connected by the administrators on-site during the event, who also host the various servers required for playing LAN based games such as [[Team Fortress 2]], [[Counter-Strike: Source]], and [[Unreal Tournament]]. LANcouver organizers have also been responsible for running tournaments at other events such as [[GottaCon|GottaCon 2012]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LANcouver5.jpg|thumb|300px|right|LANcouver Tournament]] --&gt;

==2006 World Cyber Games event==
LANcouver 6 was a registered [[World Cyber Games]] qualifying event, and hosted qualifying tournaments for the national championships.  The qualifying matches hosted at LANcouver events were:

*[[Warcraft 3#The Frozen Throne expansion|Warcraft III: Frozen Throne]]
*[[Starcraft: Brood War]]
*[[Counter Strike]] 1.6
*[[FIFA Series#FIFA 06|Fifa 2006]] (PC)

==LANcouver 2011==
In late 2010, LANcouver founders announced that an event was in the works for some time in 2011. In early 2011, that year's LANcouver event was announced, making it the first time that a year was given to the title rather than a number. LANcouver 2011 was the 7th event and was planned to be much larger than all previous events, while also incorporating other game types not played on computers such as [[Xbox 360]] tournaments, [[Games Workshop|Warhammer 40,000]] events, and [[Magic: The Gathering]] and other TCG (trading card game) events.
LANcouver 2011 was held at the [[Great Northern Way Campus]]; another first for the event is that it was hosted in the City of [[Vancouver]] proper and not a suburb.

The main PC gaming events for LANcouver 2011 were [[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|Starcraft II]], [[Counter-Strike: Source]] and [[League of Legends]]. Console events were held as well, with the following main tournaments: [[Marvel vs Capcom 3]], [[Call of Duty: Black Ops]] &amp; [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]

==LANcouver 2012 presented by ASUS==
LANcouver 2012 was announced in late March 2012 and was held at the Richmond Olympic Oval, just outside Vancouver in neighboring Richmond, BC. Sponsors included ASUS (Presenting), NCIX (Retail Sponsor), Kingston Technology, Antec, Shaw Cablesystems, Compu2000, ROCCAT, and more.

The event was host to three major tournaments: League of Legends (5v5), StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (1v1) and Counter-Strike Global Offensive (5v5). The top Canadian StarCraft II player received a trip to Toronto for 2012's World Championship Series qualifier, and competed to win a spot on Team Canada for the World Finals later that year, in addition to a top-end ASUS gaming notebook.

Attendance was approximately 175 out of 200 BYOC spots, and over 150 spectators attended throughout the weekend.

==LANcouver 2013 presented by NCIX==
In March 2013, LANcouver organizers revealed that the 9th event would be held at the [[NCIX]] Warehouse in Richmond, BC, and that the event would also be title sponsored by NCIX. The departure from the Richmond Olympic Oval allows for several key factors from 2012 to be addressed, such as the lack of darkness during nighttime hours. It was also announced that NCIX would be holding a Warehouse Sale simultaneously, with early ticket purchasers for LANcouver getting early access to the NCIX sale.

Tournaments in 2013 included League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, StarCraft, and others. New for 2013 were VIP seats, advertised as being in a "special seating area" and with features like privacy curtains, reduced noise, better seating and complementary refreshments. Other new features included a live broadcast of the LANcouver University panel sessions, improved networking, and an increase in prizing for the entire event. [[Nvidia]]'s [[Shield Portable]] handheld gaming system had its Western Canada debut at LANcouver, and attendees were able to try the new system before it went on sale.

==LANcouver 2014 and 2015==
In April 2014, rumours surfaced that LANcouver organizers had been planning a special 10th anniversary for 2014. The event would also be the 10th since founding. Speculations included a 350-seat BYOC, multi-genre gaming, console tournament, or even live finals for a major international eSports event. In late 2014 it was revealed that LANcouver would miss out on hosting an event for that year, with a followup to be provided in 2015. In Spring of 2015 it was revealed that a 10th LANcouver event is in full planning for late 2015. Several reasons were given for the lack of an event in 2014, mainly concerning the organizer's personal schedule (LANcouver is run by one person) as well as difficulty securing an adequate venue within budget requirements.

The '''Letter of Benan''' was a [[literary forgery]] issued by Ernst Edler von der Planitz in 1910, allegedly a translation from a fifth-century [[Coptic language|Coptic]] papyrus containing a translation of an original composed in Greek in 83 CE.  There is no evidence that either the Greek or Coptic works ever existed.&lt;ref name=Goodspeed&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/goodspeed_strange_new_gospels.htm#7|title=Strange New Gospels|authorlink=Edgar J. Goodspeed|last=Goodspeed|first=Edgar J.|year=1931|publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1931)|pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a letter purporting to be of an [[Egypt]]ian physician describing his encounters with [[Jesus]] and the apostles. Internal evidence and historical inconsistencies, in the absence of the purported original manuscripts, clearly indicate this work to be a fake. It is thus counted among the [[modern apocrypha]].&lt;ref name=Goodspeed /&gt;

{{Vietnamese name|Lý|Tường}}
'''Lý Long Tường''' ({{linktext|李|龍|祥}}; 1174–?) was a prince of the [[Lý Dynasty]] of [[Đại Việt]] (in modern-day [[Vietnam]]) and later became '''Lee Yong-sang''' (이용상) of Hwasan, a general of Korea. He is an ancestor of one branch of the [[Lee (Korean surname)|Lee]] (or Rhee) family today in both South and North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Taylor, Modernity and Re-Enchantment: Religion in Post-Revolutionary Vietnam  Institute of Southeast Asian Studies - 2007 - Page 80 "To this day, the Lý Long Tường branch of the Vietnamese royal family is concentrated in the Hoa Son district outside of Seoul in what is now South Korea (Phạm Côn Sơn 1998). In the 1980s, one descendant of this wayward prince began ..."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lý was born in 1174, the seventh son of Emperor [[Lý Anh Tông]] (who reigned from 1138–75) and his consort Le My Nga. He was appointed the Great National Tutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-vi|Thái sư Thương trụ quốc, Khai phủ nghị đồng tam tư, Thượng thư tả bộc xạ, lĩnh đại đô đốc, tước Kiến Bình vương}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1225, [[Trần Thủ Độ]] overthrew the Lý Dynasty by introducing his nephew [[Trần Cảnh]] to the imperial court to serve the incumbent Empress [[Lý Chiêu Hoàng]], he then orchestrated a political marriage between Trần Cảnh and Lý Chiêu Hoàng and thereafter forced Lý Chiêu Hoàng to abdicate in favour of her husband Trần Cảnh. This marked the end of the Lý Dynasty and the beginning of the Trần Dynasty. With the Trần family having just gained the throne, Trần Thủ Độ ordered the massacre of the Lý family members and forced all of its descendants to change their surname to Nguyen, and sent them to the northern mountainous areas.

==Life in exile==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
In 1226, (Kien Trung's year of the Second Trần Dynasty of Thai Tong), in order to avoid further bloodshed by the Trần family, Lý Long Tường, together with 6000 [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]]s and servants departed from the Than Phu (now [[Thanh Hóa Province]]) estuary and fled to the [[South China Sea]] in three large ships. They carried relics with them, including the imperial crown, imperial costumes, and the heaven imperial sword ({{lang|vi|Thượng phương bảo kiếm}}). After a month on the high seas, they were forced to land in [[Taiwan]] due to a typhoon. When Lý Long Tường decided to leave, his son Ly Long Hien was severely ill and had to stay in Taiwan together with 200 mandarins, followers and servants. Lý Long Tường continued northwards to [[Ongjin County, South Hwanghae|Ongjin County]] and then on to [[Haeju]], [[Hwanghae]] in the [[Yellow Sea]]. Legend has it that the Korean king [[Gojong of Goryeo|Kojong]] of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (1192–1259) had dreamt of a grand [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] flying from the south and landing in his nation. Therefore, he ordered the local government of Hae-ju to give the Vietnamese royal refugees a red-carpeted welcome and allow them to live in a manor in his country.

Lý Long Tường and his companions started their culture of fishing and breeding. He also opened a school for literature (poetry, rhythmical prose and worship rituals) and a school to teach martial arts - the art of war. Thousands of local students joined his two schools.

==Defeat of the Mongol invaders==
In 1232, an army of the [[Mongol Empire]] led by [[General Sartai]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Korea|attack on Korea]] by both sea and land. The troops, using the waterways, attacked Hwang-hae but were defeated by the army and the local inhabitants led by Ly Long Tuong.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Ly Long Tuong always rode a white horse and as a result, was dubbed the "White Horse General."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1253, the Mongol army led by the great Khan [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]] launched a second attack on Korea. The Yuan-Mongol army, led by Tang Ji, attacked Hwang-hae overland and by using the waterways. Lý Long Tường, although by then over 70 years old, led the army and the local inhabitants to victory after a five-month campaign.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} As a result of this important triumph, the Korean king renamed Jin-san ({{korean=진산|hanja=鎭山}}) Hwa-san ({{korean=화산|hanja=花山}}) and appointed Ly Long Tuong Hwa-san gun (花山君). The location of the Mongol army surrender was called the Gate of Surrender Acceptance ({{lang|ko-Hani|{{linktext|受|降|門}}}}; ''Su-hang-mun''). The Korean king also had a pillar erected here to honour Ly Long Tuong. (The pillar can still be seen today).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

When Lý Long Tường died, he was buried at the foot of Mount Di A near Panmunjeom ({{lang|ko-Hani|板門店}}).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The mountain peak (Kwang-dea) where Lý Long Tường always sat to look southwards and cried is now called the "Peak of Nostalgia" ({{lang|ko-Hani|{{linktext|望|國|壇}}}}).

==Descendants in Korea==
Today, there are some 1500 households in [[North Korea]] and 600 in [[South Korea]] with connections to Lý Long Tường.&lt;ref&gt;''Korea's Changing Roles in Southeast Asia: Expanding Influence and ...'' - Page 34 David I. Steinberg, ed. - 2010 "... of the Vietnamese Ly prince, called Ly Long Tuong, who led the exile could be around 1,500 (Viet Nam News). ".&lt;/ref&gt; A descendant of Lý Long Tường, Lee Chang Kun (Ly Xuong Can), and Ly Sang Joon (Ly Tung Tuan, the Founder of [[Golden Bridge Finance Group]]) visits Lý's temple in Dinh Bang village in Bắc Ninh Province every year with his family living and sends money to help in the reconstruction of the temple. He has also invested in local projects and together with this family took up Vietnamese citizenship in 2010. His son born in 1997 was named Ly Viet Quoc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nld.com.vn/20100629122620558p0c1002/dat-to-mai-trong-tim.htm Dat to mai trong con tim]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1995, a report on Lý Long Tường was broadcast by South Korean TV channel [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Also, Lý Long Tường is the founder of one of the [[Korean clan]], [[Hwasan Lee clan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=|date=|title=Academy of Korean Studies 화산이씨 花山李氏|publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]]|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=291465&amp;cid=42835&amp;categoryId=42835&amp;mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nigeria (6850954133).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nigeria]]n attendants at the 2012 National Multicultural Festival in [[Canberra]].]]
The '''National Multicultural Festival''' is a free community [[festival]] held annually each February in [[Canberra]]. 

The first festival celebrating cultural diversity was held in 1981 as a one-day event on Australia Day hosted by the ACT Ethnic Communities Council. 

In 1996 the National Multicultural Festival in Canberra officially came into being. It began as a nod to the Capital's expanding cityscape, populated by young families with links across the globe, and blossomed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s to an event reflecting the more than 170 unique nationalities that comprise our population. The festival has become one of the most successful multicultural festivals in Australia. The festival is held over three days during February each year. 

The Festival is supported by the ACT Government and is administered by the Community Participation Group, Multicultural Affairs, a division of the ACT Government Community Services Directorate.

==History==
In 1981, the ACT Ethnic Communities Council held the first festival celebrating cultural diversity, a one-day event in Civic to celebrate [[Australia Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Official souvenir programme : Canberra '81 / Australian International Multicultural Dance Festival|date=1981|location=Canberra, ACT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126874645|title=Multicultural festival|first=Vic|last=Rebikoff|date=28 January 1982|page=15|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article119474967|title=Multicultural festival last of kind|page=6|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=13 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, the festival had grown to host about 40 international food stalls, music and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101971290|title=Multicultural festivities|date=21 January 1988|newspaper=The Canberra Times|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year it was held in the Civic end of Ainslie Avenue, and along London Circuit in front of Civic Square, and also included a parade led by Chinese lion dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Canberra Times|page=3|title=Civic the venue for multicultural festival|date=23 January 1988|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article101971576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the newly established ACT Office of Multicultural Affairs staged the first week-long Festival as a means of celebrating Canberra and Australia's [[cultural diversity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In 2010, the Festival became a three-day event and remains that duration.&lt;ref name=shakeup/&gt;

In 2012, the festival hosted a record 350 stalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-10/canberra-national-multicultural-festival/3823186|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404211509/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-10/canberra-national-multicultural-festival/3823186|archivedate=4 April 2013|deadurl=no|first=Penny|last=McLintock|date=10 February 2012|title=Multicultural festival kicks off in Canberra|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 festival was also the first to allow cultural kava use, as a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/govt-relaxes-ban-on-kava-at-festival-20120209-1t962.html|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 February 2012|title=Govt relaxes ban on kava at festival|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502164409/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/govt-relaxes-ban-on-kava-at-festival-20120209-1t962.html|archivedate=2 May 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACT Government announced in 2013 that the kava trial had been a success and there would be a permanent lifting of the ban on the drink at the National Multicultural Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kava-to-be-allowed-at-all-multicultural-festivals-20130206-2dya4.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313041559/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kava-to-be-allowed-at-all-multicultural-festivals-20130206-2dya4.html|archivedate=13 March 2013|title=Kava to be allowed at all multicultural festivals|first=Christopher|last=Knaus|date=6 February 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fringe Festival==
Between 2004 and 2009, the Fringe Festival was a free event forming part of the Multicultural Festival.&lt;ref name=Pryor&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/fringe-festival-rides-again-with-old-hand-jorian-holding-the-reins-20130627-2p0a8.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809063255/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/fringe-festival-rides-again-with-old-hand-jorian-holding-the-reins-20130627-2p0a8.html|archivedate=9 August 2014|title=Fringe Festival rides again, with old hand Jorian holding the reins|first=Sally|last=Pryor|date=28 June 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, then Minister for Multicultural Affairs [[John Hargreaves (Australian Capital Territory politician)|John Hargreaves]] announced that the Multicultural Festival would be reduced to a three-day event and the Fringe Festival moved to become a part of the [[National Folk Festival (Australia)|National Folk Festival]].&lt;ref name=shakeup&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-20/festival-shake-up-angers-fringe-folk/1397488|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809064634/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-20/festival-shake-up-angers-fringe-folk/1397488|archivedate=9 August 2014|title=Festival shake-up angers fringe folk|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloomberg News]] (4 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted that in five of the six vessels in the flotilla, the boarding procedure ended without casualties. "The only difference was with one ship, where extremist Islamic activists, supporters of terrorism, waited for our troops on the deck with axes and knives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/05/israel-rachel-corrie-gaza-ship "Israeli forces board the Rachel Corrie"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boarding took place, Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] said that the flotilla of ships "was an armada of hate and violence". He added that the flotilla attempt to reach Gaza was "a premeditated and outrageous provocation" and claimed that its organizers had ties not only to [[Hamas]], but also to global [[Jihadism|Jihad]], and [[al Qaida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=176998 | newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | title=Barak: Flotilla organizers to blame | date=31 May 2010 | accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] called the international community "two faced" and said Israel was being condemned for its military acts of defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shamir |first=Shlomo |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lieberman-to-un-chief-international-community-is-two-faced-for-condemning-israel-1.293299 |title=Lieberman to UN chief: International community is two-faced for condemning Israel |work=[[Haaretz]] |location=Israel |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieberman was said to have been "reminding" the UN Secretary General that in the past month alone over 500 people were killed in various incidents in Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and [[Indo-Israeli relations|India]], which had allegedly been "ignored" while Israel was being condemned for its "unmistakably defensive actions". Israel later rescinded its criticism of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/73116/israel-drops-indias-name-list.html "Israel drops India's name from the list of violence hit nations"]. ''[[Deccan Herald]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition leader [[Tzipi Livni]] said that the coalition and the opposition are united in support of the defense forces, and that she is ready to assist the government in the political and explanatory aspects of the flotilla incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3896557,00.html "Livni offers help: In defending IDF there is no coalition, opposition"]. [[Ynetnews]] (20 June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; She, however, disagreed with what she considered Netanyahu's lack of policy: "The world is certainly hypocritical, but that doesn't absolve us from forming a policy. This is more than an isolated incident. Anything that happened when Israel had a different standing in world opinion would have had a different result. Now, any isolated incident becomes a global drama, and it's becoming worse. We are reaching the stage when Israel's ability to defend itself will no longer exist." She said the lack of policy in the aftermath of the incident would jeopardize Israel's legitimacy and backing from the international community, which she says for years had insisted on not recognizing Hamas until it recognizes Israel and accepts past agreements, and had accepted the closure of Gaza while "it was clear that Israel wanted an agreement with pragmatic forces, with the legitimate Palestinian government." She also said that IDF soldiers acted appropriately, and supports setting up an internal investigation committee with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898602,00.html |title=Livni: Keep world from investigating IDF soldiers |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambassador to the U.K., [[Ron Prosor]], said: "It's obvious – and I won't beat around the bush on this – that this wasn't successful and I think it clearly took up an issue that should have been solved differently." [However, the] other side [behaved] appallingly. [Israel was in a] war situation with terrorists. The loss of life was tragic and I’m not just saying that. When you look at the footage ... it's obvious that the reaction is self—defence to try and save your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=DPA |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article443610.ece |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |title=Flotilla attack could have been 'solved differently,' says Israeli envoy |date=29 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said "It is no longer possible to cover up or ignore Israel's lawlessness. The international community must from now on say 'enough is enough'. Dry statements of condemnation are not enough ... There should be results." He said the Israeli action was an attack "on international law, [and] the conscience of humanity and world peace". He even said that Israel acts as it does because it has powerful friends.&lt;ref name="aljaz2"/&gt; He called for Israel to lift the "inhuman siege" of the Gaza Strip, which he referred to as an "open-air prison", and announced that he was considering sending the [[Turkish Navy]] to escort any future flotillas or to visit Gaza himself, in order to break the blockade. He also urged the international community to impose sanctions on Israel.

President [[Abdullah Gül]] said, "From now on, Turkish-Israeli ties will never be the same. This incident has left an irreperable and deep scar." He also said, "Turkey will never forgive this attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/06/2010631253044379.html |title=AJE |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |accessdate=12 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gül compared Israel's actions to those of [[al-Qaeda]], and demanded that Israel apologize and pay compensation, and also urged Israel to thoroughly investigate the incident and lift the blockade of Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=141812&amp;language=en] [[Al-Manar]]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is time for the international community to say 'enough is enough'." He also said that Turkey was ready to normalise ties if the blockade on Gaza was lifted because "it was time calm replaces anger." That, in turn, was accompanied with statement saying the injured would stay in Tel Aviv hospital under the care of a Turkish doctor, "We will not leave them (the wounded) to the mercy of anyone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/06/20106293939694105.html "Turkey demands return of citizens"].

The '''Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire''' is a [[Renaissance fair]] occurring over 13 weekends from early-August through late-October on the grounds of the [[Mount Hope Estate and Winery]] in [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Odesser-Torpey"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR7mhJY5FjwC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22Pennsylvania+Renaissance+Faire%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=ZmZ4SslWi5LKBJnG7IYD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pennsylvania%20Renaissance%20Faire%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false |title=Insiders' Guide to Pennsylvania Dutch Country| last=Odesser-Torpey |first=Marilyn |ISBN=0-7627-4786-2 |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2008 |pages=222 to 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Estate was sold and converted to a winery.

==History==

In 1980, a two-day jousting festival called the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire was held in the winery parking lot to attract visitors. The event proved popular, and expanded in the following years.&lt;ref name="business"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5295/is_199807/ai_n24335724/ |title=Period fun at the Renaissance Faire doth maketh the bottom line strong |publisher=Central Penn Business Journal |date=1998-07-03 |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Faire was held on a {{convert|35|acre|m2|adj=on}} site with 90 shows performed daily on 12 stages, hundreds of costumed characters, and a recreation of a 16th-century English village with authentic Tudor buildings. Musical performances, Shakespearean plays, and other acts were offered, twenty-three "Royal Kitchens" served food and drink, and Renaissance merchants were on-site.&lt;ref name="PA DCED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visitpa.com/things-to-do/event-calendar/event-details/index.aspx?id=21306460 |title=29th Annual Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swashbuckler Brewing Company was founded on the grounds in 2000,&lt;ref name="Penn Brew"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95Yluit6hgMC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=romito+bowser&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z21Of0KSiB&amp;sig=L0VefHjubkeY7noUA8zoUkl7U-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ml94Ss3qCNSvtgeHodSWCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=romito%20bowser&amp;f=false |title=Pennsylvania Breweries |last=Bryson |first=Lew |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2005 |ISBN=0-8117-3222-3 |pages=121 to 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its product is available at the Swashbuckler Brew Pub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parenfaire.com/pages/swashbuckler_brewery/swashbuckler_history.html |title=Swashbuckler History |publisher=Swashbuckler Brewing Company |accessdate=2009-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608190142/http://www.parenfaire.com/pages/swashbuckler_brewery/swashbuckler_history.html |archivedate=June 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==

The Faire's music and storytelling have been praised by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] Little Buffalo Performance Center, and, in 1998, the Faire was named one of the top 100 motorcoach-accessible events in America by the American Bus Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2000/09/09-08-00tdc/09-08-00darts-6.asp |last=Neville |first=Erin |work=The Daily Collegian |title=Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire an educational experience out of class |date=2000-09-08 |accessdate=2009-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904062821/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2000/09/09-08-00tdc/09-08-00darts-6.asp |archivedate=2006-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==

As a privately owned business, the faire is not required to report revenues to the public. In a 1998 interview, the owner, Chuck Romito, revealed that "Gross sales for wine purchases and tickets for shows at the Mount Hope Estates--including Christmas, Halloween, Roaring '20s and other theme performances--hover around $4 million," while the faire's expenses were about $2 million.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;

As of 2008, American Renaissance festivals were much larger in scale than their European counterparts. ''Consuming History'' specifically mentions the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire for its high attendance, along with the [[Maryland Renaissance Festival|Maryland Renaissance Faire]], which draws 225,000 visitors over three weeks, and the [[Bristol Renaissance Faire]], which reached a peak in 1990 with 400,000 visitors in seven weekends.&lt;ref name="Consuming History" /&gt;

The '''Rochester Lilac Festival''' is an art, music, food and flora festival hosted annually in early May in [[Highland Park (Rochester, New York)|Highland Park]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York State|New York]]. Highland Park possesses a huge collection of [[lilac]]s, featuring more than 1800 bushes and over 500 different varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester Lilac Festival|url=http://www.rochesterevents.com/festivals-events/lilac-festival/highland-park-gardens|website=Rochester Events|accessdate=April 4, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501235923/http://www.rochesterevents.com/festivals-events/lilac-festival/highland-park-gardens|archivedate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is started with a parade and frequently hosts concerts and other attractions during the week.  The [[Highland Park (Rochester, New York)|Highland Park]] [[arboretum]] is toured free of charge and is open to all visitors. The fields surrounding the arboretum host a myriad of vendor's tents and food stands. The festival ends each year with the annual Lilac 10K road race and 5K Family Fun Run. The 10K Course is USATF certified.

==History==
In 1888, nurserymen [[George Ellwanger]] and [[Patrick Barry (horticulture)|Patrick Barry]] endowed the Rochester community with {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of gently rolling hills that are now known as [[Highland Park, Rochester, New York|Highland Park]].&lt;ref name="D&amp;C_May2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20090507/LIVING/905070334/-1/specials46/Ellwanger+and+Barry+gift+has+lasted+more+than+a+century |title=Ellwanger and Barry gift has lasted more than a century |newspaper=Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle |date=May 7, 2009 |author= |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted as one of the nation's first municipal arboretums. Renowned park designer [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] was responsible for final development of Highland Park. The park's lilac collection was started by horticulturist John Dunbar in 1892 with 20 varieties, some of which were descendants of slips of native Balkan Mountain flowers that were carried to the new world by early colonists. Today, over 500 varieties of lilacs cover 22 of Highland Park's {{convert|155|acre|km2}}.

The inspiration for the festival dates to 1898 when 3,000 people came to the park one Sunday in May to see the lilacs. Ten years later, 25,000 people came to the first organized lilac festival.&lt;ref name="D&amp;C_May2009"/&gt; Since then the number of viewers has grown to over 500,000 and the festival plays out over the course of ten days.

'''Sirimanothsavam''', ({{lang-te|సిరిమాను పండుగ, సిరి మాను ఉత్సవం}}) (also referred to as ''Sirimanu Uthsavam'', ''Siri Manu Fete/Festival'', ''Sirimanu Panduga'') is a festival organized to propitiate Goddess '''Pyddithallamma''' of [[Vizianagram]] Town. ''Siri'' means ''lean and small'' and ''manu'' means ''stump'' or ''stick''. The priest of the temple, while taking procession  between the fort and temple three times in the evening, hangs from the tip of the long, lean wooden stick (measuring 60&amp;nbsp;feet), raised high into the sky. The priest possessed by the goddess would himself tell a few days before, where this ''manu'' is available;  from there only, this has to be procured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=6029 |title=Pyditalli Ammavari temple |author=krishnakomali |publisher=Reviewstream.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanging  from the upper end of the stick, which is raised high into the sky, is a very risky exercise, but the grace of the Goddess, it is believed, saves the priest from falling. It is  organized in the month of September or October (Dasara) of every year. It is a stupendous event attended by two to three lakhs of people from the neighboring towns and villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/01/stories/2008100153080300.htm The Hindu English Daily], 2008-10-01&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rajas of Vizianagaram would be overseeing this event. The APSRTC runs about 250 buses from different parts of the state to facilitate transport of devotees to Vizianagram to attend this festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/12/stories/2008101251810300.htm The Hindu English Daily], 2008-10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

It was during 1757, when the king '''Puspati Peda Vijaya Rama Raju''' of [[Vizianagaram]] was busy in the [[Battle of Bobbili]], second Anand has taken the charge of crown and died in the year 1760. His wife also died along with him in [[Sati (practice)]]. Then the wife of Peda Vijaya Rama Raju, Rani Chandrayamma has adopted Vijaya Rama Raju who belongs to [[Vizianagaram]] dynasty as per history.

If we go through the history of 104 temples constructed by Vizianagar Sanstan some history of those temples can be known by virtue of their location. But there is no specific history about the Sri Pydithalli Ammavaru temple constructed by this sanstan. But as per rumours or by some stories it is seen that Pydithalli Ammavaru is a Grama Devata of Vizianagaram. Some say that this Ammavaru is a sister of Maharanis of Vizianagaram. But there are many evidences that Pydithalli Ammvaru belongs to Vizianagaram dynasty. Even though there are no perfect proofs regarding birth and other details of Pydimamba, as per the peoples saying, after completion of Bobbili battle after Vijayadasimi  on the next Tuesday and idol was found in the west side of Pedda Cheruvu of Vizianagaram. It is known Pyidimamaba, the village goddess of Vizianagaram.

It was in 1750 when the French leader [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]]  was staying with entire battalion near [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. Many soldiers have died due to some disease (Masuchi). He was running with financial crisis. Peda Vijaya Rama Raju of [[Vizianagaram]] helped him to overcome financial crisis and rebuild his battalion. In 1756 Bussy visited [[Rajahmundry]]. It is heard that Vijaya Rama Raju has given a warm welcome to Bussy by going in front at [[Rajahmundry]].

At that time Bobbili Maharajas were ruling with full power. There are some differences between Bobbili Maharajas and Vizianagaram Rajas regarding power. Because of those differences and some reasons [[Battle of Bobbili]] started in 23 January 1757. During the battle entire Bobbili fort got destroyed and many Bobbili soldiers died in the battle. The wife of Vijaya Rama Raju and Sister Sri. Pydimamba tried to stop the battle by hearing the news and were not succeeded. By that time only Sri Pydimamba sister of Vijayaramaraju was suffering from Masuchi disease. While she was in the puja of Goddess she came to know that Vijayaramaraju is in trouble. She wanted to inform her brother regarding this and tried to convey the message through Vizianagaram soldiers, but every one was in the battle. She started with Patiwada Appalanaidu to convey the message in a horse cart. But, by that time, she got the news that his brother Vijaya Rama Raju died in the hands of TandrapapaRayudu. She felt unconscious. Patiwada Applanaidu sprinkled water over her face and she came to conscious stage and told Appalanaidu that she will not live more. She is going to engross her soul in Goddess. Her statue will be found at the west bank of Pedda Cheruvu (A pond located at the heart of [[Vizianagaram]] lies on the west side of [[Vizianagaram]] Fort). The fishermen found the idol of Pydimamba and constructed a temple called Vanam Gudi for goddess, at [[Vizianagaram]] Railway Station which was the first temple for Pydimamba, the second temple is located at three lamps junction.&lt;ref name="Jataras"&gt;[http://vizianagaram.nic.in/Jataras.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223203651/http://vizianagaram.nic.in/Jataras.html |date=23 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procession ==
[[File:Procession of the Sirimanu.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Procession of the Sirimanu]]
Every year on the first Tuesday passing Vijayadasami Sirimanu Utsav is being celebrated. Sirimanu means a big tree. It is believed that approximately 15&amp;nbsp;days before

of Sirimanu Utsav goddess Pydimamba would come in the dream of temple Pujari and tell him where the Sirimanu for this year is located. Pujari would go in search of sirimanu and will cut the sirimanu with performing puja etc. That sirimanu can be located anywhere. The owner must agree to cut his tree for Utsav. That tree will be shaped neatly into Sirimanu and will be placed over the chariot. This sirimanu will be brought to Three Lanters junction around 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm. At around temple Pujari will make darshan of Goddess and will sit on the Sirimanu chariot. This sirimanu will move 3 times to Vizianagaram fort and temple between 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm to 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm. The Vizianagaram rajahs will sit on the top of the fort and watch the Utsav. Pujari will be given new clothes by Rajas and puja is performed. In front of Srimanu there will be a chariot in the shape of White elephant.&lt;ref name="Jataras" /&gt;

== Importance of the White Elephant ==

Many people do not know about the White Elephant moving in front of Sirimanu chariot. But in the olden days Maharajas used to sit on a white elephant and participate in Sirimanu Utsav. Now as per the present situation white elephant statue is being moved in front of Sirimanu as a part of tradition.&lt;ref name="Jataras"/&gt;

[[File:Anjali Chariot.jpg|thumb|182x182px|Anjali Chariot in Sirimanothsavam]]

== Importance of Anjali Chariot ==

Sri Pydimamba died before getting married. So five Married women were made sit on the Anjali chariot which is on the front of Sirimanu as a part of tradition. As five married women are sitting on this chariot, this is called Anjali chariot. Secondly along with this sirimanu Paladhara, an umbrella made with fishing nets decorated with flowers and fruits is important.&lt;ref name="Jataras"/&gt;
[[File:Fishermen's net.jpg|thumb|Fishermen's net in Sirimanothsavam]]

== Importance of Paladhara and Fishermen's net  ==

As per history when Goddess statue will be found in west side of pedda cheruvu, Patiwda Appalanaidu has tried to bring the statue out by calling professional swimmers of Yata Veedhi. They agreed to bring the statue out with out taking money on putting a condition that their people will participate with srimanu utasav with umbrella made of fishing nets. Patiwada Appalanaidu agreed to their condition and made the rajas convinced for allowing them to participate in Sirimanothsavam.&lt;ref name="Jataras"/&gt;

The '''Theatre Royal''' at Gloucester, at which [[Charles Dickens]] once performed, was an important theatre in the history of the city.

The theatre was built in 1791 by [[John Boles Watson]] in upper [[Westgate, Gloucester|Westgate Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42295 |title=Gloucester, 1720-1835: Social and cultural life |author=N.M.

At its centenary in 1891, [[Sir Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]] both appeared with members of the ''Lyceum Company''. In 1902 the theatre was sold again to Charles Poole who changed it to a variety theatre and picture house. [[Moving panorama|Myriorama]] shows were given. The theatre closed in the early 1920s and was replaced by Woolworths in 1922.

[[Major general (United States)|Major General]] '''Thomas Francis Farrell''' (3 December 1891&amp;nbsp;– 11 April 1967) was the Deputy Commanding General and Chief of Field Operations of the [[Manhattan Project]], acting as executive officer to Major General [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]]

Farrell graduated from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] with a degree in civil engineering in 1912. During [[World War I]], he served with the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st Engineers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the French [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]]. After the war, he was an instructor at the Engineer School, and then at the [[United States Military Academy at West Point]]. He resigned from the Regular Army in 1926 to become Commissioner of Canals and Waterway for the State of New York from 1926 to 1930, and head of construction and engineering of the [[New York State Department of Public Works]] from 1930 until 1941.

During [[World War II]] he returned to active duty as Groves' executive officer in the Operations Branch of the Construction Division under the Office of the [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]]. He went to the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India]] theater to help build the [[Ledo Road]]. In January 1945, Groves chose Farrell as his [[second-in-command]] of the Manhattan Project. Farrell observed the [[Trinity test]] at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. In August 1945, he went to [[Tinian]] to supervise the [[bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Afterwards he led teams of scientists to inspect the effects of the atomic bombs.

In 1946 he was appointed chairman of the [[New York City Housing Authority]]. He subsequently worked as a consultant for the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] on projects such as the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]]. He was a member of the evaluation board for [[Operation Crossroads]], and was an advisor to [[Bernard Baruch]], the United States representative on the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]]. During the [[Korean War]], Farrell returned to active duty once more, serving with the [[Defense Production Administration]], and then with the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] as its Assistant General Manager for Manufacturing. He oversaw a vast increase in the Commission's production capabilities before retiring again in 1951. From 1960 to 1964, he worked on the preparations for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].

== Early life ==
Thomas Francis Farrell was born on 3 December 1891 in [[Brunswick, New York]], the fourth of nine children of John Joseph Farrell, Sr., a farmer, and his wife Margaret née Connolly.&lt;ref name="Vucanovich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/letters/vucanovich/letter01.htm |title= Letter to Janet Farrell Cafferata from Barbara Vucanovich, Former Member, U.S. House of Representatives |publisher=Nevada Women's History Project |last=Vucanovich |first=Barbara |authorlink=Barbara Vucanovich |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell was raised on the family's {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} farm, where his father had an apple orchard, and raised pigs and dairy cattle. The children helped with the farm chores, and delivering the milk, but none stayed on as adults.&lt;ref name="Vucanovich &amp; Cafferata, p. 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Vucanovich|Cafferata|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farrell graduated from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first professional job was working on the [[New York State Barge Canal]]. Seeing Irish workers being mistreated by bosses made him a staunch supporter of organized labor.&lt;ref name="Vucanovich" /&gt; He worked on the [[Panama Canal]] from 1913 to 1916.&lt;ref name="Vucanovich &amp; Cafferata, p. 11" /&gt;

Farrell joined the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] Officers Reserve Corps in 1916.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; He married Maria Ynez White in 1917 before departing for France with the [[American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF).&lt;ref name="Vucanovich &amp; Cafferata, p. 11" /&gt; He joined the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st Engineers]] with the rank of [[second lieutenant]], and departed from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on the [[USS Finland (ID-4543)|USAT ''Finland'']] on 6 August as the assistant supply officer with the rank of [[first lieutenant]].{{sfn|Farrell|1919|pp=6–8}} He became a [[captain (land)|captain]] and regimental supply officer in October, and subsequently, with the rank of [[major]], commanded the 2nd Battalion from January to May 1918, Company F from May to July, and finally the 1st Battalion from July 1918.{{sfn|Farrell|1919|pp=55–56}}

Farrell participated in the [[Battle of Cantigny]], the [[Aisne-Marne Offensive]], the [[Spring Offensive#Gneisenau|Battle of Montdidier-Noyon]] and the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; The 1st Engineers' main role was maintenance of the roads and construction of bridges in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] area, although detachments also employed [[Bangalore torpedo]]es to clear paths through barbed wire.{{sfn|Farrell|1919|pp=31–38}} However, during the Argonne battle, Farrell's 1st Battalion was committed to the line as infantry. For his leadership in the action that followed, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. His citation read:{{quote|for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with 1st Engineers, 1st Division, A.E.F., at Bois-de-Moncy, France, October 8–9, 1918. On October 8 when ordered to take and hold Hill 269, which was strongly held by enemy forces, Major Farrell with great skill and with undaunted courage and determination led his battalion to the attack, seized and held this vital point despite the fact that he was attacked by greatly superior numbers on three sides and nearly surrounded by strong enemy forces who showed extraordinary determination to regain this highly important position. He held the hill until reinforcements could reach him after darkness had fallen on 9 October 1918. His fearless leadership, utter disregard for his own safety, and complete devotion to duty raised the morale of his battalion to a high pitch and inspired them to acts of great endeavor.&lt;ref name="DSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=11839 |title=Valor awards for Thomas F. Farrell |publisher=[[Military Times]] |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Farrell was also awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]] with palm for his actions,{{sfn|Farrell|1919|p=58}} and the 1st Battalion received a citation from [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Charles Summerall]], the commander of [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]].{{sfn|Farrell|1919|p=46}} After the [[Armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, the 1st Engineers participated in the [[occupation of the Rhineland]], with Farrell's 1st Battalion basing itself at [[Ebernhahn]].{{sfn|Farrell|1919|pp=51–54}} The 1st Engineers returned to the United States in August and September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwi/ob/1-ROE-OB.htm |title=1st Division (RA) Record of Events |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate=18 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Farrell joined the Regular Army. He served as an instructor at the Engineer School at [[Camp A. A. Humphreys]] from 1921 to 1924, and then at the [[United States Military Academy at West Point]] until 1926.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

Farrell resigned from the Regular Army in 1926, but remained in the reserves. The [[Governor of New York]], [[Al Smith]], appointed Farrell as Commissioner of Canals and Waterway for the State of New York.&lt;ref name="Vucanovich" /&gt; He was head of construction and engineering of the [[New York State Department of Public Works]] from 1930 until 1941.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; He was considered as a possible candidate to replace [[Frederick Stuart Greene]] as Superintendent of Public Works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |date=13 November 1930 |location=Syracuse, New York |title= Col.

Major projects in New York included the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and the construction of [[LaGuardia Airport]].{{sfn|Ohl|1994|p=32}}

== World War II ==
[[File:Groves and Farrel.jpg|thumbnail|right|240px|Farrell (right) and Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., (left), in 1945]]

=== Construction in the United States ===
Farrell returned to active duty in February 1941 with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] to act as then-[[Colonel]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]]'s executive officer in the Operations Branch of the Construction Division under the Office of the  Office of the [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the [[Quartermaster Corps]] to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=241–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell and Groves worked out new, simplified procedures for centralized procurement that provided the flexibility needed to get projects done on time with the accountability that such enormous expenditures demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=539–540}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] for his services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Times Record |location=Troy, New York |date=17 February 1944 |page=5 |title=Col. Thomas Farrell Given Merit Medal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China-Burma-India ===
In September 1943, the Chief of [[Army Service Forces]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[Brehon B. Somervell]], created a special India Committee to coordinate activities in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India theater]] with those of Army Service Forces back home. Farrell, now a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was appointed to the committee to oversee construction. The creation of a line of communications from India to China would be the largest engineer undertaking of the war. A number of new units were trained in the United States specifically for the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=429–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reorganization later that year, Farrell became Chief Engineer of the [[Services of Supply]] in the China-Burma-India theater. In December he also became head of its Construction Division.&lt;ref name="Dod, pp. 437-438"&gt;{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=437–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell, who was promoted to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] in January 1944,&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; organized his command into two divisions and six districts. He was in charge of the work inside India; construction of the [[Ledo Road]] itself was the responsibility of Colonel [[Lewis A. Pick]]. In addition to this work, Farrell had to support [[Operation Matterhorn]], the deployment of [[B-29]] bombers to China and India, which involved the construction and expansion of a series of air bases. The B-29s required runways that were almost twice the size of those for the older [[B-17]]s,&lt;ref name="Dod, pp. 437-438" /&gt; and he was forced to divert his resources to construct a {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} oil pipeline to the Matterhorn airfields.&lt;ref name="Dod, pp. 448-449"&gt;{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=448–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To bridge the fast-following rivers of northern Burma, Pick and Farrell selected the H-20 Portable Steel Highway Bridge. Production of these had been discontinued in favor of the [[Bailey bridge]], but Farrell's technical arguments won out and the Corps of Engineers had to reinstate production of the H-20.&lt;ref name="Dod, pp. 448-449" /&gt; In view of these difficulties, Farrell obtained Bailey bridges from British sources. In the end, all the major bridges beyond the [[Irrawaddy River]] would be Baileys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=664}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made the decision, controversial in Washington, to shift the terminus of the {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} oil pipeline from [[Calcutta]] to [[Chittagong]] in order to avoid crossing the [[Ganges]] and [[Brahmaputra]] Rivers, and the dangers of concentrating too many vulnerable installations in the Calcutta area.&lt;ref name="Dod, pp. 466-467"&gt;{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=466–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref name="DSC" /&gt;

=== Manhattan Project ===
In December 1944, the [[Secretary of War]], [[Henry L. Stimson]], ordered Groves, now the Director of the [[Manhattan Project]], to find a deputy. Stimson was concerned about what would happen if Groves became incapacitated. "You can have any officer in the Army," Stimson told Groves, "no matter who he is, or what duty he is on."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groves told Colonel [[Kenneth Nichols]], the commander of the Manhattan District, that his first choice would be Farrell. Nichols replied: "He would be my first choice too."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Site Y" was the code name for the remote [[Los Alamos County, New Mexico]] facilities that housed the main group of researchers and was responsible for final assembly of the bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=206 "Site Y"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell was briefed on the physics of the [[atomic bomb]] by [[Robert Oppenheimer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vucanovich|Cafferata|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he made several extended tours of the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]], which had been chosen as the site for the [[Trinity test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; On signing a receipt for the [[plutonium]] from [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], Farrell commented: {{quote|I recall that I asked them if I was going to sign for it shouldn't I take it and handle it. So I took this heavy ball in my hand and I felt it growing warm, I got a certain sense of its hidden power. It wasn't a cold piece of metal, but it was really a piece of metal that seemed to be working inside. Then maybe for the first time I began to believe some of the fantastic tales the scientists had told about this nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/trinity/assembly.shtml  |accessdate=15 June 2012 |title=Bomb Assembly |publisher=National Science Digital Library  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Farrell observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)]] with Oppenheimer from the control dugout located {{convert|10000|yd}} from the test tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his report on the test to President Truman on 21 July 1945,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Days-Destiny-Crossroads-American-History/dp/0789480107 Days of Destiny: Crossroads in American History, pg 311]&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell stated: {{quote|The effects could well be called unprecedented, magnificent, beautiful, stupendous, and terrifying. No man-made phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever occurred before...It lit every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined. Seconds after the explosion came, the air blast pressed hard against the people watching, to be followed almost immediately by the strong, sustained, awesome roar which warned of doomsday and made us feel we puny things were blasphemous to dare tamper with the forces previously reserved for the Almighty. Words are inadequate tools for the job of acquainting those not present with the physical, mental and psychological effects. It had to be witnessed to be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/pre-cold-war/manhattan-project/trinity/eyewitness-thomas-farrell_1945-07-16.htm |accessdate=15 June 2012 |title=Trinity Test, July 16, 1945 Eyewitness Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

[[File:Three Tinian Joint Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The "Tinian Joint Chiefs": [[Captain (US Navy)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]] (left), [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R. Purnell]] (center), and Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell (right)]]
Farrell assumed special responsibility for combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the target committee, acting as its chairman when Groves was absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1945, Farrell arrived on [[Guam]] to coordinate the project with the local commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his tasks was to brief [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vucanovich|Cafferata|2005|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell was joined by [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R. Purnell]], who represented the Military Liaison Committee, and [[Captain (US Navy)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], the commander of [[Project Alberta]]. They became, informally, the "Tinian Joint Chiefs", with decision-making authority over the nuclear mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christman|1998|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell notified Groves that the [[Little Boy]] bomb would be ready for use on or about 3 August, weather permitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the space of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29  crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. Parsons raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that it might be a good idea. Farrell asked Parsons if he knew how to do it. "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, "but I've got all afternoon to learn."{{sfn|Lewis|Tolzer|1957|p=72}} After the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] on 6 August, Farrell, along with Generals [[Carl Spaatz]], [[Nathan Twining]], [[Barney Giles]] and [[James H. Davies]], debriefed Parsons, the aircrews and the observers, and sent Groves a detailed report.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell brought forward the date for the next attack because good weather was only predicted until 9 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Fat Man]] bomb, "To [[Hirohito]], with love and kisses, T. F. Farrell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footagefarm.co.uk/Footage%20Farm%20website/Web%20lists/atomic%20&amp;%20nuclear.htm |title=Atomic and Nuclear Footage |accessdate=16 June 2012 |publisher=Footage Farm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bomb was loaded on the B-29 ''[[Bockscar]]''. During pre-flight inspection, a fuel pump was found to be faulty, meaning that {{convert|800|usgal}} of fuel in the bomb bay tank could not be used, although it would have to be carried. Farrell took the difficult decision to continue the mission, in view of the worsening weather. This was only the first of a number of problems that faced the mission crews that day, but the mission was carried out successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=344–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrender of Japan on 14 August precluded further attacks. Groves had already directed Farrell to prepare teams to inspect the effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Farrell had begun assembling the required personnel and equipment. Farrell arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group, equipped with portable [[geiger counter]]s, that was headed by himself, and also included Brigadier General [[James B. Newman, Jr]] from the [[US Army Air Forces]], Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator, and Colonel [[Stafford L. Warren]], the head of the Manhattan District's Medical Section. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. They were greatly impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs, and the extensive Japanese preparations for the [[Operation Downfall|Allied invasion]] that had been planned prior to the surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|1966|pp=886–889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell was promoted to the rank of major general in October 1945. He remained Deputy Commander of the Manhattan Project until he retired from active service in April 1946.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; He was appointed chairman of the [[New York City Housing Authority]] by Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]] on [[Robert Moses]]'s recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|1974|p=763}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the war, providing public housing, especially for returning veterans, was a major priority for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=19 June 1948 |title=This is New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other projects of the time, New York City public housing was not [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]]. Writing in 1950, Farrell declared, "New York's public housing projects demonstrate that Negroes and whites can live together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ten Years of Interracial Housing |last=Farrell |first=Thomas F. |journal=[[Negro Digest]] |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |year=1950 |page=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a member of the evaluation board for [[Operation Crossroads]], and was an advisor to [[Bernard Baruch]], the United States' representative on the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]]. In 1950, during the [[Korean War]], Farrell returned to active duty with the Army once more, and served with the [[Defense Production Administration]]. In July 1951, he was transferred to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), the successor organization to the Manhattan Project, where he became the Assistant General Manager for Manufacturing.

He was notable for being the [[Assistant referee (association football)|linesman]] who helped to award a contentious goal for [[England national football team|England]] in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. As a referee earlier in the tournament, he drew attention for denying a Swiss goal in [[1966 FIFA World Cup#Group 2|a first-round game]] between [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

After his death in 1993, Azerbaijan's then national stadium was renamed the [[Tofiq Bahramov Stadium]] in his honour.

==Career==
Bahramov was originally a footballer playing for [[Neftchi Baku PFC|Neftchi Baku]], but a serious leg injury prevented him from continuing his playing career and he became a referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Сын Тофика Бахрамова рассказал о своем отце (Интервью)|url=http://www.azerifootball.com/ru/7/news/17162.html|work=Azerifootball.com|accessdate=16 April 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected onto the [[FIFA]] panel of referees in 1964. In the 1966 World Cup he officiated as a [[Assistant referee (association football)|linesman]] for both the opening match&lt;ref name=uksocenguru&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/1966/07/11/world/world-cup/england/uruguay/156853/?ICID=PL_MS_01|accessdate=7 Sep 2015|publisher=Soccerway|title=England vs. Uruguay 11 July 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1966 World Cup Final|Final]], and refereed a first round match. In the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] he officiated at three matches including a semi-final.&lt;ref name=uksoctbakh&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=7 Sep 2015|title=Azerbaijan - T.

==="Wembley Goal"===
 [[File:azereng.jpg|thumb|250px|right|English fans wearing  ''Bəhramov 66'' T-shirts. Tofiq Bahramov's son is standing in the middle.]] 
In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup Final]], with the score at 2&amp;ndash;2 and after 11 minutes of the first period of [[extra time]], [[Geoff Hurst]] of England fired a shot on goal which bounced off the crossbar sharply downwards, hit the ground, and then spun backwards away from the goal. There were some moments of indecision by referee [[Gottfried Dienst]] before he noticed that Bahramov, who was the linesman at that end of the ground, was signalling to him. Eventually, Dienst awarded a goal to England, who went on to win the game 4&amp;ndash;2.

The [[Ghost goal#1966 World Cup Final|decision to award the third England goal]] is still debated. In England, it is commonly believed that the decision was correct{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, while in [[Germany]] it is commonly said that Bahramov made a mistake, and the goal has entered the German vernacular, as any situation in which a ball hits the crossbar and is reflected downwards, landing just before or behind the goal line, is described as a "[[Ghost goal|Wembley-Tor]]". After the match, many newspapers referred to the "Russian linesman" who awarded the goal, as Azerbaijan was part of the [[Soviet Union]] at the time, and the nickname stuck to the point where his real name was all but forgotten.

According to the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], for a goal to be awarded, the ball must cross the goal line, with its full diameter behind the full width of the line. The Germans argue that if that were the case, the ball would likely have bounced from there into the net, not out on the field as it did. In addition, German players claimed to have seen chalk dust, which would indicate it was not a goal. The English counter by saying that the [[Wiktionary:backspin|back-spin]] put on the ball after hitting the crossbar could just as likely have caused the ball to bounce behind the line and then back out of the goal—as had happened in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs England|later match between the two countries]]. [[Roger Hunt]] claimed to have seen the ball bounce behind the line.

When Bahramov wrote his [[memoir]]s, he stated that he believed the ball had bounced back not from the crossbar, but from the net, so the further movement of the ball was already insignificant, and not visible for him either. Bahramov loved refereeing and the game of football in general, and described football matches as,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
duels...full of unforeseen turns and even real miracles. And who does not want to be a magician if even for just 90 minutes?{{citation needed|date=May 2007}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 1996 study by Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman ([[University of Oxford]]) came to the conclusion that the ball was at least 6&amp;nbsp;cm away from being a goal. Contrary to this however, on 4 January 2016, a review of the goal on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football concluded that the ball did in fact cross the line.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman: ''Goal-directed video metrology.'' In: Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Computer Vision, LNCS 1065, Cambridge 1996, Volume II, p. 647–658, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, DOI 10.1007/3-540-61123-1, available online [http://www.springerlink.com/content/phl4g247v51582k6/ here] or [http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/reid96.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Neftchi-Internazionale, 2012 (1).jpg|thumb|After his death in 1993, the national stadium of Azerbaijan was renamed the [[Tofiq Bahramov Stadium]].]]
The Azerbaijan [[national stadium]] in [[Baku]] is named the [[Tofiq Bahramov Stadium]] in his honour. It was renamed in 1993, shortly after Azeri independence and Bahramov's death, having previously been named after the Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].

When England were drawn in the same group as [[Azerbaijan]] in [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], a ceremony was held prior to the meeting at the stadium to honor his memory, with attendees including [[Geoff Hurst]], [[Michel Platini]] and [[Sepp Blatter]]. A statue of him was also unveiled at the ceremony and he became the first referee to have a stadium named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspi.az/news/print-599.html Abidəsi olan ilk hakim] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130807/http://www.kaspi.az/news/print-599.html |date=6 July 2011 }} {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xazar.info/2008/01/29/tofiq_b601hramovun_anadan_olmas305ndan_78_il_ke231ir.html Tofiq Bəhramovun anadan olmasından 78 il keçir]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same visit, his son Bahram Bahramov met representatives of the English fans and expressed his pleasure that the famous "Russian linesman" of 1966 had finally regained his true nationality. "Now that Azerbaijan is independent it’s very right for him to be remembered as a member of the Azeri nation. People like Tofiq Bahramov are only born once in a hundred years.”&lt;ref name="Azerbaijan v England"&gt;[http://www.chrishunt.biz/englandcolumns02.html ''Azerbaijan v England''] article by [[Chris Hunt]] published in ''Football First'' newspaper, 17 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"too big to fail"''' theory asserts that certain corporations, particularly financial institutions, are so large and so interconnected that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system, and that they therefore must be supported by government when they face potential failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2040921|title=Too Big to Fail, Too Blind to See|publisher=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquial term "too big to fail" was popularized by [[U.S. Congress]]man [[Stewart McKinney (politician)|Stewart McKinney]] in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]'s intervention with [[Continental Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/weekinreview/21dash.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=If It's Too Big to Fail, Is It Too Big to Exist?|last=Dash|first=Eric|work=New York Times|date=2009-06-20|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had previously been used occasionally in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Too big to fail: the hazards of bank bailouts|author1=[[Gary H.

Opponents believe that one of the problems that arises is [[moral hazard]] whereby a company that benefits from these protective policies will seek to profit by it, deliberately taking positions (see [[asset allocation]]) that are high-risk high-return, as they are able to leverage these risks based on the policy preference they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richmondfed.org/publications/economic_research/economic_quarterly/pdfs/spring2005/ennismalek.pdf |title=Bank Risk of Failure and the Too-Big-to-Fail Policy |format=PDF |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond |work=Economic Quarterly |volume=91/2 |date=Spring 2005 |last1=Ennis |first1=Huberto M. |last2=Malek |first2=H.S |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103151555/http://richmondfed.org/publications/economic_research/economic_quarterly/pdfs/spring2005/ennismalek.pdf |archivedate=November 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has emerged as prominent in public discourse since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007–08 global financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Adair.

==Definition==
Federal Reserve Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] also defined the term in 2010: "A too-big-to-fail firm is one whose size, complexity, interconnectedness, and critical functions are such that, should the firm go unexpectedly into liquidation, the rest of the financial system and the economy would face severe adverse consequences." He continued that: "Governments provide support to too-big-to-fail firms in a crisis not out of favoritism or particular concern for the management, owners, or creditors of the firm, but because they recognize that the consequences for the broader economy of allowing a disorderly failure greatly outweigh the costs of avoiding the failure in some way. Common means of avoiding failure include facilitating a merger, providing credit, or injecting government capital, all of which protect at least some creditors who otherwise would have suffered losses. ... If the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis]] has a single lesson, it is that the too-big-to-fail problem must be solved."&lt;ref name="BernankeFCIC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm |title=Bernanke-Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernanke cited several risks with too-big-to-fail institutions:&lt;ref name="BernankeFCIC1" /&gt;
# These firms generate severe [[moral hazard]]: "If creditors believe that an institution will not be allowed to fail, they will not demand as much compensation for risks as they otherwise would, thus weakening market discipline; nor will they invest as many resources in monitoring the firm's risk-taking. As a result, too-big-to-fail firms will tend to take more risk than desirable, in the expectation that they will receive assistance if their bets go bad."
# It creates an uneven playing field between big and small firms. "This unfair competition, together with the incentive to grow that too-big-to-fail provides, increases risk and artificially raises the market share of too-big-to-fail firms, to the detriment of economic efficiency as well as financial stability."
# The firms themselves become major risks to overall financial stability, particularly in the absence of adequate resolution tools. Bernanke wrote: "The failure of Lehman Brothers and the near-failure of several other large, complex firms significantly worsened the crisis and the recession by disrupting financial markets, impeding credit flows, inducing sharp declines in asset prices, and hurting confidence. The failures of smaller, less interconnected firms, though certainly of significant concern, have not had substantial effects on the stability of the financial system as a whole."&lt;ref name="BernankeFCIC1" /&gt;

==Background on banking regulation==

===Depository banks===
Prior to the [[Great Depression]], U.S. consumer bank deposits were not guaranteed by the government, increasing the risk of a [[bank run]], in which a large number of depositors withdraw their deposits at the same time. Since banks lend most of the deposits and only retain a fraction in the proverbial vault, a bank run can render the bank insolvent. During the Depression, hundreds of banks became insolvent and depositors lost their money. As a result, the U.S. enacted the [[1933 Banking Act]], sometimes called the [[Glass–Steagall legislation|Glass–Steagall Act]], which created the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) to insure deposits up to a limit of $2,500, with successive increases to the current $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/dis/ FDIC Deposit Insurance Summary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118192945/http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/dis/ |date=2013-11-18 }} Retrieved November 17, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for the deposit insurance provided by the federal government, depository banks are highly regulated and expected to invest excess customer deposits in lower-risk assets.&lt;ref name="Krugman Reg1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Why We Regulate|last=Krugman |first=Paul|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/opinion/krugman-why-we-regulate.html?_r=0
|date=May 13, 2012 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment banks and the shadow banking system===
In contrast to depository banks, investment banks generally obtain funds from sophisticated investors and often make complex, risky investments with the funds, speculating either for their own account or on behalf of their investors. They also are "market makers" in that they serve as intermediaries between two investors that wish to take opposite sides of a financial transaction. The Glass-Steagall Act separated investment and depository banking until its repeal in 1999. Prior to 2008, the government did not explicitly guarantee the investor funds, so investment banks were not subject to the same regulations as depository banks and were allowed to take considerably more risk.

Investment banks, along with other innovations in banking and finance referred to as the [[shadow banking system]], grew to rival the depository system by 2007. They became subject to the equivalent of a bank run in 2007 and 2008, in which investors (rather than depositors) withdrew sources of financing from the shadow system. This run became known as the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. During 2008, the five largest U.S. investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were bought out by other banks at fire-sale prices (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or were at risk of failure and obtained depository banking charters to obtain additional Federal Reserve support (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). In addition, the government provided bailout funds via the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1401882|title=Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007|publisher=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zandi 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zandi|first=Mark|year=2010|title=Financial Shock |publisher=FT Press|isbn=978-0-13-701663-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] described in November 2013 how the [[Panic of 1907]] was essentially a run on the non-depository financial system, with many parallels to the crisis of 2008. One of the results of the Panic of 1907 was the creation of the [[Federal Reserve]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20131108a.htm Ben Bernanke-The Crisis as a Classic Financial Panic-November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution authority===
Before 1950, U.S. federal bank regulators had essentially two options for resolving an [[insolvency|insolvent]] institution: 1) closure, with [[liquidation|liquidation of assets]] and payouts for [[Deposit insurance|insured depositors]]; or 2) purchase and assumption, encouraging the acquisition of assets and assumption of [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] by another firm. A third option was made available by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950]]: providing assistance, the power to support an institution through loans or direct federal acquisition of assets, until it could recover from its distress.&lt;ref name="marriottschool.byu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/HBH/mba624/Commercial%20Banking%20Regulation.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Heaton|first1=Hal B.|last2=Riegger|first2=Christopher|title=Commercial Banking Regulation – Class discussion notes|publisher=marriottschool.byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute limited the "assistance" option to cases where "continued operation of the bank is essential to provide adequate banking service". Regulators shunned this third option for many years, fearing that if regionally or nationally important banks were thought generally immune to liquidation, markets in their shares would be distorted. Thus, the assistance option was never employed during the period 1950–1969, and very seldom thereafter.&lt;ref name="marriottschool.byu.edu" /&gt; Research into historical banking trends suggests that the consumption loss associated with National Banking Era bank runs was far more costly than the consumption loss from stock market crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2011/wp2011_15.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|title=The Cost of Banking Panics in an Age before "Too Big to Fail" |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act]] was passed in 1991, giving the FDIC the responsibility to rescue an insolvent bank by the least costly method. The Act had the implicit goal of eliminating the widespread belief among depositors that a loss of depositors and bondholders will be prevented for large banks. However, the Act included an exception in cases of systemic risk, subject to the approval of two-thirds of the FDIC Board of Directors, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Treasury Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Christine|last2=Craig|first2=Valentine V.|year=2007|title=Privatizing Deposit Insurance: Results of the 2006 FDIC Study|periodical=FDIC Quarterly|volume=1|issue=2|pages=23–32|url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/quarterly/2007_vol1_2/privatizing_deposit_insurance.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===Bank size and concentration===
[[File:Assets of Largest U.S. Banks.png|thumb|Assets of largest U.S. banks per FY2012 Annual Reports]]
[[File:5-Bank Asset Concentration in U.S. 1997-2012.png|thumb|Percentage of banking assets held by largest five U.S. banks, 1997–2011]]

Bank size, complexity, and interconnectedness with other banks may inhibit the ability of the government to resolve (wind-down) the bank without significant disruption to the financial system or economy, as occurred with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008. This risk of "too big to fail" entities increases the likelihood of a government bailout using taxpayer dollars.&lt;ref name="Zandi 2010"/&gt;

The largest U.S. banks continue to grow larger while the concentration of bank assets increases. The largest six U.S. banks had assets of $9,576 billion as of year-end 2012, per their 2012 annual reports (SEC Form 10K). For scale, this was 59% of the U.S. GDP for 2012 of $16,245 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=GDP|title=Graph: Gross Domestic Product|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB|title=5-Bank Asset Concentration for United States|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concentration continued despite the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and its aftermath. During March 2008, JP Morgan Chase acquired investment bank Bear Stearns. Bank of America acquired investment bank Merrill Lynch in September 2008. Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia in January 2009. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley obtained depository bank holding company charters, which gave them access to additional Federal Reserve credit lines.&lt;ref name="Zandi 2010" /&gt;

Bank deposits for all U.S. banks ranged between approximately 60–70% of GDP from 1960 to 2006, then jumped during the crisis to a peak of nearly 84% in 2009 before falling to 77% by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=146141&amp;category_id=8666|title=FRED Graph|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of U.S. commercial and savings bank institutions reached a peak of 14,495 in 1984; this fell to 6,532 by the end of 2010. The ten largest U.S. banks held nearly 50% of U.S. deposits as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/11/11/419-438Wheelock.pdf|format=PDF|first=David|last=Wheelock|title=Banking Industry Consolidation and Market Structure |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |work=Review |date=November–December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit guarantee subsidy===
Since the full amount of the deposits and debts of "too big to fail" banks are effectively guaranteed by the government, large depositors and investors view investments with these banks as a safer investment than deposits with smaller banks. Therefore, large banks are able to pay lower interest rates to depositors and investors than small banks are obliged to pay.

In October 2009, [[Sheila Bair]], at that time the Chairperson of the FDIC, commented:
: "'Too big to fail' has become worse. It's become explicit when it was implicit before. It creates competitive disparities between large and small institutions, because everybody knows small institutions can fail. So it's more expensive for them to raise capital and secure funding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiseman|first1=Paul|author2=Gogoi Pallavi|title=FDIC chief: Small banks can't compete with bailed-out giants|date=2009-10-19|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2009-10-19-FDIC-chief-sheila-bair-banking_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that banking organizations are willing to pay an added premium for mergers that will put them over the asset sizes that are commonly viewed as the thresholds for being too big to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-05.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City|title=How Much Would Banks Be Willing to Pay to Become "Too-Big-to-Fail" and to Capture Other Benefits?|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] found that the difference between the [[Cost of Funds Index|cost of funds]] for banks with more than $100 billion in assets and the cost of funds for smaller banks widened dramatically after the formalization of the "too big to fail" policy in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Dean|authorlink1=Dean Baker|author2=Travis McArthur|date=September 2009|title=The Value of the 'Too Big to Fail' Big Bank Subsidy|publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] Issue Brief|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/too-big-to-fail-subsidy/|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in the large banks' cost of funds was in effect equivalent to an indirect "too big to fail" subsidy of $34 billion per year to the 18 U.S. banks with more than $100 billion in assets.

The editors of Bloomberg View estimated there was an $83 billion annual subsidy to the 10 largest United States banks, reflecting a funding advantage of 0.8 percentage points due to implicit government support, meaning the profits of such banks are largely a taxpayer-backed illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/29/reducing-the-impact-of-too-big-to-fail/#more-170457|title=Reducing the Impact of Too Big to Fail|author=Phillip Swagel |work=The New York Times|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-20/why-should-taxpayers-give-big-banks-83-billion-a-year-.html |title=Why Should Taxpayers Give Big Banks $83 Billion a Year? |publisher=Bloomberg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104025319/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-20/why-should-taxpayers-give-big-banks-83-billion-a-year-.html |archivedate=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-01/how-to-know-when-we-ve-ended-the-83-billion-bank-subsidy.html |title=How to Know When We've Ended the $83 Billion Bank Subsidy |publisher=Bloomberg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202072505/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-01/how-to-know-when-we-ve-ended-the-83-billion-bank-subsidy.html |archivedate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study by Frederic Schweikhard and Zoe Tsesmelidakis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1573377|title=The Impact of Government Interventions on CDS and Equity Markets|publisher=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the amount saved by America's biggest banks from having a perceived safety net of a government bailout was $120 billion from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name=greeley&gt;Brendan Greeley, [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-07-05/the-price-of-too-big-to-fail "The Price of Too Big to Fail"] ''BusinessWeek'', 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For America's biggest banks the estimated savings was $53 billion for [[Citigroup]], $32 billion for [[Bank of America]], $10 billion for [[JPMorgan]], $8 billion for [[Wells Fargo]], and $4 billion for [[AIG]]. The study noted that passage of the [[Dodd–Frank Act]]—which promised an end to bailouts—did nothing to raise the [[Interest|price of credit]] (i.e., lower the implicit subsidy) for the "too-big-too-fail" institutions.&lt;ref name=greeley/&gt;

One 2013 study (Acharya, Anginer, and Warburton) measured the funding cost advantage provided by implicit government support to large financial institutions. Credit spreads were lower by approximately 28 basis points (0.28%) on average over the 1990–2010 period, with a peak of more than 120 basis points in 2009. In 2010, the implicit subsidy was worth nearly $100 billion to the largest banks. The authors concluded: "Passage of Dodd–Frank did not eliminate expectations of government support."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/the-treasurys-mistaken-view-on-too-big-to-fail/|title=The Treasury's Mistaken View on Too Big to Fail|author1=Simon Johnson |author2=John E. Parsons  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=The New York Times|date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Randall S. Kroszner]] summarized several approaches to evaluating the funding cost differential between large and small banks. The paper discusses methodology and does not specifically answer the question of whether larger institutions have an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/randall.kroszner/research/pdf/Kroszner%20Bank%20Funding%20Cost%20Difs%20Nov%202013.pdf|format=PDF|first=Randall|last=Krozner|title=A Review of Bank Funding Cost Differentials|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2013, the Moody's credit rating agency reported that it would no longer assume the eight largest U.S. banks would receive government support in the event they faced bankruptcy. However, the GAO reported that politicians and regulators would still face significant pressure to bail out large banks and their creditors in the event of a financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Whitehouse, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-15/moody-s-thinks-we-ve-solved-too-big-to-fail.html "Moody's Thinks We've Solved Too Big to Fail"], Bloomberg, November 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have argued that "The way things are now banks reap profits if their trades pan out, but taxpayers can be stuck picking up the tab if their big bets sink the company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dash|first=Eric|title=If It's Too Big to Fail, Is It Too Big to Exist?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/weekinreview/21dash.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as discussed by Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], if taxpayers are contributing to rescue these companies from bankruptcy, they "should be rewarded for assuming the risk by sharing in the gains that result from this government bailout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanders|first=Bernie|title=Billions for Bailouts!

In this sense, [[Alan Greenspan]] affirms that, "Failure is an integral part, a necessary part of a market system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKee|first=Michael|title=Greenspan Says U.S. Should Consider Breaking Up Large Banks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aJ8HPmNUfchg|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby, although the financial institutions that were bailed out were indeed important to the financial system, the fact that they took risk beyond what they would otherwise, should be enough for the Government to let them face the consequences of their actions. It would have been a lesson to motivate institutions to proceed differently next time.

===Inability to prosecute===
The political power of large banks and risks of economic impact from major prosecutions has led to use of the term "too big to jail" regarding the leaders of large financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedkaufman/2013/07/29/why-doj-deemed-bank-execs-too-big-to-jail/|title=Why DOJ Deemed Bank Execs Too Big To Jail|author=Ted Kaufman|date=29 July 2013|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2013, [[United States Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] testified to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] that the size of large financial institutions has made it difficult for the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to bring criminal charges when they are suspected of crimes, because such charges can threaten the existence of a bank and therefore their interconnectedness may endanger the national or global economy. "Some of these institutions have become too large," Holder told the Committee, "It has an inhibiting impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate," contradicting earlier written testimony from a deputy assistant attorney general who defended the Justice Department's "vigorous enforcement against wrongdoing".&lt;ref name=Mattingly&gt;{{cite news|last=Mattingly|first=Phil|title=Too-Big-to-Fail Banks Limit Prosecutor Options, Holder Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-06/too-big-to-fail-banks-limit-prosecutor-options-holder-testifies.html|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holder|first=Eric|title=Testimony to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpjFn7B4D5g|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=13 April 2013|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holder has financial ties to at least one law firm benefiting from ''de facto'' immunity to prosecution, and prosecution rates against crimes by large financial institutions are at 20-year lows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyer|first=Peter J.|title=Why Can't Obama Bring Wall Street to Justice?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/05/06/why-can-t-obama-bring-wall-street-to-justice.html|accessdate=13 April 2013|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days later, [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] President [[Richard W. Fisher]] and Vice-President Harvey Rosenblum co-authored a ''Wall Street Journal'' op-ed about the failure of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] to provide for adequate regulation of large financial institutions. In advance of his March 8 speech to the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], Fisher proposed requiring [[Divestment|breaking up]] large banks into smaller banks so that they are "too small to save," advocating the withholding from mega-banks access to both [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|Federal Deposit Insurance]] and [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] [[discount window]], and requiring disclosure of this lack of federal insurance and [[financial solvency]] support to their customers. This was the first time such a proposal had been made by a high-ranking U.S. banking official or a prominent conservative.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite news|title=Fisher and Rosenblum: How to Shrink the 'Too-Big-to-Fail' Banks|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578344652647097278|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=March 10, 2013|author=Richard W.

In a January 29, 2013 letter to Holder, Senators [[Sherrod Brown]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[List of United States Senators from Ohio|OH]]) and [[Charles Grassley]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[List of United States Senators from Iowa|IA]]) had criticized this Justice Department policy citing "important questions about the Justice Department's prosecutorial philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/untouchables/senators-bash-doj-for-evasive-response-on-too-big-to-jail/ |title=Senators Bash DOJ for "Evasive" Response on "Too Big To Jail" |last=Breslow |first=Jason |date=March 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receipt of a [[United States Department of Justice|DoJ]] response letter, Brown and Grassley issued a statement saying, "The Justice Department's response is aggressively evasive.

==Solutions==
The proposed solutions to the "too big to fail" issue are controversial. Some options include breaking up the banks, introducing regulations to reduce risk, adding higher bank taxes for larger institutions, and increasing monitoring through oversight committees.

===Breaking up the largest banks===
More than fifty economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions.&lt;ref name="Ritholtz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Economists and Financial Experts Say We Must Break Up the Giant Banks|url=http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2013/03/top-economists-and-financial-experts-say-we-must-break-up-the-giant-banks/|work=The Big Picture|publisher=Ritholtz.com|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is advocated both to limit risk to the financial system posed by the largest banks as well as to limit their political influence.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/miles-mogulescu/does-size-matter-simon-jo_b_534699.html|title=Does Size Matter? Simon Johnson vs. Paul Krugman on Whether to Break Up "Too Big to Fail" Banks|work=The Huffington Post |date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in 2009 that: "In the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, large banks have been responsible for the bulk of the [bailout] cost to taxpayers. America has let 106 smaller banks go bankrupt this year alone. It's the mega-banks that present the mega-costs ... banks that are too big to fail are too big to exist. If they continue to exist, they must exist in what is sometimes called a "utility" model, meaning that they are heavily regulated." He also wrote about several causes of the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis]] related to the size, incentives, and interconnection of the mega-banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/too-big-to-live|title=Joseph E. Stiglitz on Too Big to Live |work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing risk-taking through regulation===
{{Main|Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act}}
[[File:Goldman Sachs - Leverage Ratio 2003-2012.png|thumb|The leverage ratio, measured as debt divided by equity, for investment bank Goldman Sachs from 2003–2012. The lower the ratio, the greater the ability of the firm to withstand losses.]]

The United States passed the Dodd–Frank Act in July 2010 to help strengthen regulation of the financial system in the wake of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] that began in 2007. Dodd–Frank requires banks to reduce their risk taking, by requiring greater financial cushions (i.e., lower leverage ratios or higher capital ratios), among other steps.

Banks are required to maintain a ratio of high-quality, easily sold assets, in the event of financial difficulty either at the bank or in the financial system. These are capital requirements. Further, since the 2008 crisis, regulators have worked with banks to reduce leverage ratios. For example, the leverage ratio for investment bank Goldman Sachs declined from a peak of 25.2 during 2007 to 11.4 in 2012, indicating a much-reduced risk profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/annual-reports/2012-annual-report.html Goldman Sachs-Annual Report 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419005030/http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/annual-reports/2012-annual-report.html |date=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodd–Frank Act includes a form of the [[Volcker Rule]], a proposal to ban proprietary trading by commercial banks. Proprietary trading refers to using customer deposits to speculate in risky assets for the benefit of the bank rather than customers. The Dodd–Frank Act as enacted into law includes several loopholes to the ban, allowing proprietary trading in certain circumstances. However, the regulations required to enforce these elements of the law were not implemented during 2013 and were under attack by bank lobbying efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324662404578330563892792982?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Volcker Rule Could be Delayed – Again |work=Wall Street Journal |date=27 February 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013 |first=Scott |last=Patterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/a-roadmap-of-the-shadow-banks-plus-targeting-the-volcker-rule/|title=A Roadmap of the Shadow Banks, plus targeting the Volcker Rule|work=Rortybomb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/04/too_big_to_fail_in_two_dimensi.html|title=Too big to fail in two dimensions|work=The Washington Post|author=Ezra Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major banking regulation, the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] from 1933, was effectively repealed in 1999. The repeal allowed depository banks to enter into additional lines of business. Senators John McCain and Elizabeth Warren proposed bringing back Glass-Steagall during 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-11/warren-joins-mccain-to-push-new-glass-steagall-bill-for-banks.html|title=Warren Joins McCain to Push New Glass-Steagall Law for Banks|author=Carter Dougherty|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Too big to fail tax===
Economist [[Willem Buiter]] proposes a tax to internalize the massive costs inflicted by "too big to fail" institution. "When size creates externalities, do what you would do with any negative externality: tax it. The other way to limit size is to tax size. This can be done through capital requirements that are progressive in the size of the business (as measured by value added, the size of the balance sheet or some other metric). Such measures for preventing the New Darwinism of the survival of the fittest and the politically best connected should be distinguished from regulatory interventions based on the narrow leverage ratio aimed at regulating risk (regardless of size, except for a de minimis lower limit)."&lt;ref name='WB'&gt;{{cite news|first=Willem|last=Buiter|title=Too big to fail is too big|date=June 24, 2009|url=http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/06/too-big-to-fail-is-too-big/|work=The Financial Times|accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring===
{{Main|Systemically important financial institution}}
On November 4, 2011, a policy research and development entity, called the [[Financial Stability Board]], released a list of 29 banks worldwide that they considered "systemically important financial institutions"—financial organisations whose size ''and role'' meant that any failure could cause serious systemic problems. Of the list, 16 are based in Europe, nine in North America, and four in Asia:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Measures to Address Systemically Important Financial Institutions|publisher=Financial Stability Board|url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104bb.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-11-04|date=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable views on the issue==
===Economists===
More than fifty notable economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions.&lt;ref name="Ritholtz"/&gt; (See also [[Divestment]].)

Some economists such as [[Paul Krugman]] hold that [[economies of scale]] in banks and in other businesses are worth preserving, so long as they are well regulated in proportion to their economic clout, and therefore that "too big to fail" status can be acceptable. The global economic system must also deal with sovereign states being too big to fail. Krugman wrote in January 2010 that it was more important to reduce bank risk taking (leverage) than to break them up.&lt;ref name="Financial Reform 101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stop 'Stop Too Big To Fail'."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Too big to fail FAIL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krugman.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;

Economist [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] has advocated both increased regulation as well as breaking up the larger banks, not only to protect the financial system but to reduce the political power of the largest banks.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/sadly-too-big-to-fail-is-not-over/|title=Sadly, Too Big to Fail Is Not Over|author=Simon Johnson|work=The New York Times|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politicians===
One of the most vocal opponents in the United States government of the "too big to fail" status of large American financial institutions in recent years has been [[Elizabeth Warren]]. At her first U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on February 14, 2013, Senator Warren pressed several banking regulators to answer when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial.'" Videos of Warren's questioning, centering on "too big to fail", became popular on the internet, amassing more than 1 million views in a matter of days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senator Warren's rebuke of regulators goes viral|author=Lynch, S. N.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/19/sec-petition-warren-idUSL1N0BJ9CD20130219|publisher=Reuters|date=19 February 2013|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2013, [[United States Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] told the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] that the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] faces difficulty charging large banks with crimes because of the risk to the economy.&lt;ref name=Mattingly /&gt; Four days later, [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] President [[Richard W. Fisher]] wrote in advance of a speech to the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] that large banks should be [[Divestment|broken up]] into smaller banks, and both [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|Federal Deposit Insurance]] and [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] [[discount window]] access should end for large banks.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; Other conservatives including [[Thomas Hoenig]], [[Ed Prescott]], [[Glenn Hubbard (economist)|Glenn Hubbard]], and [[David Vitter]] also advocated breaking up the largest banks.&lt;ref name=Dayen /&gt;&lt;ref name=YglesiasWhat /&gt;

===International organizations===
On April 10, 2013, [[International Monetary Fund]] Managing Director [[Christine Lagarde]] told the [[Economic Club of New York]] "too big to fail" banks had become "more dangerous than ever" and had to be controlled with "comprehensive and clear regulation [and] more intensive and intrusive supervision".&lt;ref name=upi&gt;United Press International [http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2013/04/11/Lagarde-Too-big-to-fail-banks-dangerous/UPI-20951365663600/ (UPI), "Lagarde: 'Too big to fail' banks 'dangerous'"] Retrieved April 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other commentators ===
[[Ron Suskind]] claimed in his book ''[[Confidence Men]]'' that the administration of [[Barack Obama]] considered breaking up [[Citibank]] and other large banks that had been involved in the financial crisis of 2008. He said that Obama's staff, such as [[Timothy Geithner]], refused to do so. The administration and Geithner have denied this version of events.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Landler, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/us/politics/suskinds-confidence-men-details-recession-dissension.html?_r=2&amp;ref=politics "Book Details Dissension in Obama Economic Team"], ''New York Times'', September 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/19/ap/business/main20108361.shtml Geithner denies ignoring Obama's request on banks] Associated Press, via CBSnews.com, September 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mervyn King (economist)|Mervyn King]], the governor of the [[Bank of England]] during 2003–2013, called for cutting "too big to fail" banks down to size, as a solution to the problem of banks having taxpayer-funded guarantees for their speculative investment banking activities. "If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then, in the words of a distinguished American economist, they are too big. It is not sensible to allow large banks to combine high street retail banking with risky investment banking or funding strategies, and then provide an implicit state guarantee against failure."&lt;ref name='N000222'&gt;{{cite news|first=Jill|last=Treanor|title=King calls for banks to be 'cut down to size'|date=2009-06-17|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/17/king-in-bank-reform-call|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-06-18|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alistair Darling]] disagreed; "Many people talk about how to deal with the big banks – banks so important to the financial system that they cannot be allowed to fail, but the solution is not as simple, as some have suggested, as restricting the size of the banks". &lt;ref name='N000222' /&gt; As well, [[Alan Greenspan]] said that "If they're too big to fail, they're too big," suggesting U.S. regulators to consider breaking up large financial institutions considered "too big to fail". He added, "I don't think merely raising the fees or capital on large institutions or taxing them is enough ... they'll absorb that, they'll work with that, and it's totally inefficient and they'll still be using the savings." &lt;ref name="N000333" /&gt;

==Public opinion polls==
Gallup reported in June 2013 that: "Americans' confidence in U.S. banks increased to 26% in June, up from the record low of 21% the previous year. The percentage of Americans saying they have "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in U.S. banks is now at its highest point since June 2008, but remains well below its pre-recession level of 41%, measured in June 2007. Between 2007 and 2012, confidence in banks fell by half—20 percentage points." Gallup also reported that: "When Gallup first measured confidence in banks in 1979, 60% of Americans had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in them—second only to the church. This high level of confidence, which hasn't been matched since, was likely the result of the strong U.S. banking system established after the 1930s Great Depression and the related efforts of banks and regulators to build Americans' confidence in that system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/163073/americans-confidence-banks-first-time-years.aspx|title=Americans' Confidence in Banks Up for First Time in Years|publisher=Gallup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying by banking industry==
In the USA, the banking industry spent over $100 million lobbying politicians and regulators between January 1 and June 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/wall-street-continues-to-spend-big-on-lobbying/?_r=0|title=Wall Street Continues to Spend Big on Lobbying|author=Ben Protess|work=The New York Times|date=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbying in the finance, insurance and real estate industries has risen annually since 1998 and was approximately $500 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indus.php?id=F&amp;year=2013|title=Lobbying Spending Database Finance, Insurance &amp; Real Estate, 2013 |publisher=OpenSecrets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==
Prior to the 2008 failure and bailout of multiple firms, there were "too big to fail" examples from 1763 when [[Leendert Pieter de Neufville]] in Amsterdam and [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]] in Berlin failed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schnabel |first=Isabel |last2=Shin |first2=Hyun Song |author2link=Hyun-Song Shin |title=Liquidity and Contagion: The Crisis of 1763 |journal=[[Journal of the European Economic Association]] |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=929–968 |year=2004 |doi=10.1162/1542476042813887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from
the 1980s and 1990s. These included Continental Illinois and [[Long-Term Capital Management]].

===Continental Illinois case===
An early example of a bank rescued because it was "too big to fail" was the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company during the 1980s.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

====Distress====
The [[Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company]] experienced a fall in its overall asset quality during the early 1980s. Tight money, [[Economic history of Mexico#1982 crisis and recovery|Mexico's default (1982)]] and plunging oil prices followed a period when the bank had aggressively pursued commercial lending business, Latin American [[syndicated loan]] business, and loan participation in the energy sector. Complicating matters further, the bank's funding mix was heavily dependent on large [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] and foreign [[money market]]s, which meant its depositors were more risk-averse than average retail depositors in the US.

====Payments crisis====
The bank held significant participation in highly speculative oil and gas loans of Oklahoma's [[Penn Square Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;''Belly Up'', Phillip Zweig, Ballantine Books, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; When Penn Square failed in July 1982, the Continental's distress became acute, culminating with press rumors of failure and an investor-and-depositor [[bank run|run]] in early May 1984. In the first week of the run, the [[Federal Reserve System|Fed]] permitted the Continental Illinois [[discount window]] credits on the order of $3.6 billion. Still in significant distress, the management obtained a further $4.5 billion in credits from a syndicate of money center banks the following week. These measures failed to stop the run, and regulators were confronted with a crisis.

====Regulatory crisis====
The seventh-largest bank in the nation by deposits would very shortly be unable to meet its obligations. Regulators faced a tough decision about how to resolve the matter. Of the three options available, only two were seriously considered. Even banks much smaller than the Continental were deemed unsuitable for resolution by liquidation, owing to the disruptions this would have inevitably caused. The normal course would be to seek a purchaser (and indeed press accounts that such a search was underway contributed to Continental depositors' fears in 1984). However, in the tight-money [[Early 1980s recession|financial climate]] of the early 1980s, no purchaser was forthcoming.

Besides generic concerns of size, contagion of depositor panic and bank distress, regulators feared the significant disruption of national payment and settlement systems. Of special concern was the wide network of correspondent banks with high percentages of their capital invested in the Continental Illinois. Essentially, the bank was deemed "too big to fail," and the "provide assistance" option was reluctantly taken. The dilemma then became how to provide assistance without significantly unbalancing the nation's banking system.

====Stopping the run====
To prevent immediate [[Insolvency|failure]], the Federal Reserve announced categorically that it would meet any [[liquidity]] needs the Continental might have, while the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) gave depositors and general creditors a full guarantee (not subject to the $100,000 FDIC deposit-insurance limit) and provided direct assistance of $2 billion (including participations). Money center banks assembled an additional $5.3 billion unsecured facility pending a resolution and resumption of more-normal business. These measures slowed, but did not stop, the outflow of deposits.

====Controversy====
In a [[United States Senate]] hearing afterwards, the then [[Comptroller of the Currency]] [[C. T. Conover]] defended his position by admitting the regulators will not let the largest 11 banks fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conover|first1=Charles|year=1984|chapter=Testimony|title=Inquiry Into the Continental Illinois Corp. and Continental National Bank: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation, and Insurance of the Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives, 98th Congress, 2nd Session, 18–19 September and 4 October|pages=98–111|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-Term Capital Management===
{{Main|Long-Term Capital Management}}
Long-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) was a hedge fund management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that utilized absolute-return trading strategies combined with high financial leverage. The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998 among 14 financial institutions for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.

LTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a "new method to determine the value of derivatives". Initially successful with annualized returns of over 40% (after fees) in its first years, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months following the Russian financial crisis requiring financial intervention by the Federal Reserve, with the fund liquidating and dissolving in early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World |last=Greenspan |first=Alan |year=2007 |pages=193–95 |isbn=978-1-59420-131-8 |publisher=The Penguin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International==

===Canada===
{{main|Big Five (banks)}}
In March 2013, the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]] announced that Canada's six largest banks, the [[Bank of Montreal]], the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]], the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]], [[National Bank of Canada]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]] and [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]], were too big to fail. Those six banks accounted for 90% of banking assets in Canada at that time. It noted that "the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered, and relative importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank (National)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2013/03/26/osfi-banks-capital.html |title=Canada's big 6 banks are too big to fail, regulator says |publisher=CBC |date=2013-03-26 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Despite the government's assurances, opposition parties and some media commentators in New Zealand say that the largest banks are too big to fail and have an implicit government guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author='+nick_name+' |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10873256 |title=Bernard Hickey: Still too big to fail |work=New Zealand Herald |date=2013-03-24 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The previous British Chancellor (finance minister) [[George Osborne]] has threatened to break up banks which are too big to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.firedoglake.com/2013/02/04/british-might-end-too-big-to-fail-banking/ |title=British Might End Too Big To Fail Banking |publisher=News.firedoglake.com |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The too-big-to-fail idea has led to legislators and governments facing the challenge of limiting the scope of these hugely important organisations, and regulating activities perceived as risky or speculative—to achieve this regulation in the UK, banks are advised to follow the UK's Independent Commission on Banking Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videocentric.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-Video-Conferencing-Finance-part-1-VideoCentric-WHTPP-INVFINP1-1.0.pdf |title=Video Communications &amp; Investment Banking, Part 1: Restructuring in response to bank breakup |publisher=Videocentric.co.uk |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}
The [[Tour de France]] was not held during [[World War II]] because the organisers refused German requests. Although a 1940 Tour de France had been announced earlier, the outbreak of the war made it impossible for it to be held. After that, some attempts were made by the Germans during the war to have a Tour de France to maintain the sense of normality, but ''[[l'Auto]]'', the organising newspaper, refused. Some other races were run as a replacement.

After World War II, ''l'Auto'' was closed for collaborating with the Germans. The rights to organise the Tour went to the French government. As two newspapers were interested in these rights, they each organised a small Tour of five stages; the race run by ''[[L'Équipe]]'' was considered the more successful, so ''L'Équipe'' was allowed to organise the [[1947 Tour de France]].

==History==
Already before the war, the political situation in Europe had its influence on the Tour de France. Political reasons caused Italy, Germany and Spain to refuse to send teams to France for the [[1939 Tour de France]].&lt;ref&gt;McGann, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1938 Tour de France]] winner, [[Gino Bartali]], was among those affected. [[Henri Desgrange]], the original race organizer, and [[Jacques Goddet]], his deputy and replacement,&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Desgrange died on 16 August 1940 having abandoned his race the previous year while suffering the effects of an operation.&lt;/ref&gt; announced plans for a Tour de France in August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;McGann, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Races planned or held during the Occupation==

===1940 Tour de France===
Henri Desgrange planned a Tour for 1940, after war had started but before France had been invaded. The route, approved by military authorities, included a route along the [[Maginot Line]].&lt;ref name="The Bicycle, UK, 8 July 1943, p6"&gt;The Bicycle, UK, 8 July 1943, p6&lt;/ref&gt; Teams would have been drawn from military units in France, including the British, who would have been organised by a journalist, Bill Mills.&lt;ref name="The Bicycle, UK, 8 July 1943, p6"/&gt; The plans were dropped after the German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Dauncey, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The records and paperwork of the Tour were taken south to keep them safe but were never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;McGann, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="God1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goddet, Jacques|year=1991|title=L'Équipée Belle|publisher=Laffont, Paris|isbn=2-221-07290-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desgrange died in August 1940, and his successor, Jacques Goddet, initially wanted to organise the Tour during the war, arguing that sport should remain neutral.&lt;ref name="Thompson79"&gt;Thompson, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===1941 Tour de France===
In 1941, the newspaper ''[[Paris-Soir]]'', run by Germans, tried to persuade ''l'Auto'' to coorganize the Tour, but Goddet did not accept.&lt;ref name="Thompson79" /&gt;

===1942 Tour de France===
The German Propaganda Staffel wanted the Tour to be run and offered facilities otherwise denied, in the hope of maintaining a sense of normality.&lt;ref name="God1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gann150"&gt;McGann, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; They offered to open the borders between German-occupied France in the north and the nominally independent [[Vichy France]] in the south, so that ''l'Auto'' could organize a Tour, together with ''La France Socialiste'', but Goddet refused.&lt;ref name="God1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeuf1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boeuf|first=Jean-Luc|author2=Léonard, Yves|year=2003|title=La République du Tour de France|language=French|publisher=Seuil, France|isbn=2-02-058073-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, in any case, in little position to run a race of that scale because many of the staff had left ''L'Auto'''s office in Paris to go south.&lt;ref name="God1"/&gt;

===1942 Circuit de France===
''La France Socialiste'', run by Jean Leulliot, Goddet's former colleague at ''L'Auto'', did not have the same reluctance, and organized the race on its own. Leulliot, who had been manager of the French team that won the Tour in 1937, had become head of sport at ''La France Socialiste'' which, despite its name, was a right-wing paper that sympathized with the Germans. Leulliot assembled sixty-nine riders for the race, the Circuit de France, which ran from 28 September to 4 October 1942. Over six stages and {{convert|1650|km|mi}}, it went from Paris to Paris via [[Le Mans]], [[Poitiers]], [[Limoges]], [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[St-Étienne]], [[Lyon]] and [[Dijon]].&lt;ref name="Thompson79" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeuf1" /&gt;

One of the riders, Émile Idée, told the writer and cyclist [[Jean Bobet]] that he had been threatened with the [[Gestapo]] if he didn't take part.&lt;ref name="Memoire1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/dossiers/dos_cyclismag_bobet_leulliot.php|title=Memoire du Cyclisme – Bobet Leulliot|language=French|accessdate=17 August 2010|publisher=Memoire du Cyclisme|author=Turgis, Dominique}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobet said: "I asked him to repeat it to see if I had understood. I was stunned [''dans la tête ça fait tilt'']!"&lt;ref name="Memoire1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JeanBobet"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean|last=Bobet|authorlink=Jean Bobet|year=2008|title=Le Vélo à l'Heure Allemande|language=French|publisher=La Table Ronde, France|isbn=978-2-7103-2983-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Circuit de France''' was organized between 28 September 1942 and 4 October 1942&lt;ref name="cyclingarchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclingarchives.com/voorloopfiche.php?wedstrijdvoorloopid=4739|title=Circuit de France 1942|publisher=Cyclingarchives|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''La France Socialiste'' in both the [[Military Administration in Belgium and North France|occupied zone]] and [[Vichy France]], to give a feeling of nationality. The race had six multinational teams, and was won by [[François Neuville]]. The inexperience of the organizers, combined with bad weather and logistical problems, made the race a disaster. Although there were plans to hold the race again in 1943, it was never held.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===1943 Tour de France===
The 1943 Tour de France was not held, but instead, ''L'Auto'' organized a readers' poll in 1943 to name the perfect team for a Tour de France, were one to be run. More than 10,000 took part.&lt;ref name="Boeuf1"/&gt;

===1943 Grand Prix du Tour de France===
In 1943, ''l'Auto'' ran what it called the "Grand Prix du Tour de France", the paper's assessment of the greatest riders calculated using their placings in single-day races, all organised by ''l'Auto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laget|first=Serge|chapter=1940–1946 Des Ersatz|title=100 Ans de Tour de France|year=2002|language=French|publisher=L'Equipe|isbn=90-5947-028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dauncey269"&gt;Dauncey, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, a yellow jersey was given to the cyclist with the best overall classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/sports/0101447958-la-france-occupee-l-auto-gare-le-tour|title=La France occupee, "l'Auto" gare le tour|language=French|author=Blandine, Hennion|date=3 July 2003|accessdate=17 August 2010|work=Libération }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauncey, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was [[Jo Goutorbe]].&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt; Even though The Grand Prix du Tour de France was organized by [[Jacques Goddet]], he made it clear that it was not an official Tour de France.&lt;ref name="Gann150" /&gt;

===1944 Grand Prix du Tour de France===
In 1944, the Grand Prix du Tour de France was done again, but it was not completed because the [[Military history of France during World War II#Campaign of France (1944–1945)|liberation of France]] stopped the races from being run.&lt;ref name="Dauncey269" /&gt; [[Maurice De Simpelaere]] was the leader at the time the races were interrupted.&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;

==Candidate Tours after liberation==
After the liberation of France in 1944, ''L'Auto'' was closed and its belongings, including the Tour de France were sequestrated by the state for having published articles too close to the Germans.&lt;ref name="Liberation1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/sports/0101448021-comment-le-tour-a-echappe-au-pcf|title=Comment le Tour a echappé au PCF.|language=French|author=Blandine, Hennion|date=4 July 2003|accessdate=17 August 2010|work=Libération }}&lt;/ref&gt; All rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, ''L'Équipe'', but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of the magazines ''Sports'' and ''Miroir Sprint''. Each organised a candidate race. ''L'Équipe'' and ''Le Parisien Libéré'' had "La Course du Tour de France",&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/TdF/TdF1940_46.htm|title=1940–1946: 'TdF Style' Racing During World War 2|author=Boyce, Barry|year=2004|publisher=Cycling Revealed|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("The Race of the Tour de France" – as close as they dared come to calling the race by its original name), and ''Sports'' and ''Miroir Sprint'' had "La Ronde de France".

===Ronde de France===
From 10 July to 14 July 1946, the '''Ronde de France''' was organized. The cyclists were divided in commercial teams, but the commercial teams were each allowed to field two teams, one composed of French cyclists and one of foreign cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/Cyberdocs/MFE2007/demouveaux_g/pdf/demouveaux_g.pdf|page=36|accessdate=20 August 2010|language=French|author=Demouveaux, Gautier|title=Les débats de presse autour de la réorganisation du Tour de France, après la libération 1945–1947|publisher=Université de Lyon|date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was won by [[Giulio Bresci]], who also won two stages and the mountains classification.&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;

===La Course du Tour de France===
{{redirect|La Course du Tour de France|the women's one-day race|La Course by Le Tour de France}}
The '''Course du Tour de France''' ({{lang-en|Race of the Tour of France}}), also known as '''Monaco–Paris''' was organised in 1946 by [[Le Parisien Libéré]] together with [[l'Equipe]]. The race had many things familiar to the old Tours de France: there were six national teams and five regional French teams, and the leader in the race was also given a [[yellow jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
The race was won by French cyclist [[Apo Lazarides]]. The mountains classification was won by [[Jean Robic]].

==Aftermath==
The Course du Tour de France, ''L'Équipe'''s race, was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams which had been so successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. In late 1946, both organisers intended to organise their race again in 1947, this time at the same time. The UCI then decided in December 1946 to give ''L'Équipe'' the right to organize the [[1947 Tour de France]]. After their main rival ''Sports'' objected to this, the rights were instead given to La Societé du Parc du Princes, because this was thought to be a neutral choice. In early 1947, it became clear that the organisation of the Tour de France was difficult financially without a newspaper and, in June 1947, one month before the 1947 Tour de France would start, the Societé du Parc du Princes transferred the rights to ''L'Equipe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/Cyberdocs/MFE2007/demouveaux_g/pdf/demouveaux_g.pdf|pages=37–40|accessdate=20 August 2010|language=French|author=Demouveaux, Gautier|title=Les débats de presse autour de la réorganisation du Tour de France, après la libération 1945–1947|publisher=Université de Lyon|date=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Émile Besson, communist sports writer and a member of the Resistance from 1943 when he was 17, called ''L'Équipe'''s victory political. Besson, who was a member of the national study into French sport under the Occupation, set up by [[Marie-George Buffet]] when she was sports minister between 1997 and 2002, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a bit much to have given them the right to run the Tour again after all that [referring to ''L'Auto'''s pro-German attitude and closure]. Goddet had the keys to the [[Velodrome d'Hiver]] when [the Germans wanted it] in the round-up of Jews in July 1942. After the Liberation, the battle between Left and Right had the Tour as one of its prizes.&lt;ref name="Liberation1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goddet had to defend his wartime behaviour at an inquiry in [[Algiers]]. He pointed to the way he had allowed Resistance workers to print anti-German tracts at his newspaper and called [[Émilien Amaury]] in his defence. Amaury had a blameless record in the Resistance.&lt;ref name="God1"/&gt; He was also a right-wing businessman; his ideals close to Goddet's.&lt;ref name="Boeuf1" /&gt; It was with Amaury and his paper, ''Le Parisien Libéré'', that Goddet ran La Course du Tour de France. It was Amaury's reputation that landed Goddet the Tour.&lt;ref name="Boeuf1"/&gt; That, says Besson, and because the rival candidate was two magazines with a communist background and President [[Charles de Gaulle]] was determined to limit communist influence. De Gaulle had spent much of his time during the war trying to prevent communist domination of the Resistance. Communists held many key positions in France just before and after Liberation but De Gaulle refused even to thank them for their work. [[Albert Bourlon]], who won the 14th stage of the 1947 Tour de France, told Jean Bobet that he was convinced that his membership of the Communist Party denied him access to the race afterwards.&lt;ref name="JeanBobet"/&gt;

Amaury eventually took control of both the paper and the Tour de France, and as of 2012 is still the organiser of the Tour de France, under the name [[Amaury Sport Organisation]].

Jean Leulliot was tried for his role in organising races under German patronage but he was cleared after fellow journalists, including Goddet, spoke in his favour.&lt;ref name="Memoire1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JeanBobet" /&gt;

'''Trentishoe''' is a village and [[civil parish]] in [[North Devon]], England. The parish lies on the coast of the [[Bristol Channel]].  The village is {{convert|5|mi|0}} east of [[Combe Martin]], at an elevation of 180 metres, separated from the coast by high cliffs.

The village was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Trendesholt''.  The name is of [[Old English]] origin, and appears to mean "hill-spur of a circular hill named Trendel".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Trentishoe  | year = 2010  | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names  | editor-last = Watts | editor-first = Victor  | volume =   | pages =   | place =   | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | isbn=9780521168557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parish church ==

The small parish church is dedicated to St Peter.  The church dates from the 15th century, and is a [[Grade II* listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|97123|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the  Shirwell deanery of the [[Church of England]]. [[James Hannington]], a future saint and a martyr, took charge of the parish church in 1873.

==Trentishoe free festivals==
In 1973 a small ecologically-themed free rock festival was held on a clifftop site near Trentishoe, titled the Trentishoe Whole Earth Fayre (possibly following a minuscule 1972 festival of which records are sparse).  The 'International Times', in 1973, noted "The Trentishoe bash, kicking off on July 9th and running for a couple of weeks, looks like kindling a similar flame to that ignited by the [[Glastonbury Festival#Glastonbury Free Festival 1971|Glastonbury Fayre]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaltimes.it/archive/WebImages/IT_1973-07-12_B-IT-Volume-1_Iss-158_012-013.jpg International Times - IT158 - 1973 Festivals 'Whither the Million Dollar Bash']&lt;/ref&gt; The organisors of the 1973 event were Greg Haynes, Mike Tanner, Dave Mackay and Norman with music arranged by [[Greasy Truckers]] and [[Bath Arts Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/trentishoe-73.html Trentishoe 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; Bands included Hawkwind, Pink Fairies and Magic Muscle. A follow-up event took place in 1975, and another under the same name but at a different location in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/trentishoe-menu.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Clarke (1982) - The Politics of Pop Festivals, pp 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Road to L2.webm|thumb|This visualization follows the WFIRST telescope on its trajectory to the Sun-Earth Lagrange Two point.]]

The '''Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope''' ('''WFIRST''') is a NASA [[infrared]] [[space observatory]] currently under development. WFIRST was recommended in 2010 by [[United States National Research Council]] [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey|Decadal Survey committee]] as the top priority for the next decade of astronomy. On February 17, 2016, WFIRST was approved for development and launch.&lt;ref name="KDP-A"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-introduces-new-wider-set-of-eyes-on-the-universe|accessdate=2016-02-18|date=2016-02-18|title=NASA Introduces New, Wider Set of Eyes on the Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFIRST is based on an existing 2.4 m wide field-of-view telescope and will carry two scientific instruments. The Wide-Field Instrument is a 288-megapixel multi-band near-infrared camera, providing a sharpness of images comparable to that achieved by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) over a 0.28 square degree field of view, 100 times larger than that of the HST. The [[coronagraph|Coronagraphic Instrument]] is a high-contrast, small field-of-view camera and spectrometer covering visible and near-infrared wavelengths using novel starlight-suppression technology.

The design of WFIRST is based on one of the proposed designs for the [[Joint Dark Energy Mission]] between NASA and [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]. WFIRST adds some extra capabilities to the original JDEM proposal, including a search for [[extra-solar planets]] using [[gravitational microlensing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=National Research Council | coauthors= | title=New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics | location=Washington, D.C. | publisher=National Research Council | year=2010 | isbn=0-309-15802-8 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12951.html|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its present incarnation (2015),&lt;ref name="2015FinalReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/sdt_public/WFIRST-AFTA_SDT_Report_150310_Final.pdf|title=WFIRST Science Definition Team 2015 Report|accessdate=2016-02-23|date=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a large fraction of its primary mission will be focused on probing the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of cosmic structure with multiple methods in overlapping redshift ranges, with the goal of precisely measuring the effects of [[dark energy]],&lt;ref&gt;WFIRST Wide-Field Infrared Telescope Home Page, http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/&lt;/ref&gt; the consistency of [[general relativity]], and the curvature of [[spacetime]].

On February 12, 2018, development on the WFIRST mission was proposed to be terminated in the President's FY19 budget request, due to a reduction in the overall NASA astrophysics budget and higher priorities elsewhere in the agency.&lt;ref name="FY19 budget"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_fy_2019_budget_overview.pdf|title=FY 2019 budget estimates|accessdate=2018-02-12|date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space-fy19-cancellation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/39680-wfirst-space-telescope-cancellation-scientist-reactions.html |title=What Would it Mean for Astronomers if the WFIRST Space Telescope is Killed? |first=Calla |last=Cofield |date=13 February 2018 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180219"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Astronomers’ Dark Energy Hopes Fade to Gray |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/science/nasa-dark-energy-wfirst.html |date=19 February 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 Congress approved funding to continue making progress on WFIRST until at least September 30, 2018,&lt;ref name=B2018-04/&gt; in a bill stating that Congress "rejects the cancellation of scientific priorities recommended by the National Academy of Sciences decadal survey process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://spacenews.com/foust-forward-federal-appropriations-process-is-so-extended-that-its-confusing-what-year-were-in/ |title=Federal appropriations process is so extended that it's confusing what year we’re in|first=Jeff|last=Foust|authorlink=Jeff Foust|date=2 April 2018|accessdate=2018-08-17|work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In testimony before Congress in July 2018, NASA administrator [[Jim Bridenstine]] proposed slowing down the development of WFIRST in order to accommodate a cost increase in the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], which would result in decreased funding for WFIRST in 2020/2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-weighs-delaying-wfirst-to-fund-jwst-overrun/ |title=NASA weighs delaying WFIRST to fund JWST overrun |first=Jeff|last=Foust|authorlink=Jeff Foust|date=2018-07-25|accessdate=2018-07-25|work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The original design of WFIRST (Design Reference Mission 1), studied in 2011–2012, featured a {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}} diameter unobstructed [[three-mirror anastigmat]] telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| arxiv=1208.4012| title=WFIRST Science Definition Team Final Report
| date=2012-08-15
| bibcode=2012arXiv1208.4012G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It contained a single instrument, a visible to near-infrared imager/slitless prism spectrometer. In 2012, another possibility emerged: NASA could use a second-hand [[National Reconnaissance Office]] telescope made by [[Harris Corporation]] to accomplish a mission like the one planned for WFIRST. [[2012 National Reconnaissance Office space telescope donation to NASA|NRO offered to donate two telescopes]], the same size as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] but with a shorter focal length and hence a wider field of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; This provided important political momentum to the project, even though the telescope represents only a modest fraction of the cost of the mission and the boundary conditions from the NRO design may push the total cost over that of a fresh design. This mission concept, called WFIRST-AFTA (Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets), was matured by a scientific and technical team;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/sdt_public/WFIRST-AFTA_SDT_Final_Report_Rev1_130523.pdf | title=WFIRST-AFTA SDT Final Report, revision 1 | date=2013-05-23 | accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; this mission is now the only present NASA plan for the use of the NRO telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;

The WFIRST baseline design includes a [[coronagraph]] to enable the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Direct imaging|direct imaging]] of [[exoplanet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

WFIRST has had a number of different implementations studied (including the [[JDEM|Joint Dark Energy Mission]]-Omega configuration, an Interim Design Reference Mission featuring a 1.3m telescope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/sdt_public/WFIRST_Interim_Report.pdf|title=WFIRST IDRM|accessdate=2016-02-23|date=2011-07-11|author=Green &amp; Schechter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design Reference Mission 1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/sdt/sdt_2010_2011/meetings/2012_May/DRM1_120517.pdf|title=WFIRST DRM1|accessdate=2016-02-23|date=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 1.3m telescope, Design Reference Mission 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1208.4012|title=WFIRST DRM2|date=2012-08-15|author=Green &amp; Schechter|bibcode=2012arXiv1208.4012G}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 1.1m telescope, and several iterations of the AFTA 2.4m configuration). In the most recent report,&lt;ref name="2015FinalReport" /&gt; WFIRST was considered for both [[geosynchronous]] and [[L2 point|L2]] orbits. Appendix C documents the disadvantage of L2 vs. geosynchronous in the data rate and propellant, but the advantages for improved observing constraints, better thermal stability, and more benign radiation environment at L2. Some science cases (such as exoplanet microlensing parallax) are improved at L2, and the possibility of robotic servicing at either of the locations requires further study.

The project is led by a team at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Project Scientist for WFIRST from its inception until his death in 2017 was [[Neil Gehrels]], who was succeeded by Jeffrey Kruk; the Project Manager is Kevin Grady; the Program Scientist is Dominic Benford; the Program Executive is John Gagosian; the Formulation Science Working Group is chaired by Gehrels with Deputy Chairs [[David Spergel]] and [[N. Jeremy Kasdin|Jeremy Kasdin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Sullivan|first=John|url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S45/58/15K02/index.xml?section=topstories|publisher=Princeton|title=Princeton professors to lead NASA science team probing universe and planets|date=2016-02-18|accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science objectives ==
The science objectives of WFIRST aim to address cutting-edge questions in [[cosmology]] and [[exoplanet]] research, including:
* Answering basic questions about [[dark energy]], complementary to the [[ESA]] [[Euclid (spacecraft)|EUCLID]] mission, and including: Is cosmic acceleration caused by a new energy component or by the breakdown of [[general relativity]] on cosmological scales? If the cause is a new energy component, is its energy density constant in space and time, or has it evolved over the history of the universe? WFIRST will use three independent techniques to probe dark energy: [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], observations of distant [[supernovae]], [[weak gravitational lensing]].
* Completing a census of [[exoplanet]]s to help answer new questions about the potential for [[Astrobiology|life in the universe]]: How common are solar systems like our own? What kinds of planets exist in the cold, outer regions of planetary systems? – What determines the [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] of Earth-like worlds? This census makes use of a technique that can find exoplanets down to a mass only a few times that of the Moon: [[gravitational microlensing]].
* Establishing a guest investigator mode, enabling survey investigations to answer diverse questions about our galaxy and the universe.
* Providing a [[coronagraph]] for exoplanet [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Direct imaging|direct imaging]] that will provide the first direct images and spectra of planets around our nearest neighbors similar to our own giant planets.

WFIRST will have two instruments. The Wide-Field Instrument (WFI) is a 288-[[megapixel]] camera with a 0.28 square degree field of view providing multi-band near-infrared (0.7 to 2.0 micrometers) imaging using a [[HgCdTe]] focal-plane array with a pixel size of 110 milliarcseconds. The detector array will be composed of H4RG-10 detectors provided by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/presentations/vugraphs/160202WFIRSTSDTH4RG10C.pdf

 |last=Rauscher|first=Bernard|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It includes a [[grism]] for wide-field [[slitless spectroscopy]] and an [[integral field spectrograph]] for small-field spectroscopy. The second instrument is a high contrast [[coronagraph]] covering shorter wavelengths (0.4 to 1.0 micrometers) using novel starlight-suppression technology. It is intended to achieve a part-per-billion suppression of starlight to enable the detection of planets only 0.1 arcseconds away from their host stars.

'''William Hamman''' (born 1952) is an American pilot. Hamman taught doctors and pilots in [[Milwaukee]]. He also talked to many people at [[seminars]]. He claimed to have a medical and doctoral degree from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], but when his credentials were checked by the Associated Press there wasn't anything stating this.

'''Wim Delvoye''' (born 1965 in [[Wervik]], [[West Flanders]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/5719|title=Guggenheim|work=Guggenheim|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a Belgian neo-conceptual artist known for his inventive and often shocking projects. Much of his work is focused on the body. He repeatedly links the attractive with the repulsive, creating work that holds within it inherent contradictions – one does not know whether to stare, be seduced, or to look away.{{according to whom|date=December 2016}} As the critic [[Robert Enright]] wrote in the art magazine ''Border Crossings'', "Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created".&lt;ref name="Enright"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=412 Enright, Robert. "Vim &amp; Vigour; An Interview with Wim Delvoye". ''Border Crossings'' 96 (2005): n. pag. Web. 4 Jun 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, and scatology to the function of art in the current market economy, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Brighton, UK.

==Early life==
Delvoye was raised in [[Wervik]], a small town in West Flanders, Belgium. He did not have a religious upbringing but has been influenced by the Roman Catholic architecture that surrounded him. In a conversation with Michaël Amy of the ''New York Times'', Delvoye stated, "I have vivid memories of crowds marching behind a single statue as well as of people kneeling in front of painted and carved altarpieces… Although I was barely aware of the ideas lurking behind these types of images, I soon understood that paintings and sculptures were of great importance".&lt;ref name=AmyNYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Amy|first=Michaël|title=The Body As Machine, Taken To Its Extreme|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/arts/art-architecture-the-body-as-machine-taken-to-its-extreme.html|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Growing up, Delvoye attended exhibitions with his parents, and his love of drawing eventually led him to art school, the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Ghent)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgischekunst.be/2012/09/wim-delvoye-1965/|title=Wim Delvoye (1965-  ) — Aspecten van de Belgische kunst na '45|website=belgischekunst.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye has said that the pessimistic expectations for Belgian art students freed him, essentially making him realize that he “had nothing to lose”.&lt;ref name="AmyNYT" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, Delvoye began painting over wallpaper and carpets, coloring in the existing patterns and defying the tendency towards free expression vibrant in the art world at the time.

Delvoye considers himself an originator of concepts—he is attracted initially to the theory behind pieces, instead of the act of painting itself. After 1990, specialists directed by Delvoye have executed most of his work. In 1992, Delvoye received international recognition with the presentation of his “Mosaic” at Documenta IX, a symmetrical display of glazed tiles featuring photographs of his own excrement. The organizer of Documenta IX, Jan Hoet claimed, “The strength of Wim Delvoye lies in his ability to engineer conflict by combining the fine arts and folk art, and playing seriousness against irony.”&lt;ref name="AmyNYT"/&gt;  Three of his most well known projects are “Cloaca”, “Art Farm”, and a series of Gothic works.

==''Cloaca''==
[[File:Berriedale TAS 7011, Australia - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|Delvoye's ''Cloaca'' is on permanent display at the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA) in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Australia.]]
Delvoye is perhaps best known for his digestive machine, ''Cloaca'', which he unveiled at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerp, after eight years of consultation with experts in fields ranging from plumbing to gastroenterology.&lt;ref name="criqui"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=366 Criqui, Jean-Pierre . "Eater’s Digest". ''Artforum'' 1 Sep.2001 : 182 – 183 . Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a comment on the Belgians’ love of fine dining, ''Cloaca'' is a large installation that turns food into [[feces]], allowing Delvoye to explore the digestive process. In his large mechanism, food begins at a long, transparent bowl (mouth), travels through a number of machine-like assembly stations, and ends in hard matter which is separated from liquid through a cylinder.&lt;ref name="AmyNYT"/&gt; Delvoye collects and sells the realistically smelling output, suspended in small jars of resin at his Ghent studio. When asked about his inspiration, Delvoye stated that everything in modern life is pointless. The most useless object he could create was a machine that serves no purpose at all, besides the reduction of food to waste. ''Cloaca'' has appeared in many incarnations including: ''Cloaca Original'', ''Cloaca - New &amp; Improved'', ''Cloaca Turbo'', ''Cloaca Quattro'', ''Cloaca N° 5'', and ''Personal Cloaca''.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title=Down the Hatch|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/30/dining/critic-s-notebook-down-the-hatch.html|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye also sold specially printed toilet paper as a souvenir of the exhibit. In 2016, 5 rolls from the 2007 Mudam Luxembourg exhibit were offered for re-sale for US$300 through an online vendor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/more-furniture-collectibles/curiosities/super-cloaca-toilet-paper-roll-wim-delvoye-2007/id-f_5502343/#0 First Dibs.com], Retrieved September 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commissioned ''Cloaca'' for MONA===
Previously, Delvoye claimed that he would never sell a ''Cloaca'' machine to a museum as he could never trust that the [[curator]] would maintain the installation properly. However, after two years of discussion with [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]], Delvoye agreed to construct a custom ''Cloaca'' built specifically for the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. The new installation is suspended from the museum ceiling in a room custom-built for it.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/A-subversive-Disneyland-at-the-end-of-the-world/21204|title=A "Subversive Disneyland" at the End of the World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Farm==
Though Delvoye started [[tattoo]]ing pig skins taken from slaughterhouses in the United States in 1992, he began to tattoo live pigs in 1997. Delvoye was interested in the idea that “the pig would literally grow in value,"&lt;ref name="laster"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=587 Laster, Paul. "Bringing Home the Bacon: Wim Delvoye". ''ArtAsiaPacific'' 30 September 2007 : 154-159 . Print. ]&lt;/ref&gt; both in a physical and economic sense. He ultimately moved the operation to an Art Farm in China in 2004. The pigs have been inked with a diverse array of designs, including the trivial, such as skulls and crosses, to Louis Vuitton designs, to designs dictated by the pig's anatomy".&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=388 Harris, Gareth. "Artist Banks on Pigs and Artificial S**t". ''Art Newspaper'' 6 October 2005 : 1, 7 . Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[ArtAsiaPacific]]'s'' Paul Laster, Delvoye described the process of tattooing a live pig, "we sedate it, shave it and apply [[Vaseline]] to its skin".&lt;ref name="laster" /&gt;

==Gothic works==
Delvoye is additionally well known for his “[[Goth subculture|gothic]]” style work. In 2001, Delvoye, with the help of a [[radiologist]], had several of his friends paint themselves with small amounts of [[Radiocontrast agent|barium]], and perform [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] acts in medical X-ray clinics. He then used the X-ray scans to fill gothic window frames instead of classic [[stained glass]]. Delvoye suggests that radiography reduces the body to a machine.&lt;ref name="AmyNYT"/&gt; When he was not an active participant, Delvoye observed from a computer screen in another room, allowing the subjects enough distance to perform normally, although Delvoye has described the whole operation as "very medical, very antiseptic".&lt;ref name="laster x ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=192|title=Laster, Paul. "XXX-ray vision". Time Out New York 17 October 2002: 22.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye also creates oversized [[laser cutting|laser-cut]] steel sculptures of objects typically found in construction (like a cement truck&lt;ref name="cement truck"&gt;[http://www.designartnews.com/news/vip_art_fair_2_0/item/24_485_jpg Cement Truck]&lt;/ref&gt;), customized in seventeenth-century Flemish Baroque style. These structures juxtapose "medieval craftsmanship with Gothic filigree".&lt;ref name="public art fund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartfund.org/pafweb/projects/03/delvoye_w_release_03.html|title=Home|website=www.publicartfund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye brings together the heavy, brute force of contemporary machinery and the delicate craftsmanship associated with Gothic architecture.

In a 2013 show in New York City, Delvoye showed intricate laser-cut works combining architectural and figurative references with shapes such as a [[Möbius band]] or a [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot]].&lt;ref name=Cashdan&gt;{{cite news|last=Cashdan|first=Marina|title=New Provocations From the Belgian Bad Boy Wim Delvoye|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/on-view-new-provocations-from-the-belgian-bad-boy-wim-delvoye/|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
