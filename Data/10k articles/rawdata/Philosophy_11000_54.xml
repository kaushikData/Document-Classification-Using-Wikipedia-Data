The '''Apostolus Christinopolitanus''' is a [[Cyrillic]] manuscript of the Acts and Epistles with commentary, written in [[Church Slavonic]] of the East Slavonic recension in the middle of the twelfth century.  It takes its name from the town of Krystynopol (now [[Chervonohrad]]), where it was kept until 1908.  The greater part of the manuscript (291 leaves), is now in the Historical Museum in [[Lviv|Ľviv]] (MS 37); a further 8 leaves are in the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|National Library]] of the Ukraine in [[Kiev]] (MS VIII.3).&lt;ref&gt;''Сводный каталог славяно-русских рукописных книг, хранящихся в СССР, XI-XIII вв.,'' Moscow: Nauka,1984, №59, 60. This incorrectly gives the Ľviv shelfmark as 39, repeating a frequent error; cf. М.А. Бобрик, “Терминология библейской цитаты и толкования в рукописях Толкового Апостола XII – XVI веков”, ''Библеистика. Славистика. Русистика: К 70-летию ... А. А. Алексеева,''
 СПб.: Филологический факультет СПбГУ, 2011, pp.387−398.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript in its present condition is incomplete, lacking Acts i 1 – ix 27 and xiii 6–19, I Peter ii 11-25, I Timothy iv 8 – vi 21, and all of II Timothy, Titus and Philemon.  Unusually, the Epistle to the Hebrews is placed between II Thessalonians and I Timothy.  The epistles are accompanied by the prefaces and chapter-lists of the [[Euthalian Apparatus]] and by extensive commentary.  The manuscript is very unusual in having the scriptural text occupying the central area of the page and the commentary in smaller writing in the wide margins surrounding it, an arrangement common in Greek manuscripts but almost unknown in the Slavonic tradition, where the text and commentary usually occupy the same central area.

The Apostolus Christinopolitanus was published in 1896 by Emil Kałużniacki,&lt;ref&gt;Kałużniacki, Aem. ''Actus epistolaeque apostolorum palaeoslovenicе, Ad fidem codicis Christinopolitani saeculo XII scripti,'' Vindobonae, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; who however printed only the scriptural text (supplying the missing parts with text from other manuscripts) and omitted the commentary.  After a thorough restoration of the manuscript, carried out in 2007 and 2008, a digital facsimile was made available by the National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhm.lviv.ua/proekty/krystynopolskyy_apostol.html|title=Кристинопольський Апостол|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Apostolus Christinopolitanus, in Kałużniacki′s edition, was used as a source for Slavonic variants to the Greek New Testament in the [[United Bible Societies]]′ edition, somewhat unfortunately, as the editors failed to notice that some of the variants actually come from the other manuscripts used by Kałużniacki,&lt;ref&gt;M. Bakker, ″The Slavonic Version in UBS&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;″, ''Novum Testamentum'' 37 (1995), 92-94.&lt;/ref&gt; and because, despite the antiquity of the manuscript, the text is not a good witness to the earliest Slavonic version: in common with other manuscripts that include commentary, it ″bears the marks of revision and subsequent influence from Greek manuscripts".&lt;ref&gt;H.P.S. Bakker, ''Towards a Critical Edition of the Old Slavic New Testament,'' Amsterdam, 1996: 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscript nevertheless has considerable linguistic and text-critical importance for the Slavonic version, particularly when the commentary is taken into account.

'''Arthur Norman Prior''' (4 December 1914 – 6 October 1969), usually cited as '''A. N. Prior''', was a noted [[logic]]ian and philosopher. Prior (1957) founded tense logic, now also known as [[temporal logic]], and made important contributions to [[intensional logic]], particularly in Prior (1971).

==Biography==
Prior was born in [[Masterton]], New Zealand, on 4 December 1914, the only child of Australian-born parents: Norman Henry Prior (1882–1967) and his wife born Elizabeth Munton Rothesay Teague (1889–1914). His mother died less than 3 weeks after his birth and he was cared for by his father's sister. His father, a medical practitioner in general practice, remarried in 1920 and there were three more children. Prior grew up in a Methodist home and both of his grandfathers came to Australia as missionaries. His father Norman Prior was a doctor who was decorated for his service as medical officer in the first world war.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wairarapa100.co.nz/norman-prior&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior was educated entirely in [[New Zealand]], where he was fortunate to have come under the influence of [[John Niemeyer Findlay]]. Despite knowing only modest mathematics, he began teaching philosophy and logic at [[Canterbury University College]] in 1946, filling the vacancy created by [[Karl Popper]]'s resignation. In 1951 Prior met [[J.J.C. Smart]], also known as "Jack" Smart, at a philosophical conference in Australia and the two developed a life-long friendship. Their correspondence was influential on Prior's development of tense-logic. Smart adhered to the tenseless theory of time and was never persuaded by Prior's arguments, though Prior was influential in making Smart skeptical about [[Wittgenstein]]'s view on pseudo-relations. &lt;ref&gt;http://aauforlag.dk/UserFiles/file/Logic_and_Philosophy_of_Themes_from_Prior_ONLINE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;He became Professor in 1953. Thanks to the good offices of [[Gilbert Ryle]], who had met Prior in New Zealand in 1954, Prior spent the year 1956 on leave at the [[University of Oxford]], where he gave the [[John Locke]] [[John Locke lectures|lectures]] in philosophy. These were subsequently published as ''Time and Modality'' (1957). This is a seminal contribution to the study of tense logic and the metaphysics of time, in which Prior championed the A-theorist view that the temporal modalities past, present and future are basic ontological categories of fundamental importance for our understanding of time and the world. During his time at Oxford, Prior met [[Peter Geach]] and [[William Kneale (logician)|William Kneale]], influenced [[John Lemmon]], and corresponded with the adolescent [[Saul Kripke]]. Logic in the United Kingdom was then in a rather low state, and Prior's enthusiasm is believed to have contributed materially to its revival.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} From 1959 to 1966, he was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Manchester]], having taught [[Osmund Lewry]]. From 1966 until his death he was Fellow and Tutor in philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. His students include [[Max Cresswell]], [[Kit Fine]], and [[Robert Bull]]. 

Almost entirely self-taught in modern [[formal logic]], Prior published his first paper on logic in 1952, when he was already 38 years of age, shortly after discovering the work of [[Józef Maria Bocheński]] and [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], very little of whose work was then translated into English.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} He went on to employ [[Polish notation]] throughout his career. Prior (1955) distills much of his early teaching of logic in New Zealand. Prior's work on tense logic provides a systematic and extended defence of a tensed conception of reality in which material objects are construed as three-dimensional continuants which are wholly present at each moment of their existence.

Prior stood out by virtue of his strong interest in the history of logic. He was one of the first English-speaking logicians to appreciate the nature and scope of the logical work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and the distinction between ''[[de dicto]]'' and ''[[de re]]'' in [[modal logic]]. Prior taught and researched [[modal logic]] before Kripke proposed his [[Kripke semantics|possible worlds semantics]] for it, at a time when modality and intentionality commanded little interest in the English speaking world, and had even come under sharp attack by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

He is now said to be the precursor of [[hybrid logic]].&lt;ref name="CarnielliPizzi2008"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Walter Carnielli| author2=Claudio Pizzi| title=Modalities and Multimodalities| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpAFM04G6BAC&amp;pg=PA181| year=2008| publisher=Springer| isbn=978-1-4020-8589-5| page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Undertaking (in one section of his book ''Past, Present, and Future'' (1967)) the attempt to combine binary (e.g., "until") and unary (e.g., "will always be") temporal operators to one system of [[temporal logic]], Prior—as an incidental result—builds a base for later hybrid languages.

His work ''Time and Modality'' explored the use of a [[many-valued logic]] to explain the problem of [[non-referring names]].

Prior's work was both philosophical and formal and provides a productive synergy between formal innovation and linguistic analysis.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Natural language]], he remarked, can embody folly and confusion as well as the wisdom of our ancestors. He was scrupulous in setting out the views of his adversaries, and provided many constructive suggestions about the formal development of alternative views.

'''"Between the devil and the deep blue sea"''' is an [[idiom]] meaning a [[dilemma]]—i.e., to choose between two undesirable situations  (equivalent to "[[wiktionary:between a rock and a hard place|between a rock and a hard place]]").

The first recorded citation of "the Devil and the deep sea" in print is in [[Robert Monro]]'s ''His expedition with the worthy Scots regiment called Mac-keyes'', 1637: "I, with my partie, did lie on our poste, as betwixt the devill and the deep sea."

==Biography==
Nino studied law at the University of [[Buenos Aires]] and at [[Oxford]], where he received his Ph.D. in 1977 with a thesis directed by [[John Finnis]] and [[Tony Honoré]].

Nino began his academic activity in the early 1970s, concentrating on some traditional issues in [[jurisprudence]], such as the concept of a legal [[system]], the [[statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of the law, the debate between [[legal positivism]] and [[natural law]], and the concept of [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref&gt;see ''Notas de introducción al Derecho'', Buenos Aires, 1973, expanded in ''Introducción al análisis del Derecho'', Buenos Aires, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; After realizing the need to clarify the normative problems involved in some of those issues, he was led to embrace a model based on the explicit adoption of principles of justice and social morality, rejecting the predominant [[Germany|German]]-inspired "dogmatic" approach.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Consideraciones sobre la dogmática jurídica'', México, 1974; and ''Algunos modelos metodológicos de "ciencia" jurídica'', Valencia, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This signaled the beginning of his [[philosophical]] investigations, which were always oriented to practical issues, and marked by a distinctively [[Analysis (philosophy)|analytical]] approach. His need to provide a [[Liberalism|liberal]] justification for criminal law practice thus lead him to [[ethics|moral philosophy]], and to the development of an original "consensual" theory of [[punishment]] which combined the merits of the retributive and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] (see [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]]) varieties while avoiding their respective difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Towards a General Strategy for Criminal Law Adjudication'', unpublished Ph.D. thesis 1977; revised Spanish translation, ''Los límites de la responsabilidad penal'', Buenos Aires, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the problems presented by the characterization of criminal conduct stimulated his work in the field of [[philosophy of action]].&lt;ref&gt;(see ''Introducción a la filosofía de la acción humana'', Buenos Aires, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, after the restoration of [[democracy]], Nino became engaged in politics, serving as personal assistant to President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] and as coordinator of his newly created "Consejo para la consolidación de la democracia", a special committee for the study and design of institutional reforms. His theoretical activities, however, were not forgotten: in 1984 he published his monumental ''Ética y derechos humanos'',&lt;ref&gt;Buenos Aires; English revised translation, ''The Ethics of Human Rights'', Oxford, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to Alfonsín, where he provided a comprehensive exposition of his moral thought; divided in three parts, it dealt with [[normative ethics|normative]] and [[applied ethics]], as well as with [[meta-ethics]]. This last field he expanded in a separate volume,&lt;ref&gt;''El constructivismo ético'', Madrid, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; where he adopted a constructivist approach that attempted to derive his fundamental ethical principles from the presuppositions of moral discourse, in a manner that put him, as he said, "between [[John Rawls|Rawls]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]". These substantive principles, comprising the nucleus of a theory that aspired to capture the essential components of [[political liberalism]], were the principle of [[autonomy]], the principle of [[Sanctity of life|inviolability]], and the principle of [[dignity]]. The first expressed Nino's conception of the [[Value theory|good]]: those things, and those things only, that were valued by the individual in question. The second imposed deontological restrictions to the pursuit of that good, prohibiting the sacrifice of some to achieve the benefit of others. The third principle allowed for individual consent, thus permitting persons to waive the rights recognized by the second one.

With this solid normative foundation, Nino went to tackle some practical issues, such as [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], and [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] regulation. On the former, he proposed a gradualist approach similar to the [[United States|American]] one, recognizing rights to the [[fetus]]es only when they showed the cognitive and affective capacities necessary for considering them moral persons. As regards death penalty, he was firmly opposed to it—as he was to the criminalization of drug consumption.

While on trip to [[La Paz, Bolivia]] in 1993 to work on the reform of the [[Bolivia]]n constitution, Nino had an asthma attack and subsequently died. This tragedy killed a man who appeared to be at the peak of his productivity: the year before he had published two books,&lt;ref&gt;''Un país al margen de la ley'', Buenos Aires; and ''Fundamentos de derecho constitucional'', Buenos Aires&lt;/ref&gt; served as editor to two others,&lt;ref&gt;''El presidencialismo puesto a prueba'', Madrid; and ''Rights'', New York&lt;/ref&gt; and had given the manuscripts of a couple more to his friend [[Owen Fiss]], who assumed the responsibility of readying them for publication. ''The Constitution of Deliberative Democracy'' and ''Radical Evil on Trial'' saw the light in 1996. In the first he developed his "epistemic justification" of [[deliberative democracy]], arguing that democratic deliberation provides better reasons to believe in the validity of moral norms than private reflection. The second is a moving personal description of the [[Trial of the Juntas|military junta trials]]; it provides a testimony to his unique ability to approach public affairs with both philosophical sophistication and political commitment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">'''Carolyn Korsmeyer''' (born 1950) is an author and Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Buffalo]] in New York. She is generally recognized for her study and research on [[aesthetics]], [[feminism]], and [[emotion theory]].&lt;ref name="Dept of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|url=http://www.philosophy.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/korsmeyer/|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Carolyn received her Ph.D. from [[Brown University]] in 1972. In 1978, she began working as a professor of [[Philosophy]] at the University of Buffalo where she continues to work today as the Head of the Philosophy Department.&lt;ref name="University Archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/womens_work/bios/korsmeyer.htm|work=2012|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=21 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010343/http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/womens_work/bios/korsmeyer.htm#|archive-date=2014-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since beginning her career at the University of Buffalo, Korsmeyer has been recognized multiple times for her outstanding performance and continued achievements for her work both in and away from Philosophy.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt; During her long career, Korsmeyer has published multiple acclaimed articles and books on feminism and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;

== Overview of major work ==
After receiving her PhD in 1972, Korsmeyer began to focus her research on feminist philosophy and the field of aesthetics. Feminist perspectives in aesthetics has long been major work of Korsmeyer.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;  Fine art, genius, beauty, taste, and  aesthetic perception are gendered issues that she has studied and researched.&lt;ref name="essay review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koopman|first=Constantijn|title=Essay review of Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|url=http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Koopman5_1.pdf|publisher=Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy of taste ===
The [[philosophy of taste]] is a relatively new subject in the field of philosophy, however Korsmeyer's study of "bad taste" is well known.&lt;ref name="Dept of Philosophy"/&gt; Her consideration of taste in philosophy explores why pungent food like soured milk, fried bugs, extremely hot peppers, and game meat are seen as strong and complex to our palettes.&lt;ref name="Korsmeyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Making Sense of Food and Taste: Food and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=20ltkqE2s1UC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=Carolyn+Korsmeyer&amp;ots=m8VqoRzxQR&amp;sig=jcuJ1Zd9LaQBy02TxjJrJm90Agc#v=onepage&amp;q=Carolyn%20Korsmeyer&amp;f=false|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical understanding of taste of food is compared to the philosophy and interpretation of art in that both deem the similar qualities that entail discriminating perception and also that food and art are both considered 'artistic in creation.' &lt;ref name="Korsmeyer"/&gt;  The argument Korsmeyer presents is that these "cosmopolitan foods" are so complex that they lie on a nearly transparent line straddling between the sublime and disgusting and, when the brain is given the choice, usually the positive reaction wins. Thus, these seemingly disgusting foods give a positive aesthetic response.&lt;ref name="essay review"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Her publications on the subject include:&lt;ref name="acsu.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ckors/|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Making Sense of Taste: Food and Philosophy'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999)

=== Feminist perspectives in aesthetics ===
[[Feminist aesthetics]] refers to the idea that in their basic form, classic concepts such as genius, beauty, fine art, aesthetic perception cradle social roles are qualities that are presumed as gender related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Feminist Aesthetics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=feminism-aesthetics|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her most notorious book titled ''Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction to Understanding Feminist Philosophy'' (London: Routledge, 2004) Korsmeyer uses these "classic concepts" to identify their qualities and goes on to explain the weight of gender as the abiding attribute. Genius, for example, is said to be 'superior in mind' which has long been associated with [[masculinity]] while '[[beauty]]' has long been described as small, soft curvatures that "catch a man's eye" and thus, is defined as female.&lt;ref name="essay review"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Much of her work revolves around the parameters of feminist presence in art, music, and literature.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=s6GSMUGGEmgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Carolyn+Korsmeyer&amp;ots=PuYT_sCHvT&amp;sig=MkrfyPnLMAJZFB6YSDop1CGKx00#v=onepage&amp;q=Carolyn%20Korsmeyer&amp;f=false|publisher=Hypatia, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her book ''Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective'' Korsemeyer compares theories of art and the varying interpretations based on gender bias.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Her publications on the subject include:&lt;ref name="acsu.buffalo.edu"/&gt;

*"Feminist Aesthetics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition)
*''Feminism and Tradition in Aesthetics'', edited with Peggy Zeglin Brand(Indiana University Press, 1993)

== Honors and achievements ==
University at Buffalo Research Recognition Program awarded Korsmeyer their Sustained Achievement Exceptional Scholar Award to awknowledge her outstanding performance over a several year period in her body of work.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt; In 2001, she won the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library's Mark Twain Creative Writing Competition by writing a chapter that concluded Twain's unpublished short story, ''A Murder, a Mystery and a Marriage.''&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;

== Use in conservation ==
Charismatic species are often used as [[flagship species]] in conservation programs, as they are supposed to attract people's feelings more.&lt;ref name="Charisma"/&gt; However, being charismatic does not protect species against [[extinction]]: all of the 10 most charismatic species are currently [[endangered]], and only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population.&lt;ref name=Courchamp2018/&gt;

Beginning early in the 20th century, efforts to reintroduce extirpated charismatic megafauna to ecosystems have been an interest of a number of private and non-government conservation organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Miller |first=C. R.  |author2=Waits, L.

A. |author3=Jędrzejewska, B. |author4=Krasiński, Z. A. |author5=Niedziałkowska, M. |author6=Kamler, J. F. |author7=Yoccoz, N. G. |author8=Stenseth, N.

These and other reintroductions of charismatic megafauna, such as [[Przewalski's horse]] to [[Mongolia]], have been to areas of limited, and often patchy range compared to the historic ranges of the respective species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rugenstein | first =Dustin R. |author2=Rubenstein, Daniel I. |author3=Sherman, Paul W. |author4=Gavin, Thomas A.  |title=Pleistocene Park: Does re-wilding North America represent sound conservation for the 21st century? |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=232–238 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2006.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental activists and proponents of [[ecotourism]] seek to use the leverage provided by charismatic and well-known species to achieve more subtle and far-reaching goals in species and biodiversity conservation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} By directing public attention to the diminishing numbers of giant panda due to [[habitat loss]], for example, conservation groups can raise support for the protection of the panda and for the entire [[ecosystem]] of which it is a part.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} (The giant panda is portrayed in the logo of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].)

Charismatic megafauna may be subject to [[taxonomic inflation]], in that taxonomists will declare a [[subspecies]] to be a [[species]] because of the advocacy benefits of a unique species, rather than because of new scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9191545 "Species inflation: Hail Linnaeus"], ''[[The Economist]]'', May 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The public's preference to identify with species sold through the [[ecotourism]] industry may be a factor for creating taxonomic inflation.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; In the public perception, ecotourism may be about seeing species, and the number of unique species increases the perceived [[biodiversity]] and tourism [[Value (economics)|value]] of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Higham | first =James | title = Critical Issues in Ecotourism: understanding a complex tourism phenomenon | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year =2007 |location = |pages =76–77 | isbn =0-7506-6878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Weaver | first=D. | title=Ecotourism | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia Ltd |year=2002 |isbn =0-471-42230-4 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation may exist between the taxonomic bias in biodiversity datasets and the charisma of terrestrial megafauna, with the more charismatic species being largely over-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Monsarrat |last2 =Kerley| first1=S. | first2=G.I.H | title=Charismatic species of the past: Biases in reporting of large mammals in historical written sources| journal= Biological Conservation |year=2018| volume=223 | DOI= 10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.036 | page=68-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

ChatSecure was originally released in 2011 and was the first iOS application to support OTR messaging. In 2012 ChatSecure formed a partnership with [[The Guardian Project (software)|The Guardian Project]] and the Gibberbot app was rebranded to "ChatSecure Android".&lt;ref name="GP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://guardianproject.info/2013/10/24/chatsecure-v12-provides-comprehensive-security-and-a-whole-new-look/ |title=ChatSecure v12 Provides Comprehensive Mobile Security and a Whole New Look |author=Nathan Freitas |date=24 October 2013 |work= |publisher=GuardianProject.info |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In late 2016, the Android branding partnership was ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chatsecure.org/blog/chatsecure-android-deprecated/|title=The End of ChatSecure Android|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/chatsecure-4-omemo-end-to-end-encryption,33439.html|title=ChatSecure 4.0 Launches With Support For Signal-Derivative ‘OMEMO’ Protocol (Update)|date=18 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ChatSecure Android becoming 'Zom',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/zom/Zom-Android|title=zom/Zom-Android|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ChatSecure iOS remaining as ChatSecure. ChatSecure iOS remains in active development and is unaffected by this change. Version 4.0 was released on January 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chatsecure.org/blog/chatsecure-v4-released/|title=ChatSecure v4.0 - OMEMO and Signal Protocol|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Children's use of information''' is an issue in [[ethics]] and [[child development]]. Information is learned from many different sources and '''source monitoring''' (see also [[source-monitoring error]]) is important in understanding how people use information and decide which information is [[credibility|credible]]. Consider the example of a parent whose child has been diagnosed with [[hyperactivity]]; the parent searches the internet for information, reads books, participates in an online chat room with other parents in the same situation, and consults various medical professionals. Some of these sources will be credible (contain reliable information), and others will not. To be well-informed, the parent must filter information according to the reliability of the source.

Children learn about the world in much the same way. They are told things by numerous people (e.g., teachers, parents, siblings, and friends), see things on the television or internet, and read information in books. Can children be effective consumers of information? At what age are they able to do this? How do they deal with ambiguous resources? This page will detail answers to those questions (and others) by drawing on peer-reviewed scientific research.

==The development of source monitoring==
Young children have more difficulty with understanding and recalling the sources of information than adults do.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindsay | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Kwon | first3 = P. | year = 1991 | title = Developmental changes in memory source monitoring | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 297–318 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(91)90065-z | pmid=1770330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[episodic memory]] improves throughout childhood, development in the area of source monitoring tends to occur between the ages of 3 and 8 years.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = K. P. | year = 2002 | title = Children's ability to distinguish between memories from multiple sources: Implications for the quality and accuracy of eyewitness statements | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 403–435 | doi = 10.1016/S0273-2297(02)00005-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 3 years, children who are able to immediately recognize the source of the information they obtain have difficulty recalling this information after a short delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gopnik | first1 = A. | last2 = Graf | first2 = P. | year = 1988 | title = Knowing how you know: Young children's ability to identify and remember the sources of their beliefs | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 5| pages = 1366–1371 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb01505.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of source monitoring is gradual, and children achieve and display competency in certain aspects of source monitoring before others.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"/&gt; The developmental trajectory of source monitoring provides insight into what cognitive factors are necessary prerequisites. While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development of source monitoring, five major theories contribute ideas about how source monitoring develops in children: source monitoring theory, [[fuzzy-trace theory]], [[schema theory]], person-based perspective, and the mental-state reasoning model.

===Source monitoring theory===
According to source monitoring theory, the source of information is attributed through a decision-making process, where source is inferred based on various characteristics inherent in the memory itself.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"/&gt; This means that the sources are not directly [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], but rather [[Reconstructive memory|reconstructed]], when information is recalled. This decision-making process can either be through automatic, unconscious processing, or through heightened demanding and systematic processing that may require reasoning, and the retrieval of supporting memories. This theory implicates the development of episodic memory and memory strategies in the development of source monitoring more generally.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
{{see also|Fuzzy-trace theory}}
Fuzzy-trace theory hypothesizes that the source-monitoring errors that children make are caused by problems with memory [[Storage (memory)|storage]] and [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brainerd | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Reyna | first2 = V. F. | year = 1990 | title = Gist is the grist: Fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 3–47 | doi=10.1016/0273-2297(90)90003-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories are simultaneously stored in two different formats: the "gist" level (extracted from the experience), and the "verbatim" representation (information in exact detail). It is proposed that the source of information is encoded in memory as a verbatim detail. Memories for verbatim details decay more quickly over time than gist representations, and young children demonstrate faster decay of verbatim information than older children or adults. Younger children are more likely to experience memory intrusions due to weaker memory traces, which leads to a susceptibility to misleading information replacing memory traces from a previous event.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"/&gt; For this reason, developmental changes in episodic memory performance are viewed as the driving factor in source monitoring development.

===Schema theory===
{{see also|Schema (psychology)}}
Schema theory, as a derivative of [[script theory]], states that after repeated exposure to similar events, individuals form a general representation of what typically happens.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, M. J., &amp; Goodman, G. S. (1990). Developmental differences in the relation between scripts and episodic memory: Do they exist? In Knowing and remembering in young children, Fivush, Robyn, Hudson, Judith A. eds., (pp. 30-64). Cambridge University Press, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Some details are the same at each instance of repeated events, and others can vary from instance to instance. In the script for what usually happens, there is a "slot" for each variable detail and the detail for a particular time is chosen from a list of possible variations. If source information is encoded as a slot, errors in source monitoring can be the result of incorrect retrieval of a specific detail. This framework allows for the storage of a large amount of detailed information about specific events, however is very cognitively demanding for children. Because of their limited cognitive resources, young children require more experience with repeated events in order to generate a schema. Details that vary from instance to instance can be lost, and children rely instead on the generalized event representation when attempting to recall a particular instance. The main assumption is that the development of source monitoring depends on an increase in cognitive processing capacity.

===Person-based perspective===
Person-based perspective emphasizes [[Prospective memory|prospective processes]]. Prospective processes relate actions to one another through operations such as sequencing and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Foley | first2 = M. A. | year = 1996 | title = A unifying framework for the development of children's activity memory | url = | journal = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 33–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes are affected by the perspective taken (self vs. other) or the goals and meaning to the individual. The meaning attached to the goal of an action can interfere with source monitoring by removing attention from the source details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Ratner | first2 = H. H. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing between memories for thoughts and deeds: The role of prospective processing in children's source monitoring | url = | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1998.tb00765.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person-based perspective is social-cognitive in nature (more so than other theories of source monitoring) and assumes that development is reliant on socialization and [[theory of mind]] development.

===Mental-state reasoning model===
The mental-state reasoning model highlights possible mechanisms behind young children's suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;Welch-Ross, M. (2000). A mental-state reasoning model of suggestibility and memory source monitoring. In Children's source monitoring, Roberts, Kim P., Blades, Mark, eds., (pp. 227-255). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have difficulty with reasoning about conflicting [[mental representation]]s are likely to overwrite their original memories with misinformation because they cannot reconcile two contradicting views of what actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bright-Paul | first1 = A. | last2 = Jarrold | first2 = C. | last3 = Wright | first3 = D. B. | year = 2008 | title = Theory of mind development influences suggestibility and source monitoring | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1055 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1055–1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Source monitoring and the understanding of knowledge states, play a key role in resisting suggestions. The development of source monitoring is presumed to be based on better understanding of knowledge states, [[metacognition]] and theory of mind.

==The origins of knowledge==
Being aware of how we have acquired information is particularly difficult for young children (specifically 3 to 5 year-olds). After feeling a soft ball, 3 and 4 year-olds can correctly identify whether they know the ball is soft or hard, but cannot always say how they know. Perhaps it is because they felt the ball, saw the ball, or were told it was soft. The ability to recognize the origin of their knowledge requires the understanding of how knowledge is acquired.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D. K. | last2 = Astington | first2 = J. W. | last3 = Flavell | first3 = J. H. | year = 1992 | title = Young children's understanding of the role that sensory experiences play in knowledge acquisition | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge and justification===
When asked '''knowledge questions''' ("Do you know what is in the box?") then '''justification questions''' ("How do [or why don't] you know what is in the box?"), children who can correctly answer are able to reflect on knowledge that they have gained from a particular source and should be able to identify the source of information.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Hogrefe | first2 = | last3 = Perner | first3 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Children's understanding of informational access as source of knowledge | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 386–396 | doi=10.2307/1130318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3 and 4 year-olds are better at answering these questions when the questions refer to themselves in comparison to referring to another person. When these children are shown a hidden object they can correctly report their perceptual access (responding correctly to "Did you look into the box?") and their knowledge access of what is in the box (responding correctly to "Do you know [not know] what is in the box?").&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; Despite their ability to answer correctly when referring to the self, 3 and 4 year-olds have difficulty responding to the "other's" knowledge, where they deny the "other" has the knowledge. 3-4 year-olds can correctly identify that the other person has in fact looked in a box, but when asked "Does [other] know what is in the box?" the child will deny that the other person knows what is in the box.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; The key assumption is then that although children are aware that perceptual access is needed, they are unable to acknowledge that the knowledge was gained from perceptual access.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pratt | first1 = C. | last2 = Bryant | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Young children understand that looking leads to knowing (so long as they are looking into a single barrel) | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 973–982 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02835.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaining knowledge through looking, touching, and asking===
Gaining knowledge is knowing how to acquire new information. The ability to recognize how specific knowledge can be gained by perceptual access (looking, feeling or smelling) is the understanding of Aspectuality. '''Aspectuality''' understanding is the awareness that an object is made up of many different properties (colour, weight, odour), which can be determined by a specific perceptual action (looking, feeling, smelling).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = G. M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = S. R. | year = 2012 | title = How should we question young children's understanding of aspectuality? | url = | journal = The British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 376–392 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02044.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the colour of a car outside the window could involve asking someone for the information or looking out the window. In most cases, adults would acquire this knowledge from simply looking out the window. However, not all information can be gained in this manner. If you were asked to find out how old the driver of the car is, simply looking would not provide accurate information; you would have to ask. These two situations are dependent on whether the information being sought out is visible or invisible (respectively).&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitneva | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Lam | first2 = N. H. L. | last3 = Dunfield | first3 = K. A. | year = 2013 | title = The development of children's information gathering: To look or to ask? | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 533–542 | doi = 10.1037/a0031326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge development depends on children's ability to efficiently pursue their informational goal. Children do not always make the most effective or efficient decision when acquiring new information.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

====Age differences====
6 year-olds are able to distinguish when gaining knowledge requires looking (the information is visible) or when gaining knowledge requires asking (the information is invisible). However, 4 year-olds do not perform as consistently. Even with an [[expert]] present, 4 year-olds will [[estimation|overestimate]] the knowledge they can gain through looking. However, when the information to be gained is regarding a group of friends and the expert is a friend of the group, 4 year-olds tend to overestimate knowledge acquisition through asking.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

When given access to pairs of objects, which could either be identified by seeing (identical objects: different in colour) or by touch/feeling (identical objects: 1 soft, 1 hard), children perform relatively well, generally recognizing when they have adequate information and when they have inadequate information (i.e., knowing the object is blue after seeing it or knowing the object is soft after feeling it).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Pendle | first3 = J. E. C. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of the knowledge gained from seeing and feeling | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 299–305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00676.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, when young children are not given access (of seeing or feeling), they have difficulty predicting and identifying which mode of access would allow them to identify the object.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"/&gt; In this case, 3 and 4 year-olds overestimate the knowledge that could be gained through feeling the object.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt; 3 to 4 year-olds may not understand the perceptual access needed to acquire the specific knowledge.

===Language and question phrasing===
Waters and Beck (2012) state "understanding the link between perceptual access and consequent information (knowledge access) is a crucial component in the development of [[theory of mind]]". In a typical adult population, change in the phrasing of a particular question would not affect the understanding of what action needs to occur. "What colour is the bike that is outside?" or "Is the bike red?" should not change the action of ''looking'' to gain the needed information. However, children's performance is susceptible to this type of question phrasing.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doherty | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1998 | title = Metalinguistic awareness and theory of mind: Just two words for the same thing? | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 279–305 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(98)90012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perner | first1 = J. | last2 = Rendl | first2 = B | last3 = Garnham | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Objects of desire, thought, and reality: Problems of anchoring discourse referents in development | url = | journal = Mind &amp; Language | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 475–513 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.2007.00317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are language effects on knowledge access through 3 different question types:&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012" /&gt;

#'''Identity''': "Find out ''which one'' is in the tunnel",
#'''Dimension''': "Find out ''what colour'' the one in the tunnel is"
#'''Aspect''': "Find out if the one in the tunnel ''is the red one'' or ''the blue one''".

4 and 5 year-olds are more likely to respond correctly to aspect and dimension questions in comparison to identity questions.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt; Aspect and dimension questions are more explicit, which may be why performance is better in these categories. Identity questions require more cognitive effort as one has to remember how the objects were similar and how they differed.

==Judging the credibility of sources and understanding of trust==
Much of people's knowledge about the world is not obtained from direct experience, but indirectly from what other people or sources tell them. With widespread use of the internet people have access to nearly unlimited sources of information. Some of that information might be conflicting, and different sources of information vary in their accuracy and credibility. People can also deliberately [[deception|deceive]], be misunderstood, or be mistaken.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nurmsoo | first1 = E. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2009 | title = Children's trust in previously inaccurate informants who were well or poorly informed: When past errors can be excused | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 23–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01243.x | pmid=19236390}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that people develop the necessary skills to assess the accuracy of what they are being told.

===Adults' credibility judgments===
Adults make credibility judgments based on two factors: expertise and trustworthiness. For example, we might trust information from published research articles more than information from blogs because we know that anyone can write a blog, but scientists (experts) who write peer-reviewed articles are highly trained. With regards to trustworthiness, adults are less likely to believe someone who they think is trying to deceive them, and they take into account the intentions of the information-provider. For example, if someone's intention is to sell you something, you might be more skeptical of the accuracy of the information they provide because their motives cause you to question their honesty. Adults can effectively use these cues to make judgments about the credibility of different sources, but whether children can also do so is an important area for research.

===Children's ability to make credibility judgments===
Even very young children show an early sensitivity to issues of source credibility. By the age of 4, children show similar patterns to adults in a preference for perception over testimony; that is, they would rather see something with their own eyes than be told about it. Children also feel more confident in their knowledge when they have directly perceived it than if they have been told by someone else, even if the speaker is well informed.&lt;ref name="Robinson2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Nurmsoo | first3 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of knowledge sources: Confidence in knowledge gained from testimony | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 105–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children are not always able to directly perceive information, and they learn much of what they know from others. Some people are more [[credibility|credible]] sources of information than others, so children must actively evaluate information and decide whether or not to believe it. There are many factors or cues that children, by the age of 4, take into consideration when making judgements about whether or not to trust what a person says. For instance, [[knowledge]] and experience, [[trait theory|traits]], [[motivation]]s, age, and reasoning or support.

====Credibility judgments based on knowledge and experience====
Young children have a reputation for [[credulity]], or believing something without having any proof that it is true. Young children often [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] what adults tell them, especially when they have no prior knowledge or expectations about the topic of the testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Carrington Croft | first2 = A. | last3 = Setia | first3 = A. R. | last4 = Cole | first4 = C. A. | year = 2010 | title = Young children have a specific, highly robust bias to trust testimony | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 1541–1547 | doi=10.1177/0956797610383438 | pmid=20855905 | pmc=3507998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because children tend to interact with adults who are more knowledgeable than themselves, if they have no reason to believe otherwise, they will trust what adults tell them. In particular, 3 year-olds tendency to believe others is based on a selective bias to trust what people tell them. This selective trust is adaptive in the early years as they are learning language and their way around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baier | first1 = A | year = 1986 | title = Trust and anti-trust | url = | journal = Ethics | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 231–260 | doi=10.1086/292745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have difficulty disregarding information provided to them, even if the source has been unreliable in the past. 3 year-olds will often continue to believe what a person tells them even after being repeatedly deceived by that person, but 4 year-olds are far better able to disregard this unreliable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mascaro | first1 = O. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = The moral, epistemic, and mind- reading components of children's vigilance towards deception | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2009.05.012| journal = Cognition | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 367–380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-year-olds are better at making trust judgments when they are able to choose between two sources of knowledge, rather than deciding whether or not to believe a single person, and in this situation they are often able to choose the more reliable of two speakers.&lt;ref name="Lane2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J.

====Credibility judgments based on traits and motivation====
Almost all human institutions (e.g., family, community, business, government) are built on a foundation of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref name="Xu2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = F. | last2 = Evans | first2 = A.

(1999). Selected philosophical works. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various schools of philosophical thought that posits honesty to be morally right and lying to be morally wrong. On one end of the continuum, philosophers like Bok,&lt;ref&gt;Bok, S. (1978). Lying: Moral choice in public and private life. New York, NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1949). On a supposed right to lie from altruistic motives. In L.W. Beck (Ed.), Critical of practical reason and other writings (pp.346–350). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Augustine&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, St. (1952). Treaties on various issues. Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hold a [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] view that focuses on intrinsic duties relating to the treatment of others. In other words, telling the truth is intrinsically right and lying is intrinsically wrong. On the other end of the continuum is the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view that emphasizes the greater good, specifically with respect to the outcome of one's act. Therefore, lying and its moral implications are context dependent.&lt;ref&gt;see for example, Austin, J. L. (1962). How to do things with words. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, such as when being polite to spare another person's feelings, making a "prosocial lie" or deliberate false statement are endorsed.

Children consider motivation, as well as traits, when deciding who to seek information from and who to believe. In both Eastern and Western cultures, both adults and children adhere to the utilitarian perspective when giving moral evaluations of truths and lies in different social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | first1 = | last2 = Fu | first2 = G. | last3 = Evans | first3 = A. D. | last4 = Wang | first4 = L. | last5 = Lee | first5 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Lying in the name of collective good: A developmental study | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00695.x | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 495–503 | pmc = 2570108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of people's characteristics, children tend to place trust in people who are honest, smart, or [[Kindness|kind]] over people who are dishonest, not smart, or not kind.&lt;ref name="Lane2013" /&gt; However, they also consider a person's intent or [[motivation]]. From age 7, children consider both [[honesty]] and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] when making trust judgments about other people, and older children are more likely to trust people who tell prosocial lies (to avoid hurting another person's feelings or to help another person) than young children.&lt;ref name="Xu2013" /&gt; For younger children, honesty is more important than a person's intention. As children get older, they increasingly attend to motivation as a key factor. The relationship between telling the truth and trusting a person is stable, but when it comes to lying, children consider the motivation of the speaker when deciding whether or not to trust them.

====Credibility judgments based on age and reliability====
Children evaluate the [[credibility]] of a speaker by evaluating how reliable that person has been in the past and can make predictions about a speaker based on their age.&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Neely | first2 = L. A. | year = 2006 | title = Adults don't always know best: Preschoolers use past reliability over age when learning new words | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 757–758 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01778.x | pmid=16984291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as 3 years-old prefer to trust an unfamiliar adult rather than an unfamiliar child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = M. | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = B.S. | last3 = Bowden | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = Perspective taking and theory of mind: Do children predict interpretive diversity as a function of differences in observers' knowledge? | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 1334–1351 | doi=10.2307/1130810}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering both age and reliability, age is often the primary cue used to determine another's credibility. For example, 3 and 4 year-olds found adults to be more trustworthy than peers, unless the peer demonstrated greater reliability (i.e., adult incorrectly mislabelled objects, whereas peer correctly labelled them).&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006" /&gt; Children also consider both the prior history of accuracy and the level of perceptual access the speaker has when they provide information. Young children spontaneously keep track of the prior history of a person's accuracy or inaccuracy (reliability) and prefer to learn from someone with a good track record.&lt;ref name="Birch2008" /&gt; Children commonly interpret the speaker's history of inaccuracy as a lasting trait and so the speaker is considered an unreliable informant, at least within the domain they have been wrong about. However, under certain conditions, children may excuse a person's past inaccuracy and later [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] that person for information. If a speaker has limited information (e.g., lack of perceptual access) in making a claim – for example, inaccurately identifying a toy while blindfolded – then children as young as 3 years-old appropriately excuse their past inaccuracy especially when they are later well-informed.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009" /&gt; On the other hand, if a speaker has full access to information while making an inaccurate claim, children continue to regard him/her as unreliable.

====Credibility judgments based on reasoning or support====
Young children appreciate that people generally think and act sensibly when reasons are present, and they can evaluate a claim by assessing the quality of the reasoning provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Bartsch | first2 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Young children's reasoning about beliefs | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(88)90021-2 | journal = Cognition | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 239–277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, children create an epistemic profile of a person based on the quality of the reasons they offer when making a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = M. A. | year = 2012 | title = Beyond semantic accuracy: Preschoolers evaluate a speaker's reasons | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1051–1063 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01742.x | pmid=22417290}}&lt;/ref&gt; As young as 3 years-old, children understand the difference between weak versus strong reasoning to support a statement. Children are more likely to [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] someone when strong support is provided through: reliable testimony ("My teacher told me there's a book in the bag. I think that there's a book"), looking ("Before I came here, I looked and saw a ball in the bag. I think there's a ball in there"), and [[inference]] ("It's a backpack. Backpack holds books. I think there's a book in there").&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; On the other hand, [[desire]] ("I like crayons. I want there to be crayons in the bag. I think that there are crayons in there"), pretense ("I like to pretend. I'm going to pretend that there's a sandwich in the bag. I think there's a sandwich in there"), and guessing ("I don't know. I'm going to guess that there's a toy in the bag") are not viewed as strong support for a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; Children recognize that the mental states that they and others may hold are not always reliable means for drawing specific conclusions. 3 and 4 year-olds can also choose the more reasonable of two people and continue to seek, as well as, accept new information from the more credible person (the one who had better reasons in the past).&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt;

===Children's development of distrust===
People are not always reliable in their provision of information and it is important to be able to differentiate between good sources and bad sources. Assessing someone's reliability is based not only on the knowledgeability of the speaker, but their motives/[[intention]]s as well. People may not always be motivated to tell the [[truth]]; instead, they may potentially [[lie]] to promote their own interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Legare | first2 = C. H. | year = 2005 | title = Children's evaluation of sources of information about traits | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 636–647 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.636 | pmid=16060810}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interest of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G.

E. | last2 = Liu | first2 = D. | last3 = Heyman | first3 = G.

Beginning at 5 years-old, children use a person's prior history of deception to make reliability judgments about that person.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt2011" /&gt;

== Metacognition ==
[[Metacognition]] is an ability that allows people to think about their own thinking process, and how to use their thinking process to help themselves learn better. Metacognition includes two separate abilities: (1) knowledge of cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.&lt;ref name="schraw1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schraw | first1 = G. | last2 = Dennison | first2 = R.

Kluwe (Eds.), Metacognition, motivation, and understanding (pp. 65-116). Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of one's thinking process is not enough to regulate an individual's behaviour, and are required to use specific strategies to help them regulate their behaviour.&lt;ref name="schraw1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brown1987" /&gt;

===Knowing you don't know===
An important skill children need to learn is being able to identify when a message is incomplete and they don't have enough information to make an accurate interpretation. Being aware that an ambiguous situation has arisen is difficult for young children. Children accurately "know when they know", but often overestimate when they don't know.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E.

Despite incorrectly stating that they "know" something, children are still capable of changing their response upon hearing contradicting information to an initial interpretation and/or event.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Whittaker | first2 = S. J. | year = 1985 | title = Children's responses to ambiguous messages and their understanding of ambiguity | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 446–454 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.3.446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language plays an important role in children's accuracy in assessing their own knowledge. For children to accurately "know what they know" it is important for them to understand the various meanings of the word "know" as well as language used to describe certainty and uncertainty.&lt;ref name="mitchell1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C.

===Children's judgments about ignorant and ambiguous sources===
[[Ambiguity|Ambiguous]] information is "a piece of information (word, message, or view) with multiple interpretations".&lt;ref name="beck2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Freeth | first3 = M.

Young children have difficulty with recognizing ambiguity and understanding how to handle it. Typically, it is not until the age of 6 or 7 that children have the ability to successfully deal with ambiguous input.&lt;ref name="beck2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E.

J. (1992). Children's understanding of the evidential connotation of 'know' in relation to overestimation of their own knowledge, Journal of Child Language, 19, 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of language and prior experience===
Language can play an important role in the ability to correctly decipher ambiguous input. One can "know" someone in many different ways, for example, seeing them, talking to them, having a prior history with them, etc. This makes questions like "Do you know?" very complicated and difficult to respond to. More explicit definitions of "to know" seem to assist children in better assessing their own knowledge. Children as young as 4 years were able to make far more accurate statements about their actual knowledge when a question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Children's judgements of ignorance on the basis of absence of experience | url = | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 113–129 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1994.tb00623.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 6, children are typically able to accurately assess their knowledge with very little impact on their future behaviours regardless of the language used. 4-5 year-old's, on the other hand, were so susceptible to change that the phrase used altered their response to future questions. 4-5 year-old's were also less likely to overestimate their knowledge of a target person if the initial question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; Not only can responses from children be altered by the phrasing of the question, but the suggestion of lack of prior experience with the target is enough for children to change their response. In a study where children were asked if they really knew who a specific person was (between 2 pictures of people they had never seen before), they were more accurate in assessing that they ''didn't know'' when it was suggested that the target person had never been to the child's city before.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; While experience is important, children tend not to over-rely on prior experiences and only use it when they've had significant experience that would actually assist them in assessing their knowledge.&lt;ref name= "robinson1994" /&gt;

===Partial information===
Sometimes when confronted with ambiguous information, more than one piece of information is required to make and accurate interpretation. For example, in a study where children had to pick one of four pictures presented to them after hearing ambiguous information, they were capable of making tentative interpretations and then correctly changing their interpretations upon hearing contradicting, clarifying information.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; This strategy uses multiple pieces of information and has been seen in children as young as 15 months old.&lt;ref name="ganea2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganea | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Saylor | first2 = M. M. | year = 2007 | title = Infants' use of shared linguistic information to clarify ambiguous requests | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 493–502 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01011.x | pmid=17381786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where only partial information is available, young children make the best interpretation possible with the information given and go on to change this interpretation only when contradicting information emerges.&lt;ref name="robinson1982" /&gt;

===Delaying interpretation===
The presentation of clarifying information is not always immediately accessible. In these situations, adults seem to delay interpretation and seek clarifying information when appropriate. Even more difficult than acknowledging that an ambiguous situation has arisen, is children's understanding in what actions they need to take for clarification. There are 2 different types of delay in interpreting ambiguous information: one that is [[intention]]al and one that is [[instinct]]ual.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; The explicit decision to delay interpretation and seek further information is a difficult one as it involves being aware that the current information is not sufficient, and knowing how to acquire appropriate information necessary for clarification. Children are typically not successful in this process until the age of 7.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; However, when this explicit decision to delay is simplified, children aged 5 and up showed some ability in successfully choosing to delay their response.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; While the ability for intentionally delaying interpretation seems to be difficult, the ability to delay interpretation instinctively seems to be easier for young children. In one example, children were asked to stamp the correct snowman once they knew which one it was.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Their knowledge of the correct snowman was based on a researcher slowly revealing the target snowman. The children's cards contained snowmen that differed by some feature visible on the 2nd half of the snowman only and therefore the children were required to wait until the 2nd half of the snowman was revealed in order to accurately assess which snowman was the correct one. In this scenario focusing on instinct, children as young as 5 were able to accurately delay interpretation.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Therefore, while it is difficult for children to explicitly demonstrate their awareness of an ambiguous situation and how to resolve it, they are implicitly able to handle situations in which delaying interpretation may be beneficial.

===Referents and meaning===
It is difficult for younger children to grasp the idea that objects can be referred to in different ways and that people can have partial knowledge of the different references (i.e. a "bouncy ball" might also be referred to as a "rubber sphere"). A child might know by looking that a toy is a toy truck, but they may not be aware that the toy truck is also a present. [[Opaque context|Referential opacity]] is the concept of whether or not referring to an object changes its meaning. If something is referentially ''transparent'' (substitution insensitive), altering the [[referent]] term does not alter the meaning, and something that is referentially ''opaque'' (substitution sensitive) means that altering the referent term would alter the meaning. An example of this is a study with a puppet named Heinz.&lt;ref name="robinson2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Apperly | first2 = I. A. | year = 2001 | title = Children's difficulties with partial representations in ambiguous messages and referentially opaque contexts | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 595–615 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(00)00035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a ball in a box and children are told that Heinz knows that there is a ball in the box but does not know that the ball is a present. Children are then asked substitution-insensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know the ball is a present? – asking, "Does Heinz know the rubber sphere is a present?" ''does not'' alter the meaning of the question) and substitution sensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know there's a present in the box? – asking "Does Heinz know there is a rubber sphere in the box" ''does'' alter the meaning of the question). Regardless of age, substitution-''insensitive'' questions seem to be easier than substitution-''sensitive'' questions. The ability to correctly answer substitution-sensitive questions improves with age.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt; The ability to answer these types of questions is closely related to effectively evaluating ambiguous messages. Success on substitution-insensitive questions is necessary but not sufficient for success on evaluation ambiguous messages. Alternatively, success on substitution-sensitive questions is necessary and sufficient for success at evaluating ambiguous messages.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt;

=== Physical and epistemic uncertainty ===
Children can change their interpretation of information based on the context in which the interpretation is made.&lt;ref name="robinson2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Rowley | first2 = M. G. | last3 = Beck | first3 = S. R. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = D. J. | last5 = Apperly | first5 = I. A. | year = 2006 | title = Children's sensitivity to their own relative ignorance: Handling of possibilities under epistemic and physical uncertainty | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 1642–1655 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00964.x | pmid=17107451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and colleagues (2006) studied children's interpretation of information in two different: physical and epistemic uncertainty. Physical uncertainty occurs when an event has not yet happened, and therefore the outcome of that event has not been determined (i.e. the dice has not yet been rolled). Epistemic uncertainty occurs when an event has already occurred, but the child is not aware of the outcome of the event (i.e. the dice have been rolled, but the dice are hidden from the participant). 4 to 8 year old children have the ability to realize multiple possibilities for an event that has not yet occurred (''physical uncertainty''), however they do not seem to acknowledge that there are exactly the same possibilities for an event that has already happened when they don't know the outcome (''epistemic uncertainty''). Under the conditions of ''epistemic uncertainty'', children simply guess one of the possibilities. Beck and colleagues (2011) propose that this happens because it is much easier to imagine the outcome during epistemic uncertainty, basically knowing that there is only one outcome.&lt;ref name="beck2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = | last2 = McColgan | first2 = K. L. T. | last3 = Robinson | first3 = E. J. | last4 = Rowley | first4 = M. G. | year = 2011 | title = Imagining what might be: Why children underestimate uncertainty | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 110 | issue = | pages = 603–610 | doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2011.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, adults also prefer to make predictions or guess in epistemic uncertainty.&lt;ref name="robinson2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Pendle | first2 = J. | last3 = Rowley | first3 = M. G. | last4 = Beck | first4 = S. R. | last5 = McColgan | first5 = K. L.

=== Feeling-of-knowing (FOK) ===
Feeling-of-knowing occurs when people are unable to easily recall a memory or a fact, but they know that they learned it and are able to recognize it, such as in a multiple-choice test.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, T.O., &amp; Narens, L. (1994). Why investigate metacognition? In J. Metcalife &amp;A.P. Shimamura (Eds.), Metacognition. Knowing about knowing (pp. 1–25). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults' accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments is well above chance but not nearly perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koriat | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = How do we know that we know? The accessibility model of the feeling of knowing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 609–639 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.609}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to be the same for children as well. Lockl and Schneider (2002) did not find any developmental trends in the accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments. Instead, similar to adults, children's accuracy of feeling-of knowing judgments was low, but still above chance for all age groups studied (grade 1 through grade 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lockl | first1 = K. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = W. | year = 2002 | title = Developmental trends in children's feeling-of-knowing judgments | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 327–333 | doi=10.1080/01650250143000210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting a child to attend to this feeling-of-knowing (through language or prompting of prior experience) is one way to assist them in more accurately assessing their actual knowledge, allowing them to handle ambiguous situations at a much younger age.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt;

==Forensic applications==
Children are highly susceptible to a "[[suggestibility]] effect", producing "[[false memory|false memories]]" and/or "incorrect, post-event information" (see [[misinformation effect]]) when asked to engage in memory recall.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welch-Ross | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Diecidue | first2 = K. | last3 = Miller | first3 = S. A. | year = 1997 | title = Young children's understanding of conflicting mental representation predicts suggestibility | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 43–53 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for forensic interviewing and child witness testimony.&lt;ref name="goodman2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Melinder | first2 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Child witness research and forensic interviews of young children: A review | url = | journal = Legal and Criminological Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.1348/135532506x156620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the prominent case of Kelly Michael's (see [[Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial]]), where improper interviewing techniques lead to a miscarriage of justice. In order to develop reliable and age-appropriate instruments for interviewing children, it is imperative to consider their cognitive development, verbal and mental abilities.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

===Forensic interviews and techniques===
====Factors that can impact disclosure====
It is critical for a forensic interviewer to recognize their power during an interview, especially with a child witness. An interviewer can impact the course of a child's testimony in numerous ways, including:
* Eliciting "false allegations" through leading and suggestive questions&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Determining the amount of detail a child may disclose&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Prevent a child from disclosing&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Interviewer's gender may also impact the quality and details of disclosure. Children between the ages of 4 and 6 are more likely to disclose to an interviewer of the same gender.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

The age of a child is also an important factor during interviewing. Younger children are more likely to provide shorter, less detailed accounts of an event in comparison to older children.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Preschool children are more likely to disclose information in an "accidental way" through triggers and obvious cues, whereas older school children are more likely to make "intentional disclosures" based on the nature of the question they are asked.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Improper interviewing====
There are varying techniques and extraneous factors that can influence the way a child discloses an event during child witness testimony (e.g., experiences of abuse by a parent or caregiver). There are two major types of barriers in forensic interviews: (1) improper interviewing and (2) clumsy interviewing&lt;ref name="wood2000"&gt;Wood, J., &amp; Garven, S. (2000). How sexual abuse interviews go astray: Implications for prosecutors, police and child protection services. ''Child Maltreatment'', 5, 109-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cronch | first1 = L. E. | last2 = Viljoen | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Hansen | first3 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Forensic interviewing in child sexual abuse cases: Current techniques and future directions | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behaviour | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 195–207 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Improper interviewing'' includes forensic techniques that are considered to be "risky and ineffective".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Each of the following techniques can create critically negative consequences in witness testimony and result in false allegations or the potential for a reduced conviction:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Use of reinforcement: If an interviewer utilizes rewards and punishments to coerce disclosure&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Social influence: If an interviewer informs a child of another child's disclosure or recollection&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Asking suggestive or leading questions: This can occur when an interviewer provides a child with information that has not been previously known&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Removing the child from direct experience: For example, asking a child "what ''might'' have happened"&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

''Clumsy interviewing'' involves interviews that fail to include best practices and recommended techniques.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Interviewers who are not properly trained in forensic techniques can fail to follow structured interview guidelines and impact the outcome of a child's testimony and/or responses to questioning. This type of interviewing most often occurs when an interviewer lacks skill, forgets important procedures, and when there is a lack of necessary supervision.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

In order to prevent improper forensic interviewing, numerous methods to reduce suggestibility and the misinformation effect have been proven effective, including: taping interviews, recording transcripts, ensuring supervision by a qualified professional, experience in working with children, training in forensic interviewing, and maintaining a comfortable, safe environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Types of interviewing====
The '''''cognitive interview''''' utilizes cognitive theory as a focal point in its interview methodology. The cognitive interview, first developed in 1992 by researchers Fisher and Geiselman, was originally developed for adults and later modified for children. It utilizes two major perspectives from cognitive theory, including the "[[encoding specificity principle]]" and a "multi-component view of memory traces".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

Specifically, this method utilizes four major techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Report everything: i.e., "''tell me everything you remember''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Context reinstatement: i.e., "''think back to where you were at the time''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Reverse order: i.e., "''now that you told me what happened, try to remember it again but this time starting at the end and recounting it in reverse chronological order''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Change perspective: i.e., "''what would the perpetrator have seen and heard?''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol'''''
developed an investigative protocol in 2000 to create a structured interview technique for children, specifically those of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Orbach | first2 = Y. | last3 = Hershkowitz | first3 = I. | last4 = Esplin | first4 = P. W. | last5 = Horowitz | first5 = D. | year = 2007 | title = A structured forensic interview protocol improves the quality and informativeness of investigative interviews with children: A review of research using the NICHD Investigative Protocol | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1201–1231 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.03.021 | pmid=18023872 | pmc=2180422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses the following techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007" /&gt;
# Introductory phase: This is necessary for [[rapport]] building&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Practice in free-recall: "''Tell me about your last birthday party''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Information about the ground rules: "''It's okay to say "I don't know"''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Open-ended questions: "''Tell me why you came to talk to me''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Stepwise interview'''''
utilizes open-ended questions through a "funnel-like strategy".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; It is primarily used by legal professionals, and is most often used in North America.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; This interview begins with open-ended questions and/or free recall and slowly incorporates more focused and detailed questions.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Allegation blind interviews'''''
stress that an interviewer should refrain from gathering information prior to an interview in order to reduce suggestibility and increase interviewer patience and attentiveness.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This also enhances the interviewer's ability to be non-judgmental and objective.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Truth-lie discussions'''''
are most useful prior to commencing abuse-related questioning. This method allows the interviewer to create a baseline with the child about what the "truth" is and what a "lie" is.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; The interviewer is encouraged to ask questions with general examples, such as "tell me a lie about this chair".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This strategy has been proven to result in a less misinformed child testimony.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Touch survey'''''
was developed on the basis that "touch falls on a continuum", and is beneficial to screen for child abuse.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; It includes questions surrounding the child's experiences with touch (e.g., kissing, hugging, hitting), including where they have been touched and by whom.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This tool might be more useful when used in conjunction with other forensic strategies.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

===Recommendations for forensic interviewing===
Although there are varying suggestions for structured forensic interviewing, experts provide context into best practices that can significantly reduce suggestibility, false memories and the misinformation effect:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviews should be conducted in a safe, child-friendly environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# A child's age should be considered when being interviewed, and practices should be modified accordingly.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Structured interview protocol should always be utilized.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviewers should engage in professional training when possible.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Ground rules are essential for the beginning of the interview so that the child is aware of the type of responses they can provide (e.g., "I don't know").&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

The first entry, for example, 'abase' appears in the King James Version of the Bible (KJV) four times; in the books  of ''Job'', ''Isaiah'', ''Ezekiel'', and ''Daniel''. The header of the column of the first entry, 'abi', is the first three letters of the last entry on that page.]]
{{italic title}}
'''''A Complete Concordance to the Holy Scriptures''''', generally known as '''''Cruden's Concordance''''', is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] of the [[King James Bible]] (KJV) that was singlehandedly created by [[Alexander Cruden]] (1699–1770). The ''Concordance'' was first published in 1737 and has not been [[out of print]] since then.
Two editions of the ''Concordance'' appeared during his lifetime, 1761 and 1769.
(Reference 1955 edition)
Cruden's concordance was first published in 1737, one of the first copies being personally presented to [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]] on November 3, 1737. Cruden began work on his concordance in 1735 whilst a bookseller in London. Cruden worked alone from 7am to 1am every day and completed the bulk of the work in less than a year. The proofreading and layout took a little longer. His brain was occupied with nothing else, so much so that he failed to notice the diminishing stock in his bookshop and the consequent lack of custom. "Was there ever, before or since the year 1737", writes his biographer [[Edith Olivier]], "another enthusiast for whom it was no drudgery, but a sustained passion of delight, to creep conscientiously word by word through every chapter of the Bible, and that not once only, but again and again?".&lt;ref&gt;Olivier, Edith.

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

'''Denial''', in ordinary English usage, is asserting that a statement or allegation is not true.&lt;ref name= "OED denial"&gt;{{cite book |title= Oxford English Dictionary |edition= Online, U.S. English |chapter= denial |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/denial |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate= 2014-05-24 |via= oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same word, and also '''abnegation''' ({{lang-de|Verneinung}}), is used for a [[psychological]] [[defense mechanism]] postulated by [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]], in which a person is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming [[evidence]].&lt;ref name= "OED denial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Niolon |first= Richard |date= April 8, 2011 |url=http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/counseling/defenses.html |title= Defenses |website= psychpage.com |accessdate= 2014-05-24 |publisher= Richard Niolon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund (1925). [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/die-verneinung-915/1 "Die Verneinung"].&lt;/ref&gt; An individual that exhibits such behavior is described as a denialist&lt;ref&gt;2005, The Cape Times 2005-03-11&lt;/ref&gt; or [[True-believer syndrome|true believer]]. Denial also could mean denying the happening of an event or the reliability of information, which can lead to a feeling of aloofness and to the ignoring of possibly beneficial information. 

The subject may use:
* simple denial: deny the [[reality]] of the unpleasant fact altogether
* [[minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]: admit the fact but deny its seriousness (a combination of denial and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]])
* [[psychological projection|projection]]: admit both the fact and seriousness but deny [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] by [[blaming]] somebody or something else

==In psychoanalysis==
The concept of denial is particularly important to the study of [[Substance dependence|addiction]].

The theory of denial was first researched seriously by [[Anna Freud]].  She classified denial as a mechanism of the [[(psychological)|immature]] mind, because it conflicts with the ability to learn from and cope with reality.  Where denial occurs in mature minds, it is most often associated with death, dying and [[rape]].  More recent research has significantly expanded the scope and utility of the concept.  [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] used denial as the first of [[Kübler-Ross model|five stages in the psychology of a dying patient]], and the idea has been extended to include the reactions of survivors to news of a death.&lt;ref name="Bonanno2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonanno|first=George A.|title=The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us about Life After Loss|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465019943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary psychoanalysts treat denial as the first stage of a [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] cycle. When an unwelcome change occurs, a trauma of some sort, the first impulse to disbelieve begins the process of coping. That denial, in a healthy mind, slowly rises to greater consciousness. Gradually becoming a subconscious pressure, just beneath the surface of overt awareness, the mechanism of coping then involves repression, while the person accumulates the emotional resources to fully face the trauma. Once faced, the person deals with the trauma in a stage alternately called acceptance or enlightenment, depending on the scope of the issue and the therapist's school of thought. After this stage, once sufficiently dealt with, or dealt with for the time being, the trauma must sink away from total conscious awareness again. Left out of the conscious mind, the process of [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] involves a balance of neither quite forgetting nor quite remembering. This allows the trauma to re-emerge in consciousness if it involves an ongoing process such as a protracted illness. Alternately, sublimation may begin the full resolution process, where the trauma finally sinks away into eventual forgetfulness. Occasionally this entire cycle has been referred to in modern parlance as ''denial'', confusing the full cycle with only one stage of it.&lt;ref name="pmid6853047"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dorpat |first= T.L. | title = The cognitive arrest hypothesis of denial | journal = [[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 64 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 47–58 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6853047 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further muddy discourse, the terms ''denial'' and ''cycle of denial'' sometimes get used to refer to an unhealthy, dysfunctional cycle of unresolved coping, particularly with regard to addiction and compulsion.

Unlike some other defense mechanisms postulated by [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]] (for instance, [[Psychological repression|repression]]), the general existence of denial is fairly easy to verify, even for non-specialists.  However, denial is one of the most controversial defense mechanisms, since it can be easily used to create [[unfalsifiable]] theories:  anything the subject says or does that appears to disprove the interpreter's theory is explained, not as evidence that the interpreter's theory is wrong, but as the subject's being "in denial". However, researchers note that in some cases of corroborated [[child sexual abuse]], the victims sometimes make a series of partial confessions and recantations as they struggle with their own denial and the denial of [[abusers]] or family members. Use of denial theory in a legal setting, therefore, is carefully regulated and experts' credentials verified. "Formulaic [[guilt (law)|guilt]]" simply by "being a denier" has been castigated by English judges and academics. The main objection is that denial theory is founded on the premise that that which the supposed denier is denying is truth. This usurps the judge (and jury) as triers of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= London |first1= K. |last2= Bruck |first2= M. |last3= Ceci |first3= S.J. |last4= Shuman |first4= D.W. |title= Disclosure of child sexual abuse: What does the research tell us about the ways that children tell? |journal= [[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]] |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 194–226 |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1037/1076-8971.11.1.194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What makes denial denial and not just a refusal to admit to or accept a truth or fact rests in the degree of an individual's awareness of the existence of the truth or fact. In denial, an individual does not see or is mostly unconscious of existence of the truth or fact.  The choice to refuse reality, then, is unconscious as well.  Refusal to admit to or accept a truth or fact differs from denial in that the individual recognizes or is conscious of the existence of the truth or fact but consciously refuses to accept it as such.{{cn|date=November 2014}}
===Denial and disavowal&lt;!--'Disavowal' and 'Disavowal (psychoanalysis)' redirect here--&gt;===
Freud employs the term  ''{{lang|de|Verleugnung}}'' (usually translated either as "disavowal" or as "denial") as distinct from ''{{lang|de|Verneinung}}'' (usually translated as "denial" or as "abnegation"). In ''Verleugnung'', the defense consists of denying something that affects the individual and is a way of affirming what he or she is apparently denying. For Freud, ''Verleugnung'' is related to [[Psychosis|psychoses]], whereas ''[[Psychological repression|Verdrängung]]'' is a [[Neurosis|neurotic]] defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Salomon Resnik|Salomon Resnik]], ''The Delusional Person: Bodily Feelings in Psychosis'', Karnac Books, 2001, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud uses the term ''verleugnen'' in "The Loss of Reality in Neurosis and Psychosis" (1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Freud broadened his clinical work on disavowal beyond the realm of psychosis. In "Fetishism" (1927), he reported a case of two young men each of whom denied the death of his father. Freud notes that neither of them developed a psychosis, even though "a piece of reality which was undoubtedly important has been disavowed [''verleugnet''], just as the unwelcome fact of women's castration is disavowed in fetishists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain de Mijolla]] (ed.). ''International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'', 1st vol.: [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435300366.html "Disavowal"], Macmillan Reference Books, {{ISBN|0-02-865924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The concept of denial is important in [[twelve-step program]]s, where the abandonment or reversal of denial forms the basis of the first, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth steps.  The ability to deny or minimize is an essential part of what enables an addict to continue his or her behavior despite evidence that—to an outsider—appears overwhelming.  This is cited as one of the reasons that compulsion is seldom effective in treating addiction—the habit of denial remains.

Understanding and avoiding denial is also important in the treatment of various diseases.  The [[American Heart Association]] cites denial as a principal reason that treatment of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] is delayed.  Because the symptoms are so varied, and often have other potential explanations, the opportunity exists for the patient to deny the emergency, often with fatal consequences.  It is common for patients to delay mammograms or other tests because of a fear of cancer, even though this is clearly maladaptive.  It is the responsibility of the care team, and of the nursing staff in particular, to train at-risk patients to avoid this behavior.

==Types==
===Denial of fact===
In this form of denial, someone avoids a fact by utilizing deception.  This lying can take the form of an outright falsehood (commission), leaving out certain details to tailor a story (omission), or by falsely agreeing to something (assent). Someone who is in denial of fact is typically using lies to avoid facts they think may be painful to themselves or others.

===Denial of responsibility===
This form of denial involves avoiding personal responsibility by:
* ''[[blaming]]'': a direct statement shifting culpability and may overlap with denial of fact
* ''[[Minimisation (psychology)|minimizing]]'': an attempt to make the effects or results of an action appear to be less harmful than they may actually be
* ''[[Rationalization (making excuses)|justifying]]'': when someone takes a choice and attempts to make that choice appear acceptable due to their perception of what is right in a situation
* ''[[Regression (psychology)|regression]]'': when someone acts in a way unbecoming of their age&lt;ref name="SirriFava2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Sirri |first1= L. |last2= Fava |first2= G.A. |title= Diagnostic criteria for psychosomatic research and somatic symptom disorders |journal= [[International Review of Psychiatry]] |volume= 25 |issue= 1 |year= 2013 |pages= 19–30 |pmid= 23383664 |doi= 10.3109/09540261.2012.726923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone using denial of responsibility is usually attempting to avoid potential harm or pain by shifting [[attention]] away from themselves.

===Denial of impact===
Denial of impact involves a person's avoiding thinking about or understanding the harms of his or her behavior has caused to self or others, i.e. denial of consequences. Doing this enables that person to avoid feeling a sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and it can prevent him or her from developing remorse or empathy for others. Denial of impact reduces or eliminates a sense of pain or harm from poor decisions.&lt;ref name="SirriFava2013"/&gt;

===Denial of cycle===
Many who use this type of denial will say things such as, "[[Just-world hypothesis|it just happened]]". Denial of cycle is where a person avoids looking at their decisions leading up to an event or does not consider their pattern of decision making and how harmful behavior is repeated. The pain and harm being avoided by this type of denial is more of the effort needed to change the focus from a singular event to looking at preceding events. It can also serve as a way to blame or justify behavior (see above).

=== Denial of awareness ===
This form of denial attempts to divert pain by claiming that the level of [[awareness]] was inhibited by some mitigating variable. This is most typically seen in [[addiction]] situations where drug or alcohol abuse is a factor, though it also occasionally manifests itself in relation to [[mental health]] issues or the pharmaceutical substances used to treat mental health issues. This form of denial may also overlap with denial of responsibility.&lt;ref name="pmid11494588"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ino |first1= A. |last2= Tatsuki |first2= S. |last3= Nishikawa |first3= K. | title = The Denial and Awareness Scale (DAS) | language = Ja | journal = Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai Zasshi [Japanese Journal of Alcohol Studies and Drug Dependence] | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–34 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11494588 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial of denial===
This can be a difficult concept for many people to identify with in themselves, but is a major barrier to changing hurtful behaviors. Denial of denial involves thoughts, actions and behaviors which bolster confidence that nothing needs to be changed in one's personal behavior. This form of denial typically overlaps with all of the other forms of denial, but involves more self-delusion. Denial at this level can have significant consequences both personally and at a societal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Jeremy Griffith |last= Griffith |first= Jeremy | title= A Species in Denial | year= 2003 |url= http://www.worldtransformation.com/asid-cover/ |publisher= WTM Publishing &amp; Communications |isbn= 9781741290004 |via= worldtransormation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rayson |first1= D. |title= On denying denial |journal= [[Journal of Clinical Oncology]] |volume= 31 |issue= 34 |year= 2013 |pages= 4371–2 |pmid= 24166521 |doi= 10.1200/JCO.2013.52.6228 |url= http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/31/34/4371.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DARVO===
[[Harassment]] covers a wide range of offensive behaviour. It is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset. In the legal sense, it is behaviour which ''is'' found threatening or disturbing.

''DARVO'' is an [[acronym]] used to describe a common strategy of abusers: '''''d'''''eny the abuse, then '''''a'''''ttack the victim for attempting to make them accountable for their offense, thereby '''''r'''''eversing '''''v'''''ictim and '''''o'''''ffender. This may involve [[gaslighting]] and [[victim blaming]].

Psychologist [[Jennifer Freyd]] writes:

{{bq |1=...I have observed that actual abusers threaten, bully and make a nightmare for anyone who holds them accountable or asks them to change their abusive behavior. This attack, intended to chill and terrify, typically includes threats of law suits, overt and covert attacks on the whistle-blower's credibility, and so on.  The attack will often take the form of focusing on ridiculing the person who attempts to hold the offender accountable. [...] [T]he offender rapidly creates the impression that the abuser is the wronged one, while the victim or concerned observer is the offender. Figure and ground are completely reversed. [...] The offender is on the offense and the person attempting to hold the offender accountable is put on the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freyd |first= J.J. |title= II. Violations of power, adaptive blindness, and betrayal trauma theory |journal= [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |pages= 22–32 |date= February 1997 |doi= 10.1177/0959353597071004 |url= http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/jjf/articles/freyd97r.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''A Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran''''', was first published in 1873 by [[John Penrice]]. it is a small compact reference guide  consisting of 180 pages. It contains detailed entries on parts of speech and the meanings of words of the Quran. It is supposed to be an authoritative work of its kind. It has, at places, explained the Islamic tenets and article of worship also, to make the text comprehensive. Nothing further could be known about the author [[John Penrice]] except that he was the author of ''A Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran''. The book has been repeatedly published since its first publication in 1873. This edition is published by ''Library of Islam, Kazi Publications''  {{ISBN|0934905096}} (1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghazali.org/books/penrise-1873.pdf A Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran (1988)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Glossary-Koran-Grammatical-Explanations/dp/161640535X A Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran (1988)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his PhD in philosophy from the [[University of Turin]].

==Philosophy==
Bubbio focuses on [[perspectivism]] (the belief that there is no underlying “true” reality which exists independently of the activity of the cognitive agent) as the fundamental feature of the post-Kantian philosophy. He argues that based on this perspectivism, the religious claims are removed from the realm of [[theoretical reason]] and only have symbolic and regulative meaning. Bubbio believes that the issues regarding the theoretical content of religion do not properly belong to philosophy of religion.

Analyzing Hegel's conception of God, Bubbio thinks that content can be restored to religion, only to the extent that God is understood in God’s relation to human beings, and human beings are understood in their relation to God. Therefore the Hegelian God can be an answer to the challenge of how to conceive the [[mind-world relation]] without setting mind over and against the world and it can be a way of overcoming [[subjectivism]] in both philosophy and religion.

'''Dietrich Bonhoeffer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdiːtʁɪç ˈboːnhœfɐ|lang}}; 4 February 1906&amp;nbsp;– 9 April 1945) was a German pastor, [[Theology|theologian]], anti-[[Nazi]] dissident, and key founding member of the [[Confessing Church]]. His writings on [[Christianity|Christianity's]] role in the secular world have become widely influential, and his book ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' has been described as a modern classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christianity.com/Christian%20Foundations/The%20Essentials/11536759/ |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer Biography |accessdate=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his theological writings, Bonhoeffer was known for his staunch resistance to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi dictatorship]], including vocal opposition to Hitler's [[euthanasia]] program and genocidal persecution of the Jews.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{cite book|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry L.|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Reality And Resistance|year=2005|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-23011-1|edition=|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in April 1943 by the [[Gestapo]] and imprisoned at Tegel prison for one and a half years. Later, he was transferred to a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. After being accused of being associated with the [[July 20 plot]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]], he was quickly tried, along with other accused plotters, including former members of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' (the German Military Intelligence Office), and then executed by hanging on 9 April 1945 as the Nazi regime was collapsing.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood and family ===
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born on 4 February 1906 in Breslau, Germany into a large family. In addition to his other siblings, Dietrich had a twin sister, [[Bonhoeffer family|Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz]]:  he and Sabine were the fifth and sixth children out of seven. His father was [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]] Karl Bonhoeffer, noted for his criticism of [[Sigmund Freud]], and his mother Paula Bonhoeffer, née von Hase, was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian [[Karl Hase|Karl von Hase]] and painter Stanislaus Kalckreuth. His oldest brother [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] became a chemist, and, along with [[Paul Harteck]], discovered the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] in 1929. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during World War I, when the twins were 12. The third Bonhoeffer child, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer|Klaus]], was a lawyer until he was executed for his involvement in the [[20 July plot]].{{sfn | Bonhoeffer | Barnett | Schulz | 2011 | p=581}}{{sfn | Bethge | Barnett | 1999 | p=18,625}}{{sfn | Root | 2014 | p=119}} Both of Bonhoeffer's older sisters, [[Bonhoeffer family|Ursula Bonhoeffer Schleicher and Christel Bonhoeffer von Dohnanyi]], married men who were eventually executed by the Nazis. Christel was imprisoned by the Nazis but survived. Sabine and their youngest sister Susanne Bonhoeffer Dress each married men who survived Nazism. His cousin [[Karl-Günther von Hase]] was the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Bonhoeffer completed his ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', the equivalent of both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the [[University of Tübingen]]. He went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree (Dr. theol.) from [[Berlin University]] in 1927, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]''.

=== Studies in America ===
Still too young to be ordained, at the age of twenty-four Bonhoeffer went to the United States in 1930 for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study and a teaching fellowship at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. Although Bonhoeffer found the American seminary not up to his exacting German standards ("There is no theology here."),&lt;ref name="David Ford p 45"&gt;David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; he had life-changing experiences and friendships. He studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and met Frank Fisher, a black fellow-seminarian who introduced him to [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], where Bonhoeffer taught Sunday school and formed a lifelong love for African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], a collection of which he took back to Germany. He heard [[Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.]], preach the Gospel of Social Justice, and became sensitive to not only social injustices experienced by minorities, but also the ineptitude of the church to bring about integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html |work=PBS|title=Bonhoeffer Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhoeffer began to see things "from below"—from the perspective of those who suffer oppression. He observed, "Here one can truly speak and hear about sin and grace and the love of God...the Black Christ is preached with rapturous passion and vision." Later Bonhoeffer referred to his impressions abroad as the point at which he "turned from phraseology to reality."&lt;ref name="David Ford p 45" /&gt; He also learned to drive an automobile, although he failed the driving test three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Galli, Mark and Barbara | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3202.html |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Did You Know?| journal=Christian History| issue =32| date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R0211-316, Dietrich Bonhoeffer mit Schülern.jpg|thumb|Dietrich Bonhoeffer on a weekend getaway with [[Confirmand#Protestant views|confirmands]] of Zion's Church congregation (1932)&lt;ref&gt;''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsstätte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, pp. 31, 33. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After returning to Germany in 1931, Bonhoeffer became a lecturer in [[systematic theology]] at the University of Berlin. Deeply interested in [[ecumenism]], he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the [[World Council of Churches]]) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone something of a personal conversion from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity to being a dedicated man of faith, resolved to carry out the teaching of Christ as he found it revealed in the Gospels.&lt;ref name="Michael Balfour p216"&gt;Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 1931—at the age of 25—he was ordained at the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|Old-Prussian United]] St. Matthew's Church ({{lang-de|[[:de:St. Matthäuskirche (Berlin-Tiergarten)|St. Matthäuskirche]]}}) in Berlin.

=== Confessing Church ===
Bonhoeffer's promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically altered with the Nazi ascension to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the ''Führer'' (leader), who could very well turn out to be ''Verführer'' (mis-leader, or seducer). He was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', pp. 259–60&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply "bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam the spoke in the wheel itself."&lt;ref&gt;David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1932, two months before the Nazi takeover, there had been an election for [[presbyter]]s and [[synod]]als (church officials) of the German ''Landeskirche'' (Protestant established churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic [[German Christian]] (Deutsche Christen) movement and Young Reformers—a struggle which threatened to explode into [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials.

Despite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming number of key church positions went to Nazi-supported Deutsche Christen people.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Raum, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|Westphalia]], and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Hanover]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|Württemberg]]. The non-Nazi opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted "intact churches," as opposed to the other so-called "destroyed churches."

In opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict upon all pastoral services (baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.), but [[Karl Barth]] and others advised against such a radical proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=June 2007 | contribution-url = http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2007/06/ten-theses-on-dietrich-bonhoeffer.html | title = Faith and Theology | contribution = Ten theses on Dietrich Bonhoeffer | publisher = [[Blogspot]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and [[Hermann Sasse]] were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the [[Bethel Institution|Bethel Confession]],&lt;ref name="Obendiek 1992 57"&gt;Enno Obendiek, „Die Theologische Erklärung von Barmen 1934: Hinführung“, in: ''„… den großen Zwecken des Christenthums gemäß“: Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992; Eine Handreichung für die Gemeinden'', Wilhelm Hüffmeier (compilator) for the Kirchenkanzlei der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;52–58, here p.&amp;nbsp;57. {{ISBN|3-7858-0346-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God's faithfulness to Jews as His chosen people, the Bethel Confession was so watered down to make it more palatable that Bonhoeffer ultimately refused to sign it.&lt;ref&gt;David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1933, the national church synod at [[Wittenberg]] voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the [[Aryan paragraph]] within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of [[baptism]], [[Martin Niemöller]] founded the ''[[Pfarrernotbund]]'' (Pastors' Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the [[Old Testament]] from the Bible, which was seen by many as [[heresy]], further swelling the ranks of the Emergency League.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Ericksen. (2012). Complicity in the Holocaust. [Online]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Available from: Cambridge Books Online {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9781139059602}} [Accessed 15 April 2016]. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Within weeks of its founding, more than a third of German pastors had joined the Emergency League. It was the forerunner of the ''[[Bekennende Kirche]]'' (Confessing Church), which aimed to preserve traditional Christian beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Ericksen. (2012). Complicity in the Holocaust. [Online]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Available from: Cambridge Books Online {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9781139059602}} [Accessed 15 April 2016]. pp. 26, 28, 29, 95&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barmen Declaration]], drafted by Barth in May 1934 and adopted by the Confessing Church, insisted that Christ, not the Führer, was the head of the church.&lt;ref name=ushmm&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/dietrich-bonhoeffer/1933-1940 | publisher = United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | title = Dietrich Bonhoeffer | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160605083356/https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/dietrich-bonhoeffer/1933-1940 | archivedate = 5 June 2016 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of the declaration has often been viewed as a triumph, although by [[:de:Wilhelm Niemöller (Theologe)|Wilhelm Niemöller]]'s estimate, only 20% of German pastors were supporting the Confessing Church.&lt;ref name="LittellLocke1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Franklin Hamlin Littell|author2=Hubert G.

=== Ministries in London ===
When Bonhoeffer was offered a parish post in eastern Berlin in the autumn of 1933, he refused it in protest of the nationalist policy, and accepted a two-year appointment as a pastor of two German-speaking Protestant churches in London: the German Lutheran Church in Dacres Road, [[Sydenham]].&lt;ref name=ushmm /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Open charities | url = http://opencharities.org/charities/290945}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Reformed Church of St Paul's, Goulston Street, [[Whitechapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.stgite.org.uk/media/germanchurches.html | title = German churches | publisher = STGite | place = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dietrich Bonhoeffer Kirche (German Church, Sydeham) |publisher=AIM25: Archives in London and the M25 area| place = UK | url = http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=12592&amp;inst_id=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained to Barth that he had found little support for his views—even among friends—and that "it was about time to go for a while into the desert," Barth regarded this as running away from real battle.  He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, "I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: 'And what of the German Church?'" Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his "splendid theological armory" while "the house of your church is on fire," and chided him to return to Berlin "by the next ship."&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: London 1933–1935'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonhoeffer, however, did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home; he hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niemöller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with the Christian gospel. When Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Heckel|de}}—the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs—traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom,'' ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground seminaries ===
In 1935, Bonhoeffer was presented with a much-sought-after opportunity to study non-violent resistance under [[Gandhi]] in his [[ashram]], but, perhaps remembering Barth's rebuke, decided to return to Germany in order to head an underground seminary in [[Szczecin-Zdroje|Finkenwalde]] for training Confessing Church pastors. As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to Switzerland in 1935; Niemöller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer's authorization to teach at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was revoked after he was denounced as a "[[pacifist]] and enemy of the state" by Theodor Heckel.[[File:Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Skulptur an der Hauptkirche Sankt Petri (Hamburg).JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], Hamburg]]Bonhoeffer's efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds. He found a great benefactor in Ruth von Kleist-Retzow. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer's former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter, Maria von Wedemeyer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/februaryweb-only/33.0a.html|title=Bonhoeffer in Love|author=Wendy Murray Zoba|work=ChristianityToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest. By August 1937, [[Himmler]] decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the Gestapo closed the seminary at Finkenwalde, and by November arrested 27 pastors and former students. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]],'' a study on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which he not only attacked "cheap grace" as a cover for ethical laxity, but also preached "costly grace."

Bonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct "seminary on the run" supervision of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian [[Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania]]. The [[von Blumenthal]] family hosted the seminary on its estate of [[Słonowice, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Groß Schlönwitz]]. The pastors of Groß Schlönwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later edited Bonhoeffer's "Letters and Papers from Prison"), as vicars in their congregations.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51"&gt;''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsstätte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Gestapo banned Bonhoeffer from Berlin. In summer 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate ([[Folwark|Vorwerk]]) of the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Tychowo, Sławno County|Wendish Tychow]]. In March 1940, the Gestapo shut down the seminary there following the outbreak of World War II.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51" /&gt; Bonhoeffer's monastic communal life and teaching at Finkenwalde seminary formed the basis of his books, ''The Cost of Discipleship'' and ''Life Together.''

Bonhoeffer's sister, Sabine, along with her Jewish-classified husband Gerhard Leibholz and their two daughters, escaped to England by way of Switzerland in September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html | publisher = PBS | title = Bonhoeffer | contribution = Timeline}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to the United States ===
In February 1938, Bonhoeffer made an initial contact with members of the [[German Resistance]] when his brother-in-law [[Hans von Dohnányi]] introduced him to a group seeking Hitler's overthrow at [[Abwehr]], the German military intelligence service.

Bonhoeffer also learned from Dohnányi that war was imminent and was particularly troubled by the prospect of being conscripted. As a committed pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and fight in his army, though not to do so was potentially a [[capital offense]]. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most Christians and their churches at the time.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19" /&gt;

It was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Amid much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]: "I have come to the conclusion that I made a mistake in coming to America. I must live through this difficult period in our national history with the people of Germany. I will have no right to participate in the reconstruction of Christian life in Germany after the war if I do not share the trials of this time with my people... Christians in Germany will have to face the terrible alternative of either willing the defeat of their nation in order that [[Christian civilization]] may survive or willing the victory of their nation and thereby destroying civilization. I know which of these alternatives I must choose but I cannot make that choice from security."&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Eine Biographie'', p. 736&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Germany on the last scheduled [[Steamboat|steamer]] to cross the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom'', ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abwehr agent ===
[[File:Bonhoeffer-Haus Studienzimmer.jpg|thumb|Dietrich Bonhoeffer's study]]
Back in Germany, Bonhoeffer was further harassed by the Nazi authorities as he was forbidden to speak in public and was required to regularly report his activities to the police. In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer joined the Abwehr (a German military intelligence organization). Dohnányi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service.&lt;ref name=nyrb /&gt; Bonhoeffer presumably knew about [[Operation Spark (1940)|various 1943 plots]] against Hitler through Dohnányi, who was actively involved in the planning.&lt;ref name=nyrb&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tragedy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohnányi|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/25/tragedy-dietrich-bonhoeffer-and-hans-von-dohnanyi/ | accessdate =12 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=25 October 2012| first1 =Elisabeth | last1 = Sifton| first2=Fritz | last2 = Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of Nazi atrocities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that "the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live."&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' p. 7. N.Y. 1997, Touchstone.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not justify his action but accepted that he was taking guilt upon himself as he wrote, "When a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace."&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said, "The blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness."&lt;ref&gt;Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', 1975, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;)

Under cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the Western Allies in hope of garnering their support, and, through his ecumenical contacts abroad, to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. His visits to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland were camouflaged as legitimate intelligence activities for the Abwehr. In May 1942, he met Anglican [[Bishop George Bell]] of Chichester, a member of the [[House of Lords]] and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer's exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British foreign minister [[Sir Anthony Eden|Anthony Eden]]. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, "George Bell", SCM, 1971, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Dohnányi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time Bonhoeffer worked on ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'' and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended ''Ethics'' as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943, Bonhoeffer and Dohnányi were arrested and imprisoned.

=== Imprisonment ===
On 13 January 1943, Bonhoeffer had become engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=289|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18. The two also spent almost no time alone together prior to the engagement and did not see each other between becoming engaged and Bonhoeffer's 5 April arrest. Once he was in prison, however, Maria's status as fiancée became invaluable, as it meant she could visit Bonhoeffer and correspond with him. While their relationship was troubled,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=380|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was a source of food and smuggled messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Ordinary Men|last=Sifton|first=Elisabeth|publisher=New York Review Book|year=2013|isbn=978-1-59017-681-8|location=New York|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhoeffer made [[Eberhard Bethge]] his heir, but Maria, in allowing her correspondence with Bonhoeffer to be published after her death, provided an invaluable addition to the scholarship.

For a year and a half, Bonhoeffer was imprisoned at [[Tegel]] military prison awaiting trial. There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to [[Eberhard Bethge]] and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in ''Letters and Papers from Prison''. One of those guards, a corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and "disappear" with him, and plans were made for that end. But Bonhoeffer declined it, fearing Nazi retribution against his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Hans von Dohnányi, who were also imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bonhoeffer,  Dietrich &amp; Kelly, Geffrey B. (Editor)|title=A Testament to Freedom|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] on Hitler's life in 1944 and the discovery in September 1944 of secret Abwehr documents relating to the conspiracy, Bonhoeffer was accused of association with the conspirators. He was transferred from the military prison Tegel in Berlin, where he had been held for 18 months, to the detention cellar of the house prison of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Security Head Office]], the Gestapo's high-security prison. In February 1945, he was secretly moved to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], and finally to [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]].

On 4 April 1945, the diaries of [[Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], head of the Abwehr, were discovered, and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that the Abwehr conspirators be destroyed.&lt;ref name=PlottingHitler&gt;{{cite book|year=1994|author=[[Joachim Fest|Fest, Joachim]]|isbn=0-297-81774-4|title=[[Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933–1945]]|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhoeffer was led away just as he concluded his final Sunday service and asked an English prisoner, [[Sigismund Payne Best|Payne Best]], to remember him to Bishop George Bell of Chichester if he should ever reach his home: "This is the end—for me the beginning of life."&lt;ref name="Eberhard Bethge p 927"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bethge, Eberhard |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography|page=927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution ===
[[File:Flossenbürg April 9 1945 Memorial.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Flossenbürg concentration camp, Arrestblock-Hof: Memorial to members of German resistance executed on 9 April 1945]]
Bonhoeffer was condemned to death on 8 April 1945 by SS judge [[Otto Thorbeck]] at a [[drumhead court-martial]] without witnesses, records of proceedings or a defense in [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=GermanResistance&gt;{{cite book|year=1996|author=Peter Hoffman|isbn=0-7735-1531-3|title=The History of the German Resistance, 1933–1945|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was executed there by [[hanging]] at dawn on 9 April 1945, just two weeks before soldiers from the United States [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th]] and [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Infantry Divisions]] liberated the camp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.97thdivision.com/flossenberg4.html|title=Flossenberg|work=97thdivision.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.97thid.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?show&amp;flos&amp;line=Flossenburg+Concentration+Camp&amp;f=97thid/flossenburg&amp;dpt=9&amp;id=12817776922&amp;cr=1 |title=Memories of the chaplain to the US 97th Infantry Division at the online Museum of the division in WWII |date=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215749/http://www.97thid.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?show&amp;flos&amp;line=Flossenburg+Concentration+Camp&amp;f=97thid%2Fflossenburg&amp;dpt=9&amp;id=12817776922&amp;cr=1 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; three weeks before the Soviet capture of Berlin and a month before the surrender of Nazi Germany.

Bonhoeffer was stripped of his clothing and led naked into the execution yard where he was hanged, along with fellow conspirators Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], Canaris's deputy General [[Hans Oster]], military jurist General [[Karl Sack]], General [[Friedrich von Rabenau]],&lt;ref&gt;Wistrich, Robert (1995). Who's Who In Nazi Germany. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-41511-888-0}}. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; businessman [[Theodor Strünck]], and German resistance fighter [[Ludwig Gehre]]. Bonhoeffer's brother, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer]], and his brother-in-law, [[Rüdiger Schleicher]], were executed in Berlin on the night of 22–23 April as Soviet troops were already fighting in the capital. His brother-in-law Hans von Dohnányi had been executed in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] on 8 or 9 April.

[[Eberhard Bethge]], a student and friend of Bonhoeffer's, writes of a man who saw the execution: "I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer... kneeling on the floor praying fervently to God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable man prayed, so devout and so certain that God heard his prayer. At the place of execution, he again said a short prayer and then climbed the few steps to the gallows, brave and composed. His death ensued after a few seconds. In the almost fifty years that I worked as a doctor, I have hardly ever seen a man die so entirely submissive to the will of God."&lt;ref name="Eberhard Bethge p. 927"&gt;Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', p 927&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the traditional account of Bonhoeffer's death, which over the decades went unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Eric Metaxas|isbn=978-1-59555-138-2|title=Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy|publisher=Thomas Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many recent biographers see problems with the story, not due to Bethge but his source. The purported witness was a doctor at Flossenbürg concentration camp, Hermann Fischer-Hüllstrung,&lt;ref&gt;Little seems to be known about this doctor. A secondary work in German says Fischer-Hüllstrung was tried for killing prisoners by a variety of means and acquitted, but retried later and sentenced to three years in prison. This source does not, however, know the date of Fischer-Hüllstrung's death. {{cite book |year=2014 |first=Thomas O.

J. L. F. Mogensen, a former prisoner at Flossenbürg, cited the length of time it took for the execution to be completed (almost six hours), plus departures from camp procedure that would probably not have been allowed to prisoners so late in the war, as jarring inconsistencies. Considering that the sentences had been confirmed at the highest levels of Nazi government, by individuals with a pattern of torturing prisoners who dared to challenge the regime, it is more likely that "the physical details of Bonhoeffer's death may have been much more difficult than we earlier had imagined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|author=Craig J. Slane|isbn=1-58743-074-6|title=Bonhoeffer as Martyr: Social Responsibility and Modern Christian Commitment|publisher=Brazos Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent critics of the traditional account are more caustic. One terms the Fischer-Hüllstrung story as "unfortunately a lie," citing additional factual inconsistencies; for example, the doctor described Bonhoeffer climbing the steps to the noose, but at Flossenbürg the gallows had no steps.  Moreover, it appears that "Fischer-Hüllstrung had the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying."{{sfn|Schlingensiepen|2010|page=406}} Another critic charges that Fischer-Hüllstrung's "subsequent statement about Bonhoeffer as kneeling in wordy prayer . . . belongs to the realm of legend."{{sfn|Kaiser|2014|p=311}}

The dispostion of Bonhoeffer's remains is not known.{{sfn|Marsh|2014|page=390}} His body may have been cremated outside the camp along with hundreds of other recently executed or dead prisoners,{{sfn|Schlingensiepen|2010|page=378}} or American troops may have placed his body in one of several mass graves in which they interred the unburied dead of the camp.{{sfn|Marsh|2014|page=390}}

Bonhoeffer's life as a pastor and theologian of great intellect and spirituality who lived as he preached—and his being killed because of his opposition to Nazism—exerted great influence and inspiration for Christians across broad denominations and ideologies, such as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States, the anti-communist democratic movement in Eastern Europe during the [[Cold War]], and the anti-[[Apartheid]] movement in South Africa.

Bonhoeffer is commemorated in the [[liturgical calendar]]s of several [[Christian denomination]]s on the anniversary of his death, 9 April.

=== Theological legacy ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Breckwoldt-prüfung.JPG|thumb|upright|Sculpture by Edith Breckwoldt, ''The ordeal. No man in the whole world can change the truth. One can only look for the truth, find it and serve it. The truth is in all places. ''  citation by Dietrich Bonhoeffer|alt=]]

Overshadowed by the dramatic events of his life, Bonhoeffer's theology has nevertheless been influential. His theology has a fragmentary, unsystematic nature, due at least in part to his untimely death, and is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation and projection. So, for example, while his [[Christocentric]] approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, his commitment to justice and ideas about "religionless Christianity"&lt;ref&gt;http://intersecting.weebly.com/blog/nones-dones-and-religionless-christianity-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; are emphasized by liberal Protestants.

Central to Bonhoeffer's theology is Christ, in whom God and the world are reconciled. Bonhoeffer's God is a suffering God, whose manifestation is found in this-worldliness. Bonhoeffer believed that the [[Incarnation]] of God in flesh made it unacceptable to speak of God and the world "in terms of two spheres"—an implicit attack upon Luther's [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. Bonhoeffer stressed personal and collective piety and revived the idea of [[imitation of Christ]]. He argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', p. 835&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhoeffer insisted that the church, like the Christians, "had to share in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world" if it were to be a true church of Christ.

In his prison letters, Bonhoeffer raised tantalizing questions about the role of Christianity and the church in a "world come of age," where human beings no longer need a metaphysical God as a stop-gap to human limitations; and mused about the emergence of a "religionless Christianity," where God would be unclouded from metaphysical constructs of the previous 1900 years. Influenced by Barth's distinction between faith and religion, Bonhoeffer had a critical view of the phenomenon of religion and asserted that revelation abolished religion, which he called the "garment" of faith. Having witnessed the complete failure of the German Protestant church as an institution in the face of Nazism, he saw this challenge as an opportunity of renewal for Christianity.

Years after Bonhoeffer's death, some Protestant thinkers developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the "[[Death of God#Death of God theological movement|Death of God]]" movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics—such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and others—have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer's insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretation is more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the [[neo-orthodox]] school to which he belonged.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bonhoeffer also influenced [[Daniel Comboni|Comboni]] missionary Father [[Ezechiele Ramin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Writings ==
English translations of Bonhoeffer's works, most of which were originally written in German, are available. Many of his lectures and books were translated into English over the years and are available from multiple publishers. These works are listed following the Fortress Press edition of Bonhoeffer's writings. The English language edition of Bonhoeffer's Works contains, in many cases, more material than the German Works series because of the discovery of hitherto unknown correspondence.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

All sixteen volumes of the English Bonhoeffer Works Edition of Bonhoeffer's Oeuvre had been published by October 2013. A volume of selected readings entitled ''The Dietrich Bonhoeffer Reader'' which presents a chronological view of Bonhoeffer's theological development became available by 1 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Bonhoeffer reader |url=http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18463/The-Bonhoeffer-Reader |publisher=Fortress Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403193810/http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18463/The-Bonhoeffer-Reader |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonhoeffer's dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as ''Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche''. In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and [[collective guilt]], it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.

Hardcover, 256 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8302-3}}. Bonhoeffer's second dissertation, written in 1929–1930 and published in 1931 as ''Akt und Sein'', deals with the consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the Reformation's insight into the origin sinfulness in the "heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor." Bonhoeffer's thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology are explained.
* ''Creation and Fall. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 3''.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer; John W. De Gruchy, Editor Translated by Douglas Stephen Bax. In 1932, Bonhoeffer called on his students at the University of Berlin to focus their attention on the word of God, the word of truth, in a time of turmoil.

* ''Discipleship. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 4''.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer; John D. Dodsey and Geffrey B. Kelly, Editors. Originally published in 1937, this book (generally known in English by the title ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'') soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. Hardcover, 384 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8304-7}}.  Paper, 354 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8324-5}}.

Hardcover, 242 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8305-4}}. Paper, 232 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8325-2}}. ''Life Together'' is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer's meditation on the nature of Christian community. ''Prayerbook of the Bible'' is a classic meditation on the importance of the Psalms for ''Christian prayer''. In this theological interpretation of the Psalms, Bonhoeffer describes the moods of an individual's relationship with God and also the turns of love and heartbreak, of joy and sorrow, that are themselves the Christian community's path to God.
* ''Ethics. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 6''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Clifford Green, Editor; Translated by Reinhard Krauss, Douglas W. Stott, and Charles C. West.  The crown jewel of Bonhoeffer's body of work, Ethics is the culmination of his theological and personal odyssey. Hardcover, 544 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8306-1}}. Paperback, 605 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8326-9}}.
* ''Fiction from Tegel Prison. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 7''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Clifford Green, Editor Translated by Nancy Lukens. Hardcover, 288 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8307-8}}. Writing fiction—an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story—occupied much of Bonhoeffer's first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fiancée and dealing with his interrogation. "There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it," he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer's family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer's participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.
* ''Letters and Papers from Prison. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 8''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; John W. de Gruchy, Editor; Translated by Isabel Best; Lisa E. Dahill; Reinhard Krauss; Nancy Lukens.

Here are over 200 documents that include extensive correspondence with his family and Eberhard Bethge (much of it in English for the first time), as well as his theological notes, and his prison poems. The volume offers an illuminating introduction by editor John de Gruchy and an historical Afterword by the editors of the original German volume: Christian Gremmels, Eberhard Bethge, and Renate Bethge. Hardcover, 800 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-9703-7}}.
* ''The Young Bonhoeffer, 1918–1927. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 9''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Paul Duane Metheny, Editor.  Gathers Bonhoeffer's 100 earliest letters and journals from after the First World War through his graduation from Berlin University. Hardcover, 720 pp: {{ISBN|978-0-8006-8309-2}}.

The seventeen essays include works on the patristic period for [[Adolf von Harnack]], on Luther's moods for Karl Holl, on biblical interpretation for Professor Reinhold Seeberg, as well as essays on the church and eschatology, reason and revelation, Job, John, and even joy. Rounding out this picture of Bonhoeffer's nascent theology are his sermons from the period, along with his lectures on homiletics, [[catechesis]], and practical theology.
* ''Barcelona, Berlin, New York: 1928–1931. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 10''. Dietrich Bonhoeffer; Clifford Green, Editor.

The publishers description of the volume is thus: "''In the spring of 1935 Dietrich Bonhoeffer returned from England to direct a small illegal seminary for the Confessing Church.  The seminary existed for two years before the Gestapo ordered it closed in August 1937. The two years of Finkenwalde's existence produced some of Bonhoeffer's most significant theological work as he prepared these young seminarians for the turbulence and risk of parish ministry in the Confessing Church. Bonhoeffer and his seminarians were under Gestapo surveillance; some of them were arrested and imprisoned. Throughout, he remained dedicated to training them for the ministry and its challenges in a difficult time. This volume includes bible studies, sermons, and lectures on homiletics, pastoral care, and catechesis, giving a moving and up-close portrait of the Confessing Church in these crucial years—the same period during which Bonhoeffer wrote his classics, Discipleship and Life Together.''"&lt;ref name="store.fortresspress.com"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18486/Theological-Education-at-Finkenwalde-1935-1937-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Volume-14 |title=Theological Education at Finkenwalde: 1935–1937 |first=Dietrich |last=Bonhoeffer |series=Works |volume=14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404114641/http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18486/Theological-Education-at-Finkenwalde-1935-1937-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Works-Volume-14 |archivedate=4 April 2014 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [https://www.logos.com/product/152651/dietrich-bonhoeffer-works-german-english Fortress Press and Gütersloher editions ]

=== Various works in the Bonhoeffer corpus individually published in English ===

* ''The Bonhoeffer Reader'', edited by Clifford Green and Michael DeJonge. Fortress Press, 2013. {{ISBN|0-80069945-9}}. A representative collection of all Bonhoeffer's theological works in a single volume.
* ''Christology'' (1966) London: William Collins and New York: Harper and Row. Translation of lectures given in Berlin in 1933, from vol. 3 of ''Gesammelte Schriften'', Christian Kaiser Verlag, 1960. retitled as ''Christ the Center'', Harper San Francisco 1978 paperback: {{ISBN|0-06-060811-0}}
* ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' (1948 in English). Touchstone edition with introduction by [[Bishop George Bell]] and memoir by G. Leibholz, 1995 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-81500-1}}. Critical edition published under its original title ''Discipleship'': John D. Godsey (editor); Geffrey B. Kelly (editor). Fortress Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8006-8324-2}}. Bonhoeffer's most widely read book begins, "Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace." That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church. First published in 1937 as ''Nachfolge'' (Discipleship), it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: what Jesus demanded of his followers—and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.
* ''Life Together''. The stimulus for the writing of ''[[Life Together]]'' was the closing of the preachers' seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer's thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the "Brother's House" there. ''Life Together'' was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as ''Gemeinsames Leben'', and first translated into English in 1954. Harper San Francisco 1978 paperback: {{ISBN|0-06-060852-8}}
* ''Ethics'' (1955 in English by SCM Press). Touchstone edition, 1995 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}. This is the culmination of Bonhoeffer's theological and personal odyssey, even though the book was not completed and was not the ''Ethics'' which Bonhoeffer intended to have published. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.
* ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' (Edited originally by Eberhard Bethge; first English translation 1953 by SCM Press). This edition translated by [[Reginald H. Fuller]] and Frank Clark from ''Widerstand und Ergebung: Briefe und Aufzeichnungen aus der Haft''. Munich: Christian Kaiser Verlag (1970). Touchstone 1997 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-83827-3}}. In hundreds of letters, including letters written to his fiancée, Maria von Wedemeyer (selected from the complete correspondence, previously published as ''Love Letters from Cell 92'' Ruth-Alice von Bismarck and Ulrich Kabitz (editors), Abingdon Press (April 1995) {{ISBN|0-687-01098-5}}), as well as official documents, short original pieces, and a few final sermons, the volume sheds light on Bonhoeffer's active resistance to and increasing involvement in the conspiracy against the Hitler regime; his arrest; and his long imprisonment. Finally, Bonhoeffer's many exchanges with his family, fiancée, and closest friends, demonstrate the affection and solidarity that accompanied Bonhoeffer to his prison cell, concentration camp, and eventual death.
* ''A Testament to Freedom: The Essential Writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer'' (1990).  Geffrey B. Kelly and F. Burton Nelson, editors. Harper San Francisco 1995 2nd edition, paperback: {{ISBN|0-06-064214-9}}
* "[[Von guten Mächten]]": "By Gracious Powers," a prayer he wrote shortly before his death. Various English translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Citizen Leauki | contribution = The Power of Prayer | publisher = Joe user | contribution-url = http://citizenleauki.joeuser.com/article/337894/The_Power_of_Prayer}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Songs of hope &amp; trust | contribution = Confidence | publisher = Practica poetica | contribution-url = http://www.practicapoetica.com/adventist-poetry-and-hymns/songs-of-hope-and-trust/general-hymns/confidence}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disability etiquette''' is a set of guidelines dealing specifically with how to approach a person with a disability.

There is no consensus on when this phrase first came into use, although it most likely grew out of the [[Disability rights movement|Disability Rights Movement]] that began in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The concept may have started as a cynical play on existing rule sheets, written for audiences without a disability, that were seen as patronizing by civil rights activists.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Guidelines==
Most disability [[etiquette]] guidelines seem to be predicated on a simple dictate: "Do not assume&amp;nbsp;..." They are written to address real and perceived shortcomings in how society as a whole treats disabled people.

These guidelines can be broken down into the several broad categories.

"'''Do not assume ...'''":
* "... a person with a disability either wants or requires assistance."
* "... rejection of aid is meant as a personal affront."
* "... upon acceptance of your help, that you know, without being told, what service to perform."
* "... a person who appears to have one kind of disability also has others."
* "... a disabled person is dissatisfied with his/her quality of life, and is thus seeking pity."
* "... a person with a disability is easily offended."
* "... that a person who does not appear disabled, or who uses assistive devices intermittently instead of all of the time, is faking or imagining their disability." (''see [[invisible disability]]'')
* "... companions accompanying a person with a disability are there strictly to render service."
* "... a person with a disability will be receptive to personal questions, particularly in a public setting."
* "... that when a person with a disability is in a public place, that they are being escorted by a caretaker, instead of traveling alone."

Each category encompasses specific "rules." For example, the last two of these would include guidelines such as:
* "Ask questions of the person with a disability, and not of his/her companions."
* "Hand grocery or other receipts to the individual who is paying the bill."
* "Only ask questions about the person's disability if you know that person."

People writing on specific disabilities have given rise to their own unique guidelines. Wheelchair users may, for example, include the rule, "do not grab the push handles of a person's wheelchair without permission." Visually impaired people often list a request to, "identify yourself when you enter a room."

==Language==
Like many other minority groups, disabled people do not always agree on what constitutes [[politically correct]] language. However, see the [[List of disability-related terms with negative connotations]] and [[people-first language]].

The '''Eritrean People's Liberation Front''' (EPLF) ({{lang-ti|ህዝባዊ ግንባር, ህግ}}, {{lang-ar|الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير إريتريا}}) was an armed organization that fought for the independence of [[Eritrea]] from [[Ethiopia]]. It emerged in 1970 as an intellectual [[left-wing]] group that split from the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF). After achieving Eritrean independence in 1991, it transformed into the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ), which serves as Eritrea's only legal political organisation.

==Background==
The EPLF was an egalitarian movement in which 30% of the fighters were women. The women fighters' influence in the patriarchal and quite conservative Eritrean society was significant.

EPLF and [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] first struggled during the [[Eritrean Civil War]]. In the early 1980s, new armed conflicts between the rival [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] led to the front being marginalized and pushed into neighboring [[Sudan]]. The EPLF remained the only relevant opposition to Ethiopian occupation in [[Eritrea]].

The EPLF captured many Ethiopian soldiers during the war for independence and kept them in numerous [[prisoner of war]] camps, although captured soldiers of the EPLF (of their own) were not afforded the same treatment. Due to the humanitarian ethic of the EPLF however, these POWs were not harmed by their captors, but instead were even educated about the principles of the EPLF, as well as global politics. Some segments of the EPLF went as far as teaching prisoners of war some trades and skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=Michael|author2=Johnson, Trisha|journal=African Affairs|title=Eritrea: The National Question and the Logic of Protracted Struggle |volume=80|date=April 1981|issue=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its protracted struggle the EPLF constructed an underground [[hospital]]. In these hospitals surgeries were conducted as well as the production of various pharmaceuticals (the first of its kind made by [[Eritreans]]). The front also constructed schools in the liberated areas, as well as underground and partially outdoor schools for the children of the EPLF (i.e. Winna). 
In 1988, the EPLF started an attack from the northern province of [[Sahel]] towards the south. The EPLF emerged as the dominant rebel force as early as 1977 and continued the struggle of the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]. In 1991 the EPLF succeeded in liberating [[Eritrea]] on May 24, 1991.

The First Congress of the EPLF occurred in January 1977 and formally set out the policies of this new organization. At this first meeting a Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General were elected and a program adopted. This program specifically targeted a liberalization of women's rights as well as a broad educational policy for maintaining every language and improving literacy. It was also set out that the boundaries of a liberated Eritrean state would be based on the colonial treaties of Italy.

The Second Congress in 1987 brought together the EPLF and the Eritrean Liberation Front/Central Leadership (also sometimes referred to as Central Command, CC) in what was called the ''Unity Congress''.&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Doris | first =Burgess |author2=Cliffe, Lionel | title =EPLF Second Congress | journal =Review of African Political Economy | volume =14 | issue =38 | pages =107 | date = Spring 1987 |url= http://www.roape.org/cgi-bin/roape/show/3815.html |accessdate=2007-09-07 | doi =10.1080/03056248708703724}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the culmination of negotiations over three years which had brought together the two fighting forces in October 1986 under a unified command.&lt;ref name="second" /&gt; On this congress, [[Isaias Afewerki]] replaced secretary-general Ramadan Nur.

The Third and last Congress of the EPLF was held in 1994 in [[Asmara]]. It was important as it converted the Front from a military organization to a purely political movement. At this Congress, the name of the organization was changed to the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ).

'''Frances Wright''' (September 6, 1795&amp;nbsp;– December 13, 1852) also widely known as '''Fanny Wright''', was a Scottish-born lecturer, writer, [[Freethought|freethinker]], [[feminist]], [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and [[social reform]]er, who became a [[US citizen]] in 1825. The same year, she founded the [[Nashoba Commune]] in [[Tennessee]], as a [[utopian]] community to prepare [[slaves]] for [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], but it lasted only five years. Her ''Views of Society and Manners in America'' (1821) brought her to public attention as a critic of the new nation.

==Early life and education==
She was one of three children born in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], to Camilla Campbell and James Wright, a wealthy [[linen]] manufacturer and political radical. Her father designed Dundee trade tokens, knew [[Adam Smith]] and corresponded with French republicans, including [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]]. Both parents died young, but Fanny (as she was called as a child), orphaned at the age of three, was left a substantial inheritance. Her maternal aunt became her guardian and took Fanny to her home in England. Her guardian taught her ideas founded on the philosophy of the [[French materialism|French materialists]].&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

At 16, she returned to Scotland, where she lived with her great-uncle, [[James Mylne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/frances-wright Frances Wright biography], www.monticello.org, Confirmed October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and spent her winters in study and writing and her summers visiting the [[Scottish Highlands]]. By 18, she had written her first book.

==United States==
[[File:Frances Wright 1835.jpg|thumb|1835 portrait of Wright]] 
Wright traveled to the US in 1818. At 23, with her younger sister, she toured the country for two years before she returned to Scotland. She believed in both universal equality in education and [[feminism]]. She attacked [[organized religion]], greed, marriage, and capitalism. Along with [[Robert Owen]], Wright demanded that the government offer free [[boarding school]]s. She was a fighter for the [[emancipation]] of [[slaves]] and for [[birth control]] and [[sexual freedom]] for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schlereth, Eric R. (2007). "Fits of Political Religion: Stalking Infidelity and the Politics of Moral Reform in Antebellum America," ''Early American Studies'' '''5''' (2), pp. 288–323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Lori D. (1994). "'The Hearts of Your Readers will Shudder': Fanny Wright, Infidelity, and American Freethought," ''American Quarterly'' '''46''' (2), pp. 195–226.&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted free public education for all children over two years old, in state-supported boarding schools.&lt;ref&gt;"It is not without design that I have mentioned the name of Frances Wright, the favorite pupil of [[Jeremy Bentham]], and famous infidel lecturer through our country, some twenty years ago; for I happen to know, what may not be known to you all, that she and her friends were the great movers in the scheme of godless education, now the fashion in our country. I knew this remarkable woman well, and it was my shame to share, for a time, many of her views, for which I ask pardon of God and of my countrymen. I was for a brief time in her confidence, and one of those selected to carry into execution her plans. The great object was to get rid of Christianity, and to convert our Churches into Halls of science. The plan was not to make open attacks on religion, although we might belabor the clergy and bring them into contempt where we could; but to establish a system of state, we said, ''national'' schools, from which all religion was to be excluded, in which nothing was to be taught but such knowledge as is verifiable by the senses, and to which all parents were to be compelled by law to send their children. Our complete plan was to take the children from their parents at the age of twelve or eighteen months, and to have them nursed, fed, clothed and trained in these schools at the public expense; but at any rate, we were to have godless schools for all the children of the country, to which the parents would be compelled by law to send them." — [[Orestes Brownson|Brownson, Orestes]] (1853).

It was translated into several languages and widely read in Great Britain, the United States and Europe.

In 1824–1825, Wright again visited the United States, accompanying the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] during much of his [[visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|famous tour of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/frances-wright ''Frances Wright''.] Monticello.org&lt;/ref&gt; As Lafayette headed South in February, Wright headed west towards Robert Owen and the utopian community he had established at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. They met up again in New Orleans in April 1825 and traveled north along the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Keating, John M. (1888).

Mason &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1825, Wright returned to Memphis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peace.maripo.com/m_frances_wright.htm|title=Frances Wright [1795-1852]|author=|date=|website=peace.maripo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founded the [[Nashoba Commune]], near [[Memphis, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Parks, E.W.

To demonstrate how slaves could be emancipated without their owners losing money, Wright set out to construct a model farm community where slaves could work to earn their own freedom, while being provided with education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Frances Wright|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frances-Wright|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nashoba was partially based on Owen's [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] controversial settlement, where Wright spent a significant amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;Bederman, Gail (2005). "Revisiting Nashoba: Slavery, Utopia, and Frances Wright in America, 1818-1826," ''American Literary History'' '''17''' (3), pp. 438–459.&lt;/ref&gt; Nashoba was plagued with difficulties from the start; it was built on mosquitos-infested land and therefore was conducive to malaria, and it failed to produce good crop harvests. Wright had to leave the property because of illness, and while she was away the interim managers of Nashoba began instituting a policy of harsher punishments toward the black workers, and a scandal regarding "free love" and an interracial relationship between a white overseer and an African American slave broke out. By Wright's return in 1828, the community had collapsed financially. In 1830, Wright gave up, chartering a ship to take the Commune's thirty slaves to the black republic of [[Haiti]], which had achieved independence in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John (2009).

[[Image:Franceswright.jpg|thumb|Frances Wright, c. 1825.]]
Wright's opposition to slavery contrasted with the views of many other [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] of the era, especially those of the South. At the same time, her activism on behalf of workingmen distanced her from the leading abolitionists of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, Eric (1993). ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class''. Oxford University Press, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 to 1836, her lectures upon slavery and other social institutions attracted large and enthusiastic audiences/and led to the establishment of what were called "Fanny Wright" societies. Her visits were subsequently extended to the principal cities of the United States, but the enunciation of views similar to those contained in her ''Few Days in Athens'' met with very decided opposition.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

==Later life==
in 1831, in Paris, Wright married a French physician, [[Guillaume D'Arusmont]], with whom she had a daughter, Frances Sylva D'Arusmont in 1832. A second child died in infancy.  Sylva married William Eugene Guthry, whose name really was Eugène Picault&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2279556/f3.item.r=phiquepal%20d'arusmont.zoom Trial] on gallica BnF&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As an activist in the American [[Popular Health Movement]] between 1830 and 1840, Wright advocated for [[women in medicine|women being involved in health and medicine]]. In 1836, she published her last book, ''Course of Popular Lectures''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the mid-term political campaign of 1838, Wright suffered from a variety of health problems. She spent her last years in retirement at the residence of her daughter.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Wright, Fanny|year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1852 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], from complications resulting from a fall on an icy staircase. She is buried at the [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23549227 Find A Grave] Retrieved October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Views of Society and Manners in America''==
''Views of Society and Manners in America'' was one of Wright's first well-circulated and controversial pieces. She wrote it following her 1818 trip to the United States, her first trip to North America. In ''Views of Society and Manners'', she pondered the treatment of slaves and discussed her time as a foreigner.

Wright began the letter with a greeting and acknowledges her foreign status. She admitted having unique outlooks because of her position as an outlander. Indeed, her propositions were striking. She claimed that the Constitution was made for the benefit of its creators but admired the American people. She described their calmness, rationality, and general civility. She claimed that they seldom called names but dealt with issues in an organized manner. She stressed the importance of the newspaper to foreigners, touting it as a roadmap to navigate the new land.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Wright also discussed [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. She praised them and noted that every household possessed copies of one or both of their works. She expressed general positivity toward Americans. She also praised their love for their Founding Fathers. She respected their work ethic and sociability. She noticed their participation in government elections, as well as the newspaper's rigorous attempts to report everything about the ongoing elections. She also discussed women's rights and suggested how women should attain knowledge and be treated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

She also wrote about other travelers' differing views on American religion. She said one might think that America did not have a religion and someone else might say that the American religion was too stern and dogmatic. She clearly stated that she did not long for the American religion. She expressed that her goal was to analyze the religion, not to conform to it. Based on her time in America, she proposed that there were many different denominations of religion. She referred to them as fraternities. She was very open-minded during her travels to America. She withheld judgment and recorded the various things that stood out to her.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Wright also expressed a strong desire to aid marginalized people. In ''Views of Society and Manners'', she examined the American society in terms of the manners of the wealthy and the poorer classes alike. She spoke out against slavery. She was an advocate for citizen health in the South and for assisting the less fortunate. She realized that differences between the majority and minority were made not only on the country but in the small communities as well. She was aware that blacks were uneducated and insisted that education was the way to equality.

'''Gianluca Bocchi''' (19 December 1954) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]].

== Life ==

Gianluca Bocchi studied Philosophy at the [[University of Milan]] where he graduated in [[Philosophy of Science]] in 1978, discussing a dissertation entitled "Conditions and rules in the context of contemporary scientific epistemology" (supervisors: [[Ludwig Geymonat]] and [[Giulio Giorello]]).
From 1983 to 1988, he taught Philosophy and worked as researcher at the [[Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences]] of the [[University of Geneva]], carrying on his research within the scientific team coordinated by [[Alberto Munari]], one of the main exponents of the Piagetian school of genetic epistemology; and has worked extensively with [[Edgar Morin]] in [[Paris]] on the themes of complexity and complex thinking.

== Works ==
Apart from its academic research and teaching engagements at the University, he has also been working as author, lecturer, scientific consultant and trainer. He has been working as project manager and scientific trainer within a number of training projects promoted by leading Italian companies (such as [[Omnitel]], [[ISVOR-FIAT]], [[Telespazio]], [[RAI]], [[Unilever]], [[ENEL]], [[Eni|ENI]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Unicredit]], [[Banca Intesa]], [[Banca Mediolanum]], [[Publitalia]], etc.) as well as within training courses for teachers, psychotherapists, and managers of "human systems". 
He has been giving a number of lecturers and seminars in various post-graduate Master courses, and he has especially been working with the TSM-Trento School of Management. He lectured and lectures extensively for managerial audiences on the political and cultural international landscapes in the age of globalization; on human evolution; on scientific and philosophical themes of [[complexity]] and change (how the understanding of patterns of change in natural and human history can help us in facing the ubiquitous challenge of change in human organizations).

He has been guiding a number of "study tours", especially to [[Berlin]] and the United States, devoted to managers and students and mainly concerning the topic of innovation and identity. 
In particular, he is currently organizing 'study tours' (Berlin, [[Istanbu]]l, [[Prague]], [[Lisbon]]) on behalf of the section devoted to Training and Work of the Italian [[Province of Trento]] (Formazione e Lavoro della Provincia di Trento) and on behalf of a Federation of banks of the Italian Region "Trentino" (Federazione delle Casse Rurali del Trentino). 
In 2009 and 2010, different groups of students from the University of Bergamo attended "study tours" to Berlin and Stockholm.

Gianluca Bocchi is currently Full Professor at [[Bergamo University]], Italy, Department of Human and Social Sciences, where he teaches [[Philosophy of Sciences]], [[Global History]] and [[Global Sciences]]. His courses address epistemological issues concerning life sciences, history and the main controversies within the tradition of evolutionary studies, the current major developments within the sciences of complex systems, the philosophical question of identity, the relationship between natural sciences and human sciences, the epistemological refection regarding both history and geography. 
He is currently also Director of the Centre for Research on Complexity ([http://www.cercounibg.it CE.R.CO]) at the University of Bergamo, which research activities are devoted to theories, researches and practices concerning complex systems in human, social and natural sciences. He is also scientific responsible for University of Bergamo of the EU 7FP project  "Bordering, Political Landscapes and Social Arenas: Potentials and Challenges of Evolving Border Concepts in a Post-Cold War World" (acronym EUBORDERSCAPES, 2012/2016).

Apart from his role of Professor at the University of Bergamo, Gianluca Bocchi is also teaching Global History and supervising PhD students and PostDoc fellows within the PhD Programme in Anthropology and Epistemology of Complexity. From 2002 to 2006, he was also the Scientific Coordinator of the PhD Programme in Anthropology and Epistemology of Complexity.
Gianluca Bocchi introduced, indeed, complexity studies in Italy with the volume La sfida della complessità (with [[Mauro Ceruti]], Feltrinelli, 1985) that focuses on the changing paradigms of sciences in the present times as well as the number of modes human beings adopt to inhabit the globe. 
With Mauro Ceruti and [[Edgar Morin]], he is author of the book ''L’Europa nell’era planetaria'' (Sperling &amp; Kupfer, 1991), where the authors reflect on the complex issue of the co-habitation of different people and nations in the [[Europe]] of the 90s and on the main trends of the world history at the beginning of the new millennium. 
In 1993 he published ''Origini di storie'' (with Mauro Ceruti, Feltrinelli), in which the authors attempt to investigate the complex relations between science, history and myth, by focusing in particular on images of biological evolutions as well as on the evolutions of natural and human history within contemporary sciences. 
With Mauro Ceruti, he also published ''Solidarietà o barbarie''. ''L’Europa delle diversità contro la pulizia etnica'' (Raffaello Cortina, 1994) that wants to be a sort of manual for citizens of the new Europe, as writes Edgar Morin in the preface to the book, by proposing a critical analysis of the historical roots of the [[Western culture|European civilization]] and of European nations in the light of the major events of the present times, that are so ambivalent being at the same time full of constructive and deconstructive potential. 
In 2001, he edited with Mauro Ceruti the volume ''Le radici prime dell’Europa'' (Bruno Mondadori), an interdisciplinary collection of the most important reflections (mostly genetic, linguistic and archaeological) that allow us to re-construct the long-term European history making reference, in particular, to migration routes (of people and cultures) that took place through the continent. In the volume, special attention is also devoted to the issue of ethnic identities in Europe both in the past and in the present. Another interesting book on the origins of western civilization and the world history is ''Origini della scrittura. Genealogie di un’invenzione'' (with Mauro Ceruti, [[Raffaello Cortina]], 2002). 
In 2004, he wrote the book ''Educazione e Globalizzazione'' (with Mauro Ceruti, [[Raffaello Cortina]]), where the authors propose a way to reform the national educational system by taking into account the major changes that have been occurring in both the international geo-political and geo-economical scenarios as well as in the forms and contents of our knowledge instruments for interpreting them. 
In 2009, he published the book ''Una e molteplice. Ripensare l’Europa'' (with Mauro Ceruti, Raffaello Cortina), an attempt to consider both the critical aspects of and the future opportunities inscribed in the present European continent's history as well as in the most recent development of the [[European Union]], 20 years after the Berlin Wall fall in 1989. 
In 2013, he published the book ''Le vie della formazione. Creatività, innovazione, complessità'' (with Francesco Varanini, Guerini).

One of the main foci of Gianluca Bocchi's current scientific research is devoted to the epistemological questions arising for biological and evolutionary sciences, in an age where there is a proliferation of empirical and sometimes very surprising results concerning our knowledge of living systems: they do need a new philosophical frame to make them relevant for our enquiry concerning man, nature and society. Other main current fields of enquiry in Gianluca Bocchi's interrogation are: global history and human evolution; paradigmatic changes in the way of seeing and imagining the world by contemporary sciences; interactions, clashes and hybridizations of cultures; cultural stratifications, urban boundaries and planning strategies in contemporary European cities; social trends and istitutional responses in political European systems;  origins and developments of national and ethnical identities; politics and governance of globalization; relationship between emerging technologies and human identities; the elaboration of a new philosophical view of change connecting models developed in natural and human sciences; philosophical implications of the rapid growing "sciences of the artificial" (synthetic biology plus robotics).

Gianluca Bocchi participated and organized a number of international interdisciplinary conferences both as coordinator and member of the scientific committee and he translated and edited the Italian edition of many books on epistemology, philosophy of science, evolutionary studies and complexity theories ([[Ilya Prigogine]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[Niles Eldredge]], [[Ervin Laszlo]]).

He was amongst the founders and the Editorial Board's members of interdisciplinary scientific journals dealing with scientific and philosophical issues: La Casa di Dedalo, Oikos, and Pluriverso. Biblioteca di idee per una civiltà planetaria.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Francis Layton (died 23 August 1661, aged 84) of [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon, West Riding of Yorkshire]]. His father was one of the masters of the jewel-house to Charles I and Charles II. In accordance with his father's will, Layton built the chapel at Rawdon, a chapelry in the parish of [[Guiseley]]. He died at Rawdon on 18 October 1705, aged 83. By his wife Elizabeth (died 1702, aged 55), daughter of Sir Nicholas Yarborough, he left no issue.

==Works==

Layton is remembered for his anonymous authorship of a series of pamphlets, printed between 1692 and 1704, on the question of the [[immortality of the soul]], a doctrine which he rejected. He started writing on the topic in 1691 with short treatise of fifteen sheets, which was circulated in manuscript. A year's correspondence with a nearby minister ended in his being referred to [[Richard Bentley]]'s second [[Boyle Lecture]] (4 April 1692). To this lecture Layton replied in his first published pamphlet. Bentley took no notice of it, but it was criticised five years later by a presbyterian divine, [[Timothy Manlove]] of [[Leeds]]. Another minister referred Layton to the ''Pneumatologia'' (1671) of [[John Flavel]]. Layton's original work had now grown to fifty pages. Ultimately he printed it at his own expense as ''A Search after Souls''.

By 1697 he had impaired eyesight; Manlove's criticism, published in that year, was read to him by his amanuensis, Timothy Jackson, and he issued a reply. His pamphlets continued till the year before his death, restating his position that soul is a function of body, a view which he defends on physiological grounds, and harmonises with scripture. His authorship was little known. [[Caleb Fleming]], who replied to his ''Search'' in 1758, thought it was the work of [[William Coward]]. Besides his printed tracts, Layton left theological manuscripts; his [[literary executor]] was his nephew, William Smith, rector of [[Melsonby]], North Riding of Yorkshire.

Layton published the following, all anonymous:

*''Observations upon a Sermon intituled, "A Confutation of Atheism,"'' [1692?], pp.&amp;nbsp;19.
* ''A Search after Souls and Spiritual Operations in Man'', [1693?] pp.&amp;nbsp;278.
* ''A Second Part of … A Search after Souls'', [1694?], pp.&amp;nbsp;188 (consists in part of replies to letters of "a minister, eminent as scholar and teacher", who on 21 November 1693 advised him not to publish).
* ''Observations upon a Short Treatise … by … Timothy Manlove, intituled, "The Immortality of the Soul,"'' [1697?], pp.&amp;nbsp;128.
* ''Observations upon Mr. Wadsworth's book of the Soul's Immortality'', [1699?], pp.&amp;nbsp;215; deals with [[Thomas Wadsworth]]'s ''Ἀντιψυχοθανασία'', 1670; from p.&amp;nbsp;201 with ''The Immortality of the Humane Soul'', 1659, by [[Walter Charleton]].
*''An Argument concerning the Humane Souls {{sic|Sepe|rate}} Subsistance'', [1699?], pp.&amp;nbsp;16 (Abbot).
*''Arguments and Replies in a Dispute concerning the Nature of the Humane Soul'', &amp;c., London, 1703, pp.&amp;nbsp;112 (no publisher; deals with letters, dated 15 August and 14 September 1702; [[Francis Blackburne (priest)|Francis Blackburne]], in ''Hist. View'', p.&amp;nbsp;305, identifies the writer with [[Henry Dodwell]] the elder; the tract is evidently meant as the first of the following series).
*''Observations upon … "A Vindication of the Separate Existence of the Soul. …" By Mr. John Turner, lecturer of Christ Church, London'', &amp;c. [1703?], pp.&amp;nbsp;55 (Turner had written in 1702 against Coward).
* ''Observations upon Dr. Nicholl's … "Conference with a Theist,"'' &amp;c. [1703?], pp.&amp;nbsp;124 (against [[William Nicholls]]).
* ''Observations upon … "Vindiciæ Mentis," … 1702'', &amp;c. [1703?], pp.&amp;nbsp;88.
* ''Observations upon … "Psychologia" … by John Broughton, M.A. … 1703'', [1703?], pp.&amp;nbsp;132.
* ''Observations upon … Broughton's Psychologia, Part Second'', &amp;c. [1703?], pp.&amp;nbsp;52. 
* ''Observations upon … A Discourse … By Dr. Sherlock … 1704'', &amp;c. [1704?], pp.&amp;nbsp;115 ([[William Sherlock]]).

Almost all were collected (not reprinted) 1706, 2 vols., as ''A Search after Souls … By a Lover of Truth''. Most of the copies were suppressed by Layton's executors, a few being deposited in public libraries and given to private friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6227">'''Hospitium''' ({{lang-gr|ξενία}}, ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', προξενία) is the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] concept of [[Hospitality|hospitality]] as a divine right of the guest and a divine duty of the host. Similar or broadly equivalent customs were and are also known in other cultures, though not always by that name. Among the Greeks and Romans, hospitium was of a twofold character: private and public.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hospitium |volume=13 |page=801 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private==
In [[Homer]]ic times, all strangers, without exception, were regarded as being under the protection of [[Zeus#Roles and epithets|Zeus Xenios]], the god of strangers and suppliants, and had the ''right to hospitality''. (It is doubtful whether, as is commonly assumed,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} they were considered as [[ipso facto]] enemies; they were rather guests.) Immediately on his arrival, the stranger was clothed and entertained, and no inquiry was made as to his name or [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedents]] until the duties of hospitality had been fulfilled. When the guest parted from his host he was often presented with gifts (ξένια), and sometimes a die (ἀστράγαλος) was broken between them. Each then took a part, a family connection was established, and the broken die served as a symbol of recognition; thus the members of each family found in the other hosts and protectors in case of need.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Violation by the host of the ''duties of hospitality'' was likely to provoke the wrath of the gods; but it does not appear that anything beyond this religious sanction existed to guard the rights of a traveler. Similar customs seem to have existed among the Italian peoples.{{Tone-inline|date=January 2012}} Amongst the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], private hospitality, which had existed from the earliest times, was more accurately and legally defined than amongst the Greeks, the tie between host and guest being almost as strong as that between patron and client. It was of the nature of a contract, entered into by mutual promise, the clasping of hands, and exchange of an agreement in writing (''tabula hospitalis'') or of a token ([[tessera]] or symbolum), and was rendered hereditary by the division of the tessera. The advantages thus obtained by the guest were, the right of hospitality when traveling and, above all, the protection of his host (representing him as his patron) in a court of law. The contract was sacred and inviolable, undertaken in the name of Jupiter Hospitalis, and could only be dissolved by a formal act.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Public==
This private connection developed into a custom according to which a state appointed one of the citizens of a foreign state as its representative [[Proxenos]] (πρόξενος) to protect any of its citizens travelling or resident in his country. Sometimes an individual came forward voluntarily to perform these duties on behalf of another state ''etheloproxenos'' (ἐθελοπρόξενος). The proxenus is generally compared to the modern consul or minister resident. His duties were to afford hospitality to strangers from the state whose proxenus he was, to introduce its ambassadors, to procure them admission to the assembly and seats in the theatre, and in general to look after the commercial and political interests of the state by which he had been appointed to his office.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Many cases occur where such an office was hereditary; thus the family of [[Callias]] at [[Athens]] were proxeni of the [[Sparta]]ns. We find the office mentioned in a [[Corcyraean]] inscription dating probably from the 7th century BC, and it continued to grow more important and frequent throughout Greek history. There is no proof that any direct emolument was ever attached to the office, while the expense and trouble entailed by it must often have been very great. Probably the honors which it brought with it were sufficient recompense. These consisted partly in the general respect and esteem paid to a proxenus, and partly in many more substantial honors conferred by special decree of the state whose representative he was, such as freedom from taxation and public burdens, the right of acquiring property in Attica, admission to the senate and popular assemblies, and perhaps even full citizenship.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Public hospitium seems also to have existed among the Italian races; but the circumstances of their history prevented it from becoming so important as in Greece. Cases, however, occur of the establishment of public hospitality between two cities ([[Rome]] and [[Caere]], [[Livy]] v. 50), and of towns entering into a position of clientship to some distinguished Roman, who then became patronus of such a town. Foreigners were frequently granted the right of public hospitality by the senate down to the end of the republic. The public ''hospes'' had a right to entertainment at the public expense, admission to sacrifices and games, the right of buying and selling on his own account, and of bringing an action at law without the intervention of a Roman patron.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A full bibliography of the subject will be found in the article in Daremberg and Saglio, ''Dictionnaire des antiquités'', to which may be added [[Rudolf von Jhering]]. ''Die Gastfreundschaft im Altertum'' (1887); see also Smith's ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' (3rd ed., 1890).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Medieval Hospitia==
[[File:Hospitium, York.jpg|thumb|The former Hospitium of [[St Mary's Abbey, York]], England]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], the term was extended, across [[Europe]], to refer to the building or complex of buildings attached to a [[monastery]], where [[pilgrim]]s and other lesser guests could find hospitality or ''hospitium'', including [[dormitory]]-based accommodation.

'''Identityism''' is  the school of [[Sufi metaphysics]] of unity of being traditionally known as ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood]]'' or ''Wahdat al-wujud'' (Arabic: Literally, unity of existence) formulated by [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref&gt;''God Speaks'', Meher Baba, Published by Dodd Meade, 1955, 2nd Ed. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Identityism is similar to [[monism]] in the west and [[nondualism]] and [[advaita vedanta]] in [[Hinduism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">The doctrine of '''implied repeal''' is a [[concept]] in [[constitutional theory]] which states that where an [[Act of Parliament]] or an [[Act of Congress]] (or of some other legislature) conflicts with an earlier one, the later Act takes precedence and the conflicting parts of the earlier Act becomes legally inoperable. This doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase ''"leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant"''.

Implied repeal is to be contrasted with the express repeal of legislation by the legislative body.

Under [[United States]] law, "implied repeal" is a disfavored doctrine.  That is, if a court can reconcile the two statutes with any reasonable interpretation, that interpretation is preferred to one that treats the earlier statute as invalidated by the later one.&lt;ref&gt;See Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 950 P.2d 1086, 1096 (Cal. 1998) (recalling that to overcome the strong presumption against implicit repeal the two provisions must be so inconsistent that they cannot have concurrent operation).&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
{{see|Quasi-constitutionality}}
In Canadian law, it is possible for a law to be protected from implied repeal by way of a "primacy clause" which state that the act in question supersedes all other statutes until it is specifically repealed.  Acts with such primacy clauses are called quasi-constitutional.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the 2002 English case ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' (the so-called "[[Metric Martyrs]]" case), [[Lord Justice Laws]] held that some [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutionally significant statutes]] hold a higher status in UK law and are not be subject to the doctrine of implied repeal. The case specifically dealt with s.2(2) of the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act]], but in his judgment Lord Justice Laws also held the view that the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts]] and the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] are "constitutional statutes" and in his opinion may not be subject to the doctrine of implied repeal. 

A decade later in 2012, in a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Supreme Court]], ''BH v The Lord Advocate (Scotland)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/24.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;2012&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKSC 24]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]] held (in Paragraph 30 of the judgment) that "the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]] can only be expressly repealed; it cannot be impliedly repealed; that is because of its 'fundamental constitutional nature'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6RL17oiC0?url=http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2013/11/26/adam-perry-and-farrah-ahmed-are-constitutional-statutes-quasi-entrenched/ Adam Perry and Farrah Ahmed: Are Constitutional Statutes 'Quasi-Entrenched'?

Goodman |title=Protect yourself! Make a plan to obtain "informed refusal" |journal=OBG Management |volume=19|pages=45–50|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informed refusal is linked to the [[informed consent]] process, as a patient has a right to consent, but also may choose to refuse.&lt;ref name="ACOG"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Informed Refusal (2004) |author=[[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]], Committee on Professional Liability | journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=104|pages=1465–6|year= 2004 |doi=10.1097/00006250-200412000-00048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual needs to be in possession of the relevant facts as well as of his reasoning faculties, such as not being [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] or [[mentally ill]] and without an [[Disability|impairment]] of [[judgment]] at the time of refusing.  Such impairments might include illness, [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[drunkenness]], [[Psychoactive drug|using drug]]s, insufficient [[sleep]], and other [[health]] problems.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; In cases where an individual is considered unable to give informed refusal, another person ([[Legal guardian|guardian]]) may be authorized to give consent on their behalf.
The concept grew out of and is similar to that of [[informed consent]], but much less commonly used and applied. In the [[United States|United States of America]] it is recognized in certain [[state law]]s (in 2006: [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Vermont]], and [[Michigan]]) as well as in various [[court decision]]s.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

As applied in the medical field, a physician has made an assessment of a patient and finds a specific test, intervention, or treatment is medically necessary. The patient refuses to consent to this recommendation. The physician then needs to explain the risks of not following through with the recommendations to allow the patient to make an informed decision against the recommendation. While in the past documentation of refusal of treatment has not been important, the widespread use of managed care, cost containment processes, as well as increased patient autonomy have created a situation where documented "informed refusal" is viewed as becoming more important.&lt;ref name="ACOG"/&gt; When refusal of treatment may result in significant damage or death, the interaction needs to be  documented to protect the care giver in a potential later [[litigation]] against the allegation that the recommendation was either not made or not understood. On occasion, a patient will also refuse to sign the "informed refusal" document, in which case a witness would have to sign that the informed process and the refusal took place.&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;

The pregnant patient represents a specific dilemma in the field of informed refusal as her action may result in harm or death to the fetus. Ethicists disagree on how to handle this situation.&lt;ref name="DWB"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-8847.2006.00132.x |title=Rights of and duties to non-consenting patients - Informed refusal in the developing world| author=Louis-Jacques van Bogaert| journal=Developing World Bioethics | doi=10.1111/j.1471-8847.2006.00132.x| pmid=16436170| year=2006| volume=6| issue=1| pages=13–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Blund'''{{efn|Or '''Johannes Blund''', '''Iohannes Blondus''', '''Iohannes Blundus'''}} ([[circa|c.]] 1175–1248) was an English [[scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher, known for his work on the nature of the soul, the Tractatus de anima, one of the first works of western philosophy to make use of the recently translated  ''[[De Anima]]'' by [[Aristotle]] and especially the Persian philosopher Avicenna's work on the soul, also called ''De Anima''.&lt;ref&gt;Blund ''Tractatus de Anima''&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at [[Oxford University]]&lt;ref name=Thought280&gt;Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Edmund of Abingdon]]. [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] said that he was "noteworthy for his knowledge of [[Avicenna]] and his rejection of the [[hylomorphism]] of [[Avicebron]] and the plurality of forms.",&lt;ref name=Thought287&gt;Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; although the problem of the plurality of forms as understood by later scholastics was not formulated explicitly in Blund's time.&lt;ref name=Dales45&gt;Dales ''Problem of the Rational Soul''  p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Powicke]] calls him the "first English Aristotelian."&lt;ref name=13th56&gt;Powicke ''Thirteenth Century'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Blund was a royal clerk by 1227 and studied at Oxford and [[Paris]], and was at the [[University of Paris]] when it was [[University of Paris strike of 1229|dispersed]] in 1229.&lt;ref name=BHOCanChich&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34335 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 5: Chichester: Unidentified Prebends]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Chichester]] before 1232. He was [[archbishop of Canterbury]] during a brief reign, having been elected on 26 August 1232.&lt;ref name=Handbook233&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported by [[Peter des Roches]], but did not receive papal approval and the election was quashed because of alleged [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] on 1 June 1233.&lt;ref name=BHOCant&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33853 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Canterbury: Archbishops]''&lt;/ref&gt; Probably it was the support of des Roches that doomed his election to Canterbury, and the pluralism charge was cover for the real reason.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Lawrence "Blund, John" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Chancellor of York|chancellor of the see of York]] before 3 November 1234, and died in 1248.&lt;ref name=BHOYork&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=8065 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 6: York: Chancellors]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2830">The '''Libre Software Meeting''' (LSM) is an annual [[free software]] event originally held in [[France]]. The French name of this event is '''Rencontres mondiales du logiciel libre''' (RMLL).

== Summary ==

The '''Libre Software Meeting''' takes place each year since 2000, in July. Launched by the French free software users group '''Association Bordelaise des utilisateurs de logiciels libres''' ([[ABUL]]). More than 1000 people, coming from more than 50 countries, participate each year.

The LSM is a mix of two complementary meetings:
* a developers meeting, free software coders coming to discuss about their projects during the event
* a free software promotion event dedicated to a large audience

== Organisation ==

The LSM is organized by a team of volunteers, combining local and national free software associations.

== Villages ==

[[Image:RMLL2017 village.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Village of the associations, LSM 2017]]

The village of the associations welcome the visitors with a set of stands presenting local or national associations.

== Logo ==

The LSM logo was drawn with [[Skencil|Sketch]] by André Pascual, Linuxgraphic.org co-creator, for the LSM 2001. The choice of the mascot and her name come from the homophony with Armelle (a French feminine first name) and RMLL, as pronounced in English.

Throughout Islamic history, there have existed several different metaphysical concepts that have been understood to correspond "in many respects" to the [[Logos (Christianity)|logos Christology]] of [[Christianity]] and to the use of the phrase in late [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., “ʿAḳl”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In the writings of many of the most prominent [[Sunni Islam]]ic metaphysicians, [[Islamic philosophy|philosophers]], and [[Sufism|mystics]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age]], [[Muhammad]], who is given the title of "[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|Seal of the Prophets]]" in the [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 33:40.&lt;/ref&gt; was understood to be "both a manifestation of the Logos and the Logos itself, both the beginning of the prophetic cycle and its end, and, being its end and seal," as one who contained "from an essential and inward point of view the whole prophetic function within himself."&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr'', ed. William C. Chittick (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2007), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; This classical identification of Muhammad with the ''logos'' emerged from particular interpretations of specific [[Quran]]ic verses, [[hadith|sayings of the prophet]], and through the writings of [[Sufism|the early mystics of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr'', ed. William C. Chittick (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2007), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the ''logos'' concept was also intimately tied in the works of the same authors to other important [[Islamic cosmology|Islamic cosmological]] concepts, such as the ideas of ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), which "resembled the late Greek doctrine of the ''logos''" and represented an Arabic equivalent to the Neoplatonic ''νοῦς'' ("Intellect"),&lt;ref&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., “ʿAḳl”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; ''lawḥ maḥfūẓ'' ("Guarded Tablet," in Quran 85:22),&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''Ideals and Realities of Islam'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; ''ḳalam'' ("Divine Pen"),&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''Ideals and Realities of Islam'' (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Heavenly Quran|umm al-kitāb]]'' ("Mother of the Book," in Quran 3:7, 13:39, 43:4),&lt;ref&gt;Wensinck, A. J., “Lawḥ”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition'' (1913-1936), Edited by M. Th. Houtsma, T.W. Arnold, R. Basset, R. Hartmann.&lt;/ref&gt; and, perhaps most famously, the Muhammad-related ideas of ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Perfect Man" or "Universal Man"), ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("Muhammadan Light"),&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, U., “Nūr Muḥammadī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''al-ḥaqīqa al-muḥammadiyya'' ("Muhammadan Reality").&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, U., “Nūr Muḥammadī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''logos'' was often presented as "created" in Islamic doctrine, and thus was more akin to [[Philo]]'s understanding of the phrase than [[Nicene Christianity]].

'''Lululemon athletica inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|uː|l|uː|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|ᵻ|n}}), styled as '''lululemon athletica''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] athletic apparel retailer. Lululemon is a self-described [[yoga]]-inspired athletic apparel company for women and men. The company makes a variety of types of athletic wear, including performance shirts, shorts, and pants, as well as lifestyle apparel and [[yoga]] accessories. The company was originally based in Canada, but has expanded to sell its products internationally in both store fronts and online. While the brand is known for its stylish and high-quality items, it has been criticized for being "cultish, faddish and overpriced."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 2011|title=LOCO FOR LULU|url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/docview/865046155?accountid=15115|journal=Canadian Business|volume=84|pages=28–32|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand attempts to adopt a genuine, customer-education focus, but has been questioned as to whether it truly practices what it preaches. Key competitors include Athleta, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Under Armour]].

On February 5, 2018, Laurent Potdevin resigned as CEO and from the company's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-lululemon-ceo-resigns-20180205-story,amp.html|title=Lululemon's CEO resigns over issue of conduct|last=D'Innocenzio|first=Anne|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lululemon cited several incidents of unspecified misconduct as the reasons for Potdevin's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/lululemon-ceo-laurent-potdevin-had-inappropriate-employee-relationship.html|title=Lululemon CEO left in part because of relationship with female designer at the company|last=Thomas|first=Christina Farr, Lauren Hirsch, Lauren|date=2018-02-06|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
According to a company source, seventy percent of managers are hired internally.&lt;ref name="CNN Money"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/03/16/lululemon-christine-day/|title=Lululemon CEO: How to build trust inside your company|accessdate=2012-10-18|publisher=CNN Money|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127090004/http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/03/16/lululemon-christine-day/|archivedate=2012-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Store managers are responsible for their store's layout, color coordination, and community involvement.&lt;ref name="CNN Money" /&gt;

== Products ==
Lululemon sells athletic wear including tops, pants, shorts, sweaters, jackets and undergarments,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as well as hair accessories, bags, yoga mats and water bottles.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Lululemon trademarked its original fabric, Luon, which included a higher-than-average amount of nylon microfiber, in 2005.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, the company has produced several different types of fabrics, including compression and moisture-wicking designs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

Lululemon maintains a research and development lab within its headquarters called Whitespace. The lab is made up of around 50 employees that include scientists and physiologists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

== Marketing ==

=== Holistic Guerrilla Marketing Model ===
It has been argued that Lululemon uses a holistic guerrilla marketing approach, through which wearing Lululemon clothing is linked to feeling like part of a larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 2011|title=LOCO FOR LULU|url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/docview/865046155/abstract/97F68EB2A33F4906PQ/1?accountid=15115|journal=Canadian Business|volume=84|pages=28–32|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, purchasing their product and supporting their brand becomes a solution to a problem. Consumers' purchases from Lululemon become less about the commercial transaction, and more about how the individual feels the purchase contributes to their personal development.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Use of social media ===
Lululemon uses [[social media]] including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]] as one of its main methods of marketing the company and its products. Through social media such as Facebook, it holds live discussions with designers from the brand via posts and comments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Touchette|first=Ben|last2=Schanski|first2=Megan|last3=Lee|first3=Seung-Eun|date=2015|title=Apparel brands' use of Facebook: an exploratory content analysis of branded entertainment|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=102347902&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=19|pages=107–119|via=ABI/INFORM Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also feature photos and advertisements for its ‘products of the day,’ to keep its followers interested and actively thinking about the brand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility ==
{{Advert section|date=February 2018}}
Lululemon incorporates sustainability into its business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainablebrands.com/digital_learning/slideshow/collaboration/embedding_sustainability_vancouver_style|title=Embedding Sustainability, Vancouver Style {{!}} Sustainable Brands|website=sustainablebrands.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's [[corporate social responsibility]] strategy, "Community Legacy", is built around five elements: community, sourcing and manufacturing, people, efficiency and waste reduction, and green building spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bass|first=Erin|date=2010|title=Lululemon’s commitment to the environment: a tangle of seaweed, suppliers, and social responsibility|url=http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=mrktngmngmntfacproc|journal=Marketing and Management Faculty Proceedings &amp; Presentations|volume=|pages=1–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== False advertising ===
In November 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Lululemon made false claims about its ''Vitasea'' clothing product; the firm had claimed that its Vitasea clothing, made from [[seaweed]], provided "anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits" but laboratory tests failed to find significant differences in mineral levels between cotton T-shirts and the fabric Vitasea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/business/14seaweed.html|title=Seaweed Clothing Has None, Tests Show|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-14|first=Louise|last=Story|date=2007-11-14|quote=Lululemon ... says the VitaSea clothing, made from seaweed fiber ... provides anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hydrating and detoxifying benefits ... There is one problem with its VitaSea claims, however. Some of them may not be true.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lululemon was subsequently forced to remove all health claims from its seaweed-based products marketed in Canada, following a demand from a Canadian oversight agency, the [[Competition Bureau]] of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/internet/index.cfm?itemID=2517&amp;lg=e|title=Lululemon VitaSea Clothing: Competition Bureau Takes Action to Ensure Unsubstantiated Claims Removed from Lululemon Clothing|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent report in 2009 suggested that some yoga devotees saw the company's yoga image as an "annoying phony-baloney symbol" with criticism that its "positive messaging" is vague with slogans such as "friends are more important than money."

=== Product quality issues ===
There were complaints about lululemon's clothing being poor quality with some items being "too sheer," as well as having holes appear and falling apart after a few uses.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes4"&gt;Los Angeles Times, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/03/what-lululemons-revealing-pants-say-about-yoga-.html It seems that Lululemon, the Vancouver-based company, had to recall some of its yoga pants because they are too sheer.

=== Controversial statements by founder ===
Founder Chip Wilson has made numerous controversial statements. In a 2004 interview, Wilson mocked Japanese pronunciation of the name of his company: "I was playing with [the letter] Ls and I came up with Lululemon. It's funny to watch them try to say it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/lululemon-athletica-chip-wilson-controversy|title=Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s 5 most controversial quotes|date=2013-12-10|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that his company does not make clothes for plus-size women because it costs too much money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/31/lululemon-plus-size_n_3675605.html |title=Shunning Plus-Size Shoppers Is Key To Lululemon's Strategy, Insiders Say |work=The Huffington Post |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2014-04-13 |first=Kim |last=Bhasin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an effort to explain the cause of excessive pilling in the brand's clothing, he blamed some customers for wearing lululemon's clothes improperly or for having body shapes inconsistent with his clothes.&lt;ref name="twsBusinessInsider" /&gt; During his interview for Bloomberg TV in November 2013, he said, "Frankly some women's bodies just don't actually work for it" and "it's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it."&lt;ref name="twsBusinessInsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/outrageous-remarks-by-lululemon-founder-chip-wilson-2013-12#ixzz2rtTHmZ7w |title=Outrageous Remarks By Lululemon Founder Chip Wilson |work=Business Insider |date=2013-12-10 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, comments such as these led to Wilson's resignation as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eun Kyung Kim |url=http://www.today.com/money/lululemon-co-founder-steps-down-wake-womens-bodies-remark-2D11721314 |title=Lululemon co-founder steps down in wake of 'women's bodies' remark |publisher=TODAY.com |date=2013-12-10 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements were described in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as "[[fat shaming]]" which led to much criticism among [[feminist]] blogs. The report suggested that it was company policy to discourage "[[plus-size clothing|plus-size]] customers" as part of its brand strategy since "no customer wants to endure the embarrassment of asking a clerk to go find a bigger size."&lt;ref name="twsTimeMag"&gt;Eliana Dockterman, November 13, 2013, ''Time'' magazine, [http://ideas.time.com/2013/11/13/forget-feminist-outrage-by-shunning-plus-size-customers-lululemon-is-making-a-terrible-business-decision/ "What Lululemon Could Learn From Abercrombie About Fat Shaming: A co-founder of Lululemon said his yoga pants just aren’t built for 'some women's bodies.'

'''Marius Jeuken''' (26 January 1916 - 24 March 1983) was professor of theoretical biology at the Institute of Theoretical Biology at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, from 1968 until his death.
Jeuken was also a member of the [[Society of Jesus]]; he joined the Dutch Jesuits in 1934 and was ordained a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[priest]] in 1946 in [[Maastricht]].

== Background ==
In 1953 Leiden University started a section [[Theoretical Biology]] within the department of Zoology under the direction of the mathematical biologist H.R. van der Vaart. In 1957 this section was transformed into an Institute with Van der Vaart as its Professor. But in 1961 he moved to Raleigh, North Carolina.

In 1966, the institute attracted Evert Meelis as a [[statistical consultant]] and invited Marius Jeuken to direct the institute, after he had been teaching biology at the [[Gadjah Mada University]] of Yogyakarta (Indonesia). He had been trained as an animal [[physiologist]], and had defended his thesis under supervision of C. J. van der Klaauw at Leiden University.

In 1968, Jeuken was given a Professorship in Theoretical Biology.  For at least half of his time he was dedicated to do experimental research so his theoretical biology would not lose contact with reality. One of his specific interests was how biology could benefit from the philosophy developed by the mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] at [[Harvard University]]. It inspired one of his students, [[Gerard Verschuuren]], to further expand on this issue (on Hemostatic Regulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00118370|title=Hemostatic regulation and Whitehead's philosophy of organism|first1=James A.|last1=Marcum|first2=Geert M. N.|last2=Verschuuren|publisher=|journal=Acta Biotheor|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=123–133|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF00118370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His institute has always had strong historical ties with the Prof. Dr. Jan van der Hoeven Foundation, which is still the publisher of [[Acta Biotheoretica]], the oldest journal of theoretical biology in the world. For years, Jeuken acted as its Editor-in-Chief, until he died in 1983.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24518">The middle of the [[Twentieth century|twentieth century]] was marked by significant and persistent increase in fertility rates in many countries of the world, especially in the West, resulting in the famous [[baby boomer]] generation. There is some disagreement as to the precise beginning and ending dates of the post-war baby boom, but it is most often agreed to have begun in 1946 immediately after [[World War II]]; some place it earlier, at the increase of births during 1941–1943. The boom coincided with the marriage boom, a significant increase in nuptiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hajnal |first1=John |title=The Marriage Boom |journal=Population Index |date=April 1953 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=80–101 |doi=10.2307/2730761 |jstor=2730761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby boom started to decline as birth rates in the United States started to decline in 1958, and grinded to a halt six years later in 1964. In countries that had suffered heavy war damage, displacement of people, and post-war economic hardship (e.g., [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]), the boom began some years later.

== Causes ==
Economist and demographer [[Richard Easterlin]] in his "Twentieth Century American Population Growth" (2000), explains the growth pattern of American population in the 20th century by examining the fertility rate fluctuations and the decreasing mortality rate.  Easterlin attempts to prove the cause of the baby boom and baby bust by the "relative income" theory, despite the various other theories that these events have been attributed to.  The "relative income" theory suggests that couples choose to have children based on a couple's ratio of potential earning power and the desire to obtain material objects.  This ratio depends on the economic stability of the country and how people are raised to value material objects.  The "relative income" theory explains the baby boom by suggesting that the late 1940s and the 1950s brought low desires to have material objects, because of the Great Depression and World War II, as well as plentiful job opportunities (being a post-war period).  These two factors gave rise to a high relative income, which encouraged high fertility.  Following this period, the next generation had a greater desire for material objects, however an economic slowdown in the United States made jobs harder to acquire.  This resulted in lower fertility rates causing the Baby Bust.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard A. Easterlin, ''Birth and Fortune: The Impact of Numbers on Personal Welfare'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Van Bavel and David S. Reher proposed that the increase in nuptiality (marriage boom) coupled with low efficiency of contraception was the main cause of the baby-boom. They doubted the explanations (including the Easterlin hypothesis) which considered the post-war economic prosperity that followed deprivation of the Great Depression as main cause of the baby-boom, stressing that GDP-birth rate association was not consistent (positive before 1945 and negative after) with GDP growth accounting for mere 5 percent of the variance in the crude birth rate over the period studied by the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Bavel |first1=Jan |last2=Reher |first2=David S. |title=The Baby Boom and Its Causes: What We Know and What We Need to Know |journal=Population and Development Review |date=2013 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=257–288 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00591.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00591.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthias Doepke, Moshe Hazan, and Yishay Maoz all argued that the baby-boom was mainly caused by the alleged crowding out from labor force of females who reached adulthood in 1950s by females who start to work during the [[Second World War]] and do not quit job after the economy recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doepke |first1=Matthias |last2=Hazan |first2=Moshe |last3=Maoz |first3=Yishay D. |title=The Baby Boom and World War II: A Macroeconomic Analysis |journal=Review of Economic Studies |date=2015 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=1031–1073 |doi=10.3386/w13707 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w13707.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andriana Bellou and Emanuela Cardia promote similar argument, but they claiming that it were women who entered labor force during the [[Great Depression]] who crowded out women who participate in the baby-boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bellou |first1=Andriana |last2=Cardia |first2=Emanuela |date=2014 |title=Baby-Boom, Baby-Bust and the Great Depression |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.665.133&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |website=Institute of Labor Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Sandström disagrees with both variants of this interpretation based on the data from [[Sweden]] showing that an increase in nuptiality (which was one of the main causes of an increase in fertility) was limited to economically active women. He pointed out that in 1939 a law prohibiting the [[Marriage bar|firing of a woman when she got married]] was passed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sandström |first1=Glenn |title=A reversal of the socioeconomic gradient of nuptiality during the Swedish mid-20th-century baby boom |journal=Demographic Research |date=November 2017 |volume=37 |doi=10.4054/DemRes.2017.37.50 |url=https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol37/50/37-50.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwood, Seshadri, and Vandenbroucke ascribe the baby boom to the diffusion of new household appliances that led to reduction of costs of childbearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenwood |first1=Jeremy |last2=Seshadri |first2=Ananth |last3=Vandenbroucke |first3=Guillaume |title=The Baby Boom and Baby Bust |journal=American Economic Review |date=2005 |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=183–207 |doi=10.1257/0002828053828680}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Martha J. Bailey and William J. Collins criticize their explanation on the basis that improvement of household technology began before baby-boom, differences and changes in ownership of appliances and electrification in U.S. counties are negatively correlated with birth rates
during baby-boom, that the correlation between cohort fertility of the relevant women and access to electrical service in early adulthood is negative, and that [[Amish]] also experienced the baby boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=Martha J. |last2=Collins |first2=William J. |title=Did Improvements in Household Technology Cause the Baby Boom? Evidence from Electrification, Appliance Diffusion, and the Amish |journal=American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics |date=2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=189–217 |doi=10.1257/mac.3.2.189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Blake and Prithwis Das Gupta point out the increase in ideal family size in the times of baby-boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=Judith |last2=Das Gupta |first2=Prithwis |title=Reproductive Motivation Versus Contraceptive Technology: Is Recent American Experience an Exception? |journal=Population and Development Review |date=December 1975 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=229–249 |doi=10.2307/1972222 |jstor=1972222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Lindert partially attribute the baby-boom to the extension of income tax coverage on most of US population in the early 1940s. The latter actualize already existed and newly created tax exemptions for children and married couples creating the new incentive for earlier marriage and higher fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindert |first1=Peter H. |title=Fertility and Scarcity in America |date=1978 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey, USA |isbn=9781400870066}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that because of the fact that the taxation was progressive the baby-boom was more pronounced among the richer population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zhao |first1=Jackie Kai |title=War Debt and the Baby Boom |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.205.8899&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |website=The Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology |publisher=Society for Economic Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==
Most [[baby boomer]]s are now in their 60s or 70s, with the oldest member of the boom being around 75. The trailing boomers are in their late 50s, with the youngest being 58 as of 2018 (If one uses Strauss and Howes generational span of 1943-1960). In the economy, many are now retiring and leaving the [[labor force]].

In 1946, live births in the U.S. surged from 222,721 in January to 339,499 in October. By the end of the 1940s, about 32&amp;nbsp;million babies had been born, compared with 24&amp;nbsp;million in the 1930s. In 1954, annual births first topped four million and did not drop below that figure until 1965, when four out of ten Americans were under the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;Figures in Landon Y. Jones, "Swinging 60s?" in ''Smithsonian Magazine'', January 2006, pp 102–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition of the boom years===
It is important to distinguish between the demographic boom in births, and the actual generations born during that period.

[[File:US Birth Rates.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|right|United States birth rate (births per 1000 population).&lt;ref&gt;Pre-2003 data came from: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/natfinal2003.annvol1_01.pdf "Table 1-1. Live Births, Birth Rates, and Fertility Rates, by Race: United States, 1909-2003"]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). (Retrieved from: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus/vsus_1980_2003.htm "Vital Statistics of the United States, 2003, Volume I, Natality".] CDC.) Post-2003 data came from: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr59/nvsr59_01.pdf "National Vital Statistics Reports"] (8 December 2010). CDC. Volume 59, no. 1. The graph is an expanded SVG version of [[:File:U.S.BirthRate.1909.2003.png]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines ''baby boomers'' as those born between mid-1946 and mid-1964 (shown in red).&lt;ref name="census2014"&gt;[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-84.html "Fueled by Aging Baby Boomers, Nation's Older Population to Nearly Double in the Next 20 Years, Census Bureau Reports"]. United States Census Bureau. 6 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As shown in the birth rate chart to the right, the baby boom in the United States is as much defined by the low birth rates that preceded and followed it as it is by an exceptionally high post-war fertility rate. The birth rate from 1946 to 1964 is much lower than the birth rate prior to World War I, although it is high in comparison to the time periods immediately preceding and following 1946–1964.

The exact beginning and end of the baby boom can be debated. The U.S. Census Bureau defines ''baby boomers'' as those born between mid-1946 and mid-1964,&lt;ref name="census2014" /&gt; although the U.S. birth rate began to shoot up in 1941 and to decline after 1957. Deborah Carr considers baby boomers to be those born between 1944 and 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first=Deborah|title=The Psychological Consequences of Work-Family Trade-Offs for Three Cohorts of Men and Women|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=2002|volume=65|issue=2|url=http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/32.pdf|doi=10.2307/3090096}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Strauss and Howe place the beginning of the baby boom in 1943.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The following table shows changes in U.S. population during the period of U.S. involvement in World War II and for the five years thereafter, based on U.S. census information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/ |title=Population and Household Economic Topics |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical and social background===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
When the war ended in 1945, millions of veterans returned home and reintegrated into civilian life. To help this process, Congress passed the [[G.I. Bill of Rights]]. This encouraged home ownership and investment in higher education through the distribution to veterans of loans at low or zero interest rates.

Returning veterans married, started families, pursued higher education, and bought their first homes. With veterans' benefits, the twenty-somethings found new homes in planned communities on the outskirts of American cities. This group, whose formative years covered the Great Depression, was a generation hardened by poverty and deprived of the security of a home or job. Now thriving on the American Dream, life was simple, jobs were plentiful, and a record number of babies were born.

Many Americans believed that lack of post-war government spending would send the United States back into depression. However, consumer demand fueled economic growth. The baby boom triggered a housing boom, a consumption boom and a boom in the labor force. Between 1950 and 1960, the nation's real GDP rose almost 50%, from $2.2 trillion to $3.1 trillion (in 2009 dollars). The middle class grew and the majority of America's labor force held white-collar jobs. This increase led to urbanization and increased the demand for ownership of cars and other 1950s and 1960s inventions.

===Marriage rates===
Marriage rates rose sharply in the 1940s and reached all-time highs. After World War II, Americans began to marry at a younger age: the average age of a person at their first marriage dropped to 22.5 years for males and 20.1 for females, down from 24.3 for males and 21.5 for females in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005061.html | title = Median Age at First Marriage,     1890–2006 | publisher=Infoplease | accessdate = July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting married immediately after high school was becoming commonplace and women were increasingly under tremendous pressure to marry by the age of 20. The stereotype developed that women were going to college to earn their M.R.S. ([[Mrs.]]) degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/p_mrs.html | title = People &amp; Events: Mrs. America: Women's Roles in the 1950s | publisher=PBS | accessdate = July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage boom is a major explanation for the baby boom. The rise in male earnings that started in the late 1930s accounts for most of the rise in marriage rates. Richard Easterlin's hypothesis that a relatively small birth cohort entering the labor market caused the marriage boom is not consistent with data from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schellekens |first1=Jona |title=The Marriage Boom and Marriage Bust in the United States: An Age-period-cohort Analysis |journal=Population Studies |date=2017 |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family sizes===
Family size increased sharply throughout the baby boom: the average woman bore 3.09 children in 1950 which increased to 3.65 children per family in 1960; the peak was in 1957, when the figure stood at 3.77. Most women became pregnant with their first child within seven months of their wedding; between 1940 and 1960, the number of families with three children doubled and the number of families having a fourth child quadrupled.

In the United States more babies were born during the seven years after 1948 than in the previous 30, causing a shortage of teenage [[babysitter]]s. [[Madison, New Jersey]], for example, only had 50 high-school girls to babysit for a town of 8,000, and any sitter could have had two sitting jobs at once if desired. $5 of the $7 that a California couple spent to go to the movies in 1950 went to the babysitter.&lt;ref name="formanbrunell2009"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnaKW5zvkUgC&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=RygbCdmRgY&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Babysitter: An American History | publisher=New York University Press | author=Forman-Brunell, Miriam | year=2009 | pages=49–50 | isbn=978-0-8147-2759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
In [[History of Canada|Canada]], the baby boom is usually defined as occurring from 1947 to 1966, with over 400,000 babies born yearly. Canadian soldiers were repatriated later than American servicemen, and Canada's birthrate did not start to rise until 1947. Most Canadian demographers prefer to use the later date of 1966 as the boom's end year in that country. The later end than the US (baby-boom generation: babies born from 1946 to 1964; see preceding paragraphs) is ascribed to a later adoption of birth control pills.&lt;ref&gt;The dates 1946 to 1962 are given in Doug Owram, ''Born at the right time: a history of the baby-boom generation'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Foot]], ''Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st Century'' (1997) see {{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home|title=By definition: Boom, bust, X and why|last=Pearce|first=Tralee|date=24 June 2006|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807071559/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home|archive-date=7 August 2006|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
After a short baby boom immediately after the war peaking in 1946, the United Kingdom experienced a second ''baby boom'' during the 1960s, with a peak in births in 1964, and a third, smaller boom peaking in 1990. The three peaks can clearly be seen in the [[Demography of the United Kingdom#Population|UK Population Pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/index.html#Population%20and%20Migration UK population interactive content]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics [http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc1/UKPyramid.html Animated Population Pyramid for the UK] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101003820/http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc1/UKPyramid.html |date=2013-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European and South-Pacific trends==
Many European countries, Australia and New Zealand also experienced a baby boom. In some cases the total fertility rate almost doubled. The American birth model, conceived by demographer [[Frank Notestein]], was punctuated by an end to the upsurge in births and a return to pre-war levels. In many European countries the first year of the Post World War II baby boom was the year 1946, but in Germany the first year was the year 1955 in Finland the largest birth rate was in August and September 1945. Japan had two separate baby booms. The first started in 1947, the second in 1971. Prior to World War II, mortality rates in Europe and America were on a general decline due to improved nutrition and medicine, and a surge in births were previously not experienced at such a large scale. Based on this model, baby boom years for other countries regarded for having a baby boom are as follows:{{by whom|date=September 2011}}{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In some of these examples, an "echo boom" followed some time after as the offspring of the initial boom gave rise to a second increase, with a baby "bust" in between. The birth years of the baby boom as noted being both short and long lived, creates what many believe to be a myth to the notion of defining baby boomers as one "generation", as a unified concept is clearly not possible. Indeed, multiple generations may be present in a single country such as Ireland where the boom lasted 36 years. This overlapping effect of generations is not illuminated when considering crude fertility rates. The only common ground for the collective boom is the same approximate starting year. This example can be applied to each state in the United States on an individual basis. The states with a census in place in 1946 saw fertility rates drop to pre-war levels throughout the 1960s, with the average being in 1964.

==In developing countries==
Along with developed countries of the West, many developing countries also witnessed baby-boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reher |first1=David |last2=Requena |first2=Miguel |title=The mid-twentieth century fertility boom from a global perspective |journal=The History of the Family |date=2014 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=420–445 |doi=10.1080/1081602X.2014.944553 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1081602X.2014.944553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|میر سید علی ہمدانی}}}}&amp;lrm;; 1314–1384) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufism|Sūfī]] of the [[Kubrawiya]] order, a poet and a prominent [[Shafi'i]] Muslim scholar.&lt;ref name=al-islam&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/ Al-islam.org] [http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter3/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/9.2.html Ninth Session, Part 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Hamadan]], and was buried in [[Khatlan]] [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=678&amp;page=4 Hadith alThaqalayn || Imam Reza (A.S.) Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known as ''Shāh-e-Hamadān'' ("King of [[Hamadān]]"), ''Amīr-i Kabīr'' ("the Great Commander"), and ''Ali Sani'' ("second [[Ali]]").&lt;ref name="Lawrence2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Walter Roper Lawrence|title=The Valley of Kashmir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqAHweWRUs0C&amp;pg=PA292|year=2005|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1630-1|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hamadani spent his early years under the tutelage of [[Ala ud-Daula Simnani]], a famous [[Kubrawi]] saint from [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]], Iran. Despite his teacher's opposition to [[Ibn Arabi]]'s explication of the [[Tawhit|''wahdat al-wujud'']] ("unity of existence"), Hamadani wrote ''Risala-i-Wujudiyya'', a tract in defense of that doctrine, as well as two commentaries on ''[[Fusus al-Hikam]]'', Ibn Arabi's work on [[Al-Insān al-Kāmil]]. Hamadani is credited with introducing the philosophy of Ibn-Arabi to South Asia.&lt;ref name=rafiabadi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeK9w9P0sBQC&amp;pg=PA101|title=World Religions and Islam: A Critical Study, Part 2|first=Hamid Naseem|last=Rafiabadi|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|year=2003|isbn=9788176254144|pages=97–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels==
Sayyid Ali Hamadani traveled widely{{snd}}it is said he traversed the known world from East to West three times. In 774{{nbsp}}[[Hijri year|AH]]/1372{{nbsp}}AD Hamadani lived in [[Kashmir]]. After [[Sharaf-ud-Din Abdul Rehman Bulbul Shah]], he was the second important Muslim to visit Kashmir. Hamadani went to Mecca, and returned to Kashmir in 781/1379, stayed for two and a half years, and then went to Turkistan by way of [[Ladakh]]. He returned to Kashmir for a third time in 785/1383 and left because of ill health{{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Don't you want to say where he went? The reader is left wondering what was so detrimental to his health in Kashmir.--&gt;. Hamadani is regarded as having brought various crafts and industries from Iran into Kashmir; it is said that he brought with him 700 followers, including some weavers of carpets and shawls, who taught the craft of ''[[pashmina]]'' textile and carpet-making to the local population.&lt;ref name=rafiabadi/&gt; Ladakh likewise benefited from his interest in textile weaving. The growth of the textile industry in Kashmir increased its demand for fine wool, which in turn meant that Kashmiri Muslim groups settled in Ladakh,{{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--What is the connection between an increased demand for fine wool and Kashmiri Muslim groups settling in Ladakh?--&gt; bringing with them crafts such as minting{{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Is this "minting coins"?

If not, this needs clarifying.--&gt; and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAmUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|pages=44–45|title=Trade and Contemporary Society Along the Silk Road: An Ethno-history of Ladakh|series=Routledge Contemporary Asia|first=Jacqueline H.|last=Fewkes|publisher=Routledge|year= 2008|isbn=9781135973094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamadani travelled and preached Islam in different parts of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Past in the Present: Horizons of Remembering in the Pakistan|first=Irmtraud|last=Stellrecht|publisher=Rüdiger Koppe|year=1997|isbn=978-38-96451-52-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} including Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, China, Syria, and Turkestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intellectual movements during Timuri and Safavid period: 1500–1700 A.D.|year=2005|first=Karim Najafi|last= Barzegar|isbn=978-81-85004-66-2|location=Delhi|publisher=Indian Bibliographies Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} {{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--Is this a complete list of the countries he travelled to and preached in?

Hamadani died in [[Kunar Province]] [[Afghanistan]] . His body was carried to [[Khatlan]], [[Tajikistan]], where his shrine is located.&lt;ref name=rafiabadi/&gt;

==Influence==
His disciple Sayyid Ishaq al-Khatlani was in turn the master{{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--The word "master" can have different meanings, so is not clear.

==Works==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3931">[[professor|Prof.]] '''Miroslav Hroch''' (born 14 June 1932 in [[Prague]])  is a Czech historian and [[political theorist]] and a professor at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]].

Hroch earned his PhD at the Charles University in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fhs.cuni.cz/historickymodul/hrochCV.htm | title = Prof. PhDr. Dr.h.c. Miroslav Hroch, DrSc. | publisher = Charles University in Prague}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 
May 30, 1997 Hroch received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Humanities at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Miroslav Hroch has earned international academic renown for his works about formation and evolution of the national movements of Central and Eastern European nations. He has significantly contributed to the establishment of comparative history as a research field in East-Central Europe.

Hroch defined three chronological stages in the creation of a nation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salva|first=Lon|title=1.2 theories of nationalism|url=http://www.slideshare.net/alonasalva/12-theories-of-nationalism|work=SlideShare.net|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  '''Phase A:''' Activists strive to lay the foundation for a [[national identity]]. They research the cultural, linguistic, social and sometimes historical attributes of a non- dominant group in order to raise awareness of the common traits—but they do this "without pressing specifically national demands to remedy deficits."  
*  '''Phase B:''' "A new range of activists emerged, who sought to win over as many of their ethnic group as possible to the project of creating a future nation." 
* '''Phase C:''' The majority of the population forms a mass movement. "In this phase, a full social movement comes into being and movement branches into conservative- clerical, liberal and democratic wings, each with its own program."

Hroch's definition of nation:
"Now the 'nation is not, of course, an eternal category, but was the product of a long and complicated process of historical development in Europe. For our purposes, let us define it at the outset as ''a large social group integrated not by one but by a combination of several kinds of objective relationships (economic, political, linguistic, cultural, religious, geographical, historical), and their subjective reflection in collective consciousness.''

Many of these ties could be mutually substituable - some playing a particularly important role in one nation-building process, and no more than a subsidiary part in others. But among them, three stand out as irreplaceable: 
#a 'memory' of some common past, treated as a 'destiny' of the group - or at least of its core constituents; 
#a density of linguistic or cultural ties enabling a higher degree of social communication within the group than beyond it; 
#a conception of the equality of all members of the group organized as a civil society."&lt;ref name=nationalism-project&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/what.htm|title=What is Nationalism?|work=The Nationalism Project|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myles Cooper''' (1735 &amp;ndash; May 1, 1785) was a figure in colonial [[Province of New York|New York]]. An [[Anglican]] priest, he served as the President of King's College (predecessor of today's [[Columbia University]]) from 1763 to 1775, and was a public opponent of the [[American Revolution]].

==Early life==
Cooper was educated at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] where he later served as chaplain. Ordained as a priest in the [[Church of England]] in 1761, he attracted the influence of several high clergymen, including [[Thomas Secker]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who recommended him for service in the American colonies. Cooper was thereby sent to [[New York City|New York]] in 1762 to assist [[Samuel Johnson (1696-1772)|Samuel Johnson]], president of King's College, which was an Anglican establishment. Cooper was appointed professor of mental and moral philosophy, and a year later he had assumed the college presidency.

==Presidency of King's College==

Cooper was chosen to replace his predecessor in the position of College President primarily because the Governors of the institution believed he would be far easier to control. Indeed, Cooper was not entirely engaged in the educational mission of King's, possessing a larger cache of alcoholic beverages than books, and more frequently engaging in the urban life of New York.

Still, the college prospered under Cooper's tenure, creating, among other things, the second medical college in the Americas, in 1767. Judge Thomas Jones wrote that "under his tuition was produced a number of young men superior in learning and ability to any that America had ever before seen," and [[George Washington]], whose stepson [[John Parke Custis]] attended King's, wrote of Cooper that he was "a gentleman capable of instructing him [Custis] in every branch of knowledge."

He was elected a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1769.

==Proposals==

While in the American colonies Cooper floated several grandiose schemes that were never realized:

===The American Bishoprics===

Cooper was reportedly more enamored with the Southern colonies than New York, and frequently took to "rambles" there. Desiring to resettle there, he proposed to his ecclesiastical superiors, in both 1768 and 1774, that two Anglican sees be established in North America, and that he be appointed bishop of the more southernly one.

===The American University===

Though he was in the thrall of King's College's governors during much of his tenure, Cooper had novel plans for the fledgling institution. He proposed that the [[Colonial Colleges]] be merged into an "American University", the structure of which would be similar to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. Under this scheme, the constituent colleges, including [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], and the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), would remain quasi-independent but would be controlled by King's, which would be elevated to university status and sanctioned as the only degree-granting institution in the colonies. Although Cooper obtained the support of the King's College Governors for the plan and left for England with a delegation to persuade [[King George III]] of its virtues and ask for his sanction in the form of a royal charter, neither Parliament nor the governing bodies of the other colleges ever took Cooper's plan seriously.

==Revolution and flight==

Cooper, who was a conservative with [[Tory]] sympathies, did not take warmly to the growing revolutionary spirit in the colonies. He authored, with several other Anglican clergy in New York, political tracts arguing that all forms of resistance to the Crown constituted treason. His pamphlet ''A Friendly Address to all Reasonable Americans on our Political Confusions; in which the Necessary Consequences of violently opposing the King's Troops, and of a General Non-importation, are fairly stated'' was later answered in best-selling tracts by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]].

For his Loyalism, Cooper, along with other prominent New York Tories, were issued death threats admonishing them "to flee for your lives, or anticipate your doom". Of Cooper, in particular, this party evidenced a desire of "seizing him in his bed, shaving his head, cutting off his ears, slitting his nose, stripping him naked, and setting him adrift". In May 1775 Cooper was confronted by an angry mob from which he managed to escape by boarding a British naval ship anchored in New York harbor. Rumors persist that this was due to the assistance of [[Alexander Hamilton]], though these have been shown to lack the weight of substantive evidence. Cooper fled to England that same month, where he engaged in numerous professions. His only subsequent association to America was his claim that he was owed pay for his tenure as college president, as well as a poem he composed about his flight.

Cooper died in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].

==Pandeism in China==
[[File:The Qutang Gorge along the Yangtze river.JPG|thumb|The [[Qutang Gorge]] along the [[Yangtze River]], in the [[Three Gorges]] region.]]
Physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] in his 1910 work ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature"), presented the broadest and most far-reaching examination of pandeism written up to that point. Weinstein found varieties of pandeism in the religious views held in [[China]],&lt;ref name="Weinstein-China"&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 121: "Es ist also nicht richtig, wenn die Anschauungen der Chinesen denen der Naturvölker gleichgesetzt werden, vielmehr gehören sie eigentlich dem Pandeismus statt dem Pananimismus, an, und zwar einem dualistischen."&lt;/ref&gt; especially with respect to [[Taoism]] as expressed by [[Lao-Tze]].&lt;ref name="Weinstein-Taoism"&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 234-235: "Pandeistische Andeutungen finden sich selbstverständlich auch bei vielen anderen Völkern. So könnte man den Taoismus der Chinesen, in der ihm von Lao-tse gegebenen Form, hierher rechnen, wenn er nicht auch dem Naturalismus zuzuzählen wäre, da bei ihm mehr die Natur als die Gottheit in den Vordergrund gestellt wird. Die Erwähnung an dieser Stelle muß genügen, zumal mit solchen Sätzen wie: "aus Tao ist alles hervorgegangen, in Tao kehrt alles zurück" nicht viel für unsere Frage anzufangen ist."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandeism (in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], '''泛自然神论''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?wdrst=1&amp;popup=1&amp;wdqchid=%E6%B3%9B%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E7%A5%9E%E8%AB%96 Definition of '''泛自然神論'''] ('''泛自然神论''', '''fànzìránshénlùn''') from [[CEDICT]], 1998: "pandeism, theological theory that God created the Universe and became one with it."&lt;/ref&gt; was described by Wen Chi, in a Peking University lecture, as embodying "a major feature of Chinese philosophical thought," in that "there is a harmony between man and the divine, and they are equal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Pandeism in India==

In 1833, religionist [[Godfrey Higgins]] theorized in his ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' that "Pandeism was a doctrine, which had been received both by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Brahmanism|Brahmins]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Her pan-deism is a pandemonium."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Grattan Guinness]], "[[s:First Impressions of India|First Impressions of India]]," in [[John Harvey Kellogg]], and the International Health and Temperance Association's, ''The Medical Missionary'' (1897), pages 125-127.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, twenty years earlier, in 1877, [[Peruvian]] scholar and historian [[Carlos Wiesse Portocarrero]] had written in an essay titled ''Philosophical Systems of India'' that in that country, "[[Metaphysics]] is pandeistic and degenerates into [[idealism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos Wiesse Portocarrero]], ''[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Sistemas_filosóficos_de_la_India Sistemas filosóficos de la India]'' (''Philosophical Systems of India''), November 1877, Part V: "Metafísica es pandeista y degenera en el idealismo."&lt;/ref&gt; Max Bernhard Weinstein also found Pandeism to be prevalent in [[India]], especially in the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name="Weinstein-India"&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 213: "Wir werden später sehen, daß die Indier auch den Pandeismus gelehrt haben.

==Pandeism elsewhere in Asia==
[[File:Yamazaki Ansai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yamazaki Ansai]], identified by [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] as a philosopher with ideas especially consonant with pandeism.]]
Weinstein similarly found the views of 17th century [[Japan]]ese [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosopher [[Yamazaki Ansai]], who espoused a cosmology of universal mutual interconnectedness, to be especially consonant with pandeism.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinstein, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 235: "Von den Japanern soll einer ihrer bedeutendsten Philosophen, Yamazaki-Ansai, um die mitte des siebzehnten Jahrhunderts, entwickelt haben: “Gott ist das Wesen aller Dinge und durchdringt den Himmel und die Erde.” Das klingt pandeistisch, kann jedoch auch metaphorisch gemeint sein, wie wir ja ähnliche Aussprüche von Gott tun.&lt;/ref&gt; Because cosmologically everything was interconnected, Ansai believed that the actions of an individual (in a similar manner to modern chaos theory) affect the entire universe.  He stressed the Confucian concept of ''Great Learning'', in which a person's actions (the center of a series of concentric circles) extend outward toward the family, society, and finally to the cosmos.

[[Charles Anselm Bolton]] noted in a 1963 article, ''Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?'',&lt;ref name="Bolton"&gt;[[Charles Anselm Bolton]], "[https://archive.org/details/BeyondTheEcumenical?q=%22pan-deism%22 Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?]", ''Christianity Today'', 1963, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Catholic Church and Pandeism|Catholic Church]] intended to use pandeism as a sort of umbrella belief system under which to bring religions of Asia toward [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="Bolton"/&gt; Bolton notes that "To those familiar with the history of Roman Catholic missions in recent centuries, the idea of fraternization with oriental religions is not completely new," and that "to unite with Hindus and Buddhists, Christians should explore the hidden reality—the “ultimate reality,” the infinite, the absolute, the everlasting, the all-pervading spirit that marks the religious experience of the Orient."&lt;ref name="Bolton"/&gt;

In [[medicine]] ([[oncology]] and other fields), '''performance status''' is an attempt to quantify [[cancer patient]]s' general well-being and activities of daily life. This measure is used to determine whether they can receive [[chemotherapy]], whether dose adjustment is necessary, and as a measure for the required intensity of [[palliative care]]. It is also used in [[oncology|oncological]] [[randomized controlled trial]]s as a measure of [[quality of life]].

==Scoring systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
There are various scoring systems. The most generally used are the '''Karnofsky score''' and the '''Zubrod score''', the latter being used in publications by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]. For children, the '''Lansky score''' is used. Another common system is the [[Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group]] (ECOG) system. Parallel scoring systems include the ''[[Global Assessment of Functioning]]'' (GAF) score, which has been incorporated as the fifth ''axis'' of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM) of [[psychiatry]].

===Karnofsky scoring===
The Karnofsky  Performance Score (KPS) ranking runs from 100 to 0, where 100 is "perfect" health and 0 is death. Practitioners occasionally assign performance scores in between standard intervals of 10. This scoring system is named after Dr. [[David A. Karnofsky]], who described the scale with Dr. Walter H. Abelmann, Dr. Lloyd F. Craver, and Dr. [[Joseph H. Burchenal]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Karnofsky DA, Abelmann WH, Craver LF, Burchenal JH. The Use of the Nitrogen Mustards in the Palliative Treatment of Carcinoma – with Particular Reference to Bronchogenic Carcinoma. Cancer. 1948;1(4):634-56.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of its development was to allow physicians to evaluate a patient's ability to survive chemotherapy for cancer.

* 100 – Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease. 
* 90 – Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease.
* 80 – Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.
* 70 – Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work.
* 60 – Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of their personal needs.
* 50 – Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care.
* 40 – Disabled; requires special care and assistance.
* 30 – Severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent.
* 20 – Very sick; hospital admission necessary; active supportive treatment necessary.
* 10 – Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly.
* 0 – Dead

===ECOG/WHO/Zubrod score===
The [[Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group]] (ECOG) score (published by Oken ''et al.'' in 1982), also called the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] or Zubrod score (after [[C. Gordon Zubrod]]), runs from 0 to 5, with 0 denoting perfect health and 5 death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Oken MM, Creech RH, Tormey DC, etal |title=Toxicity and response criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group |journal=Am. J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=649–55 |year=1982 |pmid=7165009|doi=10.1097/00000421-198212000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its advantage over the Karnofsky scale lies in its simplicity.
* 0 – Asymptomatic (Fully active, able to carry on all predisease activities without restriction)
* 1 – Symptomatic but completely ambulatory (Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature. For example, light housework, office work) 
* 2 – Symptomatic, &lt;50% in bed during the day (Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours)
* 3 – Symptomatic, &gt;50% in bed, but not bedbound (Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours)
* 4 – Bedbound (Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair) 		
* 5 – Death

===Lansky score===
Children, who might have more trouble expressing their experienced quality of life, require a somewhat more observational scoring system suggested and validated by Lansky ''et al.'' in 1987:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lansky SB, List MA, Lansky LL, Ritter-Sterr C, Miller DR |title=The measurement of performance in childhood cancer patients |journal=Cancer |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1651–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3621134|doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19871001)60:7&lt;1651::AID-CNCR2820600738&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 100 – fully active, normal
* 90 – minor restrictions in strenuous physical activity
* 80 – active, but gets tired more quickly
* 70 – greater restriction of play ''and'' less time spent in play activity
* 60 – up and around, but active play minimal; keeps busy by being involved in quieter activities
* 50 – lying around much of the day, but gets dressed; no active playing participates in all quiet play and activities
* 40 – mainly in bed; participates in quiet activities
* 30 – bedbound; needing assistance even for quiet play
* 20 – sleeping often; play entirely limited to very passive activities
* 10 – doesn't play; does not get out of bed
* 0 – unresponsive

==Comparison==
A translation between the Zubrod and Karnofsky scales that works especially well for healthy patients has been validated in a large sample of lung cancer patients:&lt;ref&gt;Buccheri G, Ferrigno D, Tamburini M. Karnofsky and ECOG performance status scoring in lung cancer: a prospective, longitudinal study of 536 patients from a single institution. Eur J Cancer. 1996 Jun;32A(7):1135-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Zubrod 0–1 equals Karnofsky 80–100
*Zubrod 2 equals Karnofsky 60–70
*Zubrod 3–4 equals Karnofsky 10–50

'''Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|k|uː|_|l|ə|ˈ|b|ɑr|t}}; {{IPA-fr|laku labaʁt|lang}}; 6 March 1940 &amp;ndash; 28 January 2007) was a [[France|French]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. He was also a [[literary criticism|literary critic]] and [[translation|translator]].

Lacoue-Labarthe was influenced by and wrote extensively on [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[German Romanticism]], [[Paul Celan]], and [[Gérard Granel]].&lt;ref&gt;On the influence of Granel, cf., [http://www.gerardgranel.com/audio4.html Audio recording of Lacoue-Labarthe discussing Granel]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated works by Heidegger, Celan, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and [[Walter Benjamin]] into French.

Lacoue-Labarthe was a member and president of the [[Collège international de philosophie]].

==Work==
===Collaboration with Jean-Luc Nancy===
Lacoue-Labarthe wrote several books and articles in collaboration with [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], a colleague at the [[Université Marc Bloch]] in [[Strasbourg]]. Early collaborations included ''Le Titre de la lettre: une lecture de Lacan'' (1973; trans., ''The Title of the Letter: A Reading of Lacan'') and ''L'Absolu littéraire: théorie de la littérature du romantisme allemand'' (1978; trans., ''The Literary Absolute: The Theory of Literature in German Romanticism'').

In 1980 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy organized a conference at Cerisy-la-Salle, centered around Derrida's 1968 paper ''Les fins de l'homme''. Following this conference and at Derrida's request, in November 1980 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy founded the ''Centre de recherches philosophiques sur le politique'' (Centre for Philosophical Research on the Political). The Centre operated for four years, pursuing philosophical rather than empirical approaches to political questions. During that period Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy produced several important papers, together and separately. Some of these texts appear in ''Les Fins de l'homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980'' (1981), ''Rejouer le politique'' (1981), ''La retrait du politique'' (1983), and ''Le mythe nazi'' (1991, revised edition; originally published as ''Les méchanismes du fascisme'', 1981). Many of these texts are gathered in translation in ''Retreating the Political'' (1997).

===On Martin Heidegger===
In 1986 Lacoue-Labarthe published a book on Celan and Heidegger entitled ''La poésie comme expérience'' (1986; trans., ''Poetry as Experience''). Lacoue-Labarthe received his ''doctorat d'état'' in 1987 with a jury led by Gérard Granel and including Derrida, [[George Steiner]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. The monograph submitted for that degree was ''La fiction du politique'' (1988; trans., ''Heidegger, Art, and Politics''), a study of Heidegger's relation to [[National Socialism]]. These works predate the explosion of interest in the political dimensions of Heidegger's thought which followed the publication of a book by [[Victor Farias|Victor Farías]].

In ''Poetry as Experience'' Lacoue-Labarthe argued that, even though Celan's poetry was deeply informed by Heidegger's philosophy, Celan was long aware of Heidegger's association with the Nazi party and therefore fundamentally circumspect toward the man and transformative in his reception of his work. Celan was nonetheless willing to meet Heidegger. Heidegger was a professed admirer of Celan's writing, although Celan's poetry never received the kind of philosophical attention which Heidegger gave to the work of poets such as Friedrich Hölderlin or [[Georg Trakl]]. Celan's poem "[[Todtnauberg]]," however, seems to hold out the possibility of a rapprochement between their work. In this respect Heidegger's work was perhaps redeemable for Celan, even if that redemption was not played out in the encounter between the two men.   
 
Lacoue-Labarthe considered that Heidegger's greatest failure was not his involvement in the National Socialist movement but his "silence on the extermination" and his refusal to engage in a thorough deconstruction of Nazism. He also believed, however, that Heidegger's thought offers pathways to a philosophical confrontation with Nazism, pathways which Heidegger failed to follow, but which Lacoue-Labarthe did attempt to pursue.

== Theatrical work ==
Lacoue-Labarthe was also involved in theatrical productions. He translated Hölderlin's version of ''[[Antigone]]'', and collaborated with {{Interlanguage link multi|Michel Deutsch|fr}} to stage the work at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Théâtre national de Strasbourg|fr}} on June 15 and 30, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;The performance was attended by, among others, [[Sarah Kofman]], who wrote a review in response. Cf., Sarah Kofman, "L'espace de la césure," ''Critique'' 34/379 (December 1978), pp. 1143–50; Tina Chanter, "Eating Words: Antigone as Kofman's Proper Name," in [[Penelope Deutscher]] &amp; Kelly Oliver (eds.), ''Enigmas: Essays on Sarah Kofman'' (Ithaca &amp; London: Cornell University Press, 1999), pp. 189–202; and Andrew Bush, "María Zambrano and the Survival of Antigone," ''[[diacritics (journal)|diacritics]]'' 34 (3–4) (2004): 90–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacoue-Labarthe and Deutsch returned to the [[National Theatre of Strasbourg|Théâtre national de Strasbourg]] to collaborate on a 1980 production of [[Euripides|Euripdies']] ''[[Phoenician Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colline.fr/auteur/101 Website about Michel Deutsch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620004556/http://www.colline.fr/auteur/101 |date=2008-06-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacoue-Labarthe's translation of Hölderlin's version of ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' was staged in [[Avignon]] in 1998, with [[Charles Berling]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/07/18/avi.t.php Actor's Metamorphosis Into Oedipus the Tyrant].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of printing}}

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Woodblock printing]] is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on [[textiles]] and later on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 A.D.

====In East Asia====
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|left|The intricate frontispiece of the [[Diamond Sutra]] from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China, 868 A.D. ([[British Library]])]]
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 A.D.). They are the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the mid-seventh century in China.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the [[Diamond Sutra]] ([[British Library]]) of 868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |title=Oneline Gallery: Sacred Texts |publisher=British Library |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110093610/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Tsuen-Hsuin |first1=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Needham |first2=Joseph |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |title=Paper and Printing |series=Science and Civilisation in China |volume=5 part 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=158, 201 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing spread early to [[Korea]] and Japan, which also used Chinese [[logogram]]s, but the technique was also used in [[Turpan]] and [[Vietnam]] using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;[[Thomas Franklin Carter]], ''The Invention of Printing in China and its Spread Westward'', The Ronald Press, NY 2nd ed. 1955, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was transmitted to Europe via the Islamic world, and by around 1400 was being used on paper for [[old master print]]s and [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=A Hyatt |title=Prints and People |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=Princeton |volume=5-18 |isbn=0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Arabs never used this to print the [[Quran]] because of the limits imposed by Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

====In the Middle East====
Block printing, called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], developed in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]] during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and [[amulet]]s. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly [[tin]], lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the [[Muslim world]]. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type printing was introduced from China.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), p. 427-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Europe====
[[File:Saint Christopher 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The earliest known [[woodcut]], 1423, [[Buxheim]], with hand-colouring]]
Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing card]]s printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.&lt;!-- This may be supported by the reference - An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}} (recovered from a previous version of this article) --&gt;

Around the mid-fifteenth-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common.  There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of [[movable type]], with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|History of Western typography}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of printing and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]]. [[Movable type]] allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by [[Bi Sheng]] out of [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Great Chinese Inventions"/&gt; Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which "proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I., ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The [[Jikji]], published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp. 15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;{{cite book |last=Polenz |first=Peter von. |title=Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

===The printing press===
{{main|Printing press}}
Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]], adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=S. H. |authorlink=S. H. Steinberg |title=Five Hundred Years of Printing |edition=3rd |year=1974 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex |isbn=0140203435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, [[tin]], [[antimony]], copper and bismuth – the same components still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 27, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] – entry "printing"&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Gutenberg started work on his [[printing press]] around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt;

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to [[typography]] and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. 
[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Page-setting room - c. 1920]]
Gutenberg's innovations in movable type printing have been called the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium".

===Rotary printing press===
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
The '''rotary printing press''' was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843. It uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]].

==Conventional printing technology==
All printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:
# Image Area (printing areas)
# Non-image Area (non-printing areas)

After the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.

Conventional printing has four types of process:
# Planographics, in which the printing and non-printing areas are on the same plane surface and the difference between them is maintained chemically or by physical properties, the examples are: offset lithography, collotype, and screenless printing.
# Relief, in which the printing areas are on a plane surface and the non printing areas are below the surface, examples: flexography and letterpress.
# Intaglio, in which the non-printing areas are on a plane surface and the printing area are etched or engraved below the surface, examples: steel die engraving, gravure
# Porous, in which the printing areas are on fine mesh screens through which ink can penetrate, and the non-printing areas are a stencil over the screen to block the flow of ink in those areas, examples: screen printing, stencil duplicator.

===Letterpress===
[[File:Commercial. Le Samedi BAnQ P48S1P03551.jpg|thumb|Miehle press printing Le Samedi journal. [[Montreal]], 1939.]]
{{Main|Letterpress printing}}
'''Letterpress printing''' is a technique of [[relief printing]]. A worker composes and locks [[movable type]] into the bed of a press, [[ink]]s it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century and [[Global spread of the printing press|remained in wide use for books and other uses]] until the second half of the 20th century, when [[offset printing]] was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

===Offset===
{{Main|Offset press}}
'''Offset printing''' is a widely used printing technique. Offset printing is where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket. An offset transfer moves the image to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, a process based on the repulsion of oil and water; the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier. So, the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using the technique of offset lithography.

===Gravure===
{{Main|Rotogravure}}
'''Gravure printing''' is an [[intaglio printing]] technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or [[laser]] ablation.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

===Other printing techniques===
The other significant printing techniques include:

* [[Flexography]], used for packaging, labels, newspapers
* [[Dye-sublimation printer]]
* [[Inkjet]], used typically to print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials: from high quality papers simulating offset printing, to floor tiles. Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces
* [[Laser printing]] (toner printing) mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons.
*[[Pad printing]], popular for its unusual ability to print on complex three-dimensional surfaces
*[[Relief print]], mainly used for [[Mail-order catalog|catalogue]]s
*[[Screen-printing]] for a variety of applications ranging from T-shirts to floor tiles, and on uneven surfaces
*[[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], used mainly for high value documents such as currencies.
*[[Thermal printing]], popular in the 1990s for fax printing. Used today for printing labels such as airline baggage tags and individual price labels in supermarket deli counters.

==Impact of German movable type printing press==
===Quantitative aspects===
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|European output of books printed by movable type from ca. 1450 to 1800&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"/&gt;]]
{{Main|History of printing}}

It is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg's printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (417, table 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious impact===
[[Samuel Hartlib]], who was exiled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that "the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke"&gt;Ref: Briggs, Asa and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Burke, Peter]] (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PrintMus 038.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the Gutenberg press at the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, California]]

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the [[early modern period]], though sometimes printing in [[Hebrew]] or [[Armenian script]] was permitted.  Thus the first movable type printing in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was in Hebrew in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;or soon after; Naim A. Güleryüz, ''Bizans'tan 20. Yüzyıla - Türk Yahudileri'', Gözlem Gazetecilik Basın ve Yayın A.Ş., İstanbul, January 2012, p.90 {{ISBN|978-9944-994-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an imperial ambassador to [[Istanbul]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan [[Selim I]] issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan [[Murad III]] permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in [[Arabic]] characters, yet the majority were imported from [[Italy]].  [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]]
established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the [[Ulama]]. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters.  Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William J., "İbrāhīm Müteferriḳa and Turkish Incunabula", ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', 1968, volume 88, issue 3, page 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews were banned from German printing [[guild]]s; as a result Hebrew printing sprang up in [[Italy]], beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetime's Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sotheby's]", [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of the printing medium 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41"&gt;Meyrowitz: "Mediating Communication: What Happens?" in "Questioning the Media", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41" /&gt; used the example of [[William Carter (martyr)|William Carter]] who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was [[hanging]].

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] in his lecture ''On the Study of History'' (1895), gave "assurance that the work of the [[Renaissance]] would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the [[Middle Ages]] would never recur, that not an idea would be lost".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke" /&gt;
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|upright|Bookprinting in the 16th century]]
Print was instrumental in changing the nature of reading within society.

[[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge as well as allowing for comparison between incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asa Briggs]] and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: due to the fact that texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged because people were given the option to form their own opinions on texts
# Dangerous Reading: reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable especially in the case of women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love and that if women could read, they could read love notes
# Creative reading: printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended
# Extensive Reading: print allowed for a wide range of texts to become available, thus, previous methods of intensive reading of texts from start to finish, began to change and with texts being readily available, people began reading on particular topics or chapters, allowing for much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics
# Private reading: became linked to the rise of individualism because before print, reading was often a group event, where one person would read to a group of people and with print, literacy rose as did availability of texts, thus reading became a solitary pursuit

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. [[Printer (publisher)|Printers]] emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, although the much more labour-intensive occupation of the [[scribe]] naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of [[bookselling|booksellers]] and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

=== Educational Impact ===
Gutenberg's printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their "language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modie|first=G|date=2014|title=Gutenberg’s Effects on Universities|url=|journal=History of Education|volume=43 |issue=4|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The language of Scholarship ====
Before the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== University Libraries ====
At this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. "Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. This issue was solved, however, by a man named Merton (1589) who decided books should be stacked horizontally on shelves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Curriculum ====
The printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Digital printing==
By 2005, [[Digital printing]] accounts for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion pages printed annually around the world.&lt;ref name="vj_ipg2-0_keynote"&gt;"[http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html When 2% Leads to a Major Industry Shift] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032849/http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html |date=February 16, 2008 }}" Patrick Scaglia, August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
*small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
*wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:

*[[blueprint]] – and related chemical technologies
*[[daisy wheel]] – where pre-formed characters are applied individually
*[[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] – which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs
*[[line printer|line printing]] – where formed characters are applied to the paper by lines
*[[thermal printer|heat transfer]] – such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image
*[[inkjet]] – including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image
*[[electrophotography]] – where [[toner]] is attracted to a charged image and then developed
*[[laser printing|laser]] – a type of [[xerography]] where the charged image is written pixel by pixel using a laser
*[[solid ink]] printer – where [[cube]]s of ink are melted to make ink or liquid toner

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional [[digital printing]] (using [[toner]]) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP [[Indigo Digital Press]] series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use [[digital printing]]. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying the use of machines such as the [[spirit duplicator]], [[hectograph]], and [[mimeograph]] was common.

==3D printing==
[[3D printing]] is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from [[3D modeling|three-dimensional digital models]] using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession.  The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Gang run printing==
[[Gang run printing]] is a method in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common paper sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste. Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process color jobs, which require four separate plates that are hung on the plate cylinder of the press.  Printers use the term "gang run" or "gang" to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same oversized sheet. Basically, instead of running one postcard that is 4 x 6 as an individual job the printer would place 15 different postcards on 20 x 18 sheet therefore using the same amount of press time the printer will get 15 jobs done in the roughly the same amount of time as one job.

==Printed electronics==
[[Printed electronics]] is the manufacturing of electronic devices using standard printing processes. Printed electronics technology can be produced on cheap materials such as paper or flexible film, which makes it an extremely cost-effective method of production. Since early 2010, the printable electronics industry has been gaining momentum and several large companies, including [[Bemis Company]] and [[Illinois Tool Works]] have made investments in printed electronics and industry associations including OE-A and FlexTech Alliance are contributing heavily to the advancement of the printed electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Announcements Show Gains Being Made by PE Industry|url=http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2012/07/recent-announcements-show-gains-being-made-by-pe-i|publisher=Printed Electronics Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printable transistors usher in 'internet of things'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/21/thinfilm/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Progressive illumination''' is a theological concept describing the [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] practice of orthodox theological development, most notably in [[Christianity]]; though the practice exists in many religions, especially [[Abrahamic religions]].  The term is used mostly among [[Christian theology|Christian theologians]].  It is distinct from [[progressive revelation (Christianity)|progressive revelation]] in that it does not describe the reception from God of new divine texts, or any novel concept that has no accepted foundation.  Rather it describes God-given understanding of existing revelation in a better and more accurate way.&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, Eugene, Ph.D. [http://www.bsmi.org/download/kimble/Biblical_Theology_Hermeneutical_Principles_20020926.pdf Biblical Theology: Hermeneutical Principles of Progressive Revelation], Retrieved 18 August 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually refers to understanding a [[Special revelation|biblical concept]] better, but the term also encompasses understanding [[general revelation|creation]] better, even through scientific inquiry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12050">'''Relational constructivism''' can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. ''self referentially operating cognition''). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.

In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. Björn Kraus puts it in a nutshell:

{{Zitat|„It is substantial for relational constructivism that it basically originates from an epistemological point of view, thus from the subject and its construction processes. Coming from this perspective it then focusses on the (not only social, but also material) relations under which these cognitive construction processes are performed. Consequently, it‘s not only about social construction processes, but about cognitive construction processes performed under certain relational conditions.“&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35, http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Lifeworld and life conditions as relational constructions ==

In the course of recent constructivist discourses a discussion about the [[lifeworld]] term took place as well. [[Björn Kraus|Björn Kraus']] relational-constructivist&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35 http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948&lt;/ref&gt; version of the lifeworld term considers its phenomenological roots ([[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schütz|Schütz]]), but expands it within the range of [[constructivist epistemology|epistemological constructivist]] theory building.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 145 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, a new approach is created, which is not only focusing on the individual perspective upon the lifeworld term, but is also taking account of social and material environmental conditions and their relevance as emphasized for example by [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]. Essential therefore is Kraus' basic assumption that cognitive development depends on two determining factors. On the one hand a person's own reality is her subjective construct. On the other hand, this construct—in spite of all [[subjectivity]]—is not random: Since a person is still linked to her environment, her own reality is influenced by the conditions of this environment (German ''Grundsätzliche Doppelbindung menschlicher Strukturentwicklung'').&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building up on this point of view, a separation of individual perception and the social and material environmental conditions is made possible. Kraus accordingly picks up the lifeworld term, adds the term "life conditions" (German ''Lebenslage''&lt;ref&gt;See Neurath 1931/Weisser 1956 in Björn Kraus: Lebenswelt und Lebensweltorientierung – eine begriffliche Revision als Angebot an eine systemisch-konstruktivistische Sozialarbeitswissenschaft. Kontext. Zeitschrift für Systemische Therapie und Familientherapie. Göttingen: Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht. Heft 37/02, 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;116–129. Also available online: http://www.webnetwork-nordwest.de/sowi/article.php?sid=92 2004, p. 7. See also Björn Kraus 2013, p. 143 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;) and opposes the two terms to each other.

By this means, lifeworld describes a person's subjectively experienced world, whereas life conditions describe the person's actual circumstances in life. Accordingly, it could be said that a person's lifeworld is built depending on their particular life conditions. More precisely, the life conditions include the material and immaterial living circumstances as for example employment situation, availability of material resources, housing conditions, social environment (friends, foes, acquaintances, relatives, etc.) as well as the persons physical condition (fat/thin, tall/small, female/male, healthy/sick, etc.). The lifeworld, in contrast, describes the subjective [[perception]] of these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 152 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraus uses the epistemological distinction between subjective reality and objective reality.  Thus, a person's lifeworld correlates with the person's life conditions in the same way than subjective reality correlates with objective reality. The one is the insurmountable, subjective construct built depending on the other one's conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between “Lifeworld” (Lebenswelt) and “Life Conditions” (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438; Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden.''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraus defined lifeworld and life conditions as follows:

{{Zitat|''"Life conditions mean a person's material and immaterial circumstances of life.''

''Lifeworld means a person's subjective construction of reality, which he or she forms under the condition of his or her life circumstances."''&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between "Lifeworld" (Lebenswelt) and "Life Conditions" (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, P. 4. http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This contrasting comparison provides a conceptual specification, enabling in the first step the distinction between a subjectively experienced world and its material and social conditions and allowing in the second step to focus on these conditions' relevance for the subjective construction of reality.

With this in mind, Manfred Ferdinand, who is reviewing the lifeworld terms used by [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Björn Kraus]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], concludes: Kraus' "thoughts on a constructivist comprehension of lifeworlds contours the integration of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches, as it is demanded by Invernizzi and Butterwege: This integration is not only necessary in order to relate the subjective perspectives and the objective frame conditions to each other but also because the objective frame conditions obtain their relevance for the subjective lifeworlds not before they are perceived and assessed."&lt;ref&gt;See Manfred Ferdinand: Lebenswelten - Lebensschnüre. Heidelberger Studien zur praktischen Theologie.: Lit Verlag: Münster 2014. P. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A relational constructivist theory of power: Instructive vs. destructive power ==
[[Björn Kraus]] deals with the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective upon [[Power (social and political)|power]] regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of [[constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] ("Machtanalytischer Konstruktivismus").&lt;ref&gt;Heiko Kleve: ''Vom Erweitern der Möglichkeiten''. In: [[Bernhard Pörksen]] (ed.): ''Schlüsselwerke des Konstruktivismus''. VS-Verlag, Wiesbaden/Germany 2011. pp. 506–519, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power, he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all.&lt;ref name=Kraus2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Björn|title=Introducing a Model for Analyzing the Possibilities of Power, Help and Control|journal=Social Work &amp; Society|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:464-sws-582|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from [[Max Weber]]'s definition of power,&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber: ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Grundriss der verstehenden Soziologie''. Mohr, Tübingen/Germany 1972. S.28&lt;/ref&gt; he realizes that the term of power has to be split into "instructive power" and "destructive power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraus|first=Björn|chapter=Soziale Arbeit – Macht – Hilfe und Kontrolle. Die Entwicklung und Anwendung eines systemisch-konstruktivistischen Machtmodells|editor1-last=Kraus|editor1-first=Björn|editor2-last=Krieger|editor2-first=Wolfgang|title=Macht in der Sozialen Arbeit – Interaktionsverhältnisse zwischen Kontrolle, Partizipation und Freisetzung|publisher=Jacobs|place=Lage, Germany|date=2011|pages=95–118|chapterurl=http://www.webnetwork-nordwest.de/dokumente/kraus_macht2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|105}}&lt;ref name=Kraus2013/&gt;{{Rp|126}}

More precisely, instructive power means the chance to determine the actions and thoughts of another person, whereas destructive power means the chance to diminish the opportunities of another person.&lt;ref name=Kraus2014/&gt;

Kraus defined "instructive power" and "destructive power" as follows:

{{Zitat|"'''''Instructive power''' means the chance to determine a human’s thinking or behaviour.

(Instructive power as chance for instructive interaction is dependent on the instructed person’s own will, which ultimately can refuse instructive power.)

'''''Destructive power''' means the chance to restrict a human’s possibilities.''

(Destructive power as chance for destructive interaction is independent of the instructed person’s own will, which
can’t refuse destructive power.)''"&lt;ref name="nbn-resolving.de"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Björn|title=Introducing a Model for Analyzing the Possibilities of Power, Help and Control|journal=Social Work &amp; Society|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|page=8|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:464-sws-582|accessdate=12 August 2014|ref=KrausSW&amp;S2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

How significant this distinction really is, becomes evident by looking at the possibilities of rejecting power attempts: Rejecting instructive power is possible – rejecting destructive power is not. By using this distinction, proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way, helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kraus2013&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|139 f.}} This perspective permits to get over an "either-or-position" (either there is power, or there isn't), which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories,&lt;ref&gt;Reimund Böse, Günter Schiepek: ''Systemische Theorie und Therapie: ein Handwörterbuch''. Asanger, Heidelberg/Germany 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bateson: ''Ökologie des Geistes: anthropologische, psychologische, biologische und epistemologische Perspektiven''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main/Germany 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinz von Foerster: ''Wissen und Gewissen. Versuch einer Brücke''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main/Germany 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and to introduce the possibility of an "as well as-position".&lt;ref name=Kraus2013/&gt;{{Rp|120}}

As Wolf Ritscher says, it is Björn Kraus who “has reflected on the topic of power as a substantial aspect of social existence in a constructivist manner and has shown that constructivism can also be used in terms of social theory”.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf Ritscher: ''Soziale Arbeit: systemisch. Ein Konzept und seine Anwendung.'' Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen/Germany 2007. P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seth Baum''' is an American researcher involved in the field of [[Global catastrophic risk|risk]]. He is the executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI), a think tank focused on existential risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/fv/i_am_seth_baum_ama/|title=I am Seth Baum, AMA! - Effective Altruism Forum|website=effective-altruism.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also affiliated with the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science and the Columbia University Center for Research on Environmental Decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcrinstitute.org/people/|title=People {{!}} Global Catastrophic Risk Institute|website=gcrinstitute.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Baum obtained his BS in optics and mathematics in 2007{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} at the [[University of Rochester]], followed by an MS in Electrical Engineering, [[Northeastern University]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cred.columbia.edu/about-cred/people/alumni/sethbaum/|title=Seth Baum - Center for Research on Environmental Decisions|website=cred.columbia.edu|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he obtained his Ph.D in Geography with his dissertation on climate change policy: "Discounting Across Space and Time in Climate Change Assessment" from [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Seth D.

== Work ==
As a graduate student in Northstrom, Boston, Baum contributed to the Whats Up magazine (now Spare Change News), from 2004 to 2007.

In 2011, Baum co-founded GCRI along with Tony Barrett, with the mission to "develop the best ways to confront humanity's gravest threats". The institute has since grown rapidly, publishing in peer-reviewed academic journals and media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcrinstitute.org/publications/|title=Publications {{!}} Global Catastrophic Risk Institute|website=gcrinstitute.org|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, its main work is on the "Integrated Assessment Project", which assesses all the global catastrophic risks in order to make them available for societal learning and decision making processes. GCRI is funded by "a mix of grants, private donations, and occasional consulting work.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;About GCRI. http://gcrinstitute.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcrinstitute.org/integrated-assessment/|title=Integrated Assessment Project {{!}} Global Catastrophic Risk Institute|website=gcrinstitute.org|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Baum hosted a regular blog on Scientific American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/when-global-catastrophes-collide-the-climate-engineering-double-catastrophe/|title=When Global Catastrophes Collide: The Climate Engineering Double Catastrophe|last=Baum|first=Seth|newspaper=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been interviewed about his work and research in the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/baum20160106|title=IEET Affiliate Scholar Seth Baum interviewed on the History Channel|website=ieet.org|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[The O'Reilly Factor|O'Reilly Factor]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/1146350884001/alien-invasion-over-global-warming|title=Alien Invasion Over Global Warming?|date=2011-09-06|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was asked about studying possible human contact with extraterrestrial life and the ethics involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=NEWS ANALYSIS; What Do You Say to an Alien?|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=2012-02-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also started contributing regularly to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', writing about the [[Ukrainian crisis]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]] as possible scenarios for nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-baum/best-and-worst-case-scena_b_4915315.html|title=Best And Worst Case Scenarios for Ukraine Crisis: World Peace And Nuclear War {{!}} Huffington Post|last=Director|first=Seth Baum Executive|last2=Institute|first2=Global Catastrophic Risk|date=2014-03-07|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, after receiving a 100,000 dollar grant from the [[Future of Life Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://futureoflife.org/first-ai-grant-recipients/#Baum|title=First AI Grant Recipients - Future of Life Institute|newspaper=Future of Life Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; his research interests shifted to [[AI safety]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Anthony M.|last2=Baum|first2=Seth D.|date=2016-05-23|title=A Model of Pathways to Artificial Superintelligence Catastrophe for Risk and Decision Analysis|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|volume=29|issue=2|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2016.1186228|issn=0952-813X|arxiv=1607.07730}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ethics of outer space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That same year, he wrote a monthly column for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, where he discussed AI threats, biological weapons and the risks of nuclear deterrence failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/breaking-down-risk-nuclear-deterrence-failure8562|title=Breaking down the risk of nuclear deterrence failure|date=2015-07-27|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sheffield school''' is an approach in biblical studies that engages in literary readings of the [[Canonical criticism|final form]] of the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. A. Clines]], Stephen E. Fowl, and [[Stanley E. Porter]], "[https://books.google.com/books?id=xvyLkaeQIG0C&amp;pg=PA14 Preface]," in ''The Bible in Three Dimensions: Essays in Celebration of Forty Years of Biblical Studies in the University of Sheffield'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the [[University of Sheffield]], where [[David J. A. Clines]] and [[David M. Gunn]] pioneered the approach. The phrase was coined by [[Tremper Longman]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=Longman /&gt;

The approach is also associated with the ''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]''.&lt;ref name=Longman&gt;[[Tremper Longman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oP8uLGkq8EsC&amp;pg=PA112 Literary Approaches to Biblical Interpretation]'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Travers&gt;Michael E.

'''Skinwalker Ranch''', also known as '''Sherman Ranch''', is a property located on approximately {{convert|512|acre|km2}} southeast of [[Ballard, Utah|Ballard]], [[Utah]] that is allegedly the site of [[paranormal]] and [[UFO]]-related activities. Its name is taken from the [[skin-walker]] of [[Navajo]] legend concerning malevolent [[witches]].

Claims about the ranch first appeared in the [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] ''[[Deseret News]]'',&lt;ref name="Van Eyck"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Eyck|first=Zack|title=FREQUENT FLIERS?|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/498676/FREQUENT-FLIERS.html|accessdate=2 August 2011|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=June 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the alternative weekly ''[[Las Vegas Mercury]]'' as a series of articles by journalist [[George Knapp (journalist)|George Knapp]]. These early stories detailed the claims that a family that had recently purchased and occupied the property only to experience an array of inexplicable and frightening events.

Colm Kelleher and co-author George Knapp subsequently authored a book&lt;ref name="Kelleher"&gt;Kelleher, Colm &amp; Knapp, George: ''Hunt for the Skinwalker: Science Confronts the Unexplained at a Remote Ranch in Utah'' (Paraview Pocket Books, 2005 {{ISBN|1-4165-0521-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; in which they describe the ranch being acquired by the [[National Institute for Discovery Science]] (NIDSci) to study anecdotal sightings of UFOs, [[bigfoot]]-like creatures, [[crop circles]], glowing orbs and [[poltergeist]] activity reported by its former owners.&lt;ref name="Griggs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Griggs|first=Brandon |title=Utah Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff|publisher=[[Globe Pequot]]|year=2007|isbn=9780762743865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXi0RNY7MmIC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=%22skinwalker%20ranch%22&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=%22skinwalker%20ranch%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranch, located in west [[Uintah County]] bordering the [[Ute Indian]] Reservation, was popularly dubbed the '''UFO ranch''' due to its ostensible 50-year history of odd events said to have taken place there. Knapp and Kelleher cite the 1974 book ''The Utah UFO Display: A Scientist's Report'' by Frank Salisbury and Joseph "Junior" Hicks, which details an earlier investigation into alleged UFO sightings in the [[Uintah County]] region, as partial confirmation of their account. According to Kelleher and Knapp, they saw or investigated evidence of close to 100 incidents that include vanishing and mutilated cattle, sightings of unidentified flying objects or orbs, large animals with piercing red eyes that they say were not injured when struck by bullets, and invisible objects emitting destructive magnetic fields. Among those involved were retired US Army Colonel [[John B. Alexander]] who characterized the NIDSci effort as an attempt to get hard data using a "standard scientific approach".&lt;ref name="DeseretNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,635201708,00.html?pg=1|title=Mysteries of 'UFO ranch' in spotlight|last=Whiting|first=Lezlee E. |date=April 21, 2006|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the investigators admitted to "difficulty obtaining evidence consistent with scientific publication." [[Cattle mutilation]]s have been part of the folklore of the surrounding area for decades, but NIDSci founder [[Robert Bigelow]]'s purchase of the ranch and investigation funding was reportedly the result of his being convinced by stories of mutilations that included tales of strange lights and unusual impressions made in grass and soil told by the family of former ranch owner Terry Sherman.&lt;ref name="ModestoBee"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4i4uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-tUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1210,1600389&amp;dq=robert+bigelow+ranch&amp;hl=en|title=Utah UFO research gets money boost|last=Van Eyck|first=Zack|author2=Associated Press |date=Oct 24, 1996|publisher=[[The Modesto Bee]]|accessdate=24 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]] awarded Bigelow a [[Pigasus Award]] for funding the purchase of the ranch by Harvard professor [[John E. Mack|John Mack]] and author [[Bud Hopkins]], for what Randi called a "useless study of a {{sic}} supernatural, paranormal or occult".&lt;ref name="JREF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/hotline/1997/0014.html|title=The Pigasus Awards|last=Randi|first=James|date=1 April 1997|publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=13 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314115746/http://www.randi.org/hotline/1997/0014.html|archive-date=14 March 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranch was sold by Bigelow to a private corporation Adamantium Real Estate, LLC in 2016. In 2017, the name "Skinwalker Ranch" was filed for trademark through Justia Trademarks. The trademark was issued in 2018.&lt;ref name="JustiaTM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/873/36/skinwalker-87336178.html|title=SKINWALKER RANCH - Trademark Details|publisher=Justia Trademarks|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10964">'''Spiritual Communion''' is a Christian practice of desiring union with [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Holy Eucharist]]. It is used as a preparation for [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] and by individuals who cannot receive Holy Communion.&lt;ref name="Tovey2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tovey|first=Phillip|title=The Theory and Practice of Extended Communion|date=24 February 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317014201|page=61|quote=Spiritual Communion is another part of the Anglican tradition. The 1549 Prayer Book said that if the person is so sick as to be unable to receive the elements but is repentant, they eat and drink spiritually. This statement is incorporated into many prayer books of the Communion. Anglican devotional material developed this into a set of prayers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice is well established in the [[Catholic Church]] and highly recommended by many saints, according to Pope John Paul II. He explained that practicing this constant desire for Jesus in the Eucharist is rooted in the ultimate perfection of Eucharistic communion, which is the ultimate goal of every human desire.

==Doctrine==

St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined Spiritual Communion as “an ardent desire to receive Jesus in the [[Holy Sacrament]] and a loving embrace as though we had already received Him.”

The basis of this practice was explained by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] in his encyclical, ''[[Ecclesia de Eucharistia]]'':

:In the Eucharist, "unlike any other sacrament, the mystery [of communion] is so perfect that it brings us to the heights of every good thing: Here is the ultimate goal of every human desire, because here we attain God and God joins himself to us in the most perfect union."

:Precisely for this reason it is good to cultivate in our hearts a constant desire for the sacrament of the Eucharist. This was the origin of the practice of "spiritual communion," which has happily been established in the Church for centuries and recommended by saints who were masters of the spiritual life. St. [[Teresa of Jesus]] wrote: "When you do not receive communion and you do not attend Mass, you can make a spiritual communion, which is a most beneficial practice; by it the love of God will be greatly impressed on you" [The Way of Perfection, Ch. 35.].1 .

Thus, the passionate [[desire (philosophy)|desire]] for [[God]], whom the saints have seen as the [[Sole Satisfier]], and who in the [[Eucharist]] is the "summit and source of the Christian life", is at the root of this practice. The experience of St. [[Padre Pio]] illustrates the compelling desire felt by the saints in the face of the  drawing and attracting power of God's love: “My heart feels as if it were being drawn by a superior force each morning just before uniting with Him in the Blessed Sacrament. I have such a thirst and hunger before receiving Him that it's a wonder I don't die of anxiety. I was hardly able to reach the Divine Prisoner in order to celebrate Mass. When Mass ended I remained with Jesus to render Him thanks. My thirst and hunger do not diminish after I have received Him in the Blessed Sacrament, but rather, increase steadily. Oh, how sweet was the conversation I held with Paradise this morning. The heart of Jesus and my own, if you will pardon the expression, fused. They were no longer two hearts beating but only one. My heart disappeared as if it were a drop in the ocean.”&lt;ref name="fatima037"&gt;http://www.fatima.org/joel/jo-pg037.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[Jean-Marie Vianney]] compared spiritual communion to blowing on fire and embers that are starting to go out in order to make them burn again: “There are some who make a spiritual communion every day with blessed bread. If we are deprived of Sacramental Communion, let us replace it, as far as we can, by spiritual communion, which we can make every moment; for we ought to have always a burning desire to receive the good God. Communion is to the soul like blowing a fire that is beginning to go out, but that has still plenty of hot embers; we blow, and the fire burns again. After the reception of the Sacraments, when we feel ourselves slacken in the love of God, let us have recourse at once to spiritual communion. When we cannot go to the church, let us turn towards the tabernacle; no wall can shut us out from the good God.”

St. [[Josemaría Escrivá]] taught spiritual communions improve [[presence of God]]: "What a source of grace there is in spiritual Communion! Practise it frequently and you'll have more presence of God and closer union with him in your life." He also taught: "Do not neglect to say, “Jesus, I love you”, and make one spiritual communion, at least, each day, in atonement for all the profanations and sacrileges he suffers because he wants to be with us."

According to Catholic theologians, the value of a spiritual can be as great as Holy Communion itself. "Spiritual Communion, as St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Alphonsus Liguori teach, produces effects similar to Sacramental Communion, according to the dispositions with which it is made, the greater or less earnestness with which Jesus is desired, and the greater or less love with which Jesus is welcomed and given due attention," stated Father Stefano Manelli, O.F.M. Conv., S.T.D., in his book ''Jesus our Eucharistic Love''.&lt;ref name="fatima037"/&gt;

"A special advantage of Spiritual Communion is that we can make it as often as we like — even hundreds of times a day — when we like — even late at night — and wherever we like — even in a desert, or up in an airplane," Fr. Stefano continued.

However, [[Anglican]] bishop [[Cecil Wood (bishop)|Cecil Wood]], cautions that "It would not be right to use this devotion of Spiritual Communion when the Sacramental Communion could be readily obtained. Care will be taken that neither unwillingness to rise in the morning nor slackness in preparing for Communion lead to the substitution of this devotion for the Church's service. That God in His love provides many special means of Grace can never be sufficient warrant for neglecting the normal means."&lt;ref name="Wood1916"/&gt;

Those who are aware of a [[mortal sin]] that needs to be confessed, can reach out to God through spiritual communion.

==Examples==

According to the official Catholic handbook ([[Enchiridion Indulgentiarum|enchiridion]]) for [[indulgences]], "an Act of Spiritual Communion, according to any pious formula, is enriched with a [[partial indulgence]]."

It also specifically mentions this ''Act of Spiritual Communion'', which was recommended by St. [[Alphonsus Ligouri]]:

:My Jesus, I believe that you are in the Blessed Sacrament. I love you above all things, and I long for you in my soul. Since I cannot now receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. As though you have already come, I embrace you and unite myself entirely to you; never permit me to be separated from you. Amen.

Cardinal [[Rafael Merry del Val]] composed this Spiritual Communion:

:At  Thy feet, O my Jesus, I prostrate myself and I offer Thee repentance of my contrite heart, which is humbled in its nothingness and in Thy holy presence. I adore Thee in the Sacrament of Thy love, the ineffable Eucharist. I desire to receive Thee into the poor dwelling that my heart offers Thee. While waiting for the happiness of sacramental communion, I wish to possess Thee in spirit. Come to me, O my Jesus, since I, for my part, am coming to Thee! May Thy love embrace my whole being in life and in death. I believe in Thee, I hope in Thee, I love Thee. Amen. 
 
Another example is:

:As I cannot this day enjoy the happiness of assisting at the holy Mysteries, O my God! I transport myself in spirit at the foot of Thine altar; I unite with the Church, which by the hands of the priest, offers Thee Thine adorable Son in the Holy Sacrifice; I offer myself with Him, by Him, and in His Name. I adore, I praise, and thank Thee, imploring Thy mercy, invoking Thine assistance, and presenting Thee the homage I owe Thee as my Creator, the love due to Thee as my Savior.

:Apply to my soul, I beseech Thee, O merciful Jesus, Thine infinite merits; apply them also to those for whom I particularly wish to pray. I desire to communicate spiritually, that Thy Blood may purify, Thy Flesh strengthen, and Thy Spirit sanctify me. May I never forget that Thou, my divine Redeemer, hast died for me; may I die to all that is not Thee, that hereafter I may live eternally with Thee. Amen.

[[Piarist]] fathers have taught this short act of Spiritual Communion, popularized by St. Josemaria Escriva:

:I wish, Lord, to receive you with the purity, humility and devotion with which your most holy Mother received you, with the spirit and fervour of the saints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/23-4-1912&lt;/ref&gt;

:In union, O Dear Lord, with the faithful at every Altar of Thy Church, where Thy blessed Body and Blood are being offered to the Father, I desire to offer Thee praise and thanksgiving.

'''Surat Shabd Yoga''' or '''Surat Shabda Yoga''' is a type of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[Yoga|yoga practice]] in the [[Sant Mat]] tradition.

==Etymology==
''Surat'' is "attention" or "face", that is, an outward expression of the [[soul]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/mt/righteousness.htm Singh, Kirpal.  Morning Talks, chapter 25, page 1, ("Righteousness - Detachment - Self-restraint.")] {{ISBN|0-942735-16-1}}, Ruhani Satsang, (7th ed., 2003): "The whole thing depends upon your attention, or surat as it is called, which is the outward expression of your soul."&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shabda|Shabd]]'' or ''Shabda'' has multiple meanings including ‘sacred song’, ‘word’, ‘voice’, ‘hymn’, ‘verse’, or ‘sound current, ‘audible life stream’, and the ‘essence of the Absolute Supreme Being’. The Absolute Supreme Being is a dynamic force of creative energy sent out into the abyss of space at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, as sound vibrations. These [[vibration]]s continue and are sent forth through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, K., ''Naam or Word''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. {{ISBN|0-942735-94-3}}, 1999; [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/naam_shabd1.htm BOOK TWO: SHABD, The Sound Principle].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yoga]]'' is literally ‘union’, or ‘to yoke’. Etymologically, ''Surat Shabd Yoga'' means the ‘Union of the Soul with the Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being’.

''Surat Shabda Yoga'' is also known as ''Sehaj Yoga'' – the path leading to ''Sehaj'' or [[Equilibrioception|equipoise]], The Path of Light and Sound, The Path of the ''[[Sants]] or'' 'Saints', The Journey of Soul, and The Yoga of the Sound Current.

==Basic principles==
''Surat Shabda Yoga'' is for the discovery of ''True Self'' ([[Self-realization|Self-Realization]]), ''True Essence'' ([[Spirit-Realization]]), and ''True Divinity'' ([[God-realization|God-Realization]]) while living in the [[human]] physical body. This involves reuniting in stages with what is called the "Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being", also known as the "Shabd or Word". Attaining this extent of self-realization is believed to result in ''[[jiva]]n'' ''[[moksha|moksha/mukti]]'', which is liberation/release from ''[[samsara]]'' and positivity in the cycle of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. Initiation by a contemporary living ''[[Satguru]]'' (Sat - true, [[Guru]] - teacher) is considered a prerequisite for successful ''[[sadhana]]'' (spiritual exercises). The ''sadhanas'' include ''[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]]'' (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a ''[[mantra]]'' given at initiation), ''dhyan'' (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and ''[[bhajan]]'' (listening to the inner sounds of the ''Shabd''). The mantra is Guru Manter. These are some verbal words that one gets from living masters and chants in mind, not with the mouth. As the language varies from culture to culture, Guru Manter or Mantra may also vary from culture to culture in spirituality. On the other hand, Naam or Word of God or Kalma is unspeakable, alive and no one can write it on paper. In the new testament "Hebrews 4:12" states, "''For the Word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.''" Words which we write on paper are not alive and active those words varies from culture to culture. Some years ago there was no any man-made language existing but according to scripture the word of God is existing since the beginning of the world.   

Surat Shabd Yoga arose in India in the last several hundred years, specifically in the Sikh tradition ([[Nanakpanthi]]) founded by Guru Nanak. The practice of meditation (Shabad), which is the central core practice of Surat Shabd Yoga, is derived from the ancient Hindu practice of ''[[nāda yoga]]''. ''Nada yoga'' is expounded in various Hindu scriptures such as the [[Nadabindu Upanishad]], an ancient text affiliated with the several thousands-year-old [[Rig Veda]]. The practice of ''nāda yoga'' within Hinduism has been widely affiliated within many yoga traditions including ''[[bhakti]]'' or devotional yoga, ''[[Kundalini yoga|kundalini]]'' and ''[[tantric yoga]]s'', ''[[laya yoga]]'', and ''[[raja yoga]]''. Modern Hindu teachers still emphasizing ''nada yoga'' include Swami Sivananda, Swami Rama, Rammurti Mishra (Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati), Paramahansa Yogananda (Kriya Yoga Lineage), and many others. The practice of ''nāda yoga'' is an integral part of various other traditions as well, such as being a form of the advanced ''[[thogal]]'' practice in the Tibetan [[Dzogchen]] lineage, and is mentioned by [[H. P. Blavatsky]], founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] in her book "The Voice of the Silence". The form of Surat Shabd Yoga, practiced by followers of Sant Mat and the Sikh tradition (''nanakpanthi''), is most commonly related to ''nāda yoga''. Furthermore, ''nāda yoga'' resembles and combines elements from the Hindu practices of ''raja yoga'', ''laya yoga'', and ''bhakti yoga''.

==Movements and masters==
{{main article|Sant Mat|Contemporary Sant Mat movement|Radha Soami}}

Adherents believe Surat Shabda Yoga has been expressed through the movements of many different masters. However, a basic principle of Surat Shabd Yoga's tradition is the requirement for an outer Living Master to initiate followers onto the Path. The movements whose historical Satgurus have died and their successors do not purport themselves to be Surat Shabd Yoga Satgurus, usually are not considered currently to be Surat Shabd Yoga movements, either by their own leaders or by movements with current Living Masters.

Satguru Maharshi Mehi Paramahansa Ji Maharaj is considered the movement leader in the 20th century. He came to an isolated cave of Kuppaghat, Bhagalpur (Bihar, India) and practiced Surat-Shabda Yoga from March 1933 - November 1934. He achieved self-realization and attained ultimate salvation during his practice. He wrote books "Moksha-Darshan (Philosophy of Salvation), "Satsang-Yoga", "Shri Gita-Yoga Prakash", "Raamcharit Maanas Saar-Satik", "Maharshi-Mehi-Padaawali" and "Maharshi-Mehi-Padawaali".

The [[Radhasoami]] movement of Surat Shabda Yoga was established by [[Shiv Dayal Singh]] (1818–1878) in 1861 and named "Radhasoami Satsang" circa 1866. Soamiji Maharaj, as he was known, presided over the [[satsang]] meetings for seventeen years at Panni Gali and Soami Bagh in [[Agra]], India, until he died on June 15, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radhasoamisatsang.org/sm/sm_detail.htm|title=Radhasoami Satsang: Soamiji Maharaj|website=radhasoamisatsang.org|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accounts of his guru and successors vary, although he gave verbal instructions on his last day as to how his followers should be cared for.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Shiv Dayal. (1934). ''Sar Bachan: An abstract of the teachings of Soami Ji Maharaj, the founder of the Radha Soami system of philosophy and spiritual science: The yoga of the Sound Current''. Translated from Hindi to English by Seva Singh with Julian Johnson. (9th ed.) Beas, India: Radha Soami Satsang Beas.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radha Soami Satsang Beas, his guru was Tulsi Sahib of Hathras. According to the successors Soami Bagh and Dayal Bagh, Tulsi Sahib &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9563/chapter2.html|title=WebCite query result|website=www.webcitation.org|access-date=2017-01-14|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmkI1HBi?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9563/chapter2.html|archivedate=2009-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a contemporary guru of the same teachings; but being a natural born Satguru, Shiv Dayal Singh himself had no guru.

After his death, six immediate successors carried on Shiv Dayal Singh’s teachings, including Huzur Maharaj Rai Salig Ram of Peepal Mandi, Agra, and Babaji Maharaj [[Jaimal Singh]] of [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas|Dera Baba Jaimal Singh]] the present day headquarters of (RSSB), [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]]. More information on living masters related to Shiv Dayal Singh's lineage can be found in the [[Contemporary Sant Mat movement]] article.

[[Sant Kirpal Singh]], a [[contemporary Sant Mat movement|contemporary Sant Mat]] [[guru]], and other gurus who got the success stated that "Naam" ("Word") has been described in many traditions through the use of several different terms in different languages. In his teachings,&lt;ref&gt;Singh, K. (1999). ''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm Naam or Word]''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. {{ISBN|0-942735-94-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following expressions are interpreted as being identical to "Naam":
:*"Naad", "Akash Bani", and "Sruti" in the ''[[Vedas]]''
:*"Nada" and "Udgit" in the ''[[Upanishad]]s''
:*"[[Logos]]" and "Word" in the ''[[New Testament]]''
:*"[[Tao]]" by [[Lao Zi]]
:*"[[Musica universalis|Music of the Spheres]]" by [[Pythagoras]]
:*"Sraosha" by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoraster]]
:*"Kalma" and "Kalam-i-Qadim" in the ''[[Qur'an]]''
:*"[[Naam]]", "Akhand Kirtan", and "Sacha ('True') Shabd" by [[Guru Granth Sahib]]

The more recently promulgated [[Quan Yin Method]] of meditation espoused via the spiritual teachings of [[Supreme Master Ching Hai]] has notable similarities to Surat Shabd Yoga.

[[Eckankar]], an American movement, has many links to Surat Shabd Yoga including terminology, although its American founder [[Paul Twitchell]] disassociated himself from his former teacher Kirpal Singh.

The [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]], also founded in America in 1971 by [[John-Roger]] and now with students in thirty-two countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msia.org/msia.qry?ID=21 “Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains”, US Army, January 18 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; also teaches a similar form of active meditation called ''spiritual exercises''. This movement uses the Sound Current and ancient Sanskrit tones in order to traverse and return to the higher realms of Spirit and into God.&lt;ref name="seeking the light"&gt;[[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], ''Seeking the Light: Uncovering the Truth About the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness and its Founder John-Roger'' (Los Angeles: Mandeville, 1998), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://masterpath.org MasterPath] is another contemporary American movement of Surat Shabda Yoga. Gary Olsen, the current Living Master of this branch, contends that several historical figures are [[satguru|Sat Gurus]] of Surat Shabda Yoga as representatives for the eternal Inner Shabda Master. A few of these Living Masters of their times include [[Lao Zi|Lao Tsu]], [[Jesus]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], [[Kabir]], the [[Sufi]] Masters, and mystic poets, [[Hafez]] and [[Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], the [[The Sikh Gurus|Ten Sikh Gurus]] beginning with [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]], Tulsi Sahib, and the Radhasoami/Radha Soami and offshoot Masters, including [[Shiv Dayal Singh]], [[Baba Sawan Singh]], [[Baba Faqir Chand]], and [[Sant Kirpal Singh]].

The ten Sikh Satgurus (Nanak Panthis) discuss the inner sound and inner light a lot in their scriptures. The first Sikh Satguru was [[Guru Nanak]], but his master (guru) was [[Waheguru]]. These masters teach these two techniques. There is a master, [http://www.manavdharam.org/][[Satpal Maharaj]], that teaches four techniques that include these two of inner light and inner music. Altogether He teaches inner light (sight), inner music (hearing), primordial vibration (sense of touch), and nectar (taste and smell).

These correspond to the five senses, and this is how a student turns them inward to experience what is inside of himself. See [[Vishnu]] with his four arms and they correspond to these. One hand is holding a circle (chakra) of light, one holding a  conch shell for the inner sound (hold it to the ear and a sound is heard), one holding a lotus flower to refer to nectar, and finally the fourth hand is holding a metal club (mace) for the inner vibration (if you hit something with it, it vibrates like a tuning fork). Some people refer to this inner energy as the soul.

Two of the names above were changed. Below the same paragraph is written again with the new names based on Wikipedia{{Unreliable source?|reason=Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a reliable source|date=January 2017}} sources.

The ten Sikh Satgurus talk about the inner sound and inner light a lot in their scriptures. The first Sikh Satguru was [[Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], but people believe his master was [[Waheguru]]. However, according to history during the True merchandise(ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) Guru Nanak Dev Ji, interacted with some living masters and term Waheguru is a combination of two words that is Wahh and Guru. Wahh is the praise (i.e awesome or wonderful), Guru means a teacher, full expression is "Satt Naam WahhGuru" which means "Oh Wonderful teacher, Naam or Word is the truth."  Wikipedia{{Unreliable source?|reason=Wikipedia: Wikipedia is not a reliable source|date=January 2017}} says: "Kabir's early life is not firmly established.[7]:14 In Indian tradition, he is commonly supposed to have lived for 120 years from 1398 to 1518, which "permits him to be associated with other famous figures such as Guru Nanak."But none of this is written anywhere or proved yet both personalities used Gurmukhi for writing 'Bani'.

==The Line of Succession of sikhs== 
'''THE LINE OF SUCCESSION FROM KABIR TO PRESENT''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/pdf/Jungle.pdf |title= The Night is a Jungle p. 362-366 |author=[[Sant Kirpal Singh - Ruhani Satsang USA]] |date= 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From Kabir to present, the Masters of the Divine Science of Light and Sound appear and manifest themselves as an uninterrupted line, through which they transmitted to each successor the one knowledge and the one Power. Subsequently, we can trace an &lt;br /&gt;
exact "family tree" from Kabir Sahib (1398-1518) to Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469-1539) and further as shown below:

'''ਹੁਕਮੁ ਪਛਾਨੈ ਸੁ ਏਕੋ ਜਾਨੈ ਬੰਦਾ ਕਹੀਐ ਸੋਈ॥੩॥''' (GGSG-Page No.1350-3)...Saint Kabir &lt;br /&gt;
Translation: One who will recognize the Command (Hukam), will know One Lord, we call him the real man.

'''ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ ਹਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੈ ਸਚਾ ਵਾਪਾਰਾ ਰਾਮ॥''' (GGSG-Page No.570) &lt;br /&gt;
Translation: The True merchandise(ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) is the Lord`s Naam. Trader Raam is the truth. &lt;br /&gt;

Above line in the book "Guru Granth Sahib Ji" verifies that during the true merchandise (ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) when Guru Nanak Dev Ji fed the hungry saints and he got the Naam from them. Whereas in books when we read the history of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, we find no information regarding true merchandise of Word or Naam of God. This line also verifies that Guru Nanak Dev Ji also interacted with living SattGuru where from he got the Naam. 

'''ਏਕੋ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੁਕਮੁ ਹੈ ਨਾਨਕ ਸਿਤਗੁਿਰ ਦੀਆ ਬੁਝਾਇ ਜੀਉ॥੫॥''' (GGSG-Page No.72) ..Guru Nanak  &lt;br /&gt;
Translation: The One "Naam" is the Lord's Command, O Nanak, the "True Guru(teacher)" helped me to guess the lamp (light). &lt;br /&gt;
(Here One Naam means One Word, and Hukam also addresses the Naam of God)

'''ਦੇਹੀ ਅੰਦਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਨਿਵਾਸੀ॥''' (GGSG-Page No.1026) &lt;br /&gt;
Translation: The Naam or Word or Kalma, abides deep within the body.

This line demonstrates that the Naam of God is something present in the body. One will get it within his own home i.e body where the spirit lives. Body is the current home of the spirit. After Guru Nanak Dev Ji below are the nine SattGurus (i.e Teachers of truth) of the Sikhs who got the success in the history and lead the community of Sikhs: &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji (1504-1552),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sr Guru Amar Das Ji (1479-1574),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Ram Das Ji (1534-1581),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563-¬1606),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji (1595-1644),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji (1630-1661),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Har Krishan Ji (1656-1664),  &lt;br /&gt;
Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji (1621-1675)  &lt;br /&gt;
and Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji (1667-1708).  &lt;br /&gt;

===Variations in movements===
Among the exponents of Surat Shabd Yoga and the commonly shared elements related to the basic principles, notable variations also exist. For example, the followers of the orthodox Sikh faith no longer lay emphasis on a contemporary living guru. Different Surat Shabd Yoga paths will vary in the names used to describe the Absolute Supreme Being ([[God]]), including Anami Purush (nameless power) and Radha Soami (lord of the soul); the [[List of deities|presiding deities]] and divisions of the [[macrocosm]]; the number of outer [[Initiation rite|initiations]]; the words given as [[mantra]]s; and the initiation [[vow]]s or the prerequisites that must be agreed to before being accepted as an initiate.

'''Tritheism''' is the belief that cosmic divinity is composed of three powerful entities. As generally conceived, three gods are envisioned as having separate domains and spheres of influence that coalesce into an omnipotent whole. In this primary respect, tritheism differs from [[dualistic cosmology|cosmic dualism]], which often posits two divine powers working in theological or spiritual opposition.

Most Christian denominations do not hold the universe as spiritually tritheistic, although some [[nontrinitarian]] denominations stray slightly from pure monotheism and the duality between God and Satan. The term has been sporadically used to spearhead heresy accusations, especially when employed against [[Christian]] sects promoting allegedly anathema conceptions of the [[Trinity]]. The most notable Christian sect that has been accused of tritheism by mainstream Christianity and alike is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which views the Trinity not in light of the orthodox Christian doctrine put forth in [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] proclaiming God to be one [[being]] and three [[persons]], but rather it teaches the Trinity to be three different beings or [[ousia|substances]] united by one purpose.    

==Monistic tritheism==
The [[Trimurthi|Hindu Trinity]] of [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]] the creator, [[Vishnu]] the preserver and [[Shiva]] the destroyer have been held to constitute a Tritheistic belief system. Like the Christian Trinity, these entities are understood to interact harmoniously. However, this Hindu trinity is not conceived in a firmly doctrinal sense, but is rather posited as one of the ways in which the divine order of the universe can be understood. Ultimately, the Universal Spirit, the Param-atman, the [[Brahman]] (not to be confused with [[brahmin]], a social class / caste), or Bhagvan is held to reign supreme as a singular entity.

=="Monotheistic" tritheism==
[[Islam|Muslims]], [[Judaism|Jews]] and other [[nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarians]] claim that the orthodox [[trinitarianism|trinitarian]] [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] of [[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]] constitutes Tritheism, since these distinct "persons" are unified only by an impersonal substance [[ousia]] which does not transcend, or exist apart from, the persons.

Proponents of trinitarianism claim that the three persons of the Trinity do not have separate powers, since they are omnipotent, and do not have separate spheres of influence, since their sphere of influence is unlimited. They argue that the persons of the Trinity have one divine essence and are indivisible, whereas Tritheism appears to suggest three separate Gods. [[Athanasius]] already attempted to distinguish Trinitarianism from Tritheism and [[Modalism]].

===Historical uses of the term in Christianity===
The following tritheistic tendencies have been condemned as heretical by mainstream theology. 
At various times in the [[history of Christianity]], various theologians were accused by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] of tritheism, which the Church treated as [[heresy]].

# Those who are usually meant by the name were a section of the [[Monophysites]], who had great influence in the second half of the sixth century, but have left no traces save a few scanty notices in [[John of Ephesus]], [[Photius]], [[Leontius]] etc.&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; Their founder is said to be a certain John Ascunages, head of a [[Sophist]] school at [[Antioch]]. The principal writer was [[John Philoponus]], the great Aristotelian commentator; the leaders were two bishops, Conon of Tarsus and Eugenius of Seleucia in [[Isauria]], who were deposed by their comprovincials and took refuge at Constantinople where they found a powerful convert and protector in [[Athanasius (grandson of Theodora)|Athanasius the Monk]], a grandson of the [[Empress Theodora]]. Philoponus dedicated to him a book on the Trinity. The old philosopher pleaded his infirmities when he was summoned by the [[Emperor Justinian]] to the Court to give an account of his teaching. But Conon and Eugenius had to dispute in the reign of [[Justin II]] (565-78) in the presence of the Catholic patriarch [[John Scholasticus]] (565-77), with two champions of the moderate Monophysite party, Stephen and Paul, the latter afterward Patriarch of Antioch. The Tritheist bishops refused to anathematize Philoponus, and brought proofs that he agreed with Severus and Theodosius. They were banished to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Philoponus wrote a book against John Scholasticus, who had given his verdict in favour of his adversaries. But he developed a theory of his own as to the [[Resurrection]] (see [[Eutychianism]]) on account of which Conon and Eugenius wrote a treatise against him in collaboration with Themistus, the founder of the Agnoctae, in which they declared his views to be altogether unchristian. These two bishops and a deprived bishop named Theonas proceeded to consecrate bishops for their sect, which they established in [[Corinth]] and [[Athens]], Rome,  Northern Africa and the Western Patriarchate, while in the east agents traveled through Syria and [[Cilicia]], [[Isauria]] and [[Cappadocia]], converting whole districts and ordaining priests and deacons in cities villages and monasteries. Eugenius died in [[Pamphylia]]; Conon returned to Constantinople. Leontius assures that the Aristotelianism of Philoponus made him teach that there are in the Holy Trinity three partial substances (''merikai ousiai, ikikai theotetes, idiai physeis'') and one common. The genesis of the doctrine has been explained (for the first time) under MONOPHYSITES, where an account of Philoponus's writings and those of Stephen Gobarus, another member of the sect, will be found. 
#[[John Philoponus]], an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[monophysite]] in Alexandria about the middle of the sixth century, was charged with tritheism because he saw in the Trinity as separated three natures, substances and deities, according to the number of divine persons. He sought to justify this view by the [[Aristotelian categories]] of ''genus'', ''species'' and ''individuum''.&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt;
# In the Middle Ages, [[Roscellin of Compiegne]], the founder of [[Nominalism]], argued like Philoponus that unless the Three Persons are ''tres res'' (3 objects), the whole Trinity must have been incarnate. He was condemned of the heresy of tritheism at the 1092-1093 [[Council of Soissons]] presided over by [[Renaud du Bellay]], [[archbishop of Rheims|archbishop]] of [[diocese of Rheims|Rheims]]. Attempting to appeal to the authority of [[Lanfranc]] and [[St Anselm|Anselm]], Roscellin prompted Anselm to write ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' and other treatments of the divine nature refuting his treatment.&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; Roscellin publicly recanted and, after exile in England and Italy, reconciled himself to the church, but returned to a form of his earlier reasoning.
# Among Catholic writers, [[Pierre Faydit]], who was expelled from the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] at Paris in 1671&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; for disobedience and died in 1709, practiced a form of Tritheism in his ''Eclaireissements sur la doctrine et Phistoire ecclésiastiqes des deux premiers siecles'' (Paris, 1696), in which he tried to make out that the earliest Fathers were Tritheists. He was replied to by the [[Premonstratensian]] Abbot [[Louis-Charles Hugo]] (''Apologie du système des Saints Pères sur la Trinité'', Luxemburg, 1699).
# A prominent ideologue of Russian [[Old Believers]] and a writer, [[Avvakum]] (died 1682) was accused by official Orthodox Church and by fellow Old Believers in tritheism, based on some passages in his letters.
# A Catholic canon of Trier named Oembs, influenced by the doctrines of the "Enlightenment",&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; similarly attributed to the Fathers his own view of three similar natures in the Trinity, calling the numerical unity of God an invention of the [[Scholastics]]. His book ''Opuscula de Deo Uno et Trino'' (Mainz, 1789), was condemned by [[Pius VII]] in a Brief of 14 July 1804.
# The Bohemian Jesuit philosopher [[Anton Günther]] was also accused of Tritheism, leading to his work ending up on the [[Index librorum]]. 
# Among Protestants, Heinrich Nicolai (d. 1660), a professor at [[Dantzig]] and at [[Elbing]]&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; (not to be confounded with the founder of [[Familia Caritatis]]), is cited.
# The best known in the Anglican Church is [[William Sherlock]], [[Dean of St. Paul's]],&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; whose ''Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and ever Blessed Trinity'' (London, 1690) against the [[Socinians]], maintaining that with the exception of a mutual consciousness of each other, which no created spirits can have, the three divine persons are "three distinct infinite minds" or "three intelligent beings.", was attacked by [[Robert South]] in ''Animadversions on Dr. Sherlock's Vindication'' (1693). Sherlock's work is said to have made [[William Manning (Unitarian)|William Manning]] a Socinian and [[Thomas Emlyn]] an Arian, and the dispute was ridiculed in a skit entitled "The Battle Royal", attributed to William Pittis (1694?), which was translated into Latin at Cambridge.
# [[Joseph Bingham]], author of the "Antiquities", preached at Oxford in 1695&lt;ref name=OCE/&gt; a sermon which was considered to represent the Fathers as Tritheists, and it was condemned by the Hebdomadal Council as ''falsa, impia et haeretica'', the scholar being driven from Oxford.
# Though members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] would probably not self-identify as tritheist, some critics of [[Mormonism]] claim that it is tritheistic or polytheistic because it teaches that the [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]] is a council of three distinct deities perfectly ''one in purpose, unity and mission'', but nevertheless separate and distinct beings.&lt;ref&gt;https://carm.org/tritheism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.mrm.org/2012/12/the-trinity-mormonisms-rejection-of-gods-highest-revelation-part-4-of-4/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some have suggested that the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has embraced a Trithiestic view of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as it does not see their singularity as a Godhead consisting in one being but rather as three separate beings in a single group.&lt;ref&gt;http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Moon_Quest_Biblical_Trinity.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Westar Institute''', founded by [[Robert W. Funk]] in 1985, is a member-supported nonprofit educational institute with a twofold mission:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Westar|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/about/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* To foster collaborative, cumulative research in religious studies 
* To communicate the results of the scholarship of religion to a broad, non-specialist public  
Westar is located in [[Salem, Oregon]], on the campus of [[Willamette University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The institute has a publishing arm in the form of '''Polebridge Press''', which publishes books, media, and two journals:&lt;ref name="journals"&gt;{{cite web|
url= http://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/|
title = Westar Magazines|accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Forum'', an academic journal which publishes scholarly articles on the historical Jesus, Christian origins, and related fields.
*''The Fourth R,''a bimonthly magazine that publishes religious studies research in nontechnical language for at a general audience.

==Westar Organizational Structure==
Westar is managed by a Board of Directors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/about/westar-institute-board-of-directors/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/about/westar-institute-staff/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is divided into Associate Members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associate Members|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/associate-membership/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are members of the public, and Westar Fellows,&lt;ref name="Westar Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=Westar Fellows|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars in the field of religious studies or a cognate discipline. Associate membership provides ongoing support for the organization in the form of annual dues, and is open to anyone with an interest in religion. However, scholars must apply to become Fellows. To become a Fellow, a person must hold an "advanced academic degree (Ph.D. or equivalent) in religious studies or related disciplines with accredited universities worldwide."&lt;ref name="Westar Fellows"/&gt; While there is no required religious affiliation, Fellows do commit to the Ethos &amp; Protocol statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows Ethos &amp; Protocol|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/ethos-protocols/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes sharing historical-critical research with the public. The approach taken by the Westar Fellows to their research has drawn criticism from a number of directions. See '''Reactions to Westar''' below.

==Westar Activities==
Westar sponsors "large-scale, collaborative research projects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westar Projects|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/projects/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; called seminars on various topics in early Christian history. The first and most famous of these was the [[Jesus Seminar]] on the [[historical Jesus]], which lasted from 1985-1993. Other Westar seminars include the Paul Seminar, Acts of Apostles, Christian Origins, and, currently, the Christianity Seminar. While Scholars communicate throughout the year, twice annually they present papers at national meetings with a public audience. Meetings culminate in votes by both Fellows and Associate Members regarding specific historical assertions.

==Voting System==
The concept of voting on aspects of early Christian life and the accuracy of biblical sayings was not a unique innovation of Westar. Rather, it was based on "the disciplined work of Bible translation committees, a very traditional scholarly practice,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bessler|first=Joseph|title=A Scandalous Jesus: How Three Historic Quests Changed Theology for the Better|year=2013|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Salem, OR|isbn=978-1-59815-122-0|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Robert J.|title=The Jesus Seminar and Its Critics|year=1999|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Santa Rosa, CA|isbn=978-0944344781|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in turn on the more ancient Greek voting system that involved dropping colored beads into an urn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birth of Democracy|url=http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/the_verdict.html|work=American School of Classical Studies|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}} Westar Fellows vote as follows:
* RED: This information is virtually certain; it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and is accepted as historical. 
* PINK: This information is not certain but is probably reliable; it fits well with evidence that is verifiable and so is regarded as borderline historical. 
* GRAY: This information is possible but unreliable; it is not a clear fabrication but lacks supporting evidence and so is regarded as dubious. 
* BLACK: This information is improbable; it does not fit verifiable evidence or seems to be a fabrication and is regarded as nonhistorical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyson|first=Joseph|title=Acts and Christian beginnings : the acts seminar report|year=2013|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Salem, OR|isbn=978-1-59815-135-0|page=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Votes are weighted according to historicity. The higher the numerical value, the more historical weight is given to a piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/projects/the-jesus-seminar/voting/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from the Jesus Seminar, as recorded in seminar publication ''The Five Gospels'', include:
* RED: Parable of the Leaven (Matt 13:33)
* PINK: Parable of the Mustard Seed (Matt 13:31-32)
* GRAY: Parable of the Sabotage of Weeds (Matt 13:24-30)
* BLACK: Meaning of the Weeds Parable (Matt 13:37-43a)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funk|first=Robert|title=The Five Gospels|year=1996|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0060630409|pages=194–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to Westar==
Because of its emphasis on historical foundations over against dogmatic faith, Westar Institute has been criticized by evangelical and fundamentalist-leaning organizations. This criticism has appeared "almost from the moment that they published their first paper on the life and death of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="Critics of the Jesus Seminar FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Critics of the Jesus Seminar FAQ|url=http://www.allaboutreligion.org/critics-of-the-jesus-seminar-faq.htm|work=AllAboutReligion.org|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderators of the faith-based site AllAboutReligion.org provide a relevant example: "Critics of the Jesus Seminar [cry] foul because they say that the Jesus Seminar is not subjective in their findings. This criticism is based on the knowledge that the Jesus Seminar eliminates any evidence they cannot explained using modern scientific principles."&lt;ref name="Critics of the Jesus Seminar FAQ"/&gt; Indeed, as the Ethos &amp; Protocol statement of Westar Fellows indicates, the approach of all seminars sponsored by the institute is historical-critical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westar Ethos &amp; Protocols|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/ethos-protocols/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by definition incongruous with faith-based assertions.

Beyond online forums, books have been published that criticize the work of the Westar Institute, particularly the Jesus Seminar, from the above perspective. ''Reasons for Our Hope: An Introduction to Christian Apologetics'', published in 2011 by Wayne House and Dennis Jowers, serves as an example. As with the above-cited website, House and Jowers argue that the historical-critical approach of Fellows is problematic: "The starting point [of the Jesus Seminar] is a total rejection of the supernatural, a throwback to the first quest [of the historical Jesus]. ... Any miracle is considered a myth, added later to reflect later beliefs. Thus, there can be no virgin birth, walking on water, or resurrection. Before they even begin their work, the Jesus Seminar decided that anything in the Gospels that supports Jesus being more than just human cannot possibly be true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=House|first=Wayne|title=Reasons for Our Hope: An Introduction to Christian Apologetics|year=2011|publisher=B&amp;H Academic|isbn=978-0805444810|pages=319–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

House and Jowers describe Westar Institute as "a think tank set up by several liberal academics" and "radical critics of the Bible" among whom, House and Jowers claim on less credible terms, are "only a handful are well-known scholars in the field of New Testament studies" (319). In fact, most Westar Fellows are affiliated in some manner with leading organizations in the field of biblical studies and generally respected academic honors, as is evident in any survey of Fellow biographies on the Westar website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of Westar Fellows|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/fellows-directory/|work=Westar Institute|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, publications and activities of the Fellows frequently include involvement with the leading organization of biblical research, the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL). The SBL published an obituary for Westar founder Robert W. Funk in 2005, in which Funk is credited for his service as the Executive Secretary for the SBL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBL Obituary for Robert W. Funk|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?ArticleId=438|work=Society of Biblical Literature|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise another Westar Fellow, Daryl D. Schmidt, was remembered in an obituary on the site in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBL obituary for Daryl D. Schmidt|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=511|work=Society of Biblical Literature|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an article by John Dart, originally a paper presented at the 2006 SBL International Meeting in Edinburgh published in ''Forum,'' also in 2006, is featured on the SBL website. As Dart explains: "Unfortunately, there is built-in resistance to popularizing biblical research findings for the general public. First, it is believed that complex, nuanced scholarly arguments tend to get 'lost in translation' to readers and audiences unfamiliar with the terminology and background."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblical Research Findings for the Public|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=567|work=John Dart|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say Westar has escaped criticism from other scholars. "The most bitter and outspoken critic of the Seminar, Luke Timothy Johnson, published ''The Real Jesus: The Misguided Quest for the Historical Jesus and the Truth of the Traditional Gospels'' in 1996."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last = Bessler|first = Joseph|title = A Scandalous Jesus: How Three Historic Quests Changed Theology for the Better|year = 2013|publisher = Polebridge Press|location = Salem, OR|isbn = 978-1598151220|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|200}} To clarify, Johnson does not come from a fundamentalist perspective; he critiques that perspective as neither modern nor self-critical enough.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last = Johnson|first = Luke Timothy|title = The Real Jesus: The Misguided Quest for the Historical Jesus and the Truth of the Traditional Gospels|year = 1997|publisher = HarperOne|isbn = 978-0060641665|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|63}} Nevertheless, he problematizes the deeply unsettling experience of viewing the Bible through an historical-critical lens: "First-year students, who often come to seminary with deeply conservative convictions concerning the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture, are exposed at once to the 'shock therapy' of the historical critical method."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|64}} In the spirit of earlier theological perspectives of the twentieth century, Johnson focuses on the Christ of faith over against the Jesus of history as an appropriate focus of studies of Christian life.

Bessler, himself a Westar Fellow, describes Johnson's position as largely dependent on the approach of theologian Martin Kähler, among others, and responds critically to Johnson's criticism of the first-year theology students' experience of the historical method: "Can one also imagine, I wonder, the gall of professors in other graduate departments, in physics for example, or psychology, or cultural anthropology, 'forcing' their students to learn a methodology: How outrageous!"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|201}}

A more weighty criticism comes from feminist theologian [[Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza]] for "historical [[positivism]]."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schüssler Fiorenza|first=Elisabeth|title=Jesus and the Politics of Interpretation|journal=Harvard Theological Review|date=October 1997|volume=90|issue=4|page=345|doi=10.1017/s001781600003090x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Schüssler Fiorenza does not criticize the use of the historical-critical method, she does critique a lack of emphasis on the fact that all historical work is a form of re-construction which "must open up its historical models or patters to public reflection and critical scrutiny."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In other words, in spite of the highly public format of the Westar seminars, Schüssler Fiorenza advocates for greater involvement in explaining and opening methods up to public scrutiny.

Though [[Zen]] is said to be based on a "special transmission outside scriptures" which "did not stand upon words",{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=85-94}} the Zen-tradition has a rich doctrinal and textual background. It has been influenced by sutras such as the [[Lankavatara Sutra]],{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu|p=17}}{{sfn|Poceski}} the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=49-51}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=157-158}}{{sfn|Low|2000|p=83-112}} the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}} and the [[Lotus Sutra]].

Subsequently, the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching, including the [[Platform Sutra]],{{sfn|Poceski}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}} lineage charts, collected sayings of Zen-masters, and the koan-literature.

==The role of scripture in Zen==
Contrary to the popular image, literature does play a role in the Zen-training. ''Unsui'', Zen-monks, "are expected to become familiar with the classics of the Zen canon".{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=427}} A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Zen masters clearly reveals that they were well versed in numerous Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtras.{{sfn|Poceski}}

Nevertheless, Zen is often pictured as anti-intellectual.{{sfn|Low|2000}} This [[Zen#Zen narratives|picture of Zen]] emerged during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1297), when Chán became the dominant form of Buddhism in China, and gained great popularity among the educated and literary classes of Chinese society. The use of koans, which are highly stylized literary texts, reflects this popularity among the higher classes.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

In the tenth century, during the turmoil of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, regionally oriented schools with differing views on the Chán-identity developed. One view was that of ''jiaowai biechuan'', "a special transmission outside the teaching". The opposing view was ''jiaochan yizhi'', "the harmony between Chán and the teaching".{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=87}} The view of the harmony between Chán and the teachings was dominant in the lineage of Fa-ten Wen-i (885-958), and prevailed in the Southern Kingdoms in the tenth century.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-87}} Thereafter the notion of a "special transmission outside the teachings" became dominant.{{sfn|Welter|2000}}

The famous saying "do not establish words and letters", attributed in this period to Bodhidharma,{{sfn|Welter|2000}}
{{quote|...was taken not as a denial of the recorded words of the Buddha or the doctrinal elaborations by learned monks, but as a warning to those who had become confused about the relationship between Buddhist teaching as a guide to the truth and mistook it for the truth itself.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=94}}}}

The Chán of the [[Tang Dynasty]], especially that of [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]] and [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]] with its emphasis on "shock techniques", in retrospect was seen as a golden age of Chán.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} This picture has gained great popularity in the west in the 20th century, especially due to the influence of [[D.T. Suzuki]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} This picture has been challenged, and changed, since the 1970s by modern scientific research on Zen.{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|McRae|2005}}{{sfn|Heine|2007}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1991}}

The Zen tradition, especially Rinzai Zen, aims to give a direct transmission of insight, and stresses the impossibility of giving any positive statement of this insight.{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu}} This is famously worded in a 12th-century{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=102}} stanza, attributed to Bodhidharma:{{refn|group=note|According to Whalen Lai, this stanza "point[s] more directly to the Zen of the Hung-chou school" of Ma-tsu{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu}}}}
{{quote|A special transmission outside the scriptures,&lt;br&gt;
Not founded upon words and letters.{{refn|group=note|Whalen Lai translates this line as "No postulating (li) of (any positive) thesis in words"{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu}}}}&lt;br&gt;
By pointing directly to [one's] mind,&lt;br&gt;
It lets one see into [one's own true] nature and [thus] attain Buddhahood.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=85}}{{refn|group=note|In ''The Essential Determination'', a text by Chih-ta (d. 714), a student of Shen-hui, "contemplative analysis" is applied to a line from the Diamond Sutra:&lt;br&gt;"Should view the locus of non-being".&lt;br&gt;The text then proceeds:&lt;br&gt;Question: "What thing does one see?"&lt;br&gt;Answer: "The ''[[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra|[Nirvana]]] Sutra'' says: 'See the [[Buddha-nature|[Buddha]-nature]] and achieve the enlightenment of [[Buddhahood]]'."{{sfn|McRae|1991|p=270, footnote 81}}}}}}
An example of this non-dependence on words and scripture in 9th century China is Teshan (Tokusan 780-865).{{sfn|Sekida|1996|p=56}} He became famous for burning his commentaries on the Diamond sutra, when he realized that his attachment to these commentaries had become a stumbling block on his way to gaining insight.{{sfn|Sekida|1996|p=93-96}}{{refn|group=note|Tokusan is being mentioned in case 13 and 28 of the Mumonkan, and case 4 of the Blue Cliff Record{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}}}

Hisamatsu states it more bluntly:
{{quote|From the Zen perspective, scriptures are nothing but scraps of paper for wiping up filth.{{sfn|Hisamatsu|2002|p=24}}{{refn|group=note|This is a reference to the Record of Linji: Someone asked, "What about the state where ‘mind and Mind do not differ’?" The master said, "The instant you ask the question they are already separate, and essence differs from its manifestations. "Followers of the Way, make no mistake! All the dharmas of this world and of the worlds beyond are without self-nature. Also, they are without produced nature. They are just empty names, and these names are also empty. All you are doing is taking these worthless names to be real. That’s all wrong! Even if they do exist, they are nothing but states of dependent transformation, such as the dependent transformations of bodhi, nirvana, emancipation, the threefold body, the [objective] surroundings and the [subjective] mind, bodhisattvahood, and buddhahood. What are you looking for in these lands of dependent transformations! '''All of these, up to and including the Three Vehicles’ twelve divisions of teachings, are just so much waste paper to wipe off privy filth'''. The buddha is just a phantom body, the patriarchs just old monks.{{sfn|Sasaki|2009|p=221-222}}}}}}

Masao Abe points out that the role of the intellect in the understanding of Zen should not be misunderstood:
{{quote|It is clear that Zen is not a philosophy. It is beyond words and intellect and is not, as in the case of philosophy, a study of the processes governing thought and conduct, nor a theory of principles or laws that regulate people and the universe. For the realisation of Zen, ''practice is absolutely necessary''. Nevertheless, Zen is neither a mere anti-intellectualism nor a cheap intuitism nor is it an encouragement to animal-like spontaneity. Rather, it embraces a profound philosophy. Although intellectual understanding cannot be a substitute for Zen's awakening, practice without a proper and legitimate form of intellectual understanding is often misleading.{{sfn|Abe|1989|p=4}}}}

Arokiasamy warns against this
{{quote|... misleading notion about Awakening which holds that Zen and Awakening are non-intellectual [...] This arises not only from misconstruing the nature of language as merely literal, descriptive and representational but also misunderstanding the nature of Awakening as a literal seeing into reality as such".{{sfn|Arokiasamy|2005|p=155}}}}

The importance given to Zen's non-reliance on written words is also often misunderstood as an opposition to the study of Buddhist texts. However, Zen is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism{{sfn|Low|2000}}{{refn|group=note|Albert Low: "It is evident that the masters were well versed in the sutras. Zen master Tokusan, for example, knew the ''Diamond Sutra'' well and, before meeting with bhis own Zen master, lectured upon it extensively; the founder of the Zen sect, Bodhidharma, the very one who preached selfrealization outside the scriptures, nevertheless advocated the ''Lankavatara Sutra''; Zen master Hogen knew the ''Avatamsaka Sutra'' well, and koan twenty-six in the ''Mumonkan'', in which Hogen is involved, comes out of the teaching of that sutra. Other koans, too, make reference directly or indirectly to the sutras. The autobiography of yet another Zen master, Hui Neng, subsequently became the ''Platform Sutra'', one of those sutras so condemned by those who reject intellectual and sutra studies"{{sfn|Low|2000|p=4}}}}{{sfn|Poceski}}{{refn|group=note|Poceski: "Direct references to specific scriptures are relatively rare in the records of Mazu and his disciples, but that does not mean that they rejected the canon or repudiated its authority. To the contrary, one of the striking features of their records is that they are filled with scriptural quotations and allusions, even though the full extend of their usage of canonical sources is not immediately obvious and its discernment requires familiarity with Buddhist literature." See source for a full-length example from "one of Mazu's sermons", in which can be found references to the Vimalakīrti Scripture, the Huayan Scripture, the Mahāsamnipata-sūtra, the Foshuo Foming Scripture 佛說佛名經, the Lankāvatāra scripture and the Faju jing,{{sfn|Poceski}}}} and gradually developed its own literature. What the Zen tradition emphasizes is that enlightenment of the Buddha came not through conceptualization, but rather through direct insight:
{{quote|Despite its teaching of "no dependence upon words and letters," Chan did not reject the scriptures of the Buddhist canon, but simply warned of the futility of relying on them for the attainment of emancipating insight. The sacred texts — and much more so the huge exegetical apparatus that had grown up around them in the older scholastic schools — were regarded as no more than signposts pointing the way to liberation. Valuable though they were as guides, they needed to be transcended in order for one to awaken to the true intent of Śākyamuni’s teachings.{{sfn|Yanagida|2009|p=62}}}}

But direct insight has to be supported by study and understanding (''hori''{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=296}} of the Buddhist teachings and texts.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=295-297}} Hakuin goes as far as to state that the buddhist path even ''starts'' with study: 
{{quote|[A] person [...] must first gain wide-ranging knowledge, accumulate a treasure-store of wisdom by studying all the Buddhist sutras and commentaries, reading through all the classic works Buddhist and nonBuddhist and perusing the writings of the wise men of other traditions. It is for that reason the vow states "the Dharma teachings are infinite, I vow to study them all.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=42}}}}

Intellectual understanding without practice is called ''yako-zen'', [[Wild fox koan|"wild fox Zen"]], but "one who has only experience without intellectual understanding is a ''zen temma'', "Zen devil"".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=297}}

==Grounding Chán in scripture==
The early Buddhist schools in China were each based on a specific sutra. At the beginning of the [[Tang Dynasty]], by the time of the Fifth Patriarch [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] (601–674), the Zen school became established as a separate school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ferguson|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to ascertain its position,{{sfn|McRae|2003}} and to ground its teachings in a specific sutra. Various sutras were used for this, even before the time of Hongren: the [[Śrīmālādevī Sūtra]] (Huike),{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu|p=17}} [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]] (Daoxin),{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu|p=17}} the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] (East Mountain School),{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu|p=17}}{{sfn|Poceski}} the [[Diamond Sutra]]{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}} (Shenhui),{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu|p=17}} the [[Platform Sutra]].{{sfn|Poceski}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}} Subsequently, the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching.

Other influential sutras are the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=49-51}}{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=157-158}}{{sfn|Low|2000|p=83-112}} [[Avatamsaka Sutra]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=45-49}} the [[Shurangama Sutra]],{{sfn|Low|2000|p=135-154}} and the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahaparinirvana Sutra]].{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu}}

The growing Chán tradition also faced the challenge to put its teachings into words, to bolster its identity and to apply it in formal teaching settings, without losing the central insight into the [[Tathātā/Dharmatā|"suchness"]] of reality.{{sfn|Poceski}} One solution to this was the shift of emphasis from the recorded sayings of the historical Buddha, to the sayings of living Buddhas, namely the Chán masters.{{sfn|Buswell|1991}}{{sfn|Kasulis|2003}} In time, these sayings, from the so-called "encounter-dialogues" between masters and students, but also from sermons, became codified and formed the basis of typical Zen-genres, namely the "yü-lü" (recorded sayings) and the classic koan-collections. These too became formalised, and as such became a subject of disputes on the right way to teach Zen and the avoidance of dependence on words.{{sfn|Haskel|1984}}

==Influential sutras==

===Lankavatara Sutra===
In its beginnings in China, Zen primarily referred to the [[Mahayana Sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] and especially to the ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''. As a result, early masters of the Zen tradition were referred to as "Laṅkāvatāra masters". As the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' teaches the doctrine of the "One Vehicle" (Skt. ''[[Ekayana|Ekayāna]]''), the early Zen school was sometimes referred to as the "One Vehicle School".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|1967|p=29, note 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Zen is sometimes even referred to as simply the "Laṅkāvatāra school" (Ch. 楞伽宗, ''Léngqié Zōng'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005a|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts recording the history of this early period are to be found in ''Records of the Laṅkāvatāra Masters'' (Ch. 楞伽師資記, ''[[Léngqié Shīzī Jì]]'').

===Diamond Sutra===
During the [[Tang Dynasty]], the Zen school's central text shifted to the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Diamond Sūtra]]'' (''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra''). Thereafter, the essential texts of the Zen school were often considered to be the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' and the ''Diamond Sūtra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Huaijin|1997|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for this shift are not clear. Whalen Lai writes:
{{quote|Up to that point [Shenhui (670–762)], the school did not call itself Chan (meditation), a rather colorless name. It was in fact still looking for a name, and the custom then was to tie a new teaching to a sutra. Huike used the Srimala sutra, but Daoxin later drew inspiration from the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]]. Members of the [[East Mountain Teaching]], realizing that the Awakening of Faith was a sastra, came up with the next best; they conjured up a lineage of Lankavatara sutra masters, this being the sutra that informed the Awakening of Faith. Shenhui then perpetuated the myth that Huineng favored the Diamond Sutra. Actually, none of these labels really identifies the school’s ideological affiliation, because this tradition apparently never used one sutra to legitimize itself.{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu|p=17-18}}}}

Kalupahana does see a struggle to give clues to students about ultimate reality, without going back to scripture (e.g. the Lankavatara-sutra). According to him, the use of kung-an's served this role. {{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=231}} The prajnaparamita-sutras are a reaction against the early Buddhist philosophical schools, especially the realistic approach of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]],{{refn|group=note|The reaction against this realism of the Sarvastivadins, who held that "things do exist in a real sense [and] [p]ast and future also possess real existence",{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=93}} can be recognized in case 28 of the Mumonkan, on Tokusan and the Diamond Sutra: "The old woman said, "I hear it is said in that sutra, 'The past mind cannot be held, the present mind cannot be held, the future mind cannot be held.' Now, I would like to ask you, what mind are you going to have refreshed?""{{sfn|Sekida|1996|p=94}}}} and a return to the notion of non-substantiality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=43, note 12}} According to Kalupahana, also in Chán the use of...
{{quote|...the ''Vajracchedika'' represents an attempt to return to the Buddha's teaching, which were gradually becoming infested with absolute and transcendentalist metaphysics.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=232}}}}

===Vimalakirti Sutra===
The [[Vimalakirti Sutra]] is an early Mahayana Sutra dating from the second century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=49-51}} The sutra centers on the person of the householder Vimalakirti, who's being visited by various bodhisattvas while he's ill.

The Vimalakirti Sutra stresses that...
{{quote|[A]wakening by itself is not enough [...] [A]fter awakening more work remains to be done to perfect the awakening.{{sfn|Low|2000|p=86}}}}

The sutra is grounded on the prajnaparamita-teachings on emptiness.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=49-51}} This is the central theme in "the dialogue between the bodhisattvas and Vimalakirti on the subject of nonduality".{{sfn|Low|2000|p=109-112}} While discussing this subject, the bodhisattvas give a variety of answers. Manjusri is the last bodhisattva to answer, who says that "by giving an explanation they have already fallen into dualism". Vimalakirti, in his turn, answers with silence. {{sfn|Low|2000|p=109-112}}{{refn|group=note|This dialogue is being treated in case 84 of the [[Hekiganroku]]{{sfn|Low|2000|p=110}}}}

This silence became paradigmatic for the Chán-tradition:
{{quote|Thus are all Zen masters reluctant to express enlightenment, the condition of nonduality, in words or signs.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=51}}}}

===Avatamsaka Sutra===
The [[Avatamsaka Sutra]] is a compilation of sutras of various length. The earliest of these texts, the [[Ten Stages Sutra|Daśabhūmika Sūtra]], maybe dates from the first century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=46}} The Daśabhūmika Sūtra describes the ten stages on the [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-path]]. The various sutras were probably joined together shortly before its translation into Chinese, at the beginning of the 5th century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=46}}

The Avatamsaka ("garland", string of flowers) sutra integrates the teachings on [[sunyata]] and [[Yogacara|vijnaptimatra]] (mind-only).{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=46}} The [[Huayan school]], that originated in the same period as Chán, and influenced the Chán-school, was based on the Avatamsaka Sutra.

The basic idea of the Avatamsaka Sutra is the unity of the absolute and the relative:
{{quote|All in One, One in All. The All melts into a single whole. There are no divisions in the totality of reality [...] [I]t views the cosmos as holy, as "one bright pearl," the universal reality of the Buddha. The [[Dharmakaya|universal Buddhahood]] of all reality is the religious message of the Avatamsaka-sutra.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=46-47}}}}

Each part of the world reflects the totality of the cosmos:
{{quote|In each dust-mote of these worlds&lt;br&gt;
Are countless worlds and Buddhas...&lt;br&gt;
From the tip of each hair of Buddha's body&lt;br&gt;
Are revealed the indescribable Pure Lands...&lt;br&gt;
The indescribable infinite Lands&lt;br&gt;
All ensemble in a hair's tip [of Buddha].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=47}}}}

All levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of [[Indra's net]]. This "unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an [[Buddha-nature|inherent nature]] to anything".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=47}}

The Hua-yen school persistently influenced Chán. [[Guifeng Zongmi|Tsung-mi]], the Fifth Patriarch of the Hua-yen school, also occupies a prominent position in the history of Chán. During the Song, the Hua-yen metaphysics were completely assimilated by the Chán-school.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=48}}

The Avatamsaka Sutra is being referred to, directly or indirectly, in Chán-writings. [[Xinxin Ming|Xinxin Ming's]] ''Faith in mind'' is "in many passages [...] akin to the Avatamsaka sutra, especially the closing stanzas".{{sfn|Pajin|1988}} Tsung-mi's writings reflect his Hua-yen influences.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=48}}

==Zen literature==
The Zen-tradition developed a rich textual tradition, based on the interpretation of the Buddhist teachings and the recorded sayings of Zen-masters.

===Chinese texts===

====Hui-neng's Platform Sutra====
{{Main|Platform Sutra}}

Among the earliest of the specifically Zen texts, dating back to at least the 8th century, is the  ''Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch'', attributed to Huineng. It was constructed over a longer period of time, and contains different layers of writing.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} It is...
{{quote|...a wonderful melange of early Chan teachings, a virtual repository of the entire tradition up to the second half of the eighth century. At the heart of the sermon is the same understanding of the Buddha-nature that we have seen in texts attributed to Bodhidharma and Hingren, including the idea that the fundamental Buddha-nature is ''only'' made invisible to ordinary humans by their illusions".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=65-66}}}}

It contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren. According to the text, Huineng won this contest, but had to flee the monastery to avoid the rage of the supporters of Henxui. The story is not a factual account, but an 8th-century construction, probably by the so-called Oxhead School.

The Platform Sūtra cites and explains a wide range of Buddhist scriptures: the ''Diamond Sūtra'', the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'' (''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra''), the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana-sutra]], and the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahaparinirvana Sutra]].

====Transmission of the Lamp====
{{See also|Zen lineage charts}}

The Chán-tradition developed from the established tradition of "Canonical Buddhism",{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}} which "remained normative for all later Chinese Buddhism".{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}} It was established by the end of the sixth century, as a result of the Chinese developing understanding of Buddhism in the previous centuries.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177-184}}{{sfn|Lai: Ma-Tsu}} One of the inventions of this Canonical Buddhism were transmission lists, called "Transmission of the Lamp", a literary device to establish a lineage. Both [[Tiantai|T'ien Tai]] and Chán took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity:{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|McRae|p=2-9}}
{{quote|Chan texts present the school as Buddhism itself, or as ''the'' central teaching of Buddhism, which has been transmitted from the seven Buddhas of the past to the twenty-eight patriarchs, and all the generations of Chinese and Japanese Chan and Zen masters that follow.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}}}}

Another literary device for establishing those traditions was given by the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks), compiles around 530.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}} The Chán-tradition developed its own corpus in this genre, with works as ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's ''A History of Zen'' to be a modern example of this genre, disguised as scientific history.{{sfn|McRae|2005}}

Chán transmission records, teng-lu, were essential in shaping the identity of Chán.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=82-86}} The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp (Ching-te ch'uan-teng lu), compiled by Tao-yün and published in 1004, introduced several of the key elements of the Chán-tradition.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=83}} Another key text is the "Record of the Extensive Transmission [of the Lamp] compiled during the T'ien-sheng era" (''T'ien-sheng kuang-teng lu''), compiled by Li Tsun-hsü and published in 1036, which clearly introduced the idea of "a special transmission outside the teaching".{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=80}} Until the T'ien-sheng kuang-teng lu, Chán was viewed as a teaching in harmony with the Buddhist scriptural tradition.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86}} In the tenth century, during the turmoil of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, regionally oriented schools with differing views on the Chán-identity developed. One view was that of ''chiao-wai pieh-ch'uan'', "a special transmission outside the teaching". The opposing view was ''chiao-ch'an i-chih'', "the harmony between Chán and the teaching".{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=87}} The view of the harmony between Chán and the teachings was dominant in the lineage of Fa-ten Wen-i (885-958), and prevailed in the Southern Kingdoms in the tenth century.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-87}}

The original preface to the Ching-te ch'uan-teng lu by Tao-yüan reflects this Fa-yen position of harmony with the teachings. It was replaced by an introduction by Yang I, which emphasised "a special practice outside the teaching":{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=92-93}}
{{quote|According to Tao-yüan, "[Bodhidharma] did not make a display of verbal expressions [pu-shih yü-yen], and did not establish words and letters [pu-li wen-tzu]." According to Yang I, [Bodhidharma taught]: do not establish words and letters [pu-li wen-tzu], directly point to the source of mind [ch'ih-chih shin-yüan]; do not engage in gradual methods [pu-chien chieh-ti], attain Buddhahood immediately [ching-teng fo-ti].{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=93}}}}

The differences go back to the interpretation of the Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices, a text attributed to Bodhidharma. In this text, the "entrance by principle" (li-ju) is characterized in two ways:
{{quote|Entrance by principle is said to "awaken one to the truth [wu-tsung] in accordance with [scriptural] teaching [chi-chiao]." Later, after realizing true nature [chen-hsing], one is said to "reside fixedly, without wavering, never again to be swayed by written teachings [wen-chiao]."{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=93}}}}

The first statement can be seen as a support of the harmony between the teachings and Chán. The second statement can be seen as a support of a "special transmission outside the teachings".{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=93}}

====Recorded Sayings and Encounter Dialogue====
From the "question-and-answer format that had been developed as a means of conveying Buddhist teachings" developed the "yü-lü" genre,{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=192}} the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues. The best-known example is the "[[Linji Yixuan#External links|Lin-ji yü-lü]]".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://info.stiltij.nl/publiek/meditatie/leraren/_historisch/linji-sasaki.pdf Translation of the Lin-ji yü-lü by Fuller-Sasaki]&lt;/ref&gt; These recorded sayings are not verbatim recordings of the sayings of the masters, but well-edited texts, written down up to 160 years after the supposed sayings and meetings.{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}}

====Linji yulu====
{{See also|Linji school}}

The ''Linji yulu'' ("Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi yulu") is the seminal text of the Linji and Rinzai school. It contains the recorded sayings attributed to [[Linji Yixuan]] (d. 866). It was published in 1120, but developed in a period stretching from 952 to 1120.{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}} The first mention of Linji is in the ''Zutang ji'' (祖堂集 "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall), compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death.{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}} The ''Jingde Chuangdeng lu'' (景德傳燈錄 "[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]"), compiled in 1004 by Daoyuan, gives brief biographical information on Lijni, followed by Linji's interactions with Hunagbo, to strengthen the claim of Linji's descendancy form Hunagbo and the Mazu-lineage.{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}} The ''Tiansheng Guangdeng lu'' (天聖廣燈錄), "Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗)(988-1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the [[Hongzhou school]] of [[Mazu Daoyi]], displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage.{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}} It also established the slogan of "a special transmission outside the teaching", supporting the Linji-school claim of "Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings".{{sfn|Young|2009}} The ''Sijia yulu'', ("Discourse Records of the Four Masters"), compiled 1066-1069 by Huanglong Huinan (1002–1069), contains the discourse records of [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788), [[Baizhang Huaihai]] (720–814), [[Huangbo Xiyun]] (died 850) and Linji, the major patriarchs of the Tang Dynasty according to the Linji faction. In this text, Linji is explicitly placed in line with these teachers of the [[Hongzhou school]].{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}} The ''Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi yulu'' ("The record of Linji"), compiled by Yuanjue Zongan in 1120, is the classic version of the record of Linji. Yuanjue Zongan belonged to the Yunmen-faction, and also re-issued the ''Yunmen yulu'', the "Discourse Records of Yunmen".{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}} The separate publication of Linji's records signals the newly acquired status of Linji as one of Chán's major patriarchs.{{sfn|Welter: Linji lu}}

====Koan-collections====
{{Main|Koan}}

The "encounter dialogue"-genre developed into various collections of ''[[kōan]]s'', which form itself another extensive literary corpus.

Koan practice developed from a literary practice, styling snippets of encounter-dialogue into well-edited stories. It arose in interaction with "educated literati".&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 131"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were dangers involved in such a literary approach, such as fixing specific meanings to the cases.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 131"/&gt; Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the Blue Cliff Record, for the hindrance it had become to study of Chán by his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003a|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two best known koan-collections (in the West) are the "Gateless Gate" and the "Blue Cliff Record". ''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (Chinese: 無門關 Wumenguan; Japanese: Mumonkan) is a collection of 48 kōans and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk [[Wumen]] (無門) (1183–1260). The title may be more accurately rendered as ''Gateless Barrier'' or ''Gateless Checkpoint''). The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: 碧巖錄 Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku) is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (圜悟克勤 1063–1135).

===Japanese texts===
The Japanese Zen-tradition also developed a corpus of its own. During the Tokugawa-period [[Dōgen|Dōgen's]] ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'' became the authoritative text of the Soto-school. In the Rinzai-school, the koan-curricula were systematized by dharma-heirs of [[Hakuin]], who himself produced an extended corpus of written texts.

====Dogen's Shōbōgenzō====
During the Tokugawa-period the Soto-school started to place a growing emphasis on textual authority. In 1615 the [[bakufu]] declared that "Eheiji's standards (''kakun'') must be the rule for all Soto monks".{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=450}} In time this came to mean all the writings of Dogen, which thereby became the normative source for the doctrines and organisation of the Soto-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=450}}

A key factor in this growing emphasis on Dogen was Manzan's appeal to change the rules for [[dharma transmission]], based on arguments derived from the Shōbōgenzō.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=450}} Another reformation was implemented by [[Gento Sokuchu]] (1729–1807), who tried to purify the Soto-school of the use of [[koan]]s.{{sfn|Heine|2000|p=245}} Gento Sokuchu implanted new regulations, based on Dogen's regulations.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006}}

This growing status of Dogen as textual authority also posed a problem for the Soto-school:
{{quote|The Soto hierarchy, no doubt afraid of what other radical reformers might find in Dogen's ''Shobo Genzo'', a work open to a variety of interpretations, immediately took steps to restrict access to this traditional symbol of sectarian authority. Acting at the request of the Soto prelates, in 1722 the government prohibited the copying or publication of any part of ''Shobo Genzo''.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=450}}}}

During the [[Meiji Restoration]], the memory of Dōgen was used to ensure [[Eihei-ji]]'s central place in the Soto-organisation, and "to cement closer ties with lay people". In 1899 the first lay ordination ceremony was organized in Eihei-ji.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006}} Eihei-ji also promoted the study of Dōgen's works, especially the Shōbōgenzō, which changed the view of Dōgen in Soto's history.{{sfn|Bodiford|2006}}

====Zenshū Shiburoku====
The Zenshū Shiburoku, ''The Four Texts of the Zen Sect'', is a collection of four essential Zen texts which are being used in Japan as introductory texts in the education of novice Zen monks. The collection consists of the ''Jūgyūzu'' ([[Ten Bulls|Ten Oxherding Pictures]]), the ''Shinjinmei'' ([[Xinxin Ming|Faith in mind]]), attributed to the third Chinese Chán-patriarch [[Sengcan]], the ''Shōdōka'' ([[Song of Enlightenment]]), attributed to [[Yongjia Xuanjue]], and the ''Zazengi'' (The Principles of Zazen), written by [[Dogen]].{{sfn|Mumon|2004|p=xv}}{{refn|group=note|James Ismael Ford adds two more titles to this list: the ''[[Sandokai]]'' (Identity of Relative and Absolute) by [[Shitou Xiqian]], and the ''Song of the Jeweled Mirror Samadhi'' by Dongshan Liangjia.&lt;ref group=web name=Ford&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2007/08/eight-essential-and-brief-zen-texts.html James Ford (2007), ''Eight Essential (and Brief) Zen Texts'']&lt;/ref&gt; See [http://boundlesswayzen.org/liturgy.pdf Boundless Zen Liturgy] for a translation.}}
