[[File:MonolitoMussolini.JPG|thumb|The ''Monolito'' at the ''Foro Italico'']]

The '''Academia della Farnesina''', also known as the '''Accademia fascista maschile di educazione fisica''' or '''Accademia fascista della Farnesina''', was a center for sport and political education in fascist Italy.

== The Fascist School of Physical education ==
The school opened on 5 February 1928.&lt;ref&gt;''L’inaugurazione della Scuola Superiore di Educazione Ginnico-Sportiva'', in «Bollettino quindicinale dell'Opera Nazionale Balilla», 15 febbraio 1928, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially housed in the Military Academy of Physical Education, the Institute moved to its final seat at [[Foro Italico|Foro Mussolini]] in November 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Comitato dei monumenti moderni, ''Il Foro Italico'', Clear, Roma, 1990; M. Caporilli e F. Simeoni, ''Il Foro Italico e lo Stadio olimpico: immagini dalla storia'', Tomo edizioni, Roma, 1990; A. Greco A. e S. Santuccio, ''Foro Italico'', Multigrafica, Roma, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute had an essential aim: to train the Physical Education teachers of the Italian schools and the sport instructors of the [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] (ONB). However, the lack of youth leaders obliged [[Renato Ricci]], president of the ONB, to partially change the aims of the Institute. As a consequence, the school became the most important center for training the male leadership of the Fascist Youth Organisations.

== The ONB ==
Study at the Farnesina lasted two years. After students obtained their certificate, they attended a nine-month apprenticeship. After that, they were permanently hired by the [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]]. During the course the students played many sports and gymnastic activities and attended many classes like, for example, anatomy, physiology, first aid, traumatology, hygiene, psychology, fascist laws, philosophy, pedagogy, history of physical education, art, singing, French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Delibera di Ricci del 30 marzo 1928, in Archivio Centrale dello Stato, Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri, 1928-1930, 1.1.15, 2104, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; One year after its inauguration, the school changed its name to "Accademia fascista di educazione fisica" (Fascist academy of physical education"). Ricci wanted it to be «the biggest educational experiment» ever tried in order to create the ''new man''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ricci, ''Prefazione'', in A. Pica, ''Il Foro Mussolini'', 1937, Bompiani, Milano, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute had to guarantee to the Fascist Youth Organisation the educators and leaders it needed.

Since 1929 being members of the [[Fascist Party]] became essential to apply for a post at the school. The applicants were chosen taking into consideration the years spent in the Fascist organisations. Also the syllabi at the school changed. All the subjects, considered necessary in order to train from a political point of view the future leaders of the Youth Organisations, became more and more important. To the former students of the school were assigned different roles according to the capacities showed during the course. Some of them became teachers in the schools, others, the most suitable ones from a political point of view, became youth leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. ''Attività svolta dall’Opera Nazionale Balilla nell’anno VII'', in ''La Scuola Fascista'', 17 novembre 1929, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Two laws stated clearly the organisation and the aims of the Foro Mussolini Institute: the royal decree 1.227 of 28 August 1931 and the royal decree 1.592 of 31 August 1933. According to such legislative measures the school had to be a center to train and select the Fascist Youth leadership.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasetti, ''Nuove ondate di giovinezza sotto il segno del Littorio'', in ''Almanacco fascista del «Popolo d’Italia»'', 1934, pp. 352-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The GIL ==
In 1937 the Fascist Youth Organisation became a party organisation and changed its name, from [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] to [[Gioventù Italiana del Littorio]] (GIL). Consequently, the school also had to be reorganised. In April 1938 the General Command of the [[Gioventù Italiana del Littorio|GIL]] appointed two commissions. Their aim was to draft new Statutes and new syllabi for the Fascist Academies of Rome and [[Orvieto]].&lt;ref&gt;The Accademia Nazionale Femminile di Educazione Fisica ("national academy of female physical education") opened in [[Orvieto]] in 1932, a female equivalent of the Farnesina. It trained the physical education teachers and the leaders of the Fascist female youth organisations.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the lines drawn by the two commissions, the Italian Parliament promulgated a new law, no. 866 of 22 May 1939, which ordered both institutes until the end of the fascist regime. The Foro Mussolini Institute changed its name to "Accademia della GIL". The Farnesina depended on the Fascist Party directly rather than, as before, on the [[Ministry of National Education (Italy)|Ministry of National Education]]. It became an educational centre closely tied to the Party. The courses now lasted for three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Discorso del Rettore Senatore Prof. Dott. Riccardo Versari all’inaugurazione dell’IX anno accademico dell’Accademia della GIL al Foro Mussolini il 6 novembre XVIII'', Roma, 1940, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the German language became compulsory in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 11 decreto del Capo del Governo, 1 febbraio 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects were divided into four sections: political, military, biological-scientific and sport.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. M. Di Donato, ''L’evoluzione storica della formazione del personale insegnante di educazione fisica in Italia (1847-1943)'', in «Alcmeone», nn. 5-6, 1985, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other Italian Institutes, the degrees of the Academy were awarded not in the name of the King, but in the name of the [[Duce]].

To become a student at the Academy, it was necessary to pass a public selection and to demonstrate to be deserving from a moral, political, racial, personal and family point of view. The applications were not sent by young people themselves, but by the local commands of the Youth organisation. These selected the applicants they found most suitable to attend the school.&lt;ref&gt;PNF, Gioventù del Littorio, ''Accademie, Collegi e scuole, Bando di concorso anno XVIII–XIX'', Roma, anno XVIII, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1938 racial purity became an essential requirement and Jewish students were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;''Accademia della GIL'', Roma, s.d., pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 1940 [[Riccardo Versari]], who had been chancellor of the school since its foundation, left his seat to [[Nicola Pende]], father of the Italian [[Somatotype and constitutional psychology]] and one of the scientists who wrote down the [[Manifesto of Race]]. He tried in vain to transform the schools in Rome and Orvieto into universities.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ponzio, ''La Palestra del Littorio. L’Accademia della Farnesina: un esperimento di pedagogia totalitaria nell’Italia fascista'', Milano, Franco Angeli, 2009, pp. 141-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-regime ==
After the end of the Fascist regime on 25 July 1943, the [[Gioventù Italiana del Littorio|GIL]] was dissolved and the schools were closed. In the [[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica Sociale Italiana]] (RSI), [[Renato Ricci]] created a new youth organisation known as [[Opera Balilla]]. He also founded once again the male and female academies respectively in [[Gallarate]] and in [[Castiglione Olona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', pp. 220-232.&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, many students, who couldn't finish the courses at the Fascist academies, asked to complete their training and to get the final degree. As a consequence, the Parliament approved in 1950 the law number 415. It stated that it was necessary to organise some courses so that the former students, who had to stop attending the academies, could pass the final exams. This law gave the possibility to many students, first of all those expelled for racial reasons, to finish their courses. The law stated also that the courses organised in the RSI and the degrees granted by the academies of [[Gallarate]] and [[Castiglione Olona]] were not to be acknowledged by the Italian democratic state.&lt;ref&gt;Approvato il disegno di legge per la sistemazione degli ex allievi delle Accademie di EF, in «Educazione fisica-Organo ufficiale dell’associazione nazionale di e.f.», 15 maggio 1950, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February 1951 the [[High Council of Public Education]] approved the regulation for the organisation of the courses that took place in Rome from 1951 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''Notiziario di educazione fisica'', in «Educazione fisica-Organo ufficiale dell’associazione nazionale di e.f.», 24 maggio 1951, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; To guarantee the training of the physical education teachers of the Italian democratic republic it was opened in Rome the [[Istituto Superiore di Educazione Fisica]] (ISEF) (or High Institute for Physical Education) in 1953. Only on 25 January 1967 the Institute obtained a final seat at the former [[GIL Music Academy]] located at the [[Foro Italico]] (former ''Foro Mussolini'').&lt;ref&gt;Cfr.

'''''Big Pharma''''' is a simulation game developed by Twice Circled and published by [[Positech Games]] where one builds a drug factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Pharma|url=http://www.bigpharmagame.com/|website=Big Pharma Game|publisher=Paradox Games|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was released on 27 August 2015.

==Game mechanics==
[[File:Big Pharma (Video Game) Drug Factory, October 10, 2015.png|thumb|left|An example of a factory with multiple production lines.]]
In ''Big Pharma'' the player takes the role as the manager of a pharmaceutical company, producing prescription drugs from raw materials. Raw materials have intrinsic positive (e.g., "Reduces coughs") and negative (e.g., "Induces drowsiness") effects that present themselves when the material is within a set [[concentration]] range, with possible concentrations ranging on a 0-to-20 scale. Most of the positive benefits can be enhanced to more desirable effects, or negative side effects can be outright removed, by bringing the material to a specific concentration range and applying an indicated process, some further requiring the addition of a [[catalyst]] material which itself carries positive and negative effects. Materials can also be mixed to combine positive and negative benefits to create more potent drugs. The goal in the mixing and preparation of materials is to achieve drugs that have their positive effects as close to their maximum potency concentration while either eliminating side effects or bringing the material's concentration as far away from the side effects' maximum potency levels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wicksteed|first1=Tim|title=How to Play|url=http://www.bigpharmagame.com/howtoplay.html|website=Big Pharma|publisher=Positech Games|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player produces the drugs using an assembly line approach with various equipment that can modify the concentration of the material, combine materials, rearrange the effects of a material to determine how effects combine when mixed, analyze materials to determine maximum potency levels, and finally prepare the material in pill form for delivery. This is done on an [[isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] view of building plant floorplan, with various ports along the edges that can be used to bring in materials or ship out completed drugs. Materials are transported via conveyor belts between the processing units. Added building space can be purchased with in-game funds. The player can click on processes or materials to evaluate their current state, thus giving them the ability to debug the production line. Once the player has produced a complete pill from specific materials for the first time and delivered it to an output port, they are given the opportunity to name the product. This product is then sold on the game's virtual market. The produce is rated on a letter-grade based on the effectiveness and lack of side-effects as well as current market demand. The production lines operate in real-time - in that while the player can pause the game to arrange equipment within a production line, the game while running tracks the movement of each unit of material through the production line and only considered each unit as a product when it reaches the end of the production line.

In the larger game, the player must build up these drug production lines to maintain a profit and allow them to build additional lines. Scenarios in the game include competing companies that will also be releasing prescription drugs that will impact the profitability of the player's products. For example, if other companies have released a cold remedy drug, the market may be too saturated for a better cold remedy to succeed. The player can review what market demand there is for specific remedies to tailor productions toward those goals. In addition, the player can manage a [[technology tree|research tree]] that enables more effective process equipment and other benefits to be built, and send out explorers to research on new possible ingredients to build from. The game includes a number of preset scenarios (such as reached a financial milestone after a number of years of operation) at various difficulty levels as well as the ability to create a custom open-ended game.

An expansion, "Marketing And Malpractice", was released on 26 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/458640 | title =  Big Pharma: Marketing and Malpractice | first =  | last =  | date = April 26, 2016 | accessdate = April 30, 2016 | work = [[Steam (software)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion will add Executives as part of the company which can be used to market the drugs produced by the player's production lines, as well as to try to manipulate and corner the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/31/big-pharma-expansion-malpractice-manipulation/| title =  Big Pharma Expansion Adds Malpractice &amp; Manipulation | first = John | last = Walker | date = March 31, 2016 | accessdate = March 31, 2016 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21478">A '''book club''' is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have [[reading (activity)|read]] and express their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a '''book club''', a term that is also used to describe a [[book sales club]], which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion club include '''reading group''', '''book group''', and '''book discussion group'''. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, [[library|libraries]], [[bookstore]]s, online forums, pubs, and in cafés or restaurants over meals or drinks.

A practice also associated with book discussion, '''common reading program''' or '''common read''', involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.

== Single-title clubs ==
A single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.

There may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.

== Multi-title clubs ==
The characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.

=== Open loans ===
Open loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.

=== Catch and release ===
Catch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with [[BookCrossing]]. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.

==Library book clubs==
Many [[public library|public libraries]] lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis.  A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book.  Copies of the book are available to either be checked out or signed out for the group meeting.  If leading a book discussion group outside of the facility,  often libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned out of the library to a single patron.  Also, the lending period is typically longer than for the average book.  The kits also contains a suggested reading guide with discussion questions.  This is a convenience as everyone in the group is not forced to buy a copy of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes, V., Hill, M.A., &amp; Frisbee, J. L. (2008). Reviving literary discussion: Book club to go kits. ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly, 48''(1), 30-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians also aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to withhold multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Many librarians note the positive influence of [[Google+]] hangouts and [[Skype]] to host meetings for long distance club members and for times in which all members could not attend the club. Librarians have helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their community.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliss, A. F. (2014). A novel idea: librarians reimagine book clubs with the help of technology. American Libraries, (5). 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online clubs ==
With the challenge that not all members of a club can regularly meet at an appointed place and time, a new form of book clubs has emerged online. Online clubs exist in the shape of [[Internet forum]]s, [[Yahoo Groups]], e-mail [[mailing list]]s, dedicated websites, such as Goodreads.com,&lt;ref&gt;Goodreads. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.goodreads.com/group&lt;/ref&gt; apps such as [http://novellic.com Novellic] and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of [[social networks]], these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.

== Author led clubs ==
In 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club "[http://www.12booksgroup.com 12 Books]." Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live [[conference call]] or [[webinar]].

== Broadcast clubs ==
A broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:

* "[[Oprah's Book Club]]", a segment of the American television show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]]
* "[[Book Club of the Air]]", a segment of [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s American radio show ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' hosted by [[Ray Suarez]]
* "Good Morning America Book Club", a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s American television show ''[[Good Morning America]]''
* "Despierta Leyendo (Wake Up Reading)", a segment of [[Univision]]'s American Spanish-language television show ''[[¡Despierta América!]] (Wake Up America)'' hosted by [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]]
* "[[Richard &amp; Judy#Richard .26 Judy Book Club|Richard &amp; Judy Book Club]]", a segment of [[Channel 4]]'s British television show ''[[Richard &amp; Judy]]'' hosted by [[Richard and Judy|Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan]]
* ''[[Bookclub (radio)|Bookclub]]'', a British radio show on the [[BBC Radio 4]] station hosted by [[James Naughtie]]
* ''[[First Tuesday Book Club]]'', an Australian television show on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] network hosted by [[Jennifer Byrne]]
* "Jonny's Book Club", a segment of the weekly [[podcast]] ''[[Gay Pimpin' with Jonny McGovern]]'' hosted by [[Jonny McGovern]]

== Book reading clubs ==
Given the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional 'book club' is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group [[Reading (process)#History|reads the book out loud]] while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the "homework" of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.

The '''Central Board of Secondary Education''' ('''CBSE''') is a national level [[Boards of Education in India|board of education in India]] for public and private schools, controlled and managed by [[Union Government of India]]. CBSE has asked all schools affiliated to follow only NCERT curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/only-ncert-books-at-all-cbse-schools/articleshow/57174456.cms|title=Only NCERT books at all CBSE schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 19,316 schools in India and 211 schools in 25 foreign countries affiliated to the CBSE.&lt;ref name=cbse:1/&gt;

==History==
The first education board to be set up in [[India]] was the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, which was under jurisdiction of [[Rajputana]], Central India and [[Gwalior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History (and the Expansion) of the Central Board of Secondary Examination |url=http://www.studypost.com/history-expansion-central-board-secondary-examination|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=studypost.com|date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the government of India  set up a joint Board named "Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana". This included [[Ajmer]], Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. Later it was confined to [[Ajmer]], [[Bhopal]] and [[Vindhya]] Pradesh.  In 1952, it became the "Central Board of Secondary Education".

==Affiliations==
CBSE affiliates all [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]s, all [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]]s, private schools and most of the schools approved by [[central government of India]].

==Examinations==
CBSE conducts the final examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 every year in the month of March. The results are announced by the end of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBSE Results Announcement Dates: Class 12 on May 25, Class 10 on May 27|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/05/cbse-results-announcement-dates-class-12-on-may-25-class-10-on-may-27/|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board earlier conducted the [[All India Engineering Entrance Examination|AIEEE]] Examination for admission to undergraduate courses in engineering and architecture in colleges across India. However the AIEEE exam was merged with the IIT-Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) in 2013. The common examination is now called JEE(Main). 

CBSE also conducts [[AIPMT]] (All India Pre Medical Test) for admission to major medical colleges in India. In 2014, the conduct of the National Eligibility Test for grant of junior research fellowship and eligibility for assistant professor in institutions of higher learning was outsourced to CBSE.&lt;ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE" /&gt;
Apart from these tests, CBSE also conducts the central teachers eligibility test and the Class X optional proficiency test.&lt;ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/After-UGCs-failure-CBSE-to-conduct-NET/articleshow/38950641.cms | title=After UGC's failure, CBSE to conduct NET | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the addition of NET in 2014, the CBSE has become the largest exam conducting body in the world.&lt;ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NET to be held under CBSE’s watch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/net-to-be-held-under-cbses-watch/article6240205.ece | title=NET to be held under CBSE’s watch | publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2017, Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared a proposal for creation of a National Testing Agency (NTA) which will conduct various entrance examinations. Currently, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducts Joint Engineering Entrance (JEE) Exam, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), Central Teacher Eligibility Test (twice a year) UGC’s National Eligibility Test (twice a year) and the entrance test for Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas.

== Promotion criteria ==

=== Class 10 ===
For promotion from Secondary (Class 10) to Senior Secondary (Class 11-12), a student must obtain, for all subjects (or best 5 if 6 subjects are taken),

33% overall, &lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt; any minimum theory mark requirement. 

Originally, the passing criteria was set such that a student had to get 33% in ''both'' the theory and practical components. However, an exemption was initially granted for students writing the exam in 2018 as they went through the old CCE system in the previous year &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/cbse-revises-pass-percent-for-current-class-10-batch/story-SySB8BLlILo4CozRrZ2siL.html|title=CBSE says overall 33% marks enough to pass Class 10 this year|date=2018-02-27|work=hindustantimes.com|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, CBSE later extended this relief for students writing the exam from 2019 and later as well &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/cbse-eases-class-10-passing-marks-criteria-as-combined-marks-extended-from-2019-board-exams-1906675.html|title=CBSE Eases Class 10 Passing Marks Criteria as Combined Marks Extended from 2019 Board Exams|work=News18|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For a student who does not manage to pass up to two subjects, he/she can write the compartment in those subjects in July. For those who fail the compartment, or those who fail in three subjects or more, he/she must rewrite all the subjects taken in the next year.

=== Class 12 ===
33% overall, with 33% in '''both''' theory and practical components (if available).

For a student who does not manage to pass in exactly one subject, he/she can write the compartment for that subject in July. For those who fail the compartment, or those who fail in two subjects or more, he/she must rewrite all the subjects taken in the next year.

== Grading ==
For the Class 10 and Class 12 exams, CBSE (along with the marks obtained) includes the ''positional'' grade obtained by the student, which is dependent on the average performance of the students in that subject. Consequently, the cutoffs required to obtain a particular grade vary every year.

=== During CCE ===
During 2010-2017, when CBSE implemented a CCE (Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation) for grade 10 students, only the grades obtained by the student were mentioned in the report card in a 9-point grading scale, which translates as below:

== Moderation ==
It is the practice adopted by CBSE of 'tweaking' candidates' marks to account for paper difficulties and variations. This has been criticized in the past for inflating students' marks in a hyper-competitive society where even one mark counts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/cbse-result-2018-the-curious-case-of-magic-mark-95-1744071.html|title=CBSE Result 2018: The Curious Case of 'Magic Mark 95'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and CBSE is in the process of ending it. In 2017, CBSE informed that it would end moderation entirely, but was hit with a court case and the Delhi High Court ruled that moderation should continue for that year &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/cbse-moderation-row-board-awarded-up-to-11-grace-marks-in-this-years-class-12th-exams-3508967.html|title=CBSE moderation row: Board awarded up to 11 extra marks in this year's Class 12th exams - Firstpost|website=www.firstpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Till 2018, moderation was applied to account for variations in region sets (as then students in different regions would be answering different question papers). Since 2018, when everyone around the world answers the same questions, this practice was renamed as ''standardisation,'' with the CBSE gradually phasing out the practice with the reduction on subjects which were given the offset.

In 2018, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Accountancy were given offset of +9, Business Studies given +6, and English given a +3 offset. 

The total mark obtained by a student through moderation cannot exceed 95; if so, it is ''capped'' at 95 unless the student's actual mark is 96 or more. This is the reason a mark of 95 is relatively common for such subjects, and why it is ''much'' tougher to get 96 than to get a 95.

Moderation was also applied in the infamous CBSE Class 12 mathematics papers of 2015 and 2016, wherein the paper created a huge furore as students and teachers complained that the paper was too tough&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/How-was-the-CBSE-Class-12-Mathematics-paper-for-2016|title=How was the CBSE Class 12 Mathematics paper for 2016? - Quora|website=www.quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/03/16/cbse-maths-paper_n_9474882.html|title=A CBSE Math Paper So Tough, It Made Students Cry|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite a reportedly heavy offset of +16 (+15 for Delhi) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-with-no-more-marks-moderation-cbse-class-xii-results-du-cutoffs-likely-to-dip-381995|title=With no more ‘marks moderation’, CBSE Class XII results likely to dip; will bring down DU cutoffs|date=18 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, students' marks reduced (especially for 2016), as while the A1 cutoff was stable (90), the A2 cutoff reduced to 77, with other grades also experiencing a dip in cutoff.

Moderation can also take the form of giving ''grace'' marks to enable students who have scored near the pass mark to pass. This is the reason marks between 25 and 33 are unheard of in subjects like Mathematics, and also explains why the difference between D1 and D2 cutoff is sometimes very small.
==2018 question paper leak==
In March 2018, there were reports that CBSE Class 10 mathematics and Class 12 economics question papers were leaked.&lt;ref name=et63513943&gt;{{cite news|title=CBSE paper leak: Board announces re-exam; HRD initiates probe|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cbse-orders-re-exam-of-class-xii-economics-class-x-mathematics-papers/articleshow/63513943.cms|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=[[The Economic Times]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=28 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330024853/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cbse-orders-re-exam-of-class-xii-economics-class-x-mathematics-papers/articleshow/63513943.cms|archivedate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, CBSE announced that these exams will be cancelled and re-exams will be conducted.&lt;ref name=et63513943 /&gt; However, CBSE later announced that there will be no re-exam for Class 10 mathematics paper because the paper leak may have been confined to a few alleged beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="NDTV_1832343"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Shihabudeen Kunju S|title=No Re-Exam For Class 10 Maths Paper: CBSE|url=https://www.ndtv.com/education/cbse-class-10-maths-re-exam-internal-inquiries-indicate-few-beneficiaries-no-re-exam-1832343|accessdate=8 April 2018|work=[[NDTV]]|date=3 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404045230/https://www.ndtv.com/education/cbse-class-10-maths-re-exam-internal-inquiries-indicate-few-beneficiaries-no-re-exam-1832343|archivedate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2018, Rakesh Kumar (an economics teacher) and two other employees of a private school in [[Una, Himachal Pradesh]] were arrested for leaking the Class 12 economics paper.&lt;ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sikdar|first1=Shubhomoy|title=How a Punjab housewife led Delhi cops to source of CBSE Economics paper leak|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/how-a-punjab-housewife-led-delhi-cops-to-source-of-cbse-economics-paper-leak/story-8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP.html|accessdate=8 April 2018|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=8 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408110406/https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/how-a-punjab-housewife-led-delhi-cops-to-source-of-cbse-economics-paper-leak/story-8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP.html|archivedate=8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the police, Rakesh Kumar had gone inside the strong room of a bank to pick up packets of computer science question papers but also picked up a packet of economics question paper.&lt;ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /&gt; He asked a student to make a handwritten copy of the question paper (to avoid being traced from the handwriting).&lt;ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /&gt; He then sent photos of the handwritten copy of the paper on [[WhatsApp]] to a relative in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].&lt;ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /&gt; This relative shared the photos with her son and nephew, who shared them with their friends on WhatsApp groups, from where it was forwarded to other Whatsapp groups.&lt;ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /&gt;

On 12 April 2018, the police said that Rakesh Kumar, who leaked the class 12 economics paper, had leaked class 10 mathematics paper also.&lt;ref name="bs_118041200431_1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Una teacher leaked both CBSE economics and maths question papers: Police|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/una-teacher-leaked-both-cbse-economics-and-maths-question-papers-police-118041200431_1.html|accessdate=12 April 2018|work=[[Business Standard]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=12 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412190632/http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/una-teacher-leaked-both-cbse-economics-and-maths-question-papers-police-118041200431_1.html|archivedate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the Central Board of Secondary Education has put in place a system of “encrypted” question papers, which are supposed to be printed by the schools half an hour before the exam starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.gov.in/contact.htm |title=Contacts |publisher=CBSE |date= |accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communitarianism sidebar}}
'''Communitarianism''' is a [[philosophy]] that emphasizes the connection between the [[individual]] and the [[community]]. Its overriding philosophy is based upon the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism. Although the community might be a [[family]], communitarianism usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history.&lt;ref&gt;Avineri, S.and de-Shalit, Avner. (1992) ''Communitarianism and Individualism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Communitarianism usually opposes extreme [[individualism]] and disagrees with extreme [[laissez-faire]] policies that neglect the stability of the overall community.

==Terminology==
The philosophy of communitarianism originated in the 20th century, but the term "communitarian" was coined in 1841, by [[John Goodwyn Barmby]], a leader of the British [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, who used it in referring  to [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]], and other idealists, who experimented with communal styles of life. However, it was not until the 1980s that the term "communitarianism" gained currency through association with the work of a small group of political philosophers. Their application of the label "communitarian" was controversial, even among communitarians, because, in the West, the term "communitarian" evokes associations with the ideologies of [[socialism]] and [[collectivism]]; so, public leaders—and some of the academics who champion this school of thought—usually avoid the term "communitarian", while still advocating and advancing the ideas of communitarianism.

The term is primarily used in two senses:
* '''Philosophical communitarianism''' considers [[classical liberalism]] to be [[ontology|ontologically]] and [[epistemology|epistemologically]] incoherent, and opposes it on those grounds. Unlike classical liberalism, which construes communities as originating from the voluntary acts of pre-community [[individual]]s, it emphasizes the role of the community in defining and shaping individuals. Communitarians believe that the value of community is not sufficiently recognized in liberal theories of justice.
* '''Ideological communitarianism''' is characterized as a [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] [[ideology]] that is sometimes marked by leftism on economic issues and centrism on social issues. This usage was coined recently. When the term is capitalized, it usually refers to the Responsive Communitarian movement of [[Amitai Etzioni]] and other philosophers.

==Origins==
While the term communitarian was coined only in the mid-nineteenth century, ideas that are communitarian in nature appear much earlier. They are found in some classical socialist doctrine (e.g. writings about the early commune and about workers' solidarity), and further back in the [[New Testament]]. Communitarianism has been traced back to early [[monasticism]], but in the twentieth century began to be formulated as a philosophy by [[Dorothy Day]] and the [[Catholic Worker movement]]. In an early article the ''Catholic Worker'' clarified the dogma of the Mystical Body of Christ as the basis for the movement's communitarianism. Communitarianism is also related to the [[personalist]] philosophy of [[Emmanuel Mounier]].

A number of early sociologists had strongly communitarian elements in their work, such as [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in his comparison of [[Gemeinschaft]] (oppressive but nurturing communities) and Gesellschaft (liberating but impersonal societies), and Emile Durkheim's concerns about the integrating role of social values and the relations between the individual and society. Both authors warned of the dangers of [[anomie]] (normlessness) and alienation in modern societies composed of atomized individuals who had gained their liberty but lost their social moorings.  Modern sociologists saw the rise of a mass society and the decline of communal bonds and respect for traditional values and authority in the United  States as of the 1960s. Among those who raised these issues were Robert Nisbet (Twilight of Authority),&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert, Twilight of Authority. Indianapolis: LibertyFund, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert N. Bellah]] (Habits of the Heart),&lt;ref&gt;Bellah, Robert N., Habits of the Heart, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Ehrenhalt (The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenhalt Ehrenhalt, Alan, The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America. New York:BasicBooks, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Bowling Alone (2000), Robert Putnam documented the decline of "social capital" and stressed the importance of "bridging social capital," in which bonds of connectedness are formed across diverse social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Putman, Robert D., Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of AmericanCommunity. New York:Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to criticism that the term 'community' is too vague or cannot be defined, [[Amitai Etzioni]], one of the leaders of the American communitarian movement, pointed out that communities can be defined with reasonable precision as having two characteristics: first, a web of affect-laden relationships among a group of individuals, relationships that often crisscross and reinforce one another (as opposed to one-on-one or chain-like individual relationships); and second, a measure of commitment to a set of shared values, norms, and meanings, and a shared history and identity – in short, a particular culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beckert, Jen. "Communitarianism." International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology. London:Routledge, 2006. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, author David E. Pearson argued that "[t]o earn the appellation 'community,' it seems to me, groups must be able to exert moral suasion and extract a measure of compliance from their members. That is, communities are necessarily, indeed, by definition, coercive as well as moral, threatening their members with the stick of sanctions if they stray, offering them the carrot of certainty and stability if they don't."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

What is specifically meant by "community" in the context of communitarianism can vary greatly between authors and time periods. Historically, communities have been small and localized. However, as the reach of economic and technological forces extended, more-expansive communities became necessary in order to provide effective normative and political guidance to these forces, prompting the rise of national communities in Europe in the 17th century. Since the late 20th century there has been some growing recognition that the scope of even these communities is too limited, as many challenges that people now face, such as the threat of nuclear war and that of global environmental degradation and economic crises, cannot be handled on a national basis. This has led to the quest for more-encompassing communities, such as the [[European Union]]. Whether truly supra-national communities can be developed is far from clear.

More modern communities can take many different forms, but are often limited in scope and reach. For example, members of one residential community are often also members of other communities – such as work, ethnic, or religious ones. As a result, modern community members have multiple sources of attachments, and if one threatens to become overwhelming, individuals will often pull back and turn to another community for their attachments.

Thus, communitarianism is the reaction of some intellectuals to the problems of Western society, an attempt to find flexible forms of balance between the individual and society, the autonomy of the individual and the interests of the community, between the common good and freedom, rights and duties.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Communitarian philosophy==&lt;!--'Communitarian philosophy' redirects here --&gt;
{{Christian Democracy sidebar|Christian democracy|expanded=all}}
In moral and political philosophy, communitarians are best known for their critiques of [[John Rawls]]' political liberalism, detailed at length in his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Communitarians criticize the image Rawls presents of humans as atomistic individuals, and stress that individuals who are well-integrated into communities are better able to reason and act in responsible ways than isolated individuals, but add that if social pressure to conform rises to high levels, it will undermine the individual self. Communitarians uphold the importance of the social realm, and communities in particular, though they differ in the extent to which their conceptions are attentive to liberty and individual rights. Even with these general similarities, communitarians, like members of many other schools of thought, differ considerably from one another. There are several distinct (and at times wildly divergent) schools of communitarian thought.

The following authors have communitarian tendencies in the philosophical sense, but have all taken pains to distance themselves from the political ideology known as communitarianism, which is discussed further below:
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]{{spaced ndash}}''After Virtue''
* [[Michael Sandel]]{{spaced ndash}}''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice''
* [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]{{spaced ndash}}''Sources of the Self''

==Academic communitarianism==&lt;!-- 'Academic communitarianism' redirects here --&gt;
Whereas the classical liberalism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] can be viewed as a reaction to centuries of authoritarianism, oppressive government, overbearing communities, and rigid dogma, modern communitarianism can be considered a reaction to excessive individualism, understood as an undue emphasis on individual rights, leading people to become selfish or egocentric.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/communitarianism#ref299521|title=Communitarianism {{!}} political and social philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close relation between the individual and the community was discussed on a theoretical level by [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], among other academic communitarians, in their criticisms of philosophical liberalism, especially the work of the American liberal theorist [[John Rawls]] and that of the German Enlightenment philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. They argued that contemporary liberalism failed to account for the complex set of social relations that all individuals in the modern world are a part of. Liberalism is rooted in an untenable ontology that posits the existence of generic individuals and fails to account for social embeddeddness. To the contrary, they argued, there are no generic individuals but rather only Germans or Russians, Berliners or Muscovites, or members of some other particularistic community. Because individual identity is partly constructed by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. Thus, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles decided behind Rawls' [[veil of ignorance]], because individuals cannot exist in such an abstracted state, even in principle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Academic communitarians also contend that the nature of the political community is misunderstood by liberalism. Where liberal philosophers described the polity as a neutral framework of rules within which a multiplicity of commitments to moral values can coexist, academic communitarians argue that such a thin conception of political community was both empirically misleading and normatively dangerous. Good societies, these authors believe, rest on much more than neutral rules and procedures—they rely on a shared moral culture. Some academic communitarians argued even more strongly on behalf of such particularistic values, suggesting that these were the only kind of values which matter and that it is a philosophical error to posit any truly universal moral values.

In addition to Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, other thinkers sometimes associated with academic communitarianism include [[Michael Walzer]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Seyla Benhabib]], and [[Shlomo Avineri]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Social capital===

Beginning in the late 20th century, many authors began to observe a deterioration in the social networks of the United States. In the book ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', [[Robert Putnam]] observed that nearly every form of civic organization has undergone drops in membership exemplified by the fact that, while more people are bowling than in the 1950s, there are fewer bowling leagues.

This results in a decline in "[[social capital]]", described by Putnam as "the collective value of all '[[social networks]]' and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other". According to Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy.

Communitarians seek to bolster social capital and the institutions of [[civil society]]. The Responsive Communitarian Platform described it thus:&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;The Communitarian Network, ''[http://www.gwu.edu/~icps/RCP%20text.html Responsive Communitarian Platform Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114032208/http://www.gwu.edu/~icps/RCP%20text.html |date=2010-01-14 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Many social goals ... require partnership between public and private groups. Though government should not seek to replace local communities, it may need to empower them by strategies of support, including revenue-sharing and technical assistance. There is a great need for study and experimentation with creative use of the structures of civil society, and public-private cooperation, especially where the delivery of health, educational and social services are concerned."

===Positive rights===

Important to some supporters of communitarian philosophy is the concept of [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]], which are rights or guarantees to certain things. These may include state-subsidized education, state-subsidized housing, a safe and clean environment, universal health care, and even the right to a job with the concomitant obligation of the government or individuals to provide one. To this end, communitarians generally support social security programs, public works programs, and laws limiting such things as pollution.

A common objection is that by providing such rights, communitarians violate the [[negative and positive rights|negative rights]] of the citizens; rights to ''not'' have something done for you. For example, taxation to pay for such programs as described above dispossesses individuals of property. Proponents of positive rights, by attributing the protection of negative rights to the society rather than the government, respond that individuals would not have any rights in the absence of societies—a central tenet of communitarianism—and thus have a social responsibility to give something back to it. Some have viewed this as a negation of [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. However, what is or is not a "natural right" is a source of contention in modern politics, as well as historically; for example, whether or not universal health care, private property or protection from polluters can be considered a birthright.

Alternatively, some agree that negative rights may be violated by a government action, but argue that it is justifiable if the positive rights protected outweigh the negative rights lost. In the same vein, supporters of positive rights further argue that negative rights are irrelevant in their absence. Moreover, some communitarians "experience this less as a case of being used for others' ends and more as a way of contributing to the purposes of a community I regard as my own".&lt;ref&gt;Sandel, ''Liberalism and the Limits of Justice'', 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other communitarians question the very idea of natural rights and their place in a properly functioning community. They claim that instead, claims of rights and entitlements creates a society unable to form cultural institutions and grounded social norms based on shared values. Rather, the liberalist claim to individual rights leads to a morality centered on individual emotivism, as ethical issues can no longer be solved by working through common understandings of the good. The worry here is that not only is society individualized, but so are moral claims.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, Alasdair C. After Virtue. Notre Dame, IN: U of Notre Dame, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsive communitarianism movement==
In the early 1990s, in response to the perceived breakdown in the moral fabric of society engendered by excessive individualism, Amitai Etzioni and William A. Galston began to organize working meetings to think through communitarian approaches to key societal issues. This ultimately took the communitarian philosophy from a small academic group, introduced it into public life, and recast its philosophical content.

Deeming themselves "responsive communitarians" in order to distinguish the movement from  authoritarian communitarians, Etzioni and Galston, along with a varied group of academics (including Mary Ann Glendon, Thomas A. Spragens, James Fishkin, Benjamin Barber, Hans Joas, Philip Selznick, and [[Robert N. Bellah]], among others) drafted and published The Responsive Communitarian Platform&lt;ref&gt;]{{cite web |url=http://communitariannetwork.org/about-communitarianism/responsive-communitarian-platform/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709214807/http://communitariannetwork.org/about-communitarianism/responsive-communitarian-platform/ |archivedate=2013-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their shared political principles, and the ideas in it were eventually elaborated in academic and popular books and periodicals, gaining thereby a measure of political currency in the West. Etzioni later formed the Communitarian Network to study and promote communitarian approaches to social issues and began publishing a quarterly journal, ''The Responsive Community''.

The main thesis of responsive communitarianism is that people face two major sources of normativity: that of the common good and that of autonomy and rights, neither of which in principle should take precedence over the other. This can be contrasted with other political and social philosophies which derive their core assumptions from one overarching principle (such as liberty/autonomy for libertarianism). It further posits that a good society is based on a carefully crafted balance between liberty and social order, between individual rights and personal responsibility, and between pluralistic and socially established values.

Responsive communitarianism stresses the importance of society and its institutions above and beyond that of the state and the market, which are often the focus of other political philosophies. It also emphasizes the key role played by socialization, moral culture, and informal social controls rather than state coercion or market pressures. It provides an alternative to liberal individualism and a major counterpoint to authoritarian communitarianism by stressing that strong rights presume strong responsibilities and that one should not be neglected in the name of the other.

Following standing sociological positions, communitarians assume that the moral character of individuals tends to degrade over time unless that character is continually and communally reinforced. They contend that a major function of the community, as a building block of moral infrastructure, is to reinforce the character of its members through the community's "moral voice," defined as the informal sanction of others, built into a web of informal affect-laden relationships, which communities provide.

===Influence===
Responsive communitarians have been playing a considerable public role, presenting themselves as the founders of a different kind of environmental movement, one dedicated to shoring up society (as opposed to the state) rather than nature. Like environmentalism, communitarianism appeals to audiences across the political spectrum, although it has found greater acceptance with some groups than others.

Although communitarianism is a small philosophical school, it has had considerable influence on public dialogues and politics. There are strong similarities between communitarian thinking and the Third Way, the political thinking of centrist Democrats in the United States, and the Neue Mitte in Germany. Communitarianism played a key role in Tony Blair's remaking of the British socialist Labour Party into "New Labour" and a smaller role in President Bill Clinton's campaigns. Other politicians have echoed key communitarian themes, such as Hillary Clinton, who has long held that to raise a child takes not just parents, family, friends and neighbors, but a whole village.&lt;ref&gt;Dionne, E.J., Our Divided Political Heart: The Battle for the American Idea in an Age of Discontent, New York: Bloomsbury USA, 2012, 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; It has also been suggested that the "&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[compassionate conservatism]]" espoused by President Bush during his 2000 presidential campaign was a form of conservative communitarian thinking, though he too did not implement it in his policy program. Cited policies have included economic and rhetorical support for education, volunteerism, and community programs, as well as a social emphasis on promoting families, character education, traditional values, and faith-based projects.

President Barack Obama gave voice to communitarian ideas and ideals in his book ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Obama, Barack. ''The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream''. New York: Crown Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 2008 presidential election campaign he repeatedly called upon Americans to "ground our politics in the notion of a common good," for an "age of responsibility," and for foregoing identity politics in favor of community-wide unity building. However, for many in the West, the term communitarian conjures up authoritarian and collectivist associations, so many public leaders – and even several academics considered champions of this school – avoid the term while embracing and advancing its ideas.

Reflecting the dominance of [[Left-Right politics|liberal and conservative politics]] in the United States, no major party and few elected officials openly advocate communitarianism. Thus there is no consensus on individual policies, but some that most communitarians endorse have been enacted. Nonetheless, there is a small faction of communitarians within the Democratic Party; prominent communitarians include [[Bob Casey Jr.]], [[Joe Donnelly]], and [[Claire McCaskill]]. Many communitarian Democrats are part of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]]. A small communitarian faction within the Republican Party also exists. [[Rick Santorum]] is an example of a communitarian Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstate.com/diary/tex_whitley/2012/01/05/rick-santorum-and-communitarian-conservatism/|title=Rick Santorum and Communitarian Conservatism|first=Brad|last=Jackson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite possible that the United States'  [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] ideological underpinnings have suppressed major communitarian factions from emerging.&lt;ref&gt;The Responsive Community, Vol. 3, Issue 1. Winter 1992/93. Retrieved May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dana Milbank]], writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', remarked of modern communitarians, "There is still no such thing as a card-carrying communitarian, and therefore no consensus on policies. Some, such as [[John DiIulio]] and outside Bush adviser [[Marvin Olasky]], favor religious solutions for communities, while others, like Etzioni and Galston, prefer secular approaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janda.org/b20/News%20articles/GW%2C%20the%20Communitarian.htm|title=Needed: Catchword For Bush Ideology; 'Communitarianism' Finds Favor|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the right-libertarian ''[[Reason Magazine]]'' worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone. The Reason-Rupe poll found that "Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the 'liberal' or 'conservative' groups". Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was ±3.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/29/reason-rupe-poll-finds-24-of-a|title=Reason-Rupe Poll Finds 24 Percent of Americans are Economically Conservative and Socially Liberal, 28 Percent Liberal, 28 Percent Conservative, and 20 Percent Communitarian|first=Emily|last=Ekins|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=''[[Reason Magazine]]''|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar Gallup survey in 2011 included possible [[centrism|centrist/moderate]] responses. That poll reported that 17% expressed conservative views, 22% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, 17% expressed centrist views, and 24% expressed liberal views. The organization used the terminology "the bigger the better" to describe communitarianism.&lt;ref name="poll" /&gt;

The [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] party, founded and led by [[Imran Khan]], is considered the first political party in the world which has declared communitarianism as one of their official ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electioncell2013.com/pakistan-tehreek-e-insaf-pti/7667 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116104746/http://www.electioncell2013.com/pakistan-tehreek-e-insaf-pti/7667 |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other political philosophies==
[[Image:Political-spectrum-multiaxis.png|thumb|250px|A variant of the [[Nolan chart]] using traditional political color coding ([[Red (political adjective)|red leftism]] versus [[Blue#Politics|blue rightism]]) with communitarianism on the top left.]]
Early communitarians were charged with being, in effect, social conservatives. However, many contemporary communitarians, especially those who define themselves as responsive communitarians, fully realize and often stress that they do not seek to return to traditional communities, with their authoritarian power structure, rigid stratification, and discriminatory practices against minorities and women. Responsive communitarians seek to build communities based on open participation, dialogue, and truly shared values. Linda McClain, a critic of communitarians, recognizes this feature of the responsive communitarians, writing that some communitarians do "recognize the need for careful evaluation of what is good and bad about [any specific] tradition and the possibility of severing certain features . . . from others."&lt;ref&gt;McClain, Linda, C, "Rights and irresponsibility," Duke Law Journal (March 1994): 989–1088.&lt;/ref&gt; And R. Bruce Douglass writes, "Unlike conservatives, communitarians are aware that the days when the issues we face as a society could be settled on the basis of the beliefs of a privileged segment of the population have long since passed."&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, R. Bruce. "The renewal of democracy and the communitarian prospect." The Responsive Community 4.3 (1994): 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major way the communitarian position differs from the social conservative one is that although communitarianism's ideal "good society" "reaches into the private realm, it seeks to cultivate only a limited set of core virtues through an organically developed set of values rather than having an expansive or holistically normative agenda given by the state. For example, American society favors being religious over being atheist, but is rather neutral with regard to which particular religion a person should follow. There are no state-prescribed dress codes, "correct" number of children to have, or places one is expected to live, etc. In short, a key defining characteristic of the ideal communitarian society is that in contrast to a liberal state, it creates shared formulations of the good, but the scope of this good is much smaller than that advanced by authoritarian societies."&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai, What is Political? (2003). CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, 2006. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2157170&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarian governments often embrace extremist ideologies and rule with brute force, accompanied with severe restrictions on personal freedom, political and civil rights. Authoritarian governments are overt about the role of the government as director and commander. [[Civil society]] and democracy are not generally characteristic of authoritarian regimes.

==Criticisms==
Liberal theorists such as Simon Caney&lt;ref&gt;'Liberalism and communitarianism: a misconceived debate'. Political Studies 40, 273–290&lt;/ref&gt; disagree that philosophical communitarianism has any interesting criticisms to make of liberalism. They reject the communitarian charges that liberalism neglects the value of community, and holds an "atomized" or asocial view of the self.

According to [[Peter Sutch]] the principal criticisms of communitarianism are:
# that communitarianism leads necessarily to moral relativism,
# that this relativism leads necessarily to a re-endorsement of the status quo in international politics, and
# that such a position relies upon a discredited ontological argument that posits the foundational status of the community or state.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sutch, Ethics, Justice, and International Relations, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he goes on to show that such arguments cannot be leveled against the particular communitarian theories of [[Michael Walzer]] and [[Mervyn Frost]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Other critics emphasize close relation of communitarianism to [[neoliberalism]] and new policies of dismantling the [[welfare state]] institutions through development of the third sector.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski, ''Neoliberalizm i spoleczenstwo obywatelskie (Neoliberalism and Civil Society)'', Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Mikołaja Kopernika, Torun 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme is the equivalent of a [[Master's degree|masters]] or [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] degree which offers a level 6 – 7 qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/06/from-barclays-to-boots-apprenticeships-are-transforming-management-training|title=From Barclays to Boots, apprenticeships are transforming management training|last=Doughty|first=Richard|date=2018-03-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training for this qualification includes working in a full-time job as well as studying at a partner University or training provider.

== Requirements ==
Degree apprenticeships have been designed for learners 18 years of age or older.

Candidates interested in this programme must already have a level-3 qualification such as an advanced [[apprenticeship]], A [[A-Levels|levels]] or an International [[International Baccalaureate|Baccalaureat]]. However, some programmes may require further training.

'''ETEC Lauro Gomes''', formerly known as '''ETE Lauro Gomes''', '''ETI Lauro Gomes''' and '''Escola Técnica Industrial de São Bernardo do Campo''' is an educational facility located in [[São Bernardo do Campo]], [[São Paulo (state)|SP]], [[Brazil]]. It offers [[secondary education]] and [[vocational education]] classes.

== History ==

São Bernardo do Campo, a municipality neighboring [[São Paulo]], started to experience a fast growth of the [[manufacturing]] sector after the inauguration of [[Via Anchieta]], a road linking São Paulo to [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] crossing the town. In the 1950s, the traditional [[furniture]] making industry began to share space with other activities, such as [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[home appliance]]s and specially [[Automotive industry|automotive]]. In 1958, [[Willys-Overland]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Volkswagen]] already had plants in the city,&lt;ref name="OESP19580820"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = O Estado de S. Paulo | language = Portuguese | page = 14 | date = August 20, 1968 | title = S.

In 1956 the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education and Culture - MEC]] granted a [[Brazilian cruzeiro|₢$]] 20 million [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] for the installment of the school,&lt;ref name="OESP19560714"&gt;{{cite news | language = Portuguese | newspaper = O Estado de S.

In 1964 a council was set to manage a cooperation agreement between the [[Brazilian government]] and the former [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic of Germany government]] to allow the latter to provide equipment, techniques and teachers to improve the teaching level in the school. Such agreement would allow the insertion of German educators for five years into the facility to be gradually substituted by their Brazilian counterparts.&lt;ref name="OESP19640626"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://acervo.estadao.com.br/pagina/#!/19640626-27355-nac-0010-999-10-not/busca/Escola+T%C3%A9cnica+Industrial+S%C3%A3o+Bernardo+Campo | language = Portuguese | accessdate = January 30, 2014 | date = June 26, 1964 | newspaper = O Estado de S. Paulo | page = 10 | title = Bonn dará técnicos e material à Escola de S. Bernardo do Campo |trans-title=Bonn will provide technicians and material to São Bernardo do Campo School }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1967, the agreement was not fully operational as the school still was in construction, with a 60% completion rate and offering the construction of machines and engines as its only course, although the Industrial Engineering Faculty of the [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]] (now known as [[Centro Universitário da FEI]]) already was using part of the facilities.&lt;ref name="OESP19671013" /&gt; In the year before, the school has been named Lauro Gomes &lt;ref name="ETELGH"&gt;{{cite web | website = ETELG website | language = Portuguese | accessdate = February 27, 2014 | url = http://www.etelg.com.br/paginaete/escola/historico.htm | title = Histórico da Escola |trans-title=School history }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the former city mayor died in 1964.&lt;ref name="PMSBCm" /&gt;

In the 1970s other programs have been started, such as electronics, electrotechnics, designing of tools and machining fixtures, and industrial laboratory technician.&lt;ref name="ETELGH" /&gt; The [[Electronic data processing]] course has been established in 1985.&lt;ref name="ETELGH" /&gt;

== Adjoining the State Technical School Center ==

In 1980, state decree no. 16309 ordered the school to join Centro Paula Souza, effective January 1, 1981, thus being one of the state-managed technical schools in São Paulo. The law has been enacted by Governor [[Paulo Maluf]].&lt;ref name="DE16309"&gt;{{cite web | website = jusbrasil.com.br | accessdate = February 27, 2014 | language = Portuguese | url = http://governo-sp.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/204378/decreto-16309-80 | title = Decreto 16309/80 |trans-title=State decree 16309/80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Reform ==

The vocational program and the high school programs were fused into a single lesson plan, the latter frequently adapted to match the skills needed in the first one. However the national technical education reform of 1997 deterred, in practice, the continuation of such scheme, stating only 25% of the full educational schedule could be allocated for vocational lessons.&lt;ref name="D2208"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/D2208.htm | accessdate = March 7, 2014 | date = April 17, 1997 | language = Portuguese | title = Decreto 2208/97 |trans-title=Federal Decree no. 2208/97 | quote = Article 5: The vocational education will have its own coursework, independent from the high school plan, to be offered concomitantly or sequentially to it; Sole paragraph: The vocational classes may be taught in the diversified portion of high school classes, limited to 25% of the full minimum schedule (...). | website = Brazilian Presidency's Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such resolution has been superseded in 2004, the liaisons between the vocational and the high school classes were reinstalled as an option, thus allowing the continuation of separate courses offering.&lt;ref name="D5154"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2004/Decreto/D5154.htm#art9 | accessdate = March 7, 2014 | date = July 23, 2004 | language = Portuguese | title = Decreto 5154/04 |trans-title=Federal Decree no. 5154/04 | website = Brazilian Presidency's Website | quote = Article 4, § 1: The articulation between the high school level vocational classes and the high school common classes will be given through: I - integrated (...), being such course planned to conduce the learner to achieve his technical habilitation, in the same learning institution, with a single admittance; II - concomitantly, (...), when the completeness between the vocational and high school courses assumes distinct admittances for each segment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habilitations Offered ==

As of 2014, along with the high school classes, the following vocational habilitations are available:&lt;ref name="ETELGSP" /&gt;

* [[Accounting]]
* [[Business Administration]]
* [[Chemistry]] (derived from former industrial laboratory technician course)
* [[Electronics]]
* [[Industrial Automation]]
* [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] (derived from former data processing course)
* [[Internet]]-oriented Informatics
* [[Logistics]]
* [[Mechatronics]] (derived from former mechanics course)
* [[Office management]]
* [[Power electronics]] (derived from former electrotechnics course)

== Admission ==

Admission to the school involves an exam called ''vestibulinho'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[diminutive]] form of [[vestibular]], the most dominant admission test employed for those seeking to ingress in a [[college]] in Brazil). It is a [[Multiple choice|multiple choice test]] combined with a [[Composition (language)|written composition]].&lt;ref name="CEETEPSV"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.centropaulasouza.sp.gov.br/Vestibulinho/ | title = Vestibulinho do Centro Paula Souza |trans-title=Centro Paula Souza's Vestibulinho webpage | accessdate = March 10, 2014 | language = Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English Braille''', also known as ''Grade 2 Braille'',&lt;ref&gt;"English Braille" normally refers to Grade 2. The more basic Grade 1 Braille, which is only used by learners, is specified as "English Braille, Grade 1" (Braille Through Remote Learning).&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[braille alphabet]] used for [[English language|English]]. It consists of 250 or so letters ([[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]]), [[Numerical digit|numerals]], punctuation, formatting marks, contractions, and abbreviations ([[logogram]]s). Some English Braille letters, such as {{bc2|⠡}} {{angle bracket|ch}},&lt;ref&gt;{{angle bracket|Angle brackets}} will be used to indicate transcriptions of braille letters into the Latin alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; correspond to more than one letter in print.

There are three levels of complexity in English Braille. Grade 1 is a nearly one-to-one transcription of printed English and is restricted to basic literacy. Grade 2, which is nearly universal beyond basic literacy materials, abandons one-to-one transcription in many places (such as the letter {{bc2|⠡}} {{angle bracket|ch}}) and adds hundreds of abbreviations and contractions. Both grades have been standardized. "Grade 3" is any of various personal [[shorthand]]s. It is almost never found in publications. Most of this article describes the 1994 American edition of Grade 2 Braille, which is largely equivalent to British Grade 2 Braille.&lt;ref&gt;compare American (BANA) [http://www.duxburysystems.com/images/bana_black.pdf here] with British (BAUK) [http://www.duxburysystems.com/images/bauk_black.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the differences with [[Unified English Braille]], which was officially adopted by various countries between 2005 and 2012, are discussed at the end.

Braille was originally intended, and is frequently portrayed, as a re-encoding of the [[English orthography]] used by sighted people. However, braille is an independent writing system, not a variant of the printed [[English alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniels &amp; Bright, 1996, ''The World's Writing Systems'', p 817–818&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Braille was introduced to Britain in 1861. In 1876, a French-based system with a few hundred English contractions and abbreviations was adopted as the predominant script in Great Britain. However, the contractions and abbreviations proved unsatisfactory, and in 1902 the current grade-2 system, called Revised Braille, was adopted in the [[British Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=war&gt;[http://www.nyise.org/blind/irwin2.htm War of the Dots] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326203049/http://www.nyise.org/blind/irwin2.htm |date=2010-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the ideal of basing all braille alphabets of the world on the original French alphabetic order was accepted by Britain, Germany, and Egypt (see [[International Braille]]). In the United States at the time, three scripts were used: non-braille [[New York Point]]; [[American Braille]], which was reordered so that the most frequent letters were the ones with the fewest dots; and a variation of English Braille, which was reordered to match the English alphabet, assigning the values ''wxyz'' to the letters that, in France and England, stood for ''xyzç''. A partially contracted English Braille, Grade 1½,&lt;ref&gt;using only the single-cell contractions&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted in Britain in 1918, and fully contracted Grade 2, with a few minor concessions to the Americans, was adopted in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, 1953, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000711/071103eb.pdf ''World Braille Usage''], {{sc|Unesco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concessions were to swap the British two-dot capital sign with the one-dot emphasis sign, which had generally been omitted anyway (as capitals had been in [[New York Point]]), to drop a few religious contractions from general usage, and to introduce a rule stating that contractions and abbreviations should not span 'major' syllable boundaries.&lt;ref name=war/&gt;

In 1991, an American proposal was made for [[Unified English Braille]], intended to eliminate the confusion caused by competing standards for academic uses of English Braille.&lt;ref name="iceb.org"&gt;[http://www.iceb.org/cranem.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acb.org/magazine/2001/bf092001.html#bf06]&lt;/ref&gt; After several design revisions, it has since been adopted by the Commonwealth countries starting in 2005, and by the United States (starting a gradual introduction after 2012). The chief differences with Revised Braille are in punctuation, symbols, and formatting, more accurately reflecting print conventions in matters such as brackets, mathematical notation, and typefaces.

==System==
The 64 braille patterns are arranged into decades based on the numerical order of those patterns. The first decade are the numerals 1 through 0, which utilize only the top and mid row of the cell; the 2nd through 4th decades are derived from the first by adding dots to the bottom row; the 5th decade is created by shifting the first decade downwards. In addition, for each decade there are two additional mirror-image patterns, and finally there are three patterns that utilize only the bottom row of the cell. The final pattern, the empty cell {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠀}}}}, is used as a [[word divider|space]]; it has the same width as the others.

Cells 1 through 25 plus 40 (''w'') are assigned to the 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]]. The other 37 cells are often used for punctuation and typically assigned different values in different languages. The English grade-two values are as follows; cells with dots on only the right side do not have equivalents in printed English and are explained in the notes.

:&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; ''Abolished in Unified English Braille''
Some of these ligatures transcribe common words, such as ''and'' or ''of'', but they are not words: Pronunciation and meaning are ignored, and only spelling is relevant. For example, {{bc2|⠮}} {{angle bracket|the}} is commonly used when the sequence of print letters ''the'' appears, not just for the word "the". That is, {{bc2|⠮}} {{angle bracket|the}} is the ''letter'' "the" in braille, as in the two-letter word {{bc2|⠮|⠝}} ''then (the-n)''. Similarly, ''hand'' is written ''h-and'', ''roof'' (which sounds nothing like the word "of") is written ''r-o-of'', and ''forest'' is written with three letters in braille, {{bc2|⠿|⠑|⠌}} ''for-e-st''.&lt;ref&gt;This is reminiscent of writing "h8" for ''hate'' and "4ever" for ''forever'', but differs in that the spelling of the parts cannot differ in Braille (8 is not spelled "ate" as in ''h-ate'', and 4 is not "for").&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers are used this way as well—''7th'' is written {{bc2|⠼|⠛|⠹}} ''#-7-th'', and here printed English approximates normal practice in braille. There are numerous conventions for when a print sequence is "contracted" this way in braille, and when it is spelled out in full.

The ligatures {{angle bracket|-ing}} and {{angle bracket|-ble}} may not begin a word (as in *''&lt;u&gt;ble&lt;/u&gt;d'': {{bc2|⠼|⠙}} would be read instead as {{angle bracket|4}}), but are used everywhere else (as in ''pro&lt;u&gt;ble&lt;/u&gt;m, trou&lt;u&gt;ble&lt;/u&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;When a word has an established braille spelling without a ligature, the contraction is avoided in derivativations which would otherwise allow it, such as ''nosebleed'' and ''unblemished''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ligatures of the third decade, {{angle bracket|and, for, of, the, with}}, take precedence over the letters of later decades. For example, ''then'' is written {{bc2|⠮|⠝}} ''the-n'', not *{{bc2|⠹|⠢}} ''th-en''. When standing as words adjacent to other such words, or to {{bc2|⠁}} ''a'', no space is left between them. For example, ''and the, for a, with the, of a'' are all fused together.&lt;ref&gt;In an extreme example, ''for and with the people'' is written {{bc2|⠿|⠯|⠾|⠮|⠀|⠏}}. This convention has been eliminate from Unified English Braille, which spaces all words as in print.&lt;/ref&gt;

When printed ''ch, gh, sh, th'' are pronounced as two sounds, as in ''Shanghai, hogshead,'' and ''outhouse'', then they are written as two braille letters rather than with the ligatures {{angle bracket|gh, sh, th}}. Generally, other ligatures should not be used if they might cause problems with legibility, as with the ''ing'' in ''lingerie'', though they tend to be with familiar words, such as ''ginger'' and ''finger'', even if their pronunciation is divided between syllables. None of the ligatures are to be used across the boundaries of compound words. For example, {{bc2|⠷}} {{angle bracket|of}} is not used in ''twofold'', nor {{bc2|⠆}} {{angle bracket|bb}} in ''dumbbell''. The rules state that they should not span a prefix and stem either, so for example the ''ed'' in ''deduce'', the ''er'' of ''rerun'' and ''derail'', and the ''ble'' of ''sublet'' should be written out in full. In practice this is variable, as it depends upon the awareness of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{bc2|⠜}} {{angle bracket|ar}} is a common exception to this rule, and is regularly used in common words which have a prefix ''a-'' before a root beginning with ''r'', as in ''arise''. The ligature {{angle bracket|ar}} would not be considered well-formed in the word ''infrared'', however.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''of'' in ''professor'', for example, might not be recognized spanning prefix and stem, and no-one has a problem with ''a-cc-ept'' or ''a-dd-r-e-s-s'', despite the technical violation. There is also conflict with the overriding tendency to contract sequences that fall within a single syllable. So the same writer who divides the ''er'' in ''derive'' may allow the ligature in ''derivation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesbraille.org/lesson.php?num=66]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern emerges from suffixes: {{angle bracket|ed}} is not used in ''freedom'', since it spans stem and suffix, but is used in ''freed'', because it forms a single syllable with the stem. What is considered to constitute a prefix or suffix is somewhat arbitrary: {{angle bracket|st}} is not used in ''Charlestown,'' for example, but it is in ''Charleston''. Ligatures may also not separate [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] or diphthongs in print. For example, ''aerial'' does not use {{angle bracket|er}}, ''Oedipus'' does not use {{angle bracket|ed}}, and ''tableau'' does not use {{angle bracket|ble}}.&lt;ref&gt;In words like ''canoed, toed,'' and ''shoer'', however, the ''e'' is ambiguous between the stem ''canoe, toe, shoe'' and the suffix ''-ed'' or ''-er'', and in such words the letters {{angle bracket|ed}} and {{angle bracket|er}} are used.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is normal to use the letter {{angle bracket|ea}} for the [[broken vowel]] in ''i-d-ea-s'' or ''c-r-ea-t-e'', despite it being pronounced as two sounds rather than one as in ''head'' or ''ocean''.

Ligatures should not be used for [[acronym]]s that are pronounced as a string of letters. That is, ''DEA'' should not use the letter {{angle bracket|ea}}, nor PST the letter {{angle bracket|st}}. Such letters are acceptable in acronyms that are pronounced as a word, however, if the result is not obscure.{{example needed}}

The letters of the fifth decade are often used in the past tense and other grammatical forms: when ''rub'' becomes ''rubbed'', in braille the letter {{angle bracket|b}} is moved down a dot to indicate the ''bb''. However, those letters which double as punctuation marks—{{angle bracket|ea, bb, cc, dd, ff, gg}}—may only occur sandwiched in the middle of a word, not at the beginning or end, in order to avoid confusion with the punctuation. That is, *''sea, ebb, add, cuff, egg'' must be spelled out in full, though the ligatures are used in ''season, added (a-dd-ed), cuffs,'' and ''eggs''. Because of legibility problems (see "lower contractions" in the next section), they may not come in contact with an apostrophe or hyphen either. That is, in ''egg's'' and ''egg-plant'', ''tea's'' and ''tea-time'', the ''gg'' and ''ea'' must be spelled out in full. If the print letters span an obvious affix, the braille ligature is not used (''preamble, reanalyze, pineapple, subbasement''), but they are used in words such as ''accept'' and ''address'' where the morphology has become opaque.&lt;ref&gt;This can feel arbitrary: ''Lineage'' accepts the ligature, but ''mileage'' does not.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep the spelling regular, compounds of words starting with ''ea'' keep the ''ea'' spelled out: ''uneasy, anteater, southeast'' do not use the ligature {{angle bracket|ea}} because ''easy, eater, east'' do not use it.&lt;ref&gt;However, the restriction does not seem to apply to ''ea'' at the end of a word: ''teaspoon'' (ea) and ''eggbeater'' (gg) use the ligature.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the least-preferred ligatures: any other will be used instead. Thus ''wedding'' is ''w-ed-d-ing'' (not *''we-dd-ing'') and ''office'' is ''of-f-i-c-e'' (not *''o-ff-i-c-e'').

Many of the rules for when to use ligatures, contractions, and abbreviations differ when a word is divided at the end of a line of text, because some of them may not come in contact with the hyphen that divides the word. See the references for details.

The '''accent mark''' {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠈}}}} shows that there is a [[diacritic]] on the following letter, as in {{angle bracket|se@nor}} ''señor'', {{angle bracket|fa@cade}} ''façade'', {{angle bracket|caf@e}} ''café'', {{angle bracket|na@ive}} ''naïve'', and ''ångström'' {{angle bracket|@angstr@om}}. In normal braille text, noting the precise diacritic is not important, as it can be easily understood from context, or simply ignored. Where diacritics are critical, technical braille transcription must be used.

A diacritic in a word of foreign origin prevents the accented letter from combining with another into a ligature. For example, ''señor'' is not written with the ligature {{angle bracket|en}} as *{{angle bracket|''s-@-en-o-r''}}, because it would not be clear if the accent were supposed to be on the ''e'' (as ''é'') or on the ''n''. However, English words are contracted.  Thus ''blessèd'' is written {{angle bracket|''b-l-e-s-s-@-ed''}}, and ''coëducational'' is {{angle bracket|''c-o-@-ed-u-c-ation-a-l''}}.

Braille punctuation is somewhat variable, just as there is variation in printed English between curly and straight quotation marks. They fail to make some distinctions found in print. For example, both opening and closing parentheses are written {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠶}}}}, with spacing used to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;In Unified English Braille they are specified as {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠐|⠣}}}} and {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠐|⠜}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, braille makes several useful distinctions which print fails to make: The period {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠲}}}} is different from the decimal point {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠨}}}}, and the apostrophe {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠄}}}} and ditto mark {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠐|⠂}}}} are distinct from the single and double quotation marks.

{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠤}}}} is the hyphen, {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠤|⠤}}}} the [[en dash]], {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠤|⠤|⠤}}}} the em dash, and {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠤|⠤|⠤|⠤}}}} a double dash. {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠄|⠄|⠄}}}} is the [[ellipsis]]. When words or letters are replaced by ---- or .... in print, in braille {{bc2|⠤|⠤|⠤|⠤}} and {{bc2|⠄|⠄|⠄|⠄}} are used, with a matching number of characters.

The reference mark, or "asterisk" ({{bc2|⠔|⠔}}), is used for all reference marks: *, †, ‡, etc., including numbered footnotes. Unlike the asterisk in printed English, it is spaced on both sides, apart from associated footnote letters or numbers, which follow it immediately. So, {{angle bracket|word*}} is transcribed {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠘|⠺|⠀|⠔|⠔}}}}, as is {{angle bracket|word&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{angle bracket|word&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt;}}; the numbered footnote in {{angle bracket|word&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is written {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠘|⠺|⠀|⠔|⠔|⠼|⠉}}}}.

The ditto mark, {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠐|⠂}}}}, which occupies two cells, is only used once per line, in contrast to normal practice in print.

The apostrophe {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠄}}}} and cap sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠}}}} are used to compose additional punctuation. Added to parentheses, {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠|⠶}} ... {{bc2|⠶|⠄}}}}, they form brackets; added to quotation marks, {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠|⠦}} ... {{bc2|⠴|⠄}}}}, they form single quotation marks.&lt;ref&gt;This is because single quote marks are the convention in the US for embedded quotations, and so are less common than the others.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they form the ''termination sign'' {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠|⠄}}}}. (See 'formatting marks' below.) Also {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠎|⠄}}}}, the section mark (§).

The accent mark (here called the ''print symbol indicator'') is used with punctuation when it stands alone, rather than suffixed to a word or number. For example, if someone's response in a dialogue is transcribed {{angle bracket|"?"}}, in braille that would be written {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠦|⠈|⠦|⠴}}}}. It is also used to derive a few symbols: % {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠈|⠒|⠏}}}}, $ {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠈|⠲}}}}, &amp; {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠈|⠯}}}}.

Traditionally, mathematical symbols are spelled out (though Unified Braille has dedicated characters). So, ''2×5 ft.'' (read 'two-by-5 foot') is {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼|⠃|⠀|⠴|⠼|⠑|⠀|⠋|⠞|⠲}}}}, and ''2:5'' (read 'two-to-five [scale]') is {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼|⠃|⠀|⠖|⠼|⠑}}}}.

==Formatting marks==
{{anchor|Formatting marks}}
Braille has several formatting marks, sometimes called "composition signs", "register marks", or "indicators", which have no one-to-one correspondence with printed English. These are the number sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼}}}}, the letter sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠰}}}}, the capital sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠}}}}, the italic sign (or more accurately the emphasis sign) {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠨}}}}, and the termination sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠|⠄}}}} (written cap–apostrophe). These immediately precede the sequence (word or number) they modify, without an intervening space.

!rowspan=1|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|{{Braille box|type=image|46}} &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(decimal)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

All characters {{bc2|a}} ''a'' through {{bc2|j}} ''j'' are interpreted as the digits ''1'' through ''0'' when they follow a '''number sign'''.  This reading ignores intervening numerical and arithmetical symbols such as commas, decimal points, and fraction bars, until a non-number-compatible character, such as a period or a letter after J, is encountered, at which point reading reverts to the alphabetical values ''a–j''. The number sign is repeated after a slash that's not used a fraction bar (like ''model number 15/07'').&lt;ref&gt;But not with dates. For dates like 7/19/2012, a hyphen is used instead of a slash, without repeating the number sign. The number sign is only repeated after a hyphen when two dates (or other numbers) are joined, as in ''broadcast 1978–1984''. So, the date-range format {{angle bracket|10/2–10/7}} is transcribed {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼|⠁|⠚|⠤|⠃|⠤|⠼|⠁|⠚|⠤|⠛}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{fraction|1|20}} (one twentieth) is {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼|⠁|⠌|⠃|⠚}}}}, but 20/20 [vision] is {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼|⠃|⠚|⠌|⠼|⠃|⠚}}}}. The braille number sign has no equivalent in print. It is sometimes transcribed as {{angle bracket|#}}. However, this is misleading: an actual printed # is rendered in braille as {{angle bracket|No.}}, without an intervening space before the number sign {{bc2|⠼}}.

{| class=wikitable

|{{Braille box|type=image|46}} &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(emph.)&lt;/small&gt;

|{{Braille box|type=image|2}} &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(non-Latin)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

The '''letter sign''' is used to force the end of a series of numbers. For example, {{bc2|⠙|⠁}} {{angle bracket|da}} preceded by a number sign, {{bc2|⠼|⠙|⠁}}, is read as ''41''. If instead ''4a'' is intended (as in a section or apartment number), then the letter sign is used to force a reading of ''a'' rather than ''1'' for the final character: {{bc2|⠼|⠙|⠰|⠁}} {{angle bracket|4a}}.&lt;ref&gt;However, for abbreviations of units of measure which are not spaced, the letter sign is used even if the letter comes after J. ''5ml'', for example, is {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠼|⠑|⠰|⠍|⠇}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to mark a character as standing for a letter rather than for a word. For example, {{bc2|⠃}} {{angle bracket|b}} on its own is normally read as the word ''but''; to indicate that it is instead the letter ''b'', the letter sign is used: {{bc2|⠰|⠃}} ''b''. Plurals of letters (''mind your ps and qs'') always use an apostrophe in braille, but other derivations may not, as in {{bc2|⠰|⠝|⠹}} ''nth [time]'': {{bc2|⠠|⠎|⠬}} is ''Sing'', {{bc2|⠰|⠠|⠎|⠬}} is ''S-ing/Essing''.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation marks, italics, and brackets are ''replaced'' by the letter sign if their function is equivalent, or if the punctuation is retained (as in "see item (d)"), the letter sign is not used.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter sign is also used to mark lower-case Roman numbers, as in {{bc2|⠰|⠊|⠊|⠊}} {{angle bracket|iii}}.

The '''capital(ization) sign''' marks the first letter of a word as capitalized. It may occur in the middle of a word for [[camel case]], as in the name ''deAngelo''. It is doubled to place a word in all caps; this must be repeated for each word of an all-cap text.&lt;ref&gt;In Unified English Braille, a triple cap sign is used for extended text.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''emphasis (italic) sign''' marks emphatic formatting, equivalent to printed italic, bold, underlined, and small-capital text.&lt;ref&gt;In Unified English Braille, these have separate formatting signs.&lt;/ref&gt; A single italic sign emphasizes the entire word (or number). For two or three emphasized words, each takes a separate marker. For longer texts, a doubled marker is placed before the first word, and the end of the emphasis is indicated by marking the final emphasized word with a single italic sign.

When the capitalization or emphasis does not span the entire word, the beginning and end is marked with a hyphen. However, if the print word already contains a hyphen, the '''termination sign''' is used for the end. So, {{angle bracket|'''Hoo'''ray}} is written {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠨|⠠|⠓|⠕|⠕|⠤|⠗|⠁|⠽}}}}, but {{angle bracket|'''Hoo'''-ray}} is {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠨|⠠|⠓|⠕|⠕|⠠|⠄|⠤|⠗|⠁|⠽}}}}.

The '''comma''' {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠂}}}} prefixed to a letter indicates that it is to be read as non-Latin, so that for example {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠂|⠁}}}} would be {{angle bracket|α}} if Greek symbols were being used.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Greek Braille]] for the braille codes for those letters.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Contractions==
Apart from words using the various abbreviations signs, covered in the next section, English Braille utilizes a number of unmarked contractions.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called "wordsigns" when they involve a single braille letter, and "shortforms" when more.&lt;/ref&gt; These are similar to the contractions found in [[shorthand]] and [[stenoscript]]. As a rule, they are not used where they would obscure the text.

:{{bc2|⠤}} {{angle bracket|-}} ''com-''&lt;ref name="UEB"/&gt;

Note irregular {{bc2|⠭}} {{angle bracket|x}} for ''it'', {{bc2|⠱}} {{angle bracket|z}} for ''as'', and {{bc2|⠶}} {{angle bracket|gg}} for ''were''. All 26 basic Latin letters are used apart from {{bc2|⠁|⠊|⠕}} {{angle bracket|a i o}}, which already form words of their own.

These contractions are either independent words or (in the cases of ''con-, com-, dis-, -self'') [[affix]]es, as in {{bc2|⠐|⠕|⠋}} {{angle bracket|one-f}} ''oneself''. They cannot be treated as simple letters. For example, while the letter {{bc2|⠭}} {{angle bracket|x}} stands for the pronoun ''it'', it cannot substitute for the sequence ''it'' in the word ''bite''.&lt;ref&gt;Apparent exceptions, such as {{angle bracket|xs, xf}} for ''its, itself'' and {{angle bracket|yr, yrf, yrvs}} for ''your, yourself, yourselves'', are quite limited in number and best thought of as separate contractions.&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot be pluralized: *{{angle bracket|cs}} is no good for "(tin) cans". This is true even of {{angle bracket|ch}} ''child'' not being usable for *''grandchild'', nor {{angle bracket|ou}} ''out'' in *''without''. (These must be spelled ''g-r-and-ch-i-l-d'' and ''with-ou-t''.) However, a following apostrophe is acceptable: {{angle bracket|p's}} ''people's'', {{angle bracket|c't}} ''can't'', {{angle bracket|x'll}} ''it'll'';&lt;ref&gt;but not ''haven't'', where the apostrophy does not immediately follow the ''have''.&lt;/ref&gt; as are hyphenated words like ''so-and-so''. This behavior is distinct from ligatures such as {{bc2|⠫}} {{angle bracket|ed}} and {{bc2|⠮}} {{angle bracket|the}}, which are used when the equivalent sequences are found in printed English, as in {{bc2|⠗|⠫}} ''red'' and {{bc2|⠝|⠑|⠫}} ''need''.

There is no semantic restriction: {{angle bracket|c}} ''can'' may be either the verb ''can'' or a tin ''can'', and capitalized {{bc2|⠠|⠺}} {{angle bracket|W}} and {{bc2|⠠|⠍}} {{angle bracket|M}} are names ''Will'' and ''More''.&lt;ref&gt;An exception are the musical notes ''do'' and ''so'', which are spelled out as ''d-o'' and ''s-o''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the few cases where the basic letters would be words in their own right, they must be spelled out to avoid confusion. That is, because {{bc2|⠩}} {{angle bracket|sh}} stands for ''shall'', it cannot be used for the word ''sh!'', which must be spelled out as {{bc2|⠎|⠓}} ''s-h''. Similarly, {{angle bracket|st}} can be used for ''St.'' (as either ''Saint'' or ''Street'') when marked as an abbreviation by a period, but otherwise should also be spelled out.&lt;ref&gt;Since the letters {{angle bracket|ed, er, ow}} are not used as contractions, they can be used for the words ''Ed, er...'', and ''ow!''&lt;/ref&gt;

;"Lower" contractions
Because contractions that occupy only the lower half of the braille cell mostly double as basic punctuation marks, legibility requires that, with few exceptions, they may not come in contact with actual punctuation marks; if they would, they should instead be spelled out. That is, any cell which follows without an intervening space should contain a dot in its top row. Most of the difficulties of when to use contractions are due to this complication.

The whole-word contractions of the fifth decade are {{angle bracket|bb}} ''be'', {{angle bracket|en}} ''enough'', {{angle bracket|ff}} ''to'', {{angle bracket|gg}} ''were'', {{angle bracket|?}} ''his'', {{angle bracket|in}} ''in'', {{angle bracket|”}} ''by/was''.&lt;ref&gt;Note that {{angle bracket|in}} ''in'' pulls double duty: It is a simple braille letter, used for any sequence ''i-n'' in an English word. However, it also functions as the word sign for the preposition ''in'', and in such cases follows the same restrictions as the other decade-5 words. {{angle bracket|en}}, on the other hand, is similar to {{angle bracket|sh}} in that it cannot be used as a word, for example in the phrases ''en route'' and ''en masse''.&lt;br&gt;{{angle bracket|be}} functions as both a word sign (''to be'') and a prefix.&lt;br&gt;Some treatments of English Braille also describe {{angle bracket|a}} as both letter and word sign, though since {{angle bracket|a}} uses the upper half of the cell and has a one-to-one correspondence with printed English, there is less cause for confusion.&lt;/ref&gt; If one of these words occurs at the end of a sentence, or before a comma, it must be spelled out (though "enough" would still be partially contracted to ''en-ou-gh''.) They cannot even be used in hyphenated words such as ''bride-to-be''. However, much like Arabic prepositions, the prepositions {{angle bracket|to}}, {{angle bracket|into}},&lt;ref&gt;{{angle bracket|in}} and {{angle bracket|to}} are regularly compounded as {{bc2|⠔|⠖}} ''into'', which is perhaps most easily understood as an independent word sign.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{angle bracket|by}} join with a following word without an intervening space. This prevents {{angle bracket|by}} from being read as 'was'. That is, in ''He came by to see us'', "by to see" is written as one word, {{bc2|⠴|⠖|⠎|⠑|⠑}}.  Word-joining is allowed as long as the upper half of the braille cell (dot 1 or 4) is used in the final word; ''to, by, into'' do join with ''in, enough, be, his, was, were'', but the second word is spelled out.

The fifth-decade prefixes (''be-, dis-, con-'') may only be used if they occur at the beginning of a word (including in a compound word after a hyphen, or after ''by, to, into'') and form a whole syllable. That is, they cannot be used in the words ''been, disk, conch'' nor (apart from double-duty ''be'') as words in their own right, as in ''con artist''. ''Com-'' is similar, but need not constitute a syllable: it is used for example in ''come'' and ''comb''. However, because it uses only the bottom row of the cell, like the hyphen and the apostrophe, it cannot come in contact with either.

===Longer contractions===
Longer unmarked contractions are the following. Ligatures, such as {{bc2|⠌}} {{angle bracket|st}} in {{angle bracket|agst}} ''against'', are underlined here for clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Because braille {{bc2|⠌}} {{angle bracket|st}} is a letter (phonogram or "groupsign") rather than a contraction, the printed sequence ''st'' will be written {{bc2|⠌}} in any word which is not otherwise abbreviated.&lt;/ref&gt;

These can only form longer words that are derivations of them and retain their meaning. For example, ''above'' in ''aboveboard'', ''necessary'' in ''unnecessary'', ''conceive'' in ''misconceive'', and ''good'' in ''goodness'' are all well-formed braille, but not ''should'' in *''shoulder'' nor ''said'' in *''Port Said''. Nor can they be used if a final ''-e'' is dropped, as in ''declaration''. (This is why special ''-ing'' forms are available for ''declaring, rejoicing'', and ''-ceiving'': the ''-ing'' suffix would not work.)

They may be used as [[proper noun]]s (when capitalized), but not as parts of proper nouns.&lt;ref&gt;They may however be used as common nouns within proper names, such as the titles of books.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''little'' is acceptable for the name ''Little'', but may not be used within ''Doolittle''; similarly, the contraction for ''good'' may not be used in the name ''Goody''. (There are too many unpredictable names for this to be workable.)

''After'', ''blind'' and ''friend'' may only be used in longer words when followed by a consonant. (They are too ambiguous otherwise.)

Besides unmarked contractions, words are abbreviated with any of several abbreviation signs. All of these signs use only the right-hand side of the braille cell. {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠐}}}}, {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠘}}}}, and {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠸}}}} mark ''initial abbreviations'', combining with the initial braille letter of a word. The italic sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠨}}}}, letter sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠰}}}}, and capital sign {{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠}}}} mark ''final abbreviations'', combining with the final letter of a sequence, commonly a suffix.

===Initial abbreviations===
(The combining initial letter is written here in boldface, as it does not always correspond to the initial letter of printed orthography.)
*{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠐}}}} forms the words {{bc2|⠐|⠓}} '''''h'''ere,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠮}} '''''the'''re,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠱}} '''''wh'''ere,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠑}} '''''e'''ver,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠳}} '''''ou'''ght,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠋}} '''''f'''ather,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠍}} '''''m'''other,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠝}} '''''n'''ame,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠡}} '''''ch'''aracter,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠟}} '''''q'''uestion,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠅}} '''''k'''now,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠇}} '''''l'''ord,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠕}} '''''o'''ne,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠙}} '''''d'''ay,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠎}} '''''s'''ome,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠏}} '''''p'''art,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠞}} '''''t'''ime,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠗}} '''''r'''ight,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠹}} '''''th'''rough,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠥}} '''''u'''nder,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠺}} '''''w'''ork,'' {{bc2|⠐|⠽}} '''''y'''oung''
*{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠘}}}} forms the words {{bc2|⠘|⠮}} '''''the'''se,'' {{bc2|⠘|⠹}} '''''th'''ose,'' {{bc2|⠘|⠥}} '''''u'''pon,'' {{bc2|⠘|⠱}} '''''wh'''ose,'' {{bc2|⠘|⠺}} '''''w'''ord''
*{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠸}}}} forms the words {{bc2|⠸|⠉}} '''''c'''annot,'' {{bc2|⠸|⠍}} '''''m'''any,'' {{bc2|⠸|⠓}} '''''h'''ad,'' {{bc2|⠸|⠮}} '''''the'''ir,'' {{bc2|⠸|⠎}} '''''s'''pirit,'' {{bc2|⠸|⠺}} '''''w'''orld''

In general, these are acceptable as parts of longer words as long as they retain their pronunciation. There are three main exceptions to this:
*{{angle bracket|one}} need not keep its odd pronunciation, as long as the ''o'' and ''n'' fall in the same syllable
*{{angle bracket|some}} needs to form a complete syllable, as in ''chromosome (ch-r-o-m-o-some)''
*{{angle bracket|part}} cannot be used in ''partake'' or its derivatives

As can be seen from ''chromosome'', the pronunciation requirement is rather loose. Given the difficulty of English speakers in agreeing on where syllable breaks fall,&lt;ref&gt;The convention in braille is to syllabify an intervocalic consonant with the preceding vowel if it is both stressed and short, but with the following vowel if the preceding vowel is long or if the following vowel is stressed. So, for example, ''fā-mous'' but ''făm-ine'', ''fī-ber'' but ''fĭl-ial'', ''pū-nitive'' but ''pŭn-ish''; also the verbs ''pre-sént, re-córd, pro-gréss'' vs. the nouns ''prés-ent, réc-ord, próg-ress''.[http://wesbraille.org/lesson.php?num=17]&lt;/ref&gt; syllable requirements are also loosely construed in braille: they do not follow the rigid application of a dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Generally, if the sequence of letters spans a stressed to an unstressed syllable, or spans two unstressed syllables, the contraction is acceptable. However, it is generally not acceptable if the sequence spans an unstressed to a stressed syllable, where the syllable break is more salient.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final abbreviations===
*{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠨}}}} forms the sequences {{bc2|⠨|⠙}} ''-oun'''d''','' {{bc2|⠨|⠞}} ''-oun'''t''','' {{bc2|⠨|⠑}} ''-anc'''e''','' {{bc2|⠨|⠎}} ''-les'''s''','' {{bc2|⠨|⠝}} ''-sio'''n'''''
*{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠰}}}} forms the sequences {{bc2|⠰|⠛}} ''-on'''g''','' {{bc2|⠰|⠇}} ''-fu'''l''','' {{bc2|⠰|⠞}} ''-men'''t''','' {{bc2|⠰|⠑}} ''-enc'''e''','' {{bc2|⠰|⠎}} ''-nes'''s''','' {{bc2|⠰|⠝}} ''-tio'''n''','' {{bc2|⠰|⠽}} ''-it'''y'''''
*{{angle bracket|{{bc2|⠠}}}} Capital {{angle bracket|Y}} stands for the suffix {{bc2|⠠|⠽}} ''-all'''y''''',&lt;ref name="UEB"/&gt; and {{angle bracket|N}} for {{bc2|⠠|⠝}} ''-atio'''n'''''.&lt;ref name="UEB"&gt;Eliminated in [[#Unified English Braille|Unified English Braille]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These cannot follow an apostrophe or hyphen. They cannot form independent words like *''ally'' or *''less'', nor can they occur at the beginning of a word like *''ancestor'' or *''lesson''. However, then can usually occur elsewhere: ''c-ount, ar-ound''. They may be used across syllables, as in ''c-ance-r''. {{angle bracket|ness}} is used for the suffix ''-ess'' after ''n'', though not after ''en'' or ''in'', as in ''baroness (b-ar-o-ness)'' and ''lioness'', but not in ''chieftainess (ch-i-e-f-t-a-in-e-s-s)''.&lt;ref&gt;There is a similar restriction against spanning root and suffix. However, in application this is somewhat arbitrary: ''fruity'' does not use the ''-ity'' abbreviation, but ''equally'' and ''totally'' use ''-ally''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''-full'' does not use {{bc2|⠰|⠇}} {{angle bracket|ful}} in order to preserve the parallel with the independent word ''full''. However, ''-ful'' and ''-fully'' do.

When there are several ways to write a word, the shortest one is chosen, and when they are of equal length, the one without (two-cell) abbreviations is chosen. So, ''thence'' is written ''th-ence'' (3 cells) rather than ''the-n-c-e'' (4 cells). However, with the sequences ''-anced, -ancer, -enced, -encer'', the form with ''-ance/-ence'' is used even if not shorter.

Braille also uses print abbreviations such as ''ea., Mon., Sept., etc.,'' in which case the period {{bc2|⠲}} is used as in print.

==Spacing==
A single space {{angle bracket|{{Braille box|0}}}} (a blank cell, which has the same width as all other cells) is left between words and sentences. Paragraphs are indented with a double space. This is universal in braille, even when transcribing a printed text that does not indent paragraphs: Blank lines are not used for this in braille, though they may be used for changes of scene, etc. As much as possible, lines continue to the right margin, with words divided and hyphenated to fit. If this would cause an illegal sequence of ligature or contraction and hyphen, the spelling needs to be decomposed, or the word hyphenated differently.

The full cell {{angle bracket|{{Braille box|123456}}}} is used to over-type and strike out errors when using a braille writer.  (Mistakes may also be erased by smoothing them out, but this runs the risk of making the corrected letter illegible.)

The full cell may also indicate a missing value in a table. It can also function more generally as a column marker to keep the data in a table aligned.  For example, a row in a table of punctuation, where the columns contain symbols of different lengths, could be written,

:{{Braille box|123456|2|0|0|123456|bb|0|0|123456|cc|0|0|123456|dd|0|0|123456|ff|0|0}}{{Braille box|123456|gg|gg|0|123456|hh|0|0|123456|hh|jj|0|123456|in|in|0|123456|34|0|0}}

:{| class=wikitable
|-
|, || ; || : || . || ! || ( ) || ? || “ ” || * || /
|}

(For an illustration of such use, see the alphabet chart in the box at [[Russian Braille]], where a column marker sets off each letter of the alphabet and each mark of punctuation.)

==Unified English Braille==
{{main|Unified English Braille}}
Unified English Braille (UEB) is an attempted unified standard for English Braille, proposed in 1991 to the [[Braille Authority of North America]] (BANA).&lt;ref name="iceb.org"/&gt; The motivation for UEB was that the proliferation of specialized braille codes—which sometimes assigned conflicting values to even basic letters and numbers—was threatening not just braille-literacy, but also the viability of English braille itself. Also, the irregularities of English Braille made automated transcription inaccurate, and therefore increased the cost and time required to print in braille. In 1993, the UEB project was adopted by the [[International Council on English Braille]], and expanded to cover the various national systems of the member states:  Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An additional goal became adoption of a single standard for all braille encoding, apart from [[Braille music|music]]; with the exception of math-notation, this was largely achieved.  New Zealand officially retains [[Māori Braille]] as compatible with UEB, and BANA officially retains Nemeth Code as a math-notation option alongside UEB for the United States.&lt;ref name="bana-adopts-ueb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brailleauthority.org/pressreleases/pr-2012november.html |title=BANA Adopts UEB |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 2012 |work= |publisher=[[Braille Authority of North America]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finalized form as of 2013, UEB upgrades English Braille Grade 2 (the literary coding used in several slightly-variable forms in different countries), obsoletes [[Computer Braille Code]] by making email/website/programming syntax part of literary coding, and in some ways competes with [[Nemeth Code]] by adding additional math-notation (albeit [[Henry Martyn Taylor|Taylor]]-style with the numerals overwriting letters rather than overwriting punctuation as in Nemeth) to the literary coding.  Compared to the American standard described in this article, Unified English has the following differences:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm11/bm1111/bm111107.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Readings: Several have been eliminated, due to ambiguity or translation problems: the letters ''dd'' and ''-ble'', the contractions ''by, com-, to, into,'' and ''o'clock,'' and the capitalized abbreviations ''-ally'' and ''-ation.''
#Spacing: Words such as ''and the'' are to be spaced in braille just as they are in print (formerly they were typically run together as ''andthe'')
#Formatting: Bold, underline, and italics now have separate formatting marks (formerly it was impossible to distinguish between underlined-braille and italicized-braille).  A triple capital sign now indicates a passage in all-caps.
#Punctuation: New opening and closing parentheses {{bc2|⠐|⠣}} and {{bc2|⠐|⠜}} (which previously were ambiguous). Various brackets, quotation marks, dashes, and other punctuation (including notably mathematical and arithmetical notations such as the equals sign) have been added, so that printed text can be reproduced less ambiguously.
#Uniformity:  UEB is likely to become the worldwide standard for English-language braille (see [[Unified English Braille|full article]] for details)
#Extensibility:  provisions have been made for adding new symbols, without causing new conflicts
#Miscellaneous changes:  various other differences exist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dotlessbraille.org/UEBvsEBAE.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following punctuation is retained:

The Grade 2 single opening quotation mark is also retained, but the closing equivalent is changed.

The right-side abbreviation and formatting marks are used to derive quotation marks and mathematical symbols, by combining them with lower-half punctuation and four letters which graphically resemble ( ) / \.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libbraille.org/extra/unified_english_braille_alphabet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''English as a Second Language''' ('''ESL''') '''Podcast''''' is a web-based English language-learning [[podcast]]. It is the first and longest-running English language learning podcast on the Internet. It was launched in July 2005 by two former university professors, Dr. Jeff McQuillan and Dr. Lucy Tse of the Center for Educational Development in Los Angeles, California. ESL Podcast produces four main services: free audio lessons, supplementary Learning Guides, a blog on American culture and English learning, and specialty courses.

==Overview==
The purpose of English as a Second Language Podcast is to teach English by using everyday phrases and expressions spoken at a slow rate of speech, followed by explanations of what these expressions mean and how to use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McQuillan|first=Jeff|title=Tuning into podcasting: Language on the Go|journal=International Journal for Foreign Language Teaching|year=2006|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.tprstories.com/ijflt/IJFLTWinter06.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podcast411&gt;{{cite web |last=Walch |first=Rob |title=Podcast411 |url=http://www.podcast411.com |work=Item #95: Interview with Jeff McQuillan, ESL Podcast |format=MP3 |date=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learners access the lessons for free on the website or via a piece of podcast/RSS feed software such as [[iTunes]]. ESL Podcast uses a pedagogical approach based upon research in [[second language acquisition]] focusing on providing [[comprehensible input]] in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuillan|first=Jeff|title=The iPod in Education: Potential for Language Acquisition|year=2006|publisher=Apple Computers|location=Cupertino, CA|pages=12|url=https://images.apple.com/au/education/docs/Apple-iPodLangAcquisition.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESL Podcast is intended for intermediate and advanced English learners and consists of three weekly episodes: two dialog-based episodes (Mondays and Fridays) and the longer, culturally-focused English Café (Wednesdays). Dialog-based episodes contain a slow reading of an exchange in conversational English, followed by an explanation of the key vocabulary, and then a native-rate reading of the same dialog. The English Café typically covers two major topics of cultural importance to learners of American English, followed by a short question-and-answer segment based on listener input.&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{cite web|last=Zilm|first=Kerstin|url=http://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2009/09/04/sprechen-sie-deutsch/|title=Englisch per Podcast: Sprachenlernen mit Humor|publisher=Deutschlandfunk (German National Radio)|accessdate=1 September 2011|language=German,English|format=MP3|date=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Czech&gt;{{cite web |last=Bala |first=Rostislav |title=If you can't understand it, you can't acquire it: Interview with Jeff McQuillan |url=http://vyuka.jazyku.cz/l.php?id=248 |work=výuka.jazyků.cz (Language Learning) |accessdate=14 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331104721/http://vyuka.jazyku.cz/l.php?id=248 |archivedate=31 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, ESL Podcast has released more than 1000 self-contained episodes. It is not a traditional course, with a beginning and an end, and there are no quizzes or exercises. The episodes are not sequenced but are based on a set of broad themes from which the learner can choose, such as English for business, travel, daily life, health and fitness, shopping, and more.&lt;ref name=German /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diario&gt;{{cite news|last=Sturm|first=Constanza|title=Internet desata fiebre por aprender ingles, aleman y hasta chino de manera gratuita|url=http://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/wp-content/Media/Diario_Financiero_Chile.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=Diario Financiero (Chile)|date=20 December 2007|page=25|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplementary materials are available for each lesson in the form of an 8-10 page PDF Learning Guide, available to subscribers of the podcast for a fixed monthly fee. Like other popular language podcasts such as [[ChinesePod]], ESL Podcast uses a "[[freemium]]" business model, where the audio files are provided for free but the supplementary materials require a paid membership.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Kevin|title=How to Get Your Message Out Fast and Free Using Podcasts|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Publishing|location=Ocala, FL|isbn=978-1-60138-120-0|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosts==

'''Eric Eldred''' (born 1943) is an American [[literacy]] advocate and the proprietor of the unincorporated [[Eldritch Press]].

Eric Eldred has been described as a former computer programmer and systems administrator, a Boston writer, and a New Hampshire-based technical analyst. He is an independent scholar and first published online all of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s works, as well as scanning many works for [[Project Gutenberg]] and others.

Eldred co-founded [[Creative Commons]] and served on its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/history|title=Creative Commons: History|accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Eldred grew up in [[Florida]], graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1966 (philosophy, general studies), and then became a [[conscientious objector]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He was ordered to work for two years as alternative service, at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]], where he was a respiratory therapist and a chief pulmonary technologist until 1987. After he bought an [[Apple II]] computer in 1980, he was active in Apple users' groups and went to Harvard Extension School (programming and technical writing, C.A.S. 1991). Then he worked as an engineer at [[Apollo Computer]] (later [[Hewlett-Packard]]), and Cahners Publishing as a technical analyst and computer magazine journalist, then for Wang Government Services as a senior Unix systems administrator, before becoming disabled from [[repetitive strain injury]].

He lived{{when|date=July 2017}} in an [[Internet Archive|Internet]] [[Bookmobile]] traveling the U.S. visiting schools and libraries and special events to show readers how to print their own free books.

Eldred is divorced, with three (triplet) daughters.

== Eldritch Press ==
Eldritch Press is a website which republished the works of others in the [[public domain]] (no longer subject to [[copyright]]). For some years Eldritch Press ran on a Linux server from Eldred's home and is now hosted by [[Ibiblio]] and no longer maintained by him. Its principal feature was experimentation with [[HTML]] formats and the inclusion of graphics (while maintaining accessibility for blind readers) for online books that earlier had mostly been in [[ASCII]] format. Since the works, and Eldred's derivative works based on them, are in the [[public domain]], anyone can make use of them, host them, and create more works of their own without payment or credit.

In 2004, Eldred was denied a permit at [[Walden Pond]] State Reservation to print and give away free copies of ''[[Walden]]'' on the 150th anniversary of its publication.  In 2005, Eldred returned with a permit, secured with the help of the [[Berkman Center]] for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, to print and give away copies of the book, and to demonstrate to readers how to self-publish and regain control of their own culture.

== Eldred v. Ashcroft ==
In 1998, the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] was passed, preventing Eldred's plans to scan and publish works first published in the U.S. after 1922.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2004/story_lessig_marapr04.msp&lt;/ref&gt;  He later became the lead plaintiff in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', a lawsuit which challenged the [[United States constitutional law|constitutionality]] of this act but lost in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">The '''Framework for Intervention''' is a preventive approach to meet concerns about behaviour in [[school]]s and nurseries. It concentrates on helping staff to change the school environment, rather than the child. This means that all the factors that might affect the student or child's behaviour in the classroom or around the school can be analysed. To change the environment it offers teachers and other school staff a structure for planning,carrying out and evaluating their ideas. 

Evaluation has shown that changing something in the environment for the better almost always improves the behaviour of the child, and also the behaviour of others in the class.

It was introduced by [[Birmingham]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]) [[City Council Education Department]] in 1997 and now being used across the UK and Ireland. In [[Norway]] where it is known as "[http://www.eldhusetfagforum.no/finstil/english.htm Fin Stil]" (Fine Style), it was due to be extended nationwide from 2009.

'''Frederick Schoenfeld''' aka '''Fritz Schoenfeld''' (1810, [[Switzerland]] – 21 April 1868, [[Richmond, Victoria]]), was a Swiss-born Australian artist, [[Printmaking|printmaker]], [[Lithography|lithographer]] and art teacher. He is noted for providing the illustrations for the 6 volumes (1859–68) of ''[[Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae]]'' by [[Ferdinand von Mueller]], then director of the [[National Herbarium of Victoria]], and for ''The Plants Indigenous to the Colony of Victoria'' (1860–65) and ''Analytical Drawings of Australian Mosses'' (1864).

Schoenfeld arrived in Australia on 8 May 1858 on board the ''Scottish Chief'', and worked in Melbourne as a freelance artist, lithographer and drawing master. He was employed over the period 1859 until 1862 by [[Frederick McCoy]], director of the [[National Museum of Victoria]] in Melbourne, to draw and lithograph plates for McCoy's books, ''Prodromus of the Palaeontology of Victoria'' and ''Prodromus of the Zoology of Victoria'', both published in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;A Banksia Album: Two Hundred Years of Botanical Illustration - Page 122 Alex George - 2012 "Painter and lithographer Schoenfeld moved to Melbourne from Switzerland in 1858. He worked with Ferdinand von Mueller at the Melbourne Botanic Gardens and with Frederick McCoy at the National Museum ofVictoria, producing botanical "&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s Schoenfeld gave drawing classes at the "{{Lang|de|Melbourner Deutscher [[Turnverein]]}}", but when the club’s premises were destroyed by a fire in December 1866 he was left with no regular income. He became depressed about his straitened circumstances and after an unsuccessful first attempt at suicide, drowned himself in a water-filled quarry at Richmond. He was survived by his wife Philippine, née Phen.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Australian Artists: painters, sketchers, photographers and engravers to 1870''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daao.org.au/bio/frederick-schoenfeld/biography/?

Established in 2006, the Centre is entrusted to manage and develop the University’s extensive and valuable art collection, to coordinate the busy exhibition programme of the Gus Fisher Gallery, and to support and guide the student team that leads the activities of the online and onsite student-curated gallery, Window. The Centre also liaises closely with those other parts of the University engaged in similar or complementary activities with a view to maximising opportunities to profile key initiatives. The Centre was originally named the Centre for New Zealand Art Research and Discovery (CNZARD) but was renamed the Centre for Art Research in 2012.

==The University of Auckland Art Collection==

Auckland: Woolmore Publishing,1983.&lt;/ref&gt; However, its most poignant value lies in its use as a resource for teaching, learning and research. Available on loan to departments and faculties on all campuses, the Collection has been built up over forty years to include major works by significant artists such as [[Frances Hodgkins]], [[Colin McCahon]], [[Billy Apple]] and [[Ralph Hotere]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Michael. "The University of Auckland". ''Art New Zealand''. Number 26, Autumn 1983: 48&lt;/ref&gt; Outcomes from postgraduate research on the Collection have included a thesis on its own history as an entity, monograph exhibitions on individual artists, and surveys of the impact of the evolution of the Collection on Auckland’s dealer galleries, resulting in the exhibitions and publications Vuletic and His Circle (about the Petar/James Gallery) in 2003 and New Vision Gallery in 2008.

'''Hamilton Technical College''' is a [[technical college]] in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], [[Iowa]].

== History ==
Hamilton Technical College was founded in 1969 by Charles and Maryanne Hamilton as the Academy of Radio and Television (A.R.T.) in Bettendorf, IA.  The first classes were held for six students around the dinner table of the Hamiltons and the first curriculum was focused on passing the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) exam.  Curriculum was then expanded to prepare students to become broadcasters. The first formal classes began in 1970 at 1120 State Street in [[Bettendorf, IA]]. To accommodate a growing number of students, classes were moved to a larger building on State Street. 
In 1978 an [[Electronics]] program was added and A.R.T acquired recognition as a Technical College specializing in Electronics Engineering Technology. The school was then renamed A.R.T. Technical College. The Electronics Engineering program offered was for an associate degree attainable in just 18 months. In 1980 the name was changed to Hamilton Technical College. [[File:Hamilton Tech - Front Entrance.jpg|thumb|Hamilton Front Entrance]]
From 1980-1991 there were many changes. An Aviation Maintenance Technology program was added, with classes being held at the [[Davenport Municipal Airport (Iowa)|Davenport Municipal Airport]] in Mt. Joy, IA. The Hamilton Institute of Business, a branch of Hamilton Tech began offering an Associate of Occupational Technology degree in Computer Information Systems. 
In 1990, Hamilton began the Computer-Aided Drafting program offering an Associate of Occupational Studies in 19 months. 
In 1991, Hamilton Technical College moved all classes to their current location at 10111 53rd St, [[Davenport, IA]].  This year the Aerotech program also ended. Also in 1991, the Medical Assisting Technology program began which earned students a diploma in just 9 months.

In the summer of 2006 Hamilton Technical College began construction and remodeling of the current buildings. The building at the East end has been renovated to house the Advanced Electronics Center. Many equipment improvements have been made in this area. Some of the equipment that was added include: [[CNC Lathe]], Mill, [[Industrial Robot]]ics, [[Oscilloscope]]s, and computer testing equipment. The West end of the building currently houses the Medical Assisting program as well as the Development Center.

Currently, Hamilton Technical College offers an Associate and Bachelor of Science Degrees in [[Electronics]] Engineering Technology, a diploma in Medical Assisting Technology and a diploma in Medical Insurance Coding and Billing.

== Students and faculty ==
Hamilton Technical College has approximately 300 students. There are approximately 25 full-time staff and 5 part-time staff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16564">The '''Highlander Research and Education Center''', formerly known as the '''Highlander Folk School''', is a social justice leadership training school and cultural center in [[New Market, Tennessee]]. Founded in 1932 by activist [[Myles Horton]], educator [[Don West (educator)|Don West]], and [[Methodist]] minister [[James A. Dombrowski]], it was originally located in the community of Summerfield in [[Grundy County, Tennessee]], between [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]] and [[Tracy City, Tennessee|Tracy City]]. It was featured in the 1985 documentary film, ''[[You Got to Move]]''. Much of the history was documented in the book "Or We'll All Hang Separately: The Highlander Idea" by Thomas Bledsoe.

Highlander provides training and education for emerging and existing movement leaders throughout the South, Appalachia, and the world. Some of Highlander's earliest contributions were during the [[labor movement]] in [[Appalachia]] and throughout the [[Southern United States]]. During the 1950s, it played a critical role in the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]. It trained civil rights leader [[Rosa Parks]] prior to her historic role in the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], as well as providing training for many other movement activists, including members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), [[Septima Clark]], [[Anne Braden]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[James Bevel]], [[Hollis Watkins]], [[Bernard Lafayette]], [[Ralph Abernathy]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] in the mid- and-late 1950s. Backlash against the school's involvement with the Civil Rights Movement led to the school's closure by the state of Tennessee in 1961. Staff reorganized and moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they rechartered Highlander under the name "Highlander Research and Education Center." Highlander has been in its current (and longest consecutive) home in New Market, TN, since 1971.

==History==

===Early years===
The Highlander Folk School was originally established in Grundy County, Tennessee, on land donated for this purpose by educator [[Lilian Wyckoff Johnson]]. When Highlander was founded in 1932, the United States was in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. Workers in all parts of the country were met with major resistance by employers when they tried to organize [[trade union|labor unions]], especially in the South. Against that backdrop, Horton, West and Dombrowski created the Highlander School "to provide an educational center in the South for the training of rural and industrial leaders, and for the conservation and enrichment of the indigenous cultural values of the mountains." Horton was influenced by observing [[Folk high school|rural adult education schools]] in [[Denmark]] started in the 19th century by Danish Lutheran Bishop [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald N. Roberson, Jr., 2002, [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/1a/10/dc.pdf The Seeds of Social Change from Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s and 1940s, the school's main focus was labor education and the training of labor organizers. In the 1930s, [[Myra Page]] taught here.&lt;ref name=Booker&gt;

===Civil rights===
In the 1950s, Highlander turned its energies to the rising issues of [[civil rights]] and [[desegregation]]. In addition to Myles Horton and others, a key figure during this period was John Beauchamp Thompson, a minister and educator who became one of the principal fund-raisers and speakers for the school.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Highlander worked with [[Esau Jenkins]] of [[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]] to develop a literacy program for Blacks who were prevented from registering to vote by literacy requirements. The Citizenship Education Schools coordinated by [[Septima Clark]] with assistance from Bernice Robinson spread widely throughout the South and helped thousands of Blacks register to vote. Later, the program was transferred to the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], because the state of Tennessee was threatening to close the school.

The civil rights anthem, "[[We Shall Overcome]]", was adapted from a [[gospel music|gospel]] song, by Highlander music director [[Zilphia Horton]], wife of Myles Horton, from the singing of striking tobacco factory workers in South Carolina in 1946.  Shortly afterward, it was published by [[folksong|folksinger]] [[Pete Seeger]] in the [[People's Songs]] bulletin. It was revived at Highlander by [[Guy Carawan]], who succeeded Zilphia Horton as Highlander's music director in 1959. [[Guy Carawan]] taught the song to [[SNCC]] at their first convening at Shaw University. The song has since spread and become one of the most recognizable movement songs in the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Backlash===
In reaction to the school's work, during the late 1950s, Southern newspapers attacked Highlander for supposedly creating racial strife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/highlander-folk-school/"Tennessee Encyclopedia"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Commission on Education published a pamphlet titled "Highlander Folk School: Communist Training School, Monteagle, Tennessee".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/meta/html/dlg/efhf/meta_dlg_efhf_efhf003.html "Labor Day Weekend at Communist Training School,"] broadside published by Georgia Commission on Education, 1957, Series I., Subseries A, S. Ernest Vandiver collection, Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies, University of Georgia, Athens, as presented in the Digital Library of Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt; A controversial photograph of Martin Luther King and writer, trade union organizer, civil rights activist and co-founder of the Highlander School Donald Lee West, was published.  According to information obtained by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], West was the District Director of the Communist Party in North Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;[http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/hfschool.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation, Highlander Folk School]&lt;/ref&gt; though West denied he had ever been a member of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/html_use/E-0016.html Interview with Don West], January 22, 1975. Interview E-0016. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007), Documenting the American South (DocSouth), University Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Jacquelyn Hall and Ray Faherty, interviewers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the state of Tennessee revoked Highlander's charter, and confiscated and auctioned the school's land and property.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Glen, ''Highlander: No Ordinary School'', The University Press of Kentucky, 1988, pp. 184–209.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Septima Clark's autobiography, ''Echo In My Soul'' (page 225), the Highlander Folk School was closed, because it engaged in commercial activities in violation its charter. The Highlander Folk School was chartered by the State of Tennessee as a non-profit corporation without stockholders or owners. Once the State revoked its charter, no one could make a legal claim on any of the property. In 1961, the Highlander staff reincorporated as the Highlander Research and Education Center and moved to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. In 1971, it relocated to [[New Market, Tennessee]].

===Appalachian issues===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Highlander focused on worker health and safety in the coalfields of [[Appalachia]]. Its leaders played a role in the emergence of the region's [[environmental justice]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} It helped start the Southern Appalachian Leadership Training (SALT) program, and coordinated a survey of land ownership in Appalachia. In the 1980s and 1990s, Highlander broadened their base into broader regional, national, and international [[environmentalism]]; [[anti-globalization movement|struggles]] against the negative effects of [[globalization]]; grassroots leadership development in under-resourced communities. Beginning in the 1990s, became involved in [[LGBT]] issues, both in the U.S. and internationally.

==Since 2000==
Current focuses of Highlander include issues of [[democratization|democratic participation]] and  [[economic justice]], with a particular focus on [[youth]], [[immigration|immigrants]] to the U.S. from Latin America, [[African American]]s, LGBT, and [[poverty|poor]] white people.

In 2014, the Tennessee Preservation Trust placed the original Grundy County school building on its list of the ten most "endangered" historic sites in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/davidson/2014/10/29/nashville-named-endangered-list/18075319/ | title=Nashville — all of it — named to 'endangered' list | date=October 29, 2014 | website=Tennessean.com | accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| In 1932, Myles Horton and Don West founded Highlander Folk School, located ½ mile north of this site.  It quickly became one of the few schools in the South committed to the cause of organized labor, economic justice, and an end to racial segregation. Courses included labor issues, literacy, leadership, and non-violent desegregation strategies, with workshops led by Septima Clark.  The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and Eleanor Roosevelt found inspiration for the modern civil rights movement there.  Opponents of its causes tried to close the school.

| Following a 1959–1960 trial in Grundy County, the State of Tennessee revoked the school's charter. It was adjudged to have violated segregation laws, sold beer without a license, and conveyed property to Myles Horton for his home. When the sheriff padlocked the school, Horton proclaimed Highlander to be an idea rather than simply a group of buildings, adding "You can't padlock an idea." In a 1979 Ford Foundation Report, Highlander was singled out as the most notable American experiment in adult education for social change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Notable staff==

===James Still===
[[James Still]] was a notable poet, folklorist, and novelist during his life, spanning 95 years from 1906 to 2001. James Still's friend, [[Don West (educator)|Don West]] offered him a job organizing recreational programs for a settlement school in Knott County, Kentucky. James Still gladly accepted the invitation to teach in Knott County. James Still soon became a librarian at the Hindman Settlement School Library and spent the rest of his days in Knott County. James Still is buried on the Hindman Settlement School Campus.

===Fred Williams===
Fred Williams was principal at Hindman Settlement School in the mid-1940s. A close friend of [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], Williams was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] missionary who pioneered indoor and running water sanitation in rural India ([[Asansol]]) and fought to eradicate caste-based discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi's American Ally, 2008. https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/norm-williams/gandhis-american-ally/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marie Stewart Museum &amp; Craft Shop==
The Marie Stewart Museum &amp; Craft Shop supports the activities of the school.  The store sells traditional [[Appalachia]]n crafts and has an online site.  Upstairs is a small museum with exhibits about the Hindman Settlement School and regional crafts.&lt;ref name="school"/&gt;

==The school and the study of folksong==
The School's goal of integrating traditional culture with education led it to welcome visiting outsiders who sought to document the musical heritage of the Appalachians, notably in [[folk song]]. The fieldwork teams of [[Loraine Wyman]] with [[Howard Brockway]], and [[Cecil Sharp]] with [[Maud Karpeles]], working in the years of the First World War, found a wealth of beautiful melody and texts from singers at the School or from the local neighborhood.

'''Income-based repayment''' or '''income-driven repayment''' is a student loan repayment program in the US that regulates the amount that one needs to pay each month basing on one’s current income and family size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-income-based-repayment-ibr-en-633/|title=What is Income-Based Repayment (IBR)?|website=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is an umbrella term for four specific repayment plans that are available within the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loan Program. These four repayment plans are also named Income-Based Repayment (IBR), [[Pay as You Earn (PAYE) - Federal Student Loan Relief Program|Pay As You Earn]] (PAYE), Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE), and [[Income-contingent repayment|Income-Contingent Repayment]] (ICR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601073223/http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/05/income-driven-repayment/|title=How to Make Student Loan Payments Based on Your Income {{!}} ED.gov Blog|date=2015-06-01|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mechanics==
Payments under the IBR Plan are 10% or 15% of discretionary income, but will never be more than the 10-year standard repayment amount. Whether a borrower pays 10% or 15% of discretionary income depends on when the borrower first started borrowing student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/ibr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payments under the PAYE Plan are 10% of discretionary income, but will never be more than the 10-year standard repayment amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/payasyouearn |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payments under the REPAYE Plan are also 10% of discretionary income; however, unlike IBR and PAYE, payments for high-income borrowers may be higher than the 10-year standard repayment amount. Also, unlike IBR and PAYE, if required monthly payments do not cover the accruing interest, 50% of the unpaid interest is forgiven, thereby reducing negative amortization.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ed.gov/2015/12/your-federal-student-loans-just-got-easier-to-repaye/&lt;/ref&gt;

Payments under the ICR Plan are the lesser of 20% of discretionary income or a 12-year standard repayment amount adjusted based on the borrower's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/icr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-latest-student-loan-charade-1402356675|title=The Latest Student-Loan Charade - WSJ|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Eligibility requirements for the income-driven repayment plans depends on which plan the borrower chooses and when the student borrowed.

The ICR Plan has the fewest number of eligibility requirements. A borrower is only required to have an eligible loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/icr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBR and Pay As You Earn Plans require that the borrower demonstrate a "need" to make income-driven payments and have eligible loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/ibr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/payasyouearn |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pay As You Earn Plan is limited to those who borrowed recently. Specifically, the borrower must be a "new borrower" as of October 1, 2007 and have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after October 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/payasyouearn |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A borrower is a "new borrower" if, when receiving a federal student loan on or after October 1, 2007, the borrower did not have an outstanding balance on another federal student loan.

The Revised Pay As You Earn Plan is available to all Direct Loan borrowers regardless of when the money was borrowed. FFEL loans can be made eligible if they are consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan.

==Eligible loans==
Eligible loans for the ICR Plan are all loans made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program except Parent PLUS Loans. However, if a Parent PLUS Loan is consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan, then the Direct Consolidation Loan may be repaid under the ICR Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/icr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligible loans for the IBR Plan are all loans made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and Federal Family Education Loan Program except for Parent PLUS Loans. Unlike ICR, Parent PLUS Loans cannot be consolidated into a consolidation loan in order to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/ibr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligible loans for the PAYE Plan are all loans made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program except for Parent PLUS Loans. Unlike ICR, Parent PLUS Loans cannot be consolidated into a consolidation loan in order to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/payasyouearn |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowers with Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans and Federal Perkins Loan Program loans may become eligible for the ICR, Pay As You Earn, and Revised Pay As You Earn plans by consolidating them into a Direct Consolidation Loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/icr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/payasyouearn |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A "need" to make income-driven payments==
The IBR and PAYE Plans require that borrowers demonstrate a "need" to make income-driven payments. This debt-to-income test checks to see whether the borrower would see a payment amount reduction under the IBR or PAYE Plan relative to the 10-year standard repayment plan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/05/income-driven-repayment/|title=How to Make Student Loan Payments Based on Your Income &amp;#124; ED.gov Blog|date=2014-05-29|publisher=Ed.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601073223/http://www.ed.gov/blog/2014/05/income-driven-repayment/|archivedate=2015-06-01|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different terms and conditions under the IBR Plan==
The IBR Plan has different terms and conditions depending on when the student borrowed. If the borrower is a "new borrower" on or after July 1, 2014, then the borrower will have payments that are generally 10% of discretionary income and forgiveness is provided for after 20 years of qualifying payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/ibr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a borrower is not a new borrower on or after July 1, 2014, then payments will generally be 15% of discretionary income and forgiveness is provided for after 25 years of qualifying repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/ibr |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the definition of "new borrower" for Pay As You Earn, a new borrower for the IBR Plan is one who, when receiving a federal student loan on or after July 1, 2014, the borrower did not have an outstanding balance on another federal student loan.

==Determining eligibility==
Utilizing the repayment estimator [http://studentaid.gov/repayment-estimator online], a borrower can estimate his other monthly payments under all repayment plans, including IBR. However, the repayment estimator can only estimate eligibility. To receive an official determination of eligibility, a borrower must contact his or her loan servicer. The [[National Student Loan Data System]] (Nslds.ed.gov) can let a borrower know who is the servicer of his/her loan.

==Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program==
The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program provides for the forgiveness of certain types of federal student loans after 10 years of qualifying employment and payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/publicservice |title=Public Service Loan Forgiveness &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBR plan is one of the qualifying repayment plans for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/publicservice |title=Public Service Loan Forgiveness &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, to receive Public Service Loan Forgiveness, borrower must have repaid their loans under one of the "income-driven repayment plans", including IBR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/publicservice |title=Public Service Loan Forgiveness &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applying for an income-driven repayment plan==
To apply for an income-driven repayment plan, the borrower needs to submit the Income-Driven Repayment Plan Request and provide information about family size and income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1408Attachment.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420155453/http://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1408Attachment.pdf|date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Income can take the form of tax information (adjusted gross income), or "alternative documentation of income", such as a pay stub.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Tax information, as well as the application, itself, and certification of family size, may be provided electronically through StudentLoans.gov.&lt;ref name="studentloans1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action |title=StudentLoans.gov |publisher=StudentLoans.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If completing the application electronically, a borrower may transfer tax information into the application directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).&lt;ref name="studentloans1"/&gt;

According to the application, borrowers may also self-certify that they currently have no income, thus avoiding needing to try and document that they have no income.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Because the eligibility criteria are complex, the application allows borrowers to indicate that they want their loan servicer to determine which of the income-driven plans the borrower is eligible for, and to place the borrower on the income-driven plan with the lowest monthly payment amount.

==Which plan to choose==
Most borrowers seeking an income-driven plan should choose Revised Pay As You Earn. The REPAYE plan provides benefits that the IBR, ICR, and PAYE plans do not, including a 50% interest subsidy if the required payment does not cover the accruing interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentaid.gov/payasyouearn |title=Income-Driven Plans &amp;#124; Federal Student Aid |publisher=Studentaid.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there could be disadvantages to choosing the REPAYE plan which could result in higher amounts being paid over the life of the loan or very high monthly payments for borrowers with high incomes.

==Recent announcements==
On June 9, 2014, President Obama announced that the Department of Education would modify the PAYE Plan so that it is available to all borrowers, regardless of when they borrowed.&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/09/presidential-memorandum-federal-student-loan-repayments |title=Presidential Memorandum - Federal Student Loan Repayments &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new repayment plan, Revised Pay As You Earn, launched on December 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-announces-availability-additional-flexible-repayment-plan-help-borrowers-manage-their-student-loan-debt&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Education Office of Inspector General recently calculated that the portion of total Direct Loan volume being repaid through IDR plans has increased 625 percent from the FY 2011 loan cohort ($7.1 billion) to the FY 2015 loan cohort ($51.5 billion). For IDR plans, the Federal government is expected to lend more money than borrowers repay. From the FY 2011 through FY 2015 loan cohorts, the total positive subsidy cost (net cash outflow) for student loans being repaid through IDR plans has increased 748 percent (from $1.4 billion to $11.5 billion)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/auditreports/fy2018/a09q0003.pdf|title=The Department’s Communication Regarding the Costs of Income-Driven Repayment Plans and Loan Forgiveness Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''KNUST Senior High School''' is a [[co-educational]] institution in [[Kumasi]], [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;Amoh-Gyebi , Godwin. ''Knust Senior High School''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppong Frimpong Zafonic. ''Knust Senior High School''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The school's nickname, in the [[Akan language]], is ''Mmadwemma'', meaning people who carefully think before acting. Its [[motto]] is "Forward be our watchword". Approximately 600 students graduate each year. Mrs. Joyce Ansah is the current headmistress of the school. The school has a staff strength of 66 teachers and 21 non-teaching staff.

==Brief history==
KNUST Senior High School was formerly known as the Technology Secondary School until 2007. It offers high school education and it is within the [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]] in [[Kumasi]], [[Ghana]]. It was established in February 1961 by the then-vice chancellor of the University Of Science and Technology '''Dr. R.P. Baffour'''. The school being housed in prefabricated asbestos buildings thus started as the “Baby” of the University, that is, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in humble circumstances. From the onset, it was financed and staffed by the University. It was, however, hoped that the School would eventually move into permanent buildings on the University campus, and become a boarding institution.  From its foundation up to June 1967, the School retained the University Secondary Technical School.  The Technical course was abandoned because of lack of staff and facilities.  It has since been known and called '''Technology Secondary School'''. The school was originally set up to give secondary school education to the children of the university staff. The school later opened up admission to the general public. KNUST Senior High School is a ''Class A Institution'' according to the [[West African Examination Council]] and the Ghana Education Service. It is a [[coeducational]] school, with an enrollment of about 900 boys and 1010 girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twimovies.com/twi-schools/8509-knust-senior-high-school.html|title=Knust Senior High School |accessdate=2015-03-10 |publisher=Twi Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses offered==
The school offers the following courses:
*[[General arts]]
*[[Visual arts]]
*[[General science]]
*[[Business]]

'''Kelucharan Mohapatra''' (8 January 1926&amp;nbsp;– 7 April 2004) was a legendary [[Indian classical dance]]r, [[guru]], and exponent of [[Odissi]] dance, who is credited with the revival and popularizing of this classical dance form in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2DF153EF93AA25753C1A9669C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mad%20boy&amp;st=cse DANCE REVIEW; Sculptural And Sensual, It's Odissi] by Anna Kisselgoff, ''[[New York Times]]'', 19 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
He is the first person to receive the [[Padma Vibhushan]] from Odisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130126/jsp/odisha/story_16487304.jsp#.URDi_GduBtY |title=Sun dreamer gets Padma|first=Shilpi|last=Sampad|work=telegraphindia.com|quote=after late Odissi dancer Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra|accessdate=5 February 2013|location=Calcutta, India|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted Sanskrit poet of India writes on this ''Guru'': ''Saango-paanga-subhangi-laasya-madhuram samteerna-nrutyaarnavam'', which translates as - "Each fraction of his dancing body leads to paramount sweetness, through miraculous poses and postures. In fact, Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra crossed the ocean of styles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vanikavi Dr.Manmohan Acharya |url=http://www.srjan.com/guruji.aspx |title=SRJAN, Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra Odissi Nrityabasa |publisher=Srjan.com |date=1926-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910021257/http://http://www.srjan.com/GuruKelucharanMohapatra.php |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and History==
In his youth, Kelucharan Mohapatra performed [[Gotipua]] - a traditional dance form of [[Odisha]] where young boys dress up as woman to praise Lord [[Jagannath]]. Later in his life he did extensive research on [[Gotipua]] and [[Mahari dance]], which lead him to restructure [[Odissi]] dance. Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra was a master in Percussion instruments - [[Mridangam]], [[Pakhavaj]] and [[Tabla]], which clearly resonates in his dance compositions. He was also skilled in the traditional [[Pattachitra]] painting.

Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra along with his wife, Laxmipriya, herself a dancer, and their son [[Ratikant Mohapatra]] built Srjan in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.srjan.com/history_srjan_odissinrityabasa.php | title=History Of Srjan | publisher=Srjan | accessdate=3 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The real dance must convey the feeling of undivided existence, that a spectator can feel that he is not different from the thing observed".&lt;ref name=hi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20738">The '''Loebner Prize''' is an annual competition in [[artificial intelligence]] that awards prizes to the [[computer program]]s considered by the judges to be the most human-like. The format of the competition is that of a standard [[Turing test]]. In each round, a human judge simultaneously holds textual conversations with a computer program and a human being via computer. Based upon the responses, the judge must decide which is which.

The contest was launched in 1990 by [[Hugh Loebner]] in conjunction with the [[Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. Since 2014&lt;ref name=exeter&gt;[https://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/exeterblog/blog/2014/12/08/the-loebner-prize-a-turing-test-competition-at-bletchley-park/], ''The Loebner Prize, a Turing Test competition at Bletchley Park - The Exeter Blog'', Retrieved 8 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it has been organised by the [[Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour|AISB]] at [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref name=organisation&gt;[http://aisb.org.uk/events/loebner-prize Loebner Prize], ''AISB Website'', Retrieved 23 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been associated with [[Flinders University]], [[Dartmouth College]], the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[London]], [[University of Reading]] and [[Ulster University]], [[Magee Campus]], [[Derry]], [[UK City of Culture]].
In 2004 and 2005, it was held in Loebner's apartment in [[New York City]]. Within the field of artificial intelligence, the Loebner Prize is somewhat controversial; the most prominent critic, [[Marvin Minsky]], called it a publicity stunt that does not help the field along.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/ Artificial stupidity], ''Salon.com'', 16 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==
Originally, $2,000 was awarded for the most human-seeming program in the competition. The prize was $3,000 in 2005 and $2,250 in 2006. In 2008, $3,000 was awarded.

In addition, there are two one-time-only prizes that have never been awarded. $25,000 is offered for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from a real human and which can convince judges that the human is the computer program. $100,000 is the reward for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from a real human in a Turing test that includes deciphering and understanding text, visual, and auditory input. Once this is achieved, the annual competition will end.

==Competition rules and restrictions==
The rules have varied over the years and early competitions featured restricted conversation Turing tests&lt;ref&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers |4 |3 |"Machines Who Think"}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 1995 the discussion has been unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/Rules.html 2007 rules], [http://www.rdg.ac.uk/cirg/loebner/cirg-loebner-main.asp 2008 rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026004250/http://www.rdg.ac.uk/cirg/loebner/cirg-loebner-main.asp |date=2008-10-26 }} and [http://loebner.net/Prizef/2009_Contest/LP_2009.html 2009 rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222212543/http://loebner.net/Prizef/2009_Contest/LP_2009.html |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the three entries in 2007, Robert Medeksza, Noah Duncan and [[Rollo Carpenter]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/loebner-prize-2007.html 17th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence 21 October 2007 New York City]&lt;/ref&gt; some basic "screening questions" were used by the sponsor to evaluate the state of the technology. These included simple questions about the time, what round of the contest it is, etc.; general knowledge ("What is a hammer for?"); comparisons ("Which is faster, a train or a plane?"); and questions demonstrating memory for preceding parts of the same conversation. "All nouns, adjectives and verbs will come from a dictionary suitable for children or adolescents under the age of 12." Entries did not need to respond "intelligently" to the questions to be accepted.

For the first time in 2008 the sponsor allowed introduction of a preliminary phase to the contest opening up the competition to previously disallowed web-based entries judged by a variety of invited interrogators. The available rules do not state how interrogators are selected or instructed. Interrogators (who judge the systems) have limited time: 5 minutes per entity in the 2003 competition, 20+ per pair in 2004–2007 competitions, 5 minutes to conduct ''simultaneous'' conversations with a human and the program in 2008-2009, increased to 25 minutes of simultaneous conversation since 2010.

==Criticisms==

The prize has long been scorned by experts in the field,&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=David|title=The Total Turing Test and the Loebner Prize|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W98-1235|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a variety of reasons.

It is regarded by many as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name=Floridi09&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|last2=Taddeo|first2=Mariarosaria|last3=Turilli|first3=Matteo|title=Turing’s Imitation Game: Still an Impossible Challenge for All Machines and Some Judges––An Evaluation of the 2008 Loebner Contest|journal=Minds &amp; Machines|date=2009|issue=19|pages=145–150|doi=10.1007/s11023-008-9130-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sundman|first1=John|title=Artificial stupidity|url=http://www.salon.com/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/|website=Salon|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Minsky scathingly offered a "prize" to anyone who could stop the competition. Loebner responded by jokingly observing that Minsky's offering a prize to stop the competition effectively made him a co-sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minsky|first1=Marvin|title=Annual Minsky Loebner Prize Revocation Prize 1995 Announcement|url=http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/minsky.txt|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the competition have encouraged poorly qualified judges to make rapid judgements. Interactions between judges and competitors was originally very brief, for example effectively 2.5 mins of questioning, which permitted only a few questions.&lt;ref name="Floridi09" /&gt; Questioning was initially restricted to "whimsical conversation",&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; a domain suiting standard chatbot tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Richard|title=Chatbots fail to convince despite Loebner Prize win|journal=New Scientist|date=16 May 2012|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2012/05/chatbots-still-fail-to-convinc.html|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition entrants do not aim at understanding or intelligence but resort to basic [[ELIZA]] style tricks,&lt;ref name=Floridi09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serck|first1=ZLinda|title=Could a computer think?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2008/10/12/turing_test_feature.shtml|website=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successful entrants find deception and pretense is rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephens|first1=Kenneth R.|title=What Has the Loebner Contest Told Us About Conversant Systems?|url=http://www.behavior.org/resources/325.pdf|website=www.behavior.org|publisher=Operant WebSites, Inc.|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting of the annual competition often confuses the [[Turing test|imitation test]] with intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Humans have nothing to fear from intelligent machines|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9a6b6536-c372-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e.html#axzz4A29B1pUE|website=Financial Times|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a typical example being Brian Christian's introduction to his article "Mind vs. Machine" in The Atlantic, March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christian|first1=Brian|title=Mind vs. Machine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/mind-vs-machine/308386/|accessdate=29 May 2016|agency=The Atlantic|issue=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "in the race to build computers that ''can think like humans'', the proving ground is the Turing Test".

==Contests==

===2006===
In 2006, the contest was organised by [[Tim Child]] (CEO of Televirtual) and Huma Shah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2006_Contest/loebner-prize-2006.html Loebner Prize 2006 Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humashah.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html Lobner 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, the four finalists were announced:
* Rollo Carpenter
* Richard Churchill and Marie-Claire Jenkins
* Noah Duncan
* Robert Medeksza

The contest was held on 17 September in the VR theatre, Torrington Place campus of [[University College London]]. The judges included the University of Reading's [[cybernetics]] professor, [[Kevin Warwick]], a professor of artificial intelligence, John Barnden (specialist in metaphor research at the [[University of Birmingham]]), a barrister, Victoria Butler-Cole and a journalist, Graham Duncan-Rowe. The latter's experience of the event can be found in an article in ''[[Technology Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17518&amp;ch=in How To Be Human], ''Technology Review'', 20 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2006_Contest/loebner-prize-2006.html Loebner prize 2006], loebner.net&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was 'Joan', based on [[Jabberwacky]], both created by Rollo Carpenter.

===2007===
The 2007 competition was held on October 21 in New York City. The judges were: [[computer science]] professor Russ Abbott, philosophy professor [[Hartry Field]], psychology assistant professor Clayton Curtis and English lecturer [[Scott Hutchins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/loebner-prize-2007.html 17th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence], loebner.net&lt;/ref&gt;

No bot passed the Turing test, but the judges ranked the three contestants as follows:
* 1st: Robert Medeksza from Zabaware, creator of [[Ultra Hal Assistant]]
* 2nd: Noah Duncan, a private entry, creator of Cletus
* 3rd: Rollo Carpenter from Icogno, creator of Jabberwacky

The winner received $2,250 and the annual medal. The runners-up received $250 each.

===2008===
The 2008 competition was organised by professor Kevin Warwick, coordinated by Huma Shah and held on October 12 at the University of Reading, [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2008_Contest/loebner-prize-2008.html 18th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence 12 October 2008 University of Reading, Reading, UK]&lt;/ref&gt; After testing by over one hundred judges during the preliminary phase, in June and July 2008, six finalists were selected from thirteen original entrants - artificial conversational entity (ACE). Five of those invited competed in the finals:
*Brother Jerome, Peter Cole and Benji Adams
*[[Elbot]], Fred Roberts / [[Artificial Solutions]]
*[[Eugene Goostman]], Vladimir Veselov, Eugene Demchenko and Sergey Ulasen
*Jabberwacky, Rollo Carpenter
*Ultra Hal, Robert Medeksza

In the finals, each of the judges was given five minutes to conduct simultaneous, split-screen conversations with two hidden entities. Elbot&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elbot.com/ Elbot]&lt;/ref&gt; of Artificial Solutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artificial-solutions.com/ Artificial Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; won the 2008 Loebner Prize bronze award, for ''most human-like'' artificial conversational entity, through fooling three of the twelve judges who interrogated it (in the human-parallel comparisons) into believing it was human. This is coming very close to the 30% traditionally required to consider that a program has actually passed the Turing test. Eugene Goostman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonai.com/bot/botProcess.jsp Eugene Goostman]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ultra Hal&lt;ref&gt;[http://zabaware.com/assistant/ Ultra Hal]&lt;/ref&gt; both deceived one judge each that it was the human.

Will Pavia, a journalist for [[The Times]], has written about his experience; a Loebner finals' judge, he was deceived by Elbot and Eugene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article1859084.ece Machine takes on man at mass Turing Test]&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Warwick and Huma Shah have reported on the parallel-paired Turing tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/research/Highlights-News/featuresnews/res-featureloebner.asp parallel-paired Turing tests]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lojong''' (Tib. བློ་སྦྱོང་,{{bo|w=blo sbyong}}) is a '''mind training''' practice in the [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition based on a set of aphorisms formulated in [[Tibet]] in the 12th century by [[Chekawa Yeshe Dorje]]. The practice involves refining and purifying one's motivations and attitudes.

The fifty-nine or so slogans that form the root text of the mind training practice are designed as a set of antidotes to undesired mental habits that cause suffering. They contain both methods to expand one's viewpoint towards absolute [[bodhicitta]], such as "Find the consciousness you had before you were born" and "Treat everything you perceive as a dream", and methods for relating to the world in a more constructive way with relative [[bodhicitta]], such as "Be grateful to everyone" and "When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up."

Prominent teachers who have popularized this practice in the West include [[Pema Chödrön]],&lt;ref name="Joyful Mind"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pema |last=Chödrön |year=2007 |title=Always Maintain a Joyful Mind |location=Boston |publisher=Shambhala |isbn=978-1-59030-460-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken McLeod]], [[Alan Wallace]], [[Chögyam Trungpa]], [[Sogyal Rinpoche]], [[Kelsang Gyatso]], [[Zoketsu Norman Fischer|Norman Fischer]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dalai Lama |title=Transforming the Mind: Eight Verses on Generating Compassion and Transforming your Life |publisher=Thorsons |year=2000 |isbn=0-7225-3865-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the practice==
Lojong mind training practice was developed over a 300-year period between 900 and 1200 [[Common Era|CE]], as part of the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] school of [[Buddhism]]. [[Atisha|Atiśa]] (982–1054 CE), a Bengali meditation master, is generally regarded as the originator of the practice. It is described in his book ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa|Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathapradīpaṃ''). The practice is based upon his studies with the Sumatran teacher, [[Dharmakīrtiśrī]] (Tib. ''Serlingpa'', Wylie: gser gling pa), and the Indian teacher Dharmarakṣita, a prominent teacher at [[Odantapuri]] and author of a text called the ''Wheel of Sharp Weapons''. Both these texts are well known in Tibetan translation. Atiśa's third major teacher of lojong is said to have been the junior  Kusalī, known also as Maitrīyogi.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Kadam: The Core Texts'' (Library of Tibetan Classics) by Thupten Jinpa Wisdom Publications: 2008. {{ISBN|0861714415}} pg 628&lt;/ref&gt;

Atiśa journeyed to [[Sumatra]] and studied with Dharmakīrtiśrī for twelve years. He then returned to teach in India, but at an advanced age accepted an invitation to teach in Tibet, where he stayed for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kelsang |last=Gyatso |title=Joyful Path of Good Fortune: The Complete Buddhist Path to Enlightenment |pages=6–14 |publisher=Tharpa Publications |edition=2nd |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-948006-46-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A story is told that Atiśa heard that the inhabitants of Tibet were very pleasant and easy to get along with. Instead of being delighted, he was concerned that he would not have enough negative emotion to work with in his mind training practice. So he brought along his ill-tempered Bengali servant-boy, who would criticize him incessantly and was challenging to spend time with. Tibetan teachers then like to joke that when Atiśa arrived in Tibet, he realized there was no need after all.

The [[aphorisms]] on mind training in their present form were composed by [[Chekawa Yeshe Dorje]] (1101–1175 CE). According to one account, Chekhawa saw a text on his cell-mate's bed, open to the phrase: "Gain and victory to others, loss and defeat to oneself". The phrase struck him and he sought out the author [[Langri Tangpa]] (1054–1123).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Langri |last=Tangpa |url=http://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/geshe-langri-thangpa/eight-verses-training-mind  |title=Langri Tangpa's Eight Verses for Training the Mind |work=LotsawaHouse.org |publisher=Lotsawa House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding that Langri Tangpa had died, he studied instead with one of Langri Tangpa's students, [[Sharawa Yönten Drak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Sharawa |title=Sharawa Yönten Drak |work=RigpaWiki.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; for twelve years.

Chekhawa is claimed to have cured [[leprosy]] with mind training. In one account, he went to live with a colony of lepers and did the practice with them. Over time many of them were healed, more lepers came, and eventually people without leprosy also took an interest in the practice. Another popular story about Chekhawa and mind training concerns his brother and how it transformed him into a much kinder person.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso (2002), pages 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Root text==
The original Lojong practice consists of 59 slogans, or aphorisms. These slogans are further organized into seven groupings, called the "7 Points of Lojong".  The categorized slogans are listed below, translated by the Nalanda Translation Committee under the direction of [[Chögyam Trungpa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Pema |last=Chödrön |url=http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/pema/lojong3.php |title=Seven Points of Training the Mind: The Root Text |work=Shambhala.org |publisher=Shambhala International |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following is translated from ancient Sanskrit and Tibetan texts and may vary slightly from other translations. Many contemporary gurus and experts have written extensive commentaries elucidating the Lojong text and slogans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Point One: The preliminaries, which are the basis for [[dharma]] practice
:Slogan 1. First, train in the preliminaries; The four reminders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pema |last=Chödrön |url=http://www.lionsroar.com/dont-give-up/ |title=Lojong: How to Awaken Your Heart |publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]] |date=September 1, 2003|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively called the Four Thoughts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_thoughts |title=Four thoughts |work=RigpaWiki.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::1. Maintain an awareness of the preciousness of human life.
::2. Be aware of the reality that life ends; death comes for everyone; [[Impermanence]].
::3. Recall that whatever you do, whether virtuous or not, has a result; [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]].
::4. Contemplate that as long as you are too focused on self-importance and too caught up in thinking about how you are good or bad, you will experience [[Dukkha|suffering]]. Obsessing about getting what you want and avoiding what you don't want does not result in happiness; [[Anatta|Ego]].

Point Two: The main practice, which is training in [[bodhicitta]].
:''Absolute Bodhicitta''
:Slogan 2. Regard all dharmas as dreams; although experiences may seem solid, they are passing memories.
:Slogan 3. Examine the nature of unborn awareness.
:Slogan 4. Self-liberate even the antidote.
:Slogan 5. Rest in the nature of [[alaya]], the essence, the present moment.
:Slogan 6. In postmeditation, be a child of illusion.

:''Relative Bodhicitta''
:Slogan 7. Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. These two should ride the breath (aka. practice [[Tonglen]]).
:Slogan 8. Three objects, [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]], three roots of virtue -- The 3 objects are friends, enemies and neutrals.  The 3 poisons are craving, aversion and indifference.  The 3 roots of virtue are the remedies.
:Slogan 9. In all activities, train with slogans.
:Slogan 10. Begin the sequence of sending and taking with yourself.

Point Three: Transformation of Bad Circumstances into the Way of Enlightenment
:Slogan 11. When the world is filled with evil, transform all mishaps into the path of bodhi.
:Slogan 12. Drive all blames into one.
:Slogan 13. Be grateful to everyone.
:Slogan 14. Seeing confusion as the four kayas is unsurpassable [[shunyata]] protection.
:: The kayas are [[Dharmakaya]], [[sambhogakaya]], [[nirmanakaya]], svabhavikakaya. Thoughts have no birthplace, thoughts are unceasing, thoughts are not solid, and these three characteristics are interconnected. Shunyata can be described as "complete openness."
:Slogan 15. Four practices are the best of methods.

Point Four: Showing the Utilization of Practice in One's Whole Life
:Slogan 17. Practice the five strengths, the condensed heart instructions.
:: The 5 strengths are: strong determination, familiarization, the positive seed, reproach, and aspiration.
:Slogan 18. The mahayana instruction for [[Phowa|ejection of consciousness]] at death is the five strengths: how you conduct yourself is important.
:: When you are dying practice the 5 strengths.

Point Five: Evaluation of Mind Training
:Slogan 19. All dharma agrees at one point -- All Buddhist teachings are about lessening the ego, lessening one's self-absorption.
:Slogan 20. Of the two witnesses, hold the principal one -- You know yourself better than anyone else knows you
:Slogan 21. Always maintain only a joyful mind.
:Slogan 22. If you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained.

Point Six: Disciplines of Mind Training
:Slogan 23. Always abide by the three basic principles -- Dedication to your practice, refraining from outrageous conduct, developing patience.
:Slogan 24. Change your attitude, but remain natural.-- Reduce ego clinging, but be yourself.
:Slogan 25. Don't talk about injured limbs -- Don't take pleasure contemplating others' defects.
:Slogan 26. Don't ponder others -- Don't take pleasure contemplating others' weaknesses.
:Slogan 27. Work with the greatest defilements first -- Work with your greatest obstacles first.
:Slogan 28. Abandon any hope of fruition -- Don't get caught up in how you will be in the future, stay in the present moment.
:Slogan 29. Abandon poisonous food.
:Slogan 30. Don't be so predictable -- Don't hold grudges.
:Slogan 31. Don't malign others.

:Slogan 37. Don't turn gods into demons -- Don't use these slogans or your spirituality to increase your self-absorption
:Slogan 38. Don't seek others' pain as the limbs of your own happiness.

Point Seven: Guidelines of Mind Training
:Slogan 39. All activities should be done with one intention.
:Slogan 40. Correct all wrongs with one intention.
:Slogan 41. Two activities: one at the beginning, one at the end.
:Slogan 42. Whichever of the two occurs, be patient.
:Slogan 43. Observe these two, even at the risk of your life.
:Slogan 44. Train in the three difficulties.
:Slogan 45. Take on the three principal causes: the teacher, the dharma, the sangha.
:Slogan 46. Pay heed that the three never wane: gratitude towards one's teacher, appreciation of the dharma (teachings) and correct conduct.
:Slogan 47. Keep the three inseparable: body, speech, and mind.
:Slogan 48. Train without bias in all areas. It is crucial always to do this pervasively and wholeheartedly.
:Slogan 49. Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment.
:Slogan 50. Don't be swayed by external circumstances.
:Slogan 51. This time, practice the main points: others before self, dharma, and awakening compassion.
:Slogan 52. Don't misinterpret.
::The six things that may be misinterpreted are patience, yearning, excitement, compassion, priorities and joy. You're patient when you're getting your way, but not when its difficult.  You yearn for worldly things, instead of an open heart and mind. You get excited about wealth and entertainment, instead of your potential for enlightenment.  You have compassion for those you like, but none for those you don't.  Worldly gain is your priority rather than cultivating loving-kindness and compassion.  You feel joy when your enemies suffer, and do not rejoice in others' good fortune.&lt;ref name="Joyful Mind"/&gt;
:Slogan 53. Don't vacillate (in your practice of LoJong).
:Slogan 54. Train wholeheartedly.
:Slogan 55. Liberate yourself by examining and analyzing: Know your own mind with honesty and fearlessness.
:Slogan 56. Don't wallow in self-pity.
:Slogan 57. Don't be jealous.
:Slogan 58. Don't be frivolous.
:Slogan 59. Don't expect applause.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentaries==
One seminal commentary on the mind training practice was written by [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] (one of the main founders of the non-sectarian [[Rime movement]] of Tibetan Buddhism) in the 19th century. This commentary was translated by [[Ken McLeod]], initially as ''A Direct Path to Enlightenment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kongtrul |first1=Jamgon |title=A Direct Path to Enlightenment |author2=Ken McLeod (tr.) |publisher=Kagyu Kunkhyab Chuling |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation served as the root text for Osho's ''Book of Wisdom''. Later, after some consultation with [[Chögyam Trungpa]], Ken McLeod retranslated the work as ''The Great Path of Awakening''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kongtrul |first1=Jamgon |title=The Great Path of Awakening: The Classic Guide to Lojong, a Tibetan Buddhist Practice for Cultivating the Heart of Compassion |author2=Ken McLeod (tr.) |publisher=Shambhala |year=2005 |isbn= 978-1590302149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two commentaries to the root texts of mind training have been written by [[Kelsang Gyatso]] (founder of the [[New Kadampa Tradition]]) and form the basis of study programs at NKT Buddhist Centers throughout the world. The first, ''[[Universal Compassion]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; is a commentary to the root text ''Training the Mind in Seven Points'' by [[Chekawa Yeshe Dorje]]. The second, ''Eight Steps to Happiness''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kelsang |last=Gyatso |title=Eight Steps to Happiness: The Buddhist Way of Loving Kindness |publisher=Tharpa Publications |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-9817277-8-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a commentary to the root text, ''Eight Verses of Training the Mind'' by [[Langri Tangpa]].

In 2006, [[Wisdom Publications]] published the work ''Mind Training: The Great Collection'' (''Theg-pa chen-po blo-sbyong rgya-rtsa''), translated by [[Thupten Jinpa]].  This is a translation of a traditional Tibetan compilation, dating from the fifteenth century, which contains altogether forty-three texts related to the practice of mind training.  Among these texts are several different versions of the root verses, along with important early commentaries by Se Chilbu, Sangye Gompa, Konchok Gyaltsen, and others.

In 2012, [[Shambhala Publications]] published ''Training in Compassion: Zen teachings on the Practice of Lojong''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Fischer |title=Training in Compassion: Zen Teachings on the Practice of Lojong |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-1611800401}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Zoketsu Norman Fischer]] which teaches ways to incorporate Lojong practices into [[Zen]]. Fischer felt that "the plain-speaking tradition of Zen might lend something to the power of the text"&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web |first=Norman |last=Fischer |url=http://www.lionsroar.com/mind-training-for-today-march-2013/|title=Mind Training for Today |publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]] |date=March 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "although Zen is a Mahayana school (and therefore based on compassion teachings), it is nevertheless deficient in explicit teachings on compassion".&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

In 2016, [[Shambhala Publications]] published ''The Intelligent Heart: A Guide to the Compassionate Life'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Dzigar |last=Kongtrul |title=The Intelligent Heart: A Guide to Compassionate Life |publisher=Shambhala Publications |year=2016 |isbn=978-1611801781}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche]], with foreword by [[Pema Chodron]].

The '''National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning''' (NDPCAL)&lt;ref&gt;This text is a summary of a more detailed description here http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/organisations/ndpcal.html&lt;/ref&gt; was the earliest large-scale education programme in the UK to explore the use of computers for teaching and learning.  First proposed in 1969 to the [[Department of Education and Science]] by the National Council for Educational Technology (soon to be renamed The [[Council for Educational Technology]]) it ran from 1973 to 1977 spending £2.5M to support some 35 projects covering a range of subjects. About half the money was spent on projects in universities and the rest on projects in schools, colleges, industrial and military training.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper R., 1975, Two years On, National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning, Report of the Director, London: CET&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hooper (civil servant)|Richard Hooper]] was appointed its Director and operated with a small central team and the programme was administered by the Council for [[Educational technology|Educational Technology]].

==Origins==
During the 1960s various projects in the USA and the UK using [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[mini-computers]] began to develop the field of [[E-Learning|Computer Aided Learning]] and there was much debate about its value and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Annett J. and Duke J.,1970, Proceedings of a Seminar on Computer Based Learning Systems, London:NCET&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council for Educational Technology (renamed Council for Educational Technology (CET)) produced advice to government in 1969 to run a national development programme to explore the value of these approaches.&lt;ref&gt;NCET, 1969, Computer Based Learning , A Programme for Action, London: National Council for Educational Technology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/history/the_1960s/orig_NCET.html&lt;/ref&gt; After much discussion amongst the interested departments and an intervening general election, the Department for Education and Science (DES) announced in 1972 the approval by the Secretary of State ([[Mrs Thatcher]]) to a 'national development programme in computer assisted learning'.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, G. (1972) 'Go ask the computer' The Guardian Jun 20, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement of the Programme the post of Director was advertised.and [[Richard Hooper (civil servant)|Richard Hooper]], BBC Senior Producer in the Faculty of Educational Studies at the Open University was selected.

==Strategy==
NDPCAL's strategy was to work mainly with existing projects in Computer Aided Learning but also to develop feasibility projects with those with good ideas. It required joint funding from the host establishment and stipulated effective evaluation and monitoring processes but allowed a significant degree of autonomy to the projects.  The approach of the central team was active and interventionist, working alongside potential projects in their early stages to help develop their design and approach. They also focussed on good project management requiring four monthly accounting periods and carefully controlling expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper R., 1977, An Introduction to the National Development Programme in Computer Assisted Learning, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p165-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
CET was asked to provide administrative services to the new programme, and the programme's central staff were CET employees but executive control was with a committee made up of civil servants from seven government departments plus a group of co-opted advisers. This Programme Committee was chaired by the DES.  The Programme Committee was more than just a rubber stamping committee, it held the final say on proposals from the Programme Director and involved itself in project evaluation, setting up sub-committees of three or so of its members to look in detail at a particular proposal or project. Although each of the thirty projects had its own steering committee national linkage was maintained through a member of the national Programme Committee sitting on each project  steering committee.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper R., 1977, An Introduction to the National Development Programme in Computer Assisted Learning, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p165-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting Up==
From January 1973 to early summer 1973, there was a phase of exploration and consultation and from the summer of 1973 to the end of the year, there was the setting up of the Programme's management structure and of the first generation of major projects, notably in the university sector. Richard Hooper was supported by two assistant directors, Mrs Gillian Frewin (from ICL) and Roger Miles (from the Army School of Instructional Technology). They were supported by two other executive posts and three secretaries.
The programme formulated two main aims over its lifetime (Hooper, 1975, p17):
# to develop and secure the assimilation of computer assisted and computer managed learning on a regular institutional basis at reasonable cost
# to make recommendations to appropriate agencies in the public and private sector (including Government) concerning possible future levels and types of investment in computer assisted and computer managed learning in education and training.
Two evaluations were set up, one to consider the educational benefits and one to consider the financial aspects.

==Breadth of Projects==
This first government funded programme to look at the use of computers focused on their use for learning other subjects rather than about computers or programming them. It supported some 35 projects, seven in schools, a number in higher education but the majority were based on the armed services’ growing interest in developing more automated and managed approaches to training.  The hardware was limited; the computers were large expensive cabinets of complicated electronics accessed mainly by paper tape with Teletype printouts but already the focus was more on the way technology could be used to improve teaching and learning than as a subject in its own right.  This dichotomy continues throughout this history and different policies struggled with, and often confused this difference.
NDPCAL funded a wide range of different projects - of different types, covering a range of subjects and age ranges sectors. Some of these such as Chelsea College's Computers in the Undergraduate Science Curriculum developed into the Computers in the Curriculum Project and Hertfordshire's Computer Managed Mathematics helped the Advisory Unit for Computer Based Education (AUCBE) at Hatfield develop.

It classified projects into different stages&lt;ref&gt;Hooper R., 1975, Two years On, National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning, Report of the Director, London: CET&lt;/ref&gt;
Stage 1 - Design and Feasibility  - a project that shows that a particular application of CAL or CML is feasible by developing and piloting applications.
Stage 2 - Development and Transferability - the creation of a working system for increasing numbers of students across a number of institutions.
Stage 3 - Model Operation - a fully operational project able to act as a model for others.
Stage 4 - Assimilation and Dissemination - national funding is being phased out and the institution has taken ownership with other new institutions taking it up.

About half the project funds were spent on projects in universities and polytechnics, about one-sixth of the project funds was spent on schools based projects and the rest on military and industrial training.  Some of the projects are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;For a full list and their details see http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/history/the_1970s/ndpcal_projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Computer Based Learning Project on Applied Statistics for Social Science, Leeds University - Director: J.R. Hartley 
* Computer Assisted Learning in Engineering Sciences Director: Dr. P.R. Smith Faculty of Engineering, Computer Assisted Teaching Unit, Queen Mary College.
* Computer Assisted Learning in Chemistry Director: Dr. P.B. Ayscough Dept. of Physical Chemistry, The University of Leeds.
* Computers in the Undergraduate Science Curriculum Director: Dr. I. McKenzie, University College London
* Hertfordshire Computer Managed Mathematics in Schools Director: Dr. W.Tagg, Advisory Unit for Computer Based Education

==Evaluation==
NDPCAL set up two independent evaluations: an educational evaluation carried out by the [[University of East Anglia]] and a financial evaluation by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. 
The Educational Evaluation, UNCAL (Understanding Computer Assisted Learning) was carried out over a period of three years evaluation project and reported findings about CAL in general.  Its findings echo many of the later findings of the effectiveness of [[e-learning]] and provided a good summary of the benefits and disadvantages:&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald B., 1977, The Educational Evaluation of NDPCAL, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p176-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# It is the versatility of the computer as an aid that assures its educational future
# CAL, like most innovation, provides an add-on experience at an add-on cost
# Much of the learning seen within NDPCAL fell into the category of higher-order learning
# CAL is a demanding medium for learning - virtually guaranteeing the students engagement
# Some forms of CAL enforce a strict role of learner on the student - this may need to be complemented by other forms
# CAL offers the student uninhibited learning opportunities within a 'privacy of risk'
# Learning may be inhibited by interface problems - where the student needs to put extra effort into keyboard skills, learning new computer protocols
# Current CAL still requires more adaption of the student to the machine
# Students like working on CAL but are frustrated by technical problems
# CAL is change-oriented not efficiency-oriented
# CAL supports teacher development since it encourages a team approach
# At present CAL development requires access to high level computer expertise.

The financial evaluation reported some tentative but interesting conclusions in their study that again reflect later findings on [[e-learning]]:&lt;ref&gt;Fielden J., 1977, The Financial Evaluation of NDPCAL, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p190-200&lt;/ref&gt;

# CAL will always be an extra cost
# There are no realisable cash savings or benefits from CAL
# Claims that CAL will 'save' academic staff time are oversimplified and unjustifiable
# The time taken to develop science packages varies between 200 and 400 hours
# Inter-institutional development has been a success leading to substantial savings
# Large scale applications of CAL require full-time staff and regular computer time.

They calculated the 'national or total cost per student terminal hour' in the range £4-£15 by comparison the cost of conventional teaching was in the range £0.60-£2.50 per student hour.

The '''National University of Cuyo''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Nacional de Cuyo}}, UNCuyo) is the largest center of higher education in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

As of 2005, the university had 12 academic schools in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and a delegation in the city of [[San Rafael, Mendoza|San Rafael]] (province of Mendoza), in addition to the [[Balseiro Institute]], which is the most developed institute of Physics research in Argentina, located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] (province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]]). It includes the University Technological Institute which offers technical education in four other cities in Mendoza province. Moreover, UNCuyo is also devoted to improving education due to having 7 other buildings working as High Schools:

* C.U.C. (Colegio Universitario Central "Gral. Jose de San Martin")
* Escuela de Comercio Martín Zapata
* Liceo Agrícola Domingo Faustino Sarmiento
* Escuela del Magisterio
* Escuela de Agricultura
* D.A.D (Departamento de Aplicación Docente)
* Escuela Carmen Vera Arenas

==History==
The UNCuyo was established on March 21, 1939 by the presidential decree 26971. The university was established to offer tertiary education provision in the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] (the provinces of Mendoza, [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] and [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]). At its foundation the university was composed of some existing higher education colleges, and new ones were incorporated. Regional affiliations were established in Human Sciences, Medicine, Agronomy and Economics in Mendoza, Engineering and Architecture in San Juan, and Natural Sciences in San Luis. These links remained in place until 1973. That year the [[National University of San Juan]] and the [[National University of San Luis]] were established from the adjunct faculties of the National University of Cuyo already in these regions. Thereafter, the National University of Cuyo concentrated itself in Mendoza, in addition to a campus in Río Negro Province: the [[Balseiro Institute]].

==Recent research==
In recent research conducted by UNCuyo's students it was discovered how methods of cutting and preparing food can affect how many nutrients are retained in a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/diet.fitness/06/30/cl.bringing.out.best/index.html#cnnSTCText?iref=werecommend Coax flavor, nutrition from produce with proper care, handling]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably they found that the thiosulfinates (that inhibit platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding) found in garlic and onions do not form until crushing or cutting. The research also demonstrated that steaming instead boiling is preferable as vegetables retain more of their water-soluble vitamins.

As a general definition, '''paradata''' are usage data about learning resources that include not just quantitative metrics (e.g., how many times a piece of content was accessed), but also pedagogic context, as inferred through the actions of educators and learners.  Paradata may be operationalized as a specific type of [[metadata]], however the construct differs from traditional descriptive metadata that classify the properties of the learning resource itself, and instead involves the capture—and open resharing—of in situ information about online users’ actions related to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Paradata?|url=https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/nsdldocs/Paradata|publisher=NSDL/UCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning resource paradata is generated through user processes of searching for content, identifying interest for subsequent use, correlating resources to specific learning goals or standards, and integrating content into educational practices. Paradata may include individual or aggregate user interactions such as viewing, downloading, sharing to other users, favoriting,and embedding reusable content into derivative works, as well as contextualizing activities such as aligning content to educational standards, adding tags, and incorporating resources into curriculum. Context about users is also of interest as paradata, including grade level or subject taught, experience level, or geographic location—as is information about the curricular relevance, audience, methodologies, and instructional settings of use as a resource is adopted by practitioners. Paradata are generally anonymized and/or aggregated at the community level to protect the privacy of individual users as data are shared between learning communities. Paradata may be expressed in realtime data streaming as user actions occur, or as periodic reporting of user activities over a range of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradata in 20 Minutes or Less|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QG0lAmJ0ztHJq5DbiTGQj9DnQ8hP0Co0x0fB1QmoBco/edit?hl=en_US#heading=h.k1jtp0jnljko|publisher=Learning Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2010, the term '''paradata''' was adopted by the [[National Science Digital Library]] (NSDL) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Science Digital Library|url=http://nsdl.org|publisher=NSDL/UCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reference data about user interactions with digital [[learning object]]s within the NSDL’s STEM Exchange initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Exchange|url=http://stemexchange.org|publisher=NSDL/UCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construct has since been adopted by other organizations engaged in digital library and digital learning resource projects including the Learning Registry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Registry|url=http://learningregistry.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative spearheaded by the Office of Educational Technology at the U.S. Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Educational Technology|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/os/technology/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative at the Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Distributed Learning|url=http://adlnet.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical Frameworks for Sharing Learning Resource Paradata ==
In February 2011, NSDL released an open source [[XML]] paradata framework versioned as NSDL comm_para1.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSDL Comm_Para 1.00 Specification |url=http://ns.nsdl.org/ncs/comm_para/1.00/schemas/comm_para.xsd|publisher=NSDL/UCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; the structure of which parallels similar schemas for metadata so that it can interoperate with [[Dublin Core]] based schemas including nsdl-dc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributing Paradata (Usage Data) to NSDL |url=http://wiki.ucar.edu/x/86qrB|publisher=NSDL/UCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2011 the Learning Registry development team released its Paradata Specification V1.0 [&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Registry Paradata Specification V1.0 |url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IrOYXd3S0FUwNozaEG5tM7Ki4_AZPrBn-pbyVUz-Bh0/edit?hl=en_US#heading=h.vl3q267ld2zv|publisher=Learning Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt; that details the schemata of [[JSON]] objects for representing learning resource paradata.  In 2016 the US Dept of Ed and others published a spec for various companies to push their paradata to the Learning Registry.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/learningtapestry/metadataregistry/blob/master/docs/04_paradata.md&lt;/ref&gt;  That would mean various resource libraries could aggregate  data on educational resources in one place.  As an example, [http://www.opened.com OpenEd], [https://www.google.com/edu/ Google], [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education Microsoft] and others would push data on how many times an educational video was used by teachers, to help rank them by popularity.

'''Paule Marshall''' (born April 9, 1929)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/404/000048260/ "Paule Marsahll" page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110195554/http://www.nndb.com/people/404/000048260/ |date=2006-01-10 }} at NNDB.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author, best known for her 1959 novel ''[[Brown Girl, Brownstones]]''. In 1992, at the age of 63, Marshall was awarded a Macarthur Fellowship Grant.

==Life and career==
Marshall was born Valenza Pauline Burke in [[Brooklyn]], NY, to Adriana Viola Clement Burke and Sam Burke. Marshall's father had migrated from [[Barbados]] to New York in 1919 and, during her childhood, deserted the family to join a quasi-religious cult, leaving his wife to raise their children by herself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daryl Cumber Dance|Dance, Daryl Cumber]]. "An Interview of Paule Marshall", ''The Southern Review'' 28, no. 1 (Winter 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Smitten with the poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], Marshall changed her given name from Pauline to Paule (with a silent e) when she was 12 or 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/books/12paul.html?_r=1&amp;|title=Voyage of a Girl Moored in Brooklyn|last=Lee|first=Felicia R. |date=March 11, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall attended Girls’ High School in Bedstuy and subsequently enrolled in [[Hunter College]] with plans of becoming a social worker. She took ill during college and took a year off, during which time she decided to major in English Literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/marshall-paule-1929|title=Marshall, Paule (1929--)|last=Hoffman|first=Brian Gene|date=|website=BlackPast|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually earning her Bachelor of Arts at [[Brooklyn College]] in 1953 and her master's degree at Hunter College in 1955.&lt;ref name="Postcolonial Studies @ Emory"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/11/marshall-paule/|title=Postcolonial Studies @ Emory|last=Timar |first= Eszter |date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Site accepts user papers but doesn't state whether they also give editorial oversight|date=July 2017}} After graduating college, Marshall wrote for ''Our World'', the acclaimed nationally distributed magazine edited for African-American readers, which she credited with teaching her discipline in writing and eventually aiding her in writing her first novel, ''Brown Girl, Brownstones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=467272|title=MELUS, Vol. 17, No. 4, Black Modernism and Post-Modernism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, John M., [http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4558/Marshall-Paule.html "Paule Marshall Biography"], jrank.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 she married psychologist Kenneth Marshall; they divorced in 1963. In the 1970s she married Nourry Menard, a Haitian businessman.&lt;ref name="Voices from the Gaps"&gt;[http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/marshall_paule.php "Paule Marshall"], Voices from the Gaps - [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in her career, she wrote poetry, but later returned to prose, her novel ''[[Brown Girl, Brownstones]]'' being published in 1959. ''Brown Girl, Brownstones'' tells the story of Selina Boyce, a girl growing up in  a small black immigrant community.&lt;ref name="Postcolonial Studies @ Emory"/&gt; Selina is caught between her mother, who wants to conform to  the ideals of her new home and make the American dream come true, and her father, who longs to  go back to Barbados.&lt;ref name="Postcolonial Studies @ Emory"/&gt; The dominant themes in the novel – travel, migration, psychic fracture and  striving for wholeness – are important structuring elements in her later works as well.&lt;ref name="Postcolonial Studies @ Emory"/&gt;

She received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1960 and the following year published ''Soul Clap Hands and Sing'', a collection of four novellas that won her the National Institute of Arts Award.&lt;ref name="Voices from the Gaps" /&gt; In 1965, she was chosen by [[Langston Hughes]] to accompany him on a State Department-sponsored world tour, on which they both read their work, which was a boon to her career.&lt;ref&gt;Yardley, Jonathan, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/26/AR2009022602576.html "A memoir from Paule Marshall, author of "Brown Girl, Brownstones"]. ''The Washington Post'', March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently published the novels ''[[The Chosen Place, the Timeless People]]'' (1969), which the ''New York Times Book Review'' called "one of the four or five most impressive novels ever written by a black American",&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times Book Review'', November 30, 1969, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Praisesong for the Widow]]'' (1983), the latter winning the [[Before Columbus Foundation]] [[American Book Award]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="Wainwright"&gt;Mary Katherine Wainwright, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Paule_Marshall.aspx "Marshall, Paule 1929–"], Encyclopedia.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall has taught at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], and [[Yale University]] before holding the Helen Gould Sheppard Chair of Literature and Culture at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwp.fas.nyu.edu/object/cwp.faculty.paulemarshall Creative Writing Program, New York University.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she received an [[Honorary degree|honorary L.H.D.]] from [[Bates College]]. Now retired, she lives in [[Richmond, Virginia]].

She is a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and is a past winner of the [[Longwood University#The Dos Passos Prize|Dos Passos Prize for Literature]]. She was designated as a Literary Lion by the [[New York Public Library]] in 1994.

Marshall was inducted into the Celebrity Path at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] in 2001.

Her memoir, ''Triangular Road'', was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookslut.com/nonfiction/2009_05_014419.php ''Triangular Road: A Memoir'' by Paule Marshall], Basic Civitas Books. {{ISBN|0465013597}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Paule Marshall won a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anisfield-wolf.org/books/lifetime-paule-marshall/ "Paule Marshall | 2009 lifetime Achievement"], Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quote==
"I realise that it is fashionable now to dismiss the traditional novel as something of an anachronism, but to me it is still a vital form. Not only does it allow for the kind of full-blown, richly detailed writing that I love… but it permits me to operate on many levels and to explore both the inner state of my characters as well as the worlds beyond them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexis De Veaux|De Veaux, Alexis]], "Paule Marshall: In Celebration of Our Triumph", ''Essence'', May 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Playing History 2 - Slave Trade''''' is an educational game developed and published by [[Serious Games Interactive]], and released on September 13, 2013 for Windows and Mac OS X on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform.

The game caused a great deal of controversy for its inclusion of a "Slave Tetris" [[minigame]], which was later removed, and other insensitive depictions of [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-played-slave-tetris-kids-20150904-htmlstory.html|title=I played 'Slave Tetris' so your kids don't have to|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Free downloadable versions of the games were uploaded to the series' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MwnoezQHVogC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=%22playing+history%22+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0RoAMKZ4Na&amp;sig=wpYX0DQulXGra85Jl5J31YFOhSQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPu8HGn8PVAhUHFZQKHe6rBbQ4ChDoAQhFMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22playing%20history%22%20review&amp;f=false|title=Playing with the Past|last=Champion|first=Erik|date=2010-09-28|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781849965019|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The main character is a young slave boy named Tim, who must help his master, a [[slave ship]] captain, transport 300 slaves to the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The player must pilot the slave ship, collecting items that replenish your food and avoiding wind blasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other minigames in the game formerly included a ''[[Tetris]]''-like mode in which the player needed to "stack" slaves in the storage compartment of the ship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The player can help their master bargain with the locals to reduce the price of slave children, in order to earn points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reception ==
During the game's campaign on Steam Greenlight, users had raised concerns about the game, but the game's developers defended the controversial "Slave Tetris" mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/after-outcry-edutainment-game-removes-slave-tetris-mode/|title=After outcry, “edutainment” game removes slave-Tetris mode|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game was released on Steam, several years after its original release date, a large number of users complained that the game trivialized slavery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/slave-trade-video-game-developer-alters-scene-after-outcry/|title=Slave Trade Video Game Developer Alters Scene After Outcry|last=Schmidt|first=Gregory|date=September 3, 2015|website=ArtsBeat|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's developers removed the ''Tetris''-like level and issued an apology on Steam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The game's trailer was also updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-03-slave-tetris-pulled-from-steam-game-after-social-media-backlash|title="Slave Tetris" pulled from Steam game after social media backlash|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=2015-09-03|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, critics still condemned the game for other issues, such as the player picking up icons of "cakes and wine" while collecting food, and the most sympathetic character in the game being a white doctor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Katherine Cross of [[Gamasutra]] called the entire game a "dismal, tone-deaf failure at education" that trivialized slavery, and criticized the Serious Games CEO Simon Egenfeldt-Neisen for blaming oversensitive critics and cultural differences for the debacle and not the poor quality of the game itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/253003/Opinion_What_can_we_learn_from_that_tonedeaf_Slave_Tetris_minigame.php|title=Opinion: What can we learn from that tone-deaf 'Slave Tetris' minigame?|last=Cross|first=Katherine|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other games in series ==
''Playing History: the Plague''  was given a positive review by Erik Champion in his book "Playing with the Past", where he praised its amusing game that appealed to a younger demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MwnoezQHVogC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=%22playing+history%22+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0RoAMKZ4Na&amp;sig=wpYX0DQulXGra85Jl5J31YFOhSQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPu8HGn8PVAhUHFZQKHe6rBbQ4ChDoAQhFMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22playing%20history%22%20review&amp;f=false|title=Playing with the Past|last=Champion|first=Erik|date=2010-09-28|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781849965019|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
Today '''Technological University of Havana José Antonio Echeverría''', in its beginnings '''University City José Antonio Echeverría''' (CUJAE), whose old acronyms are still used for their popular recognition. With the triumph of the Revolution on January 1, 1959, a stage of revolutionary transformations began at [[Cuba]] in the national sphere and among the first were the educational ones. This creates the conditions to start a true university reform, dreams until then unique to the great Cuban masters: [[Félix Varela|Varela]], [[José Martí|Martí]], [[Julio Antonio Mella|Mella]], [[Enrique José Varona|Varona]] and of all those who for years had fought and even given their lives to establish a worthy University that was only achieved with [[Fidel Castro|Fidel]]. It is attached to the Ministry of Higher Education of Cuba.

On February 15, 2017, the National Accreditation Board granted the '''superior category of excellence''', for its results in the comprehensive training of students, research and its impact on the municipality, the nation and the outside.

== Background ==
The history of the CUJAE has its antecedents in the old School of Engineers, Electricians and Architects of the [[University of Havana]], created on June 30, 1900, when they were dictated Military orders for that purpose. In a beginning it began in the old convent of San Agustín, today Museum of History of the Medicine Carlos J. Finlay, soon to happen to the Hill, ascribed to the Faculty of Sciences and Letters of that University Center, with the races of Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering, adding the one of Architecture, the first of October of the same year.

As a result of the reform movement initiated in 1923, there is a significant shift in the programs that had not been reviewed for some twenty years, which caused changes in the curricula of the three aforementioned careers. In 1925 becomes School of Engineers and Architects, continuing within the Faculty of Letters and Sciences.

Upon the enactment of the teaching law of 1937, twelve faculties are created at the University of Havana, within which the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture appears with new programs for [[Civil Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Architecture]], which remained in force with slight modifications until 1960.

In January 1943 this Faculty is divided into two: Engineering, where you continue studying Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Architecture, with the race of the same name.

The incorporation of a broad student movement to the insurrectional process then organized to overthrow the current government, causes the closure of the University in the year 1956, which does not reopen until after the revolutionary triumph of 1 January 1959.

The November 18, 1961 is founded the Faculty of Technology of the University of Havana, and on January 10, 1962 it is officially ratified by the Law of University Reform, integrating again, with six Schools : Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Architecture. Later they would appear: Mining Engineering, Geophysical Engineering, Hydraulic Engineering, Sugar Engineering and the technical level careers: Hydrotechnology and Topography.

== Construction ==
In September 1960, the Commander in Chief [[Fidel Castro]] announced the purpose of building a university city; name her [[José Antonio Echeverría]]. There were three possible places for its realization, and by consensus was chosen the neighbor to the Central Toledo, now Central Manuel Martínez Prieto, in the current municipality of [[Marianao]].

The March 13, 1961, commemorating the fourth anniversary of the assault on the [[Attack on the presidential palace of Cuba|Presidential Palace]] and the taking of [[Radio Reloj (Cuba)|Radio Reloj]], the construction works were officially inaugurated. In the year of 1962 constructive work had advanced considerably but there was a pressing need for capital to subsidize the completion of the project. To this end, Engineer Altshuler prepared a report requesting technical assistance from the Special Fund of the United Nations, a request that met opposition from the representative of the United States, but since there were no strong reasons to reject it, they sought to obstruct it. always postponing their treatment in the Assemblies of said Organization. The pressure made by the Cuban diplomatic headquarters caused a Mission to be organized in April 1965, composed of Mr. Didier Manheimer, Consulting Engineer, Director of the International Formation Society of France and Audun Ofjord, Director of Bergen Materials Test and Research Laboratory. The visit verified that the report sent had been fulfilled, and that the Faculty was a concrete reality, since the teaching staff, the students had been developed and the installation was largely built. The project was approved in October of that same year, granting the amount of $2 007 600.00 USD.

Finally December 2, 1964, [[Fidel Castro]] opens in this Capital, the University City [[José Antonio Echeverría]], (CUJAE), occupying its facilities the Faculty of Technology of the [[University of Havana]] and the leveling courses, designed to properly train high school graduates, who aspired to study engineering careers.

== Structural changes ==
On July 29, 1976, the José Antonio Echeverría Higher Polytechnic Institute was founded, by decision of the newly created Ministry of Higher Education (MES), which immediately promoted a national network of Higher Education Centers (CES), as a consequence of the growth of enrollment in the few existing universities and because of the justified need to perfect the National System at that level.

Thus, the Faculty of Technology is definitively separated from the University of Havana, becoming the Higher Polytechnic Institute José Antonio Echeverría CUJAE, being defined by Law as the Center responsible for the training of specialists in the field of technical sciences and It conferred the responsibility of being the Rector Center of Architecture and the engineering (Technical Sciences) that are taught in it, except those related to Mining Engineering and Agronomic Engineering that are no longer studied in the CUJAE and that transferred the rectories of the same to Higher Metallurgical Mining Institute of Moa and the Agrarian University of Havana.

With an independent structure, this university begins its teaching activities in the academic year 1976 - 1977 and with it would also open a new faculty, the Azucarera, whose antecedents are imbricated in the subsidiary created in 1972 in the Central "Camilo Cienfuegos".

On June 30, 2016, the agreement No.7943 of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers is taken, in which the integration of the universities in Cuba is concluded, where the approval of the name change is adopted in the sixth agreement. Higher Polytechnic Institute "José Antonio Echeverría", Technological University of Havana "José Antonio Echeverría", with the acronym CUJAE, giving both national and international University character.

== CUJAE Project ==
The CUJAE is in a constructive process, which from 2017 to 2021 aims to renovate the center. The goal is to have the highest technology in each of its spaces: classrooms, laboratories, libraries, theaters, among others.

The CUJAE Project has its background in the act for the 50th anniversary of the institution chaired by the [[Raul Castro]], president of the Councils of States and Ministers, who gave the guidance of "putting the school at the height of the actual times". Being a university of technical sciences and preparing students in architecture and engineering that are capable of carrying out projects for production, it was decided that they could carry out the projects in the school, but based on the improvement of it.

== Red ==
It has one of the most extensive intranets in the country with a network supported by a number of servers spread throughout the institution and managed by students and teachers. In this network you can find material of all kinds that successfully supports education lacking physical books but extensive in books and virtual articles.

Internet on the other hand is restricted by a [[proxy server]] ([[Squid (program)|Squid of linux]]) that allows controlled access for users of the same (teachers and students of the CUJAE). Recently it has increased its speed and types of access, currently allowing remote telephone access and increased information traffic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9794">{{About|the common term "real life"|things named "Real Life"|Real Life (disambiguation){{!}}Real Life}}

'''"Real life"''' is a phrase used originally in literature to distinguish between the '''real world''' and fictional or idealized worlds, and in [[acting]] to distinguish between performers and the characters they portray. More recently, it has become a popular term on the [[Internet]] to describe events, people, activities, and interactions occurring offline; or otherwise not primarily through the medium of the Internet.  It is also used as a metaphor to distinguish life in a vocational setting as opposed to an academic one.

==As distinct from fiction==
[[File:BlakeStories1 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|Illustration by [[William Blake]] for Wollstonecraft's ''Original Stories'' (1791)]]
When used to distinguish from fictional worlds or [[fictional universe|universe]]s against the [[consensus reality]] of the reader, the term has a long history:
{{quote|Authors, as a rule, attempt to select and portray types rarely met with in their entirety, but these types are nevertheless more real than real life itself.|[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]|''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''&lt;ref name=Dostoyevsky&gt;{{cite web |title=Fyodor Dostoyevsky: The Idiot: Part IV: Chapter I |work=The Free Online Library |url= http://dostoyevsky.thefreelibrary.com/The-Idiot/4-1#real+life |accessdate=2006-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her 1788 work, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness]]'', author [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] employs the term in her title, representing the work's focus on a middle-class ethos which she viewed as superior to the court culture represented by [[fairy tales]] and the values of chance and [[luck]] found in [[chapbook]] stories for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. Original Stories from Real Life. London: Printed for Joseph Johnson, 1788. Available from Eighteenth Century Collections Online. (by subscription only) Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As phrased by Gary Kelly, writing about the work, "The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gary. ''Revolutionary Feminism: The Mind and Career of Mary Wollstonecraft''. London: Macmillan, 1992. {{ISBN|0-312-12904-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the phrase can be used to distinguish an [[actor]] from a character, e.g. "In real life, he has a British accent" or "In real life, he lives in Los Angeles."

There is a related but slightly distinct usage among [[live action role playing|role-players]] and [[historical reenactment|historical reenactors]], to distinguish the fantasy or historical context from the actual world and the role-player or actor from the character, e.g. "What do you do in real life?" or "Where do you live in real life?"

== As distinct from the Internet ==
On the Internet, "real life" refers to life [[Online and offline|offline]]. Online, the [[initialism]] "IRL" stands for "in real life", with the meaning "not on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=IRL|title=AcronymFinder.com search for IRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while Internet users may speak of having  "met" someone that they have contacted via [[online chat]] or in an [[online game|online gaming]] context, to say that they met someone "in real life" is to say that they literally encountered them at a physical location. Some, arguing that the Internet is part of real life, prefer to use "away from the keyboard" ([[wikt:AFK|AFK]]), e.g. the documentary ''[[TPB AFK]]''.

Some [[Sociology|sociologists]] engaged in the study of the Internet have predicted that someday, a distinction between online and offline worlds may seem "quaint", noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and "reality".&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=0-7619-6510-6|pages=533–543|chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line|editor=Leah Lievrouw and Sonia Livingstone|author=Don Slater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related terminology===

The [[initialism]] "RL" stands for "real life" and "IRL" for "in real life." For example, one can speak of "meeting IRL" someone whom one has met online, such as in "LMIRL" ("let's meet in real life"). It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to "RL problems". Some internet users use the [[idiom]]s "[[face time]]", "meatspace", or "meat world", which contrast with the term "[[cyberspace]]".&lt;ref name="WordSpy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/meatspace.asp|title=meatspace (MEET.spays) n.|date=1996-11-14|publisher=Paul McFedries and Logophilia Limited|accessdate=2008-08-11|work=Word Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid17440.aspx|title=Does your life suck?|last=Dodero|first=Camille|date=17 July 2006|publisher=''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|The Phoenix]]''|quote=Beyond this world, in real life — a/k/a what Second Lifers refer to as "meatspace," where your body is made of flesh, not bytes…|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meatspace" has appeared in the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d0f71fb6-3243-11db-ab06-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340,print=yes.html|title=Warning: interruption overload|date=2006-08-23|publisher=Ft.com|author=Rhymer Rigby|accessdate=2011-10-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813224049/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d0f71fb6-3243-11db-ab06-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340,print=yes.html|archivedate=13 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[science fiction]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;For example:

&lt;/ref&gt; Some early uses of the term include a post to the [[Usenet newsgroup]] austin.public-net in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/austin.public-net/browse_thread/thread/ab22c492a3319c44/798af58d879feba0?q=meatspace&amp;_done=%2Fgroups%3Fq%3Dmeatspace%26start%3D0%26scoring%3Dd%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26ie%3DUTF-8%26lr%3D%26as_qdr%3D%26as_drrb%3Db%26as_mind%3D31%26as_minm%3D1%26as_miny%3D1981%26as_maxd%3D2%26as_maxm%3D3%26as_maxy%3D1996%26safe%3Doff%26&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&amp;&amp;d#798af58d879feba0|title=Austin CyberSpace Journal #1|last=Barnes|first=Douglas|date=21 February 1993|quote=Meatspace update (quick rundown on where/how to interact with net.folks in meatspace, i.e., regular events, social gatherings, restaurant hangouts, etc.)|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' about [[John Perry Barlow]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2149736&amp;date=19951030&amp;query=meatspace|title=He's Trying To Build A Community On-Line -- Grateful Dead Lyricist Ventures Into Cyberspace|last=Andrews|first=Paul|date=30 October 1995|work=The Seattle Times|quote=John Perry Barlow is multitasking between cyberspace, meatspace and parentspace about as well as a mere mortal can do.|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term entered the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=36770|title='Lookist' Britain: the way we look inspires the new English|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As distinct from the academic world==
The phrase is also used to distinguish [[academia|academic life]] from work in other sectors, in a manner similar to the term "real world". A person with experience in "real life" or the "real world" has experience beyond book-learning.  It may also be used, often pejoratively, to distinguish other insular [[Subculture|subcultures]], work environments, or [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] from more traditional social and professional activities. The terms "real life" and "the real world" may also be used to describe [[adulthood]] and the adult world as distinct from [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]].

'''Share My Lesson''' is a free teaching resources website with over 300,000 resources.&lt;ref&gt;https://sharemylesson.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It officially launched on June 19, 2012.

== History ==
The [[American Federation of Teachers]] partnered with Britain's TES Connect with the aim of building the largest online community for US [[teacher]]s to collaborate and share teaching resources and innovative ideas. There is a significant emphasis on resources to guide teachers on implementing the new [[Common Core State Standards]]. The announcement about Share My Lesson was made on June 19, 2012, at the Global Education Conference at [[Stanford University]]. The AFT and TES Global (the owners of the TES) are investing $10 million to develop the site.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|last=Rich |first=Motoko |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/us/teachers-union-to-open-lesson-sharing-web-site.html?_r=2&amp;ref=us |title=Teachers’ Union to Open Lesson-Sharing Web Site |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the launch, AFT president [[Randi Weingarten]] said that there was a need for quality, peer-assessed lesson plans that was not currently being met by other resource-sharing sites.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

The site has received the support of Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]], who said that the program would benefit teachers everywhere. "We must support the incredibly complex work teachers do at every opportunity, including by sharing and promoting best practices through online resources and communities of practice," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Associated Press |url=http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/news/national/share-my-lesson-launches-for-teachers |title=Share My Lesson launches for teachers |publisher=ABC News |date= |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, Share My Lesson has been committed to providing our community of members high-quality and effective lessons, useful information to use in the classroom and professional development. As of 2015, Share My Lesson has 900,000 members, more than 300k Toddler - Grade 12 resources which have been downloaded more than 10 million times.&lt;ref&gt;https://sharemylesson.com/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2477">A '''Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education''' (SACRE) is an independent body which considers the provision of religious education in the area under the jurisdiction of its Local Authority, advising it and empowered to require a review of the locally agreed syllabus for [[Religious Education]] (RE). A SACRE is made up of representatives of the Local Authority, the [[Church of England]], Association of Teachers and representatives of other faith or other Christian groups, as well as, increasingly, [[secular humanism|humanists]] and other interested non-religious groups.

Each SACRE has wide-ranging statutory powers &lt;ref&gt;Grove, J. 2009 ''A Handbook for SACRE members'', London: NASACRE, 16f.&lt;/ref&gt; including: 
# to ratify AS’s written for them by the Agreed Syllabus Conference of their Local Authority;
# improving quality of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|Collective Worship]];
# monitoring quality of RE teaching and SMSCD provision and assisting where necessary or informing head teachers or governing bodies of difficulties;
# recommending speakers; 
# recommending places of worship to visit; 
# designing supplementary teaching materials; 
# contributing to teacher training and teachers’ in-service training, and; 
# fostering interfaith and community links especially to the end of community cohesion &lt;ref&gt;QCA 2008 ''SACREs and Community Cohesion: QCA annual analysis of SACRE annual reports from 2006/7'', London: QCA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several difficulties with the SACRE process have been recorded. Firstly, the ability of SACRE to represent the interests of the Buddhist community is highly questionable as minority religions often fail to be properly represented at all.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, D. W. 1998 'A Survey of Representative Groups on SACRE', ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'' 13(3): 387&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it would take a great deal of trouble to update Agreed Syllabuses to reflect the latest trends in faith community composition or to reflect new pedagogies of RE.&lt;ref&gt;Revell, L. 2008 'Religious Education in England', ''Numen'' 2-3: 218-240&lt;/ref&gt; Even to monitor the national picture of AS content is difficult as they are often available only locally &lt;ref&gt;Bausor, J. and Poole, M. 2002 'Science and religion in the agreed syllabuses - an investigation and some suggestions', ''British Journal of Religious Education'' 25: 18-32., 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Times Higher Education World University Rankings''''' is an annual publication of [[university ranking]]s by [[Times Higher Education|''Times Higher Education (THE)'' magazine]]. The publisher had collaborated with [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] (QS) to publish the joint ''[[THE–QS World University Rankings]]'' from 2004 to 2009 before it turned to [[Thomson Reuters]] for a new ranking system. The publication now comprises the world's overall, subject, and reputation rankings, alongside three regional league tables, ''Asia'', ''Latin America'', and ''BRICS &amp; Emerging Economies'' which are generated by different weightings.

THE Rankings is often considered as one of the most widely observed university rankings together with ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' and ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qswownews.com/history-development-higher-education-ranking-systems/|title=The history and development of higher education ranking systems - QS WOWNEWS|last=Network|first=QS Asia News|date=2018-03-02|work=QS WOWNEWS|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/09/172958/strength-and-weakness-varsity-rankings|title=Strength and weakness of varsity rankings|date=2016-09-14|work=NST Online|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new world ranking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2010/0916/New-world-university-ranking-puts-Harvard-back-on-top|title=New world university ranking puts Harvard back on top|author=Ariel Zirulnick|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|quote=Those two, as well as Shanghai Jiao Tong University, produce the most influential international university rankings out there}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edmont"&gt;{{cite news|title=Top schools don't always get top marks |author=Indira Samarasekera &amp; Carl Amrhein |publisher=The Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/schools+always+marks/3560240/story.html |quote=There are currently three major international rankings that receive widespread commentary: The Academic World Ranking of Universities, the QS World University Rankings and the Times Higher Education Rankings. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003203348/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/schools+always+marks/3560240/story.html |archivedate=3 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2010/11/11/altbach|title=The State of the Rankings|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|author=Philip G.

==History==
The creation of the original ''[[Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings]]'' was credited in Ben Wildavsky's book, ''The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities are Reshaping the World'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2010 |title=''The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities are Reshaping the World |first=Ben |last=Wildavsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; to then-editor of ''Times Higher Education'', [[John O'Leary (journalist)|John O'Leary]]. ''Times Higher Education'' chose to partner with educational and careers advice company QS to supply the data.

After the 2009 rankings, ''Times Higher Education'' took the decision to break from QS and signed an agreement with Thomson Reuters to provide the data for its annual World University Rankings from 2010 onwards. The publication developed a new rankings methodology in consultation with its readers, its editorial board and Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters will collect and analyse the data used to produce the rankings on behalf of Times Higher Education.

Commenting on Times Higher Education's decision to split from QS, former editor [[Ann Mroz]] said: "universities deserve a rigorous, robust and transparent set of rankings – a serious tool for the sector, not just an annual curiosity." She went on to explain the reason behind the decision to continue to produce rankings without QS' involvement, saying that: "The responsibility weighs heavy on our shoulders...we feel we have a duty to improve how we compile them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mroz |first=Ann |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408968&amp;c=1 |title=Leader: Only the best for the best |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phil Baty, editor of the new Times Higher Education World University Rankings, admitted in Inside Higher Ed: "The rankings of the world's top universities that my magazine has been publishing for the past six years, and which have attracted enormous global attention, are not good enough. In fact, the surveys of reputation, which made up 40 percent of scores and which Times Higher Education until recently defended, had serious weaknesses. And it's clear that our research measures favored the sciences over the humanities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baty |first=Phil |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2010/03/15/baty |title=Views: Ranking Confession |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to describe previous attempts at peer review as "embarrassing" in ''[[The Australian]]'': "The sample was simply too small, and the weighting too high, to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 February 2010 12:00AM |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion-analysis/back-to-square-one-on-the-rankings-front/story-e6frgcko-1225831101658 |title=Back to square one on the rankings front |publisher=The Australian |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  THE published its first rankings using its new methodology on 16 September 2010, a month earlier than previous years.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baty |first=Phil |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=413249&amp;c=1 |title=THE World Rankings set for release on 16&amp;nbsp;September |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, along with the QS World University Rankings and the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] are described to be the three most influential international university rankings.&lt;ref name="new world ranking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/schools+always+marks/3560240/story.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003203348/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/schools+always+marks/3560240/story.html|archivedate=2010-10-03|title=Top schools don't always get top marks|author=Indira Samarasekera and Carl Amrhein|publisher=''[[The Edmonton Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' in 2010 described the Times Higher Education World University Rankings to be "arguably the most influential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadas-universities-make-the-grade-globally/article1709616/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213172820/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadas-universities-make-the-grade-globally/article1709616/|archivedate=2011-02-13|title=Canada's universities make the grade globally|author=Simon Beck and Adrian Morrow|publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Times Higher Education announced a series of important changes to its flagship THE World University Rankings and its suite of global university performance analyses, following a strategic review by THE parent company TES Global.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/news/times-higher-education-announces-reforms-to-world-university-rankings Times Higher Education announces reforms to its World University Rankings.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Criteria and weighting===
The inaugural 2010-2011 [[methodology]] contained 13 separate indicators grouped under five categories: Teaching (30 percent of final score), research (30 percent), citations (research impact) (worth 32.5 percent), international mix (5 percent), industry income (2.5 percent). The number of indicators is up from the Times-QS rankings published between 2004 and 2009, which used six indicators.&lt;ref name="Methodology"&gt;"[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/analysis-methodology.html World University Rankings subject tables: Robust, transparent and sophisticated]" (16 September 2010). ''Times Higher Education World University Rankings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft of the inaugural methodology was released on 3 June 2010. The draft stated that 13 indicators would first be used and that this could rise to 16 in future rankings, and laid out the categories of indicators as "research indicators" (55 percent), "institutional indicators" (25 percent), "economic activity/innovation" (10 percent), and "international diversity" (10 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baty |first=Phil |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=411907&amp;c=1 |title=THE unveils broad, rigorous new rankings methodology |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The names of the categories and the weighting of each was modified in the final methodology, released on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt; The final methodology also included the weighting signed to each of the 13 indicators, shown below:&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt;

The ''Times Higher Education'' billed the methodology as "robust, transparent and sophisticated," stating that the final methodology was selected after considering 10 months of "detailed consultation with leading experts in global higher education," 250 pages of feedback from "50 senior figures across every continent" and 300 postings on its website.&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt; The overall ranking score was calculated by making [[Standard score|Z-scores]] all datasets to standardize different data types on a common scale to better make comparisons among data.&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt;

The reputational component of the rankings (34.5 percent of the overall score – 15 percent for teaching and 19.5 percent for research) came from an Academic Reputation Survey conducted by [[Thomson Reuters]] in spring 2010. The survey gathered 13,388 responses among scholars "statistically representative of global higher education's geographical and subject mix."&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt; The magazine's category for "industry income – innovation" came from a sole indicator, institution's research income from industry scaled against the number of academic staff." The magazine stated that it used this data as "proxy for high-quality knowledge transfer" and planned to add more indicators for the category in future years.&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt;

Data for [[citation impact]] (measured as a normalized average citation per paper), comprising 32.5 percent of the overall score, came from 12,000 [[academic journal]]s [[Citation index|indexed]] by Thomson Reuters' large [[Web of Science]] database over the five years from 2004 to 2008. The ''Times'' stated that articles published in 2009–2010 have not yet completely accumulated in the database.&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt; The normalization of the data differed from the previous rankings system and is intended to "reflect variations in citation volume between different subject areas," so that institutions with high levels of research activity in the [[life science]]s and other areas with high citation counts will not have an unfair advantage over institutions with high levels of research activity in the [[social science]]s, which tend to use fewer citations on average.&lt;ref name="Methodology"/&gt;

The magazine announced on 5 September 2011 that its 2011–2012 World University Rankings would be published on 6 October 2011.&lt;ref name="Launch Date"&gt;Phil Baty, "[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=417345&amp;c=1 World University Rankings launch date revealed]" (5 September 2011). ''Times Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the magazine revealed changes to the ranking formula that will be introduced with the new rankings. The methodology will continue to use 13 indicators across five broad categories and will keep its "fundamental foundations," but with some changes. Teaching and research will each remain 30 percent of the overall score, and industry income will remain at 2.5 percent. However, a new "international outlook – staff, students and research" will be introduced and will make up 7.5 percent of the final score. This category will include the proportion of international staff and students at each institution (included in the 2011–2012 ranking under the category of "international diversity"), but will also add the proportion of research papers published by each institution that are co-authored with at least one international partner. One 2011–2012 indicator, the institution's public research income, will be dropped.&lt;ref name="Launch Date"/&gt;

On 13 September 2011, the ''Times Higher Education'' announced that its 2011–2012 list will only rank the top 200 institutions. Phil Baty wrote that this was in the "interests of fairness," because "the lower down the tables you go, the more the data bunch up and the less meaningful the differentials between institutions become." However, Baty wrote that the rankings would include 200 institutions that fall immediately outside the official top 200 according to its data and methodology, but this "best of the rest" list from 201 to 400 would be unranked and listed alphabetically. Baty wrote that the magazine intentionally only ranks around 1 percent of the world's universities in a recognition that "not every university should aspire to be one of the global research elite."&lt;ref&gt;Phil Baty. "[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=417429&amp;c=2 The top 200 – and the best of the rest]" (13 September 2011), ''Times Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2015/16 edition of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranks 800 universities, while Phil Baty announced that the 2016/17 edition, to be released on 21 September 2016, will rank "980 universities from 79 countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World University Rankings 2015/16|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/-1/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only|website=Times Higher Education|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baty|first1=Phil|title=World University Rankings 2016-2017 launch date announced|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/world-university-rankings-2016-2017-launch-date-announced|website=Times Higher Education|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology of the rankings was changed during the 2011-12 rankings process, with details of the changed methodology here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2011-2012/analysis-rankings-methodology.html THE Global Rankings: Change for the better]. Times Higher Education (2011-10-06). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phil Baty, the rankings editor, has said that the THE World University Rankings are the only global university rankings to examine a university's teaching environment, as others focus purely on research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20101126204406989 |title=GLOBAL: Crucial to measure teaching in rankings |publisher=Universityworldnews.com |date=2010-11-28 |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baty has also written that the THE World University Rankings are the only rankings to put arts and humanities and social sciences research on an equal footing to the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baty |first=Phil |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=417136&amp;c=1 |title=Arts on an equal footing |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim is no longer true. In 2015, QS introduced faculty area normalization to their QS World University Rankings, ensuring that citations data was weighted in a way that prevented universities specializing in the Life Sciences and Engineering from receiving undue advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.qs.com/qsiu/Faculty_Area_Normalization_-_Technical_Explanation.pdf|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the magazine announced further reforms to the methodology after a review by parent company TES Global. The major change being all institutional data collection would be bought in house severing the connection with [[Thomson Reuters]]. In addition, research publication data would now be sourced from [[Elsevier]]'s [[Scopus]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/news/times-higher-education-announces-reforms-to-world-university-rankings |title=Times Higher Education announces reforms to its World University Rankings |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2014-11-20 |accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The reception to the methodology was varied.

Ross Williams of the [[Melbourne Institute]], commenting on the 2010–2011 draft, stated that the proposed methodology would favour more focused "science-based institutions with relatively few undergraduates" at the expense of institutions with more comprehensive programmes and undergraduates, but also stated that the indicators were "academically robust" overall and that the use of scaled measures would reward productivity rather than overall influence.&lt;ref name=praise1&gt;Andrew Trounson, "[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/science-bias-will-affect-local-rankings/story-e6frgcjx-1225877209849 Science bias will affect local rankings]" (9 June 2010). ''[[The Australian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Smith (academic)|Steve Smith]], president of [[Universities UK]], praised the new methodology as being "less heavily weighted towards subjective assessments of reputation and uses more robust citation measures," which "bolsters confidence in the evaluation method."&lt;ref name=praise2&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Smith|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/analysis-uk-performance.html|title=Pride before the fall?|publisher=''Times Higher Education'' World University Rankings|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Willetts]], British [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Minister of State for Universities and Science]] praised the rankings, noting that "reputation counts for less this time, and the weight accorded to quality in teaching and learning is greater."&lt;ref name=praise3&gt;"[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/analysis-uk-education.html Global path for the best of British]," (16 September 2010). ''Times Higher Education'' World University Rankings.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, David Willetts became chair of the TES Global Advisory Board, responsible for providing strategic advice to Times Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New partner for THE rankings; David Willetts joins TES Global advisory board|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/new-partner-for-the-rankings-david-willetts-joins-tes-global-advisory-board/2017164.article|website=Times Higher Education|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Times Higher Education places a high importance on citations to generate rankings. Citations as a metric for effective education is problematic in many ways, placing universities who do not use English as their primary language at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publications_homepage_list/Global_University_Rankings_and_Their_Impact.sflb.ashx Global university rankings and their impact] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826181934/http://www.eua.be/Libraries/Publications_homepage_list/Global_University_Rankings_and_Their_Impact.sflb.ashx |date=26 August 2012 }}," (2011). "European University Association"&lt;/ref&gt; Because English has been adopted as the international language for most academic societies and journals, citations and publications in a language different from English are harder to come across.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwts.nl/TvR/documents/AvR-Language-Scientometrics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, such a methodology is criticized for being inappropriate and not comprehensive enough.&lt;ref name="RankingWatch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes |first=Richard |url=http://rankingwatch.blogspot.com/2006/09/so-thats-how-they-did-it-for-some-time.html |title=So That's how They Did It |publisher=Rankingwatch.blogspot.com |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second important disadvantage for universities of non-English tradition is that within the disciplines of social sciences and humanities the main tool for publications are books which are not or only rarely covered by digital citations records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoom.be/sites/ecoom.be/files/downloads/Engels%20et%20al%20changing%20pub%20patterns%20SSH%20Scientometrics%202012.pdf|title=Changingpublication patterns in the Social Sciences and Humanities 2000-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Times Higher Education]] has also been criticized for its strong bias towards institutions that taught 'hard science' and had high quality output of research in these fields, often to the disadvantage of institutions focused on other subjects like the social sciences and humanities. For instance in the former [[THE-QS World University Rankings]], [[The London School of Economics and Political Science|LSE]] was ranked 11th in the world in 2004 and 2005, but dropped to 66th and 67th in the 2008 and 2009 edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/.../LSEServices/.../LSEInvestigationsIntoTheTHEandQSleaguetables.aspx]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, THE concluded the method employed by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]], who conducted the survey on their behalf, was flawed in such a way that bias was introduced against certain institutions, including LSE.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/divisionsAndDepartments/ERD/LSEinUniversityLeagueTables.aspx |title=LSE in university league tables – External Relations Division – Administrative and academic support divisions – Services and divisions – Staff and students – Home |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=26 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429102759/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/divisionsAndDepartments/ERD/LSEinUniversityLeagueTables.aspx |archivedate=29 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative of [[Thomson Reuters]], THE's new partner, commented on the controversy: "''LSE stood at only 67th in the last Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings – some mistake surely? Yes, and quite a big one''."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Nonetheless, after the change of data provider to Thomson Reuters the following year, LSE fell to 86th place, with the ranking described by a representative of Thomson Reuters as 'a fair reflection of their status as a world class university'.&lt;ref name="lse.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/LSEinUniversityLeagueTables.aspx|title=Page not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London School of Economics|LSE]] despite being ranked continuously near the top in its national rankings, has been placed below other British universities in the Times Higher Education World Rankings in recent years, other institutions such as [[Sciences Po]] have suffered due to the inherent methodology bias still used.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  [[Trinity College Dublin]]'s ranking in 2015 and 2016 was lowered by a basic mistake in data it had submitted; education administrator Bahram Bekhradnia said the fact this went unnoticed evinced a "very limited checking of data" "on the part of those who carry out such rankings". Bekhradnia also opined "while Trinity College was a respected university which could be relied upon to provide honest data, unfortunately that was not the case with all universities worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0921/818218-university-tables-trinity/|title=Trinity removed from rankings after data error|date=22 September 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general it is not clear who the rankings are made for. Many students, especially the undergraduate students, are not interested in the scientific work of a facility of higher education. Also the price of the education has no effects on the ranking. That means that private universities on the North American continent are compared to the European universities. Many European countries like France, Sweden or Germany for example have a long tradition on offering free education within facilities of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/education/15iht-educLede15.html|title=Questionable Science Behind Academic Rankings|last=Guttenplan|first=D. d|date=2010-11-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32821678|title=How US students get a university degree for free in Germany|last=Strasser|first=Franz|date=2015-06-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ''THE'' also provides '''''150 Under 50 Universities''''' with different weightings of indicators to accredit the growth of institutions that are under 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/one-hundred-fifty-under-fifty#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank_label/sort_order/asc/cols/rank_only|title=Times Higher Education 150 Under 50 Rankings 2016|publisher= Times Higher Education|accessdate=12 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the ranking attaches less weight to reputation indicators. For instance, [[University of Canberra]] [[Australia]] established in Year 1990 at the rank 50 of 150 Under 50 Universities.

===Subject===
Various academic disciplines are sorted into six categories in ''THE'''s subject rankings: "[[Art]]s &amp; [[Humanities]]"; "[[Healthcare Sciences|Clinical, Pre-clinical &amp; Health]]"; "[[Engineering|Engineering &amp; Technology]]"; "[[Life Sciences]]"; "[[Physical Sciences]]"; and "[[Social Sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/subject-ranking/subject/clinical-pre-clinical-health |title=TIMES Higher Education University Rankings by subjects (2013/14)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reputation===
[[File:Reputation of Universities.png|thumb|Regions with universities included in the reputation league tables.]]

''THE'''s '''''World Reputation Rankings''''' serve as a subsidiary of the overall league tables and rank universities independently in accordance with their scores in prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=415429&amp;c=2|title=Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings|author=John Morgan|publisher=''[[Times Higher Education]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Jaschik of [[Inside Higher Ed]] said of the new rankings: "...Most outfits that do rankings get criticised for the relative weight given to reputation as opposed to objective measures. While Times Higher Education does overall rankings that combine various factors, it is today releasing rankings that can't be criticised for being unclear about the impact of reputation – as they are strictly of reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/03/10/new_global_measures_released_for_evaluating_countries_and_institutions|title=Global Comparisons |author=Scott Jaschik|publisher=''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11553">'''Two Plus Two Publishing''' is a private company established and owned by statistician and poker player [[Mason Malmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://esos.state.nv.us/SOSServices/AnonymousAccess/CorpSearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=b1Na7yFMJ8mJtcSIVgleQA%253d%253d Nevada Secretary of State: Entity Details]&lt;/ref&gt; The company publishes books on [[poker]] and [[gambling]] written by professionals in the field such as [[David Sklansky]], [[Dan Harrington]], [[Bill Robertie]], Collin Moshman, [[Ed Miller (poker player)|Ed Miller]], [[Ray Zee]], [[Sunny Mehta]], Alan Schoonmaker, William Jockusch, and Malmuth himself.

Two Plus Two Publishing has sold over two million books and currently has more than 39 titles to its credit.&lt;ref name="2p2books"&gt;[http://www.twoplustwo.com/books/ Two Plus Two Books], List and Synopsis of 2+2 Titles.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Malmuth, the name was adopted from the cover design of his book ''Gambling Theory and Other Topics'' where the equation 2+2=4 was illustrated with card pictures. In addition, many of its titles are now being translated into many non-English languages.

The Two Plus Two website operates a popular [[Internet forum]] for discussions on mostly poker and gambling-related topics, where it also publishes the Two Plus Two monthly electronic magazine (which includes gambling articles by Two Plus Two authors and others, such as Nick Christenson and King Yao) and the weekly Two Plus Two Pokercast. Posts on the forums helped uncover the [[Absolute Poker]] cheating scandal that was later featured on [[60 Minutes]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/29/AR2008112901679_4.html WashingtonPost.com: Players Gamble on Honesty, Security of Internet Betting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pokercast==
The Two Plus Two Pokercast is a weekly [[podcast]] that reports on both [[live poker]] and [[online poker]].  The show is hosted by Mike Johnson and poker pro Adam Schwartz, with regular contributions from a number of other poker strategists and players.  Typically recorded on Tuesday nights in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, the show is released on Wednesday mornings via the [[iTunes Store]] and the Two Plus Two website.  The show is sponsored by the [[Pokerstars]] VIP Club.

===Prior to Two Plus Two===
The hosts of the Two Plus Two Pokercast were the founders of “Rounders – The Poker Show” which launched in April 2005 on terrestrial radio station [[CKST|The Team 1040]] (Vancouver) airing weekly on Sunday nights and archived on BigPoker.ca.  Rounders ran for 134 episodes before Mike Johnson and Adam Schwartz co-created the Two Plus Two Pokercast in January 2008.&lt;ref name="rounders"&gt;[http://www.bigpoker.ca/rounders/ Rounders – The Poker Show], Announcement of Rounders' move to Two Plus Two Pokercast.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy segments===
Interspersed between segments of the show and advertisements are short strategy segments from top poker pros.  Originally, the presenters of these segments were Two Plus Two authors and posters, however as of January 2009 LeggoPoker.com became the official strategy sponsor of the show, and now provides weekly strategy segments by their stable of video producers.

====Sklansky minutes====
Aside from strategy segments are “Sklansky Minutes” recorded by Two Plus Two author David Sklansky.  Subjects include poker and other games, general gambling theory and musings on life.  A collection of similar musings and "life strategy" was published in January 2010 under the title "DUCY?" – Two Plus Two shorthand for "Do You See Why?".

===Evidence in lawsuit===
Shortly after winning the [[2006 World Series of Poker]] main event, [[Jamie Gold]] appeared on Episode #65 of Rounders, during the interview Gold discussed his backing arrangement with Crispin Leyser.

'''Visual culture''' is the aspect of [[culture]] expressed in [[image|visual images]]. Many academic fields study this subject, including [[cultural studies]], [[art history]], [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[media studies]], and [[anthropology]].

== Overview ==
Among theorists working within contemporary culture, this field of study often overlaps with [[film theory|film studies]], [[psychoanalytic theory]], [[sex studies]], [[queer theory]], and the [[television studies|study of television]]; it can also include [[video game studies]], [[comics]], [[visual arts|traditional artistic media]], [[advertising]], the [[Internet]], and any other medium that has a crucial [[visual]] component.

The field's versatility stems from the range of objects contained under the term "visual culture", which aggregates "visual events in which information, meaning or pleasure is sought by the consumer in an interface with visual technology".  The term "visual technology" refers any media designed for purposes of perception or with the potential to augment our visual capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirzoeff|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Mirzoeff|title=What is Visual Culture?|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Mirzoeff-What_is_Visual_Culture.pdf|work= The Visual Culture Reader (2nd ed.)|isbn=978-0-415-14134-5 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the changing technological aspects of visual culture as well as a scientific method-derived desire to create taxonomies or articulate what the "visual" is, many aspects of Visual Culture overlap with the study of science and technology, including hybrid electronic media, cognitive science, neurology, and image and brain theory.  In an interview with the ''[[Journal of Visual Culture]]'', academic [[Martin Jay]] explicates the rise of this tie between the visual and the technological: "Insofar as we live in a culture whose technological advances abet the production and dissemination of such images at a hitherto unimagined level, it is necessary to focus on how they work and what they do, rather than move past them too quickly to the ideas they represent or the reality they purport to depict. In so doing, we necessarily have to ask questions about ... technological mediations and extensions of visual experience."&lt;ref name="That Visual Turn"&gt;{{cite web|title=That Visual Turn|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Jay-VisualTurn-JVC-2002.pdf|work=[[Journal of Visual Culture]]|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualism==
The term "Visualism" was developed by the German anthropologist [[Johannes Fabian]] to criticise the dominating role of vision in scientific discourse, through such terms as [[observation]]. He points to an under theorised approach to the use of visual representation which leads to a corpuscular theory of knowledge and information which leads to their atomisation.&lt;ref name=Rarey&gt;{{cite book |last=Rarey |first=Matthew |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Elkins |editor2-first=Kristi |editor2-last=McGuire |editor3-first=Maureen |editor3-last=Burns |editor4-first=Alicia |editor4-last=Chester |editor5-first=Joel  |editor5-last=Kuennen |title=Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages= 278–281|chapter=Visualism |isbn=9781136159169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other areas of study==
It also may overlap with another emerging field, that of [[performance studies]].  As "the turn from art history to visual culture studies parallels a turn from theater studies to performance studies", it is clear that the perspectival shift that both emerging fields embody is comparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Shannon|title=Performing Show and Tell: Disciplines of Visual Culture and Performance Studies|url=http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/4/2/163.abstract|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Visual Culture" goes by a variety of names at different institutions, including Visual and Critical Studies, Visual and Cultural Studies, and Visual Studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
There has appeared analysis which applies method with computational media. For example, in 2008, [[Yukihiko Yoshida]] did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Leni Riefenstahl]] and [[German expressionism]]: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries."  The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl's imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], Germany at 1937.

== History ==
Early work on visual culture has been done by [[John Berger]] (''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', 1972) and [[Laura Mulvey]] (''[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]'', 1975) that follows on from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s theorization of the unconscious [[gaze]]. Twentieth-century pioneers such as [[György Kepes]] and [[William Ivins, Jr.]] as well as iconic phenomenologists like [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] also played important roles in creating a foundation for the discipline. For the history of art, [[Svetlana Alpers]] published a pioneering study on ''The Art of Describing: Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century'' (Chicago 1983) in which she took up an earlier implus of [[Michael Baxandall]] to study the visual culture of a whole region of early-modern Europe in all its facets: landscape painting and perception, optics and perspectival studies, geography and topographic measurements, united in a common ''mapping impulse''.

Major works on visual culture include those by [[W. J. T. Mitchell]], [[Griselda Pollock]], [http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/bruno.html Giuliana Bruno], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Paul Crowther (philosopher)|Paul Crowther]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Continuing work has been done by [[Lisa Cartwright]], [[Margaret Dikovitskaya]], [[Nicholas Mirzoeff]], and [[Jackie Stacey]]. The first book titled Visual Culture (Vizuális Kultúra) was written by [[:hu:Miklós Pál|Pál Miklós]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Vizuális Kultúra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miklós |first=Pál |title=Vizuális Kultúra: Elméleti és kritikai tanulmányok a képzőművészet köréből |publisher=Magvető |date=1976 |isbn=9632702980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For history of science and technology, [[Klaus Hentschel]] has published a systematic comparative history in which various patterns of their emergence, stabilization and diffusion are identified.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Klaus Hentschel]]: [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198717874.do ''Visual Cultures in Science and Technology - A Comparative History''], Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German-speaking world, analogous discussions about "Bildwissenschaft" (image studies) are conducted, a.o., by Gottfried Boehm, [[Hans Belting]], and Horst Bredekamp.

Visual culture studies have been increasingly important in religious studies through the work of [[David Morgan (Art Historian)|David Morgan]], Sally Promey, [[Jeffrey F. Hamburger]], and S. Brent Plate.

==Difference from image studies==

While the image remains a focal point in visual culture studies, it is the relations between images and consumers that are evaluated for their cultural significance, not just the image in and of itself.  [[Martin Jay]] clarifies, "Although images of all kinds have long served as illustrations of arguments made discursively, the growth of visual culture as a field has allowed them to be examined more in their own terms as complex figural artifacts or the stimulants to visual experiences."&lt;ref name="That Visual Turn"/&gt;

Likewise, [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] explicitly distinguishes the two fields in his claim that visual culture studies "helps us to see that even something as broad as the image does not exhaust the field of visuality; that visual studies is not the same thing as image studies, and that the study of the visual image is just one component of the larger field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Culture/Visual Studies: Inventory of Recent Definitions|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/VisualCulture/VisualCultureStudies-definitions.html|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White Collar Zen''' is a project by [[Steven Heine]], who is primarily known for his research on medieval Japanese [[Religion in Japan|religion]] and society. The project deals with the principles of [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] in relation to the contemporary workplace and professional leadership issues. ''White Collar Zen'' demonstrates how to incorporate [[Zen]] principles into daily work life in order to achieve professional success.

In addition to the book – ''White Collar Zen: Using Zen Principles to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Your Goal'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2005) – White Collar Zen is a multi-faceted project that includes a unique course on Asian Cultural Values in Business sponsored by the Eugenio Pino Entrepreneurship Center at [[Florida International University]], as well as workshops and conferences on ancient Asian wisdom and modern business.

The Asian Cultural Values in Business course was first taught in fall 2006. On November 17, 2006 a conference was held titled ''From East to West and West to East''. It included four panels that discussed how Asia has influenced the way the West does business and vice versa, and included such topics as Asian investment and international issues, leadership in a global perspective, and Asian cultural values and entrepreneurship. The panels featured student presentations from the Asian Cultural Values in Business course and various other speakers. Among them were authors of business negotiations in Asia: Mark McNeilly (Sun Tzu and the Art of Business: Six Strategic Principles for Managers), Bill Diffenderffer (The Samurai Leader), and Kaihan Krippendorff (The Art of Advantage: 36 Strategies to Seize the Competitive Edge).

==How to Tell a Buddha from a Fox==
In Asia, the mythical [[Kitsune|Fox]] is the primary symbol of how one can become entangled in a web of misunderstanding. The [[Kitsune|Fox]], which appears to its unwitting victim in human form, represents the deception and duplicity that brings with it self-doubt and frustrates the pursuit of aspirations. It is a symbol of undesirable tendencies, such as chasing after unattainable aims while leaving important parts of life unattended. Along with [[Kitsune|Foxes]] who deceive, however, there are always the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] who are eager to support, not because of personal ties or loyalty, but because they objectively evaluate the merits and demerits of a situation. Both the [[Kitsune|Fox]] and the Buddha are often disguised and each tries to pass as the other for strategic purposes. Distinguishing between them is a valuable skill. As decisions hang in the balance, the Unmoving Mind is a tool to separate truth or authenticity from illusion or untruth. Illusion renders you vulnerable to anxiety and confusion and unable to react to critical situations with clarity and lucidity.

==Elevation–Purification–Activation==
The process of Elevation-Purification-Activation (EPA) cultivates four basic levels of human consciousness: feeling or emotion, speaking or communication, thinking or logic, and knowing or intuitive awareness. When one is controlled by emotions, his or her actions become hasty and s/he is likely to say something inappropriate. The key is to elevate and purify one's feelings so that they are balanced and objective. 

In attaining the Hermit's objective, one can effectively bring about constructive change. Tamed emotions are transmuted into the foundation of productive understanding. Such an understanding enables one to act with the Warrior's effortless, spontaneous creativity.

==The Hermit and the Warrior==
[[Steven Heine|Heine]] describes how [[Zen]] embraces two different and seemingly contradictory yet harmonious paths of behavior. The Way of the Hermit teaches detachment – the mental clarity you need to view your situation dispassionately and impartially, to perceive who is a friend and who is an enemy, to understand what is possible and what is not. The Way of the Warrior teaches the ability to act without hesitation and at the appropriate moment. Together, the ways can prepare one to meet the challenges of the modern world of business.  

Both ways can be applied to contemporary affairs.  The Warrior is always on the move and is able to establish a base of power while transient. The shifts and transitions do not conflict, but in the end enhance the Warrior's abilities. The Hermit is also in a state of continuing transition. A hermit gains strength through passivity, standing back from conflict, looking at things clearly and objectively, and remaining noncommittal until it is absolutely necessary to react. He aggressively pursues passivity by moving, not standing still and seeking out areas and arenas where constructive passivity can best be applied. 

The Warrior is dynamic, assertive and taking a stand. A Hermit is also dynamic in his own way by actively not taking a stand. In integrating the Warrior and Hermit approaches, Zen training provides a timely new paradigm for being clear in thoughts and disciplined in actions to establish harmonious interpersonal relations and attain mutually beneficial goals.

==Encounter vs. Confrontation==
A key objective is to transform dysfunctional conflicts (or Confrontations) rife with antagonism and turmoil into creative negotiations (or Encounters) characterized by shared purposes and cooperation. In a Confrontation, words do not ease tensions or have a reforming impact but cause the basic inflexibility of structure to tighten. It is characterized by personal will and gain, divisiveness, threats, and demands.  It results in a direct challenge based on alternating aggressive and passive attitudes which lead to conflict and discord. 

A Confrontation compounds futility and leads to further misunderstanding, whereas an Encounter is a productive form of negotiation with mutually beneficial results. Through negotiations, agreements, and ongoing teamwork, one can use indirect methods to reach goals by creating situations that facilitate cooperation. Both approaches involve some kind of meeting but the former, by being one-dimensional in attitude, fails to mobilize multiple factors of constructive engagement.

==The Four Steps==
The Four Steps are a means of developing self-discipline and self-control to overcome obstacles at the workplace and achieve success in the professional world through an Encounter. By cultivating the Unmoving Mind and by applying the methods discussed in ''White Collar Zen'', one is able to deal with professional challenges:

===Step 1: Recognize a Crisis in Structure===
Recognize a crisis in the structure of the work organizational environment and work through channels by investigating the roots of the problem, but without jumping to conclusions in either blaming others or remaining unassertive.

===Step 2: Use Words Creatively===
Speak creatively to alter perceptions and receptivity regarding a problem in organizational structure by getting one's message across effectively. One persuades not because of self-interest, but based on genuine commitment to ideals and goals.

===Step 3: Silence as a Tool for Strategic Planning===
Move beyond reliance on words by knowing when to refrain from speaking if verbal communication falls short, and let events take a natural course through waiting patiently yet without becoming overly passive.

===Step 4: Enter the Realm of Anti-Structure===
When both words and no-words fail, a more inventive form of ''White Collar Zen'' is required, which is found in the fourth step, the path of anti-structure. Awakening the Unmoving Mind empowers you to cross over invisible lines of hierarchy and division. Seize the moment for a bold, break the rules anti-structural expression that is based on integrity and responsibility. Cutting through structure involves taking risks but can be appropriate and conducive to progressive interaction and growth.  There are times when the attitudes or behavior of Zen masters are unpredictable and even outrageous in questioning authority that is arbitrary and therefore oppressive.  A famous saying is, "If you see the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha."  This approach relinquishes any attachment to security and safety and takes a Zen master's leap from a 100-foot pole.
