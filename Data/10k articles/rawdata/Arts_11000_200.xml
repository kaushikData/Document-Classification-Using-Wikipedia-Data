      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10945">'''Accessible housing''' refers to the construction or modification (such as through renovation or [[home modification]]) of housing to enable independent living for persons with disabilities. [[Accessibility]] is achieved through architectural design, but also by integrating accessibility features such as modified furniture, shelves and cupboards, or even electronic devices in the home.

In Canada, Flexhousing is a concept that encourages homeowners to make renovations that modify their house over time to meet changing accessibility needs. The concept supports the goals of enabling "homeowners to occupy a dwelling for longer periods of time, perhaps over their entire lifetimes, while adapting to changing circumstances and meeting a wide range of needs"; Universal Housing in the United States and Lifetime Homes in the United Kingdom are similar concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Flexhousing(TM)? |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_001.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193828/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_001.cfm |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain applies the most widespread application of home access to date. In 1999, Parliament passed Section M, an amendment to residential building regulations requiring basic access in all new homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Doors to Be Swept Away in New Rules for Builders", Rachel Kelley, [[The Times]], December 5, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the 1988 Amendments to the [[Fair Housing Act]] added people with disabilities, as well as familial status, to the classes already protected by law from [[discrimination]] (race, color, gender, religion, creed, and country of origin). Among the protection for people with disabilities in the 1988 Amendments are seven construction requirements for all multifamily buildings of more than four units first occupied after March 13, 1991. These seven requirements are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fair Housing First, a website sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/ref&gt;
#An accessible building entrance on an accessible route,
#Accessible common and public use areas,
#Doors usable by a person in a wheelchair,
#Accessible route into and through the dwelling unit,
#Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls in accessible locations,
#Reinforced walls in bathrooms for later installation of grab bars, and
#Usable kitchens and bathrooms.

Access is typically defined within the limits of what a person sitting in a wheelchair is able to reach with arm movement only, with minimal shifting of the legs and torso. Lighting and thermostat controls should not be above and power outlets should not be below the reach of a person in a wheelchair.

Sinks and cooking areas typically need to be designed without cupboards below them, to permit the legs of the wheelchair user to roll underneath, and countertops may be of reduced height to accommodate a sitting rather than standing user. In some cases two food preparation areas may be combined into a single kitchen to permit both standing and wheelchair users.

In spite of these advancements, the housing types where most people in the United States reside&amp;nbsp;– single-family homes&amp;nbsp;– are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act, or any other federal law with the exception of the small percentage of publicly funded homes impacted by [[Section 504]] of the Rehabilitation Act. As a result, the great majority of new single-family homes replicate the barriers in existing homes.

==Renovations for accessibility==

Homeowners may be challenged by the need to find renovators familiar with accessible design issues. The federal government of Canada and the provincial governments work jointly to share the cost of offering reimbursement programs for homeowners in need of house renovations for accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Adaptations for Seniors' Independence |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_004.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610205814/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_004.cfm |archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs improve the ability of homeowners to fund house modifications, through renovating existing houses.

==Adaptations and accommodations==

Many [[ranch style home]]s and [[manufactured home]]s utilize a main floor slightly raised above ground level, but have an overall flat layout with either a [[Basement#Crawl space|crawlspace]] or slightly raised [[basement]] below for plumbing, electrical, and heating systems. These homes can be relatively easily modified to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers, with the installation of a long low-rise ramp outside the building, up to the house entrance, placed over the existing stairway. This ramp can then be removed at a later time, reverting to the stairway entrance if the handicapped access is no longer necessary.

[[Split level home]]s tend to be designed with multiple internal stairways and half-floor landings inside the building. There may be an entrance area inside the building at ground level, with stairs inside the entrance that immediately go up and down from the ground level. These homes are difficult to accommodate inexpensively since there is often no space available inside the structure to install long sloping wheelchair ramps to access the various floors. It may be possible to retrofit [[stair lift]]s into the stairwells or [[wheelchair lift]]s into balconies near the stairwell.

Multi-story homes can sometimes be accommodated by installing a private [[residential elevator]], which is usually much less expensive and has fewer design and layout requirements than a full commercial elevator. Homebuilders can in some cases plan for a future residential elevator by designing closet spaces in each floor stacked vertically with the same dimensions and location. At a later time the closet floors and ceilings are removed and the elevator equipment is installed into the open shaft.

Below are some current suggested architectural features of a universally-accessible house:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FlexHousing(TM) features a room-by-room demonstration |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_005.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503222532/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_005.cfm |archivedate=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging in place and accessibility==

A growing trend among senior citizens is to "age in place", reflecting a desire to retain independence for as long as possible. Adaptations for seniors take into account the most common physical impairments affecting the elderly. For example, a common cause of serious injury for seniors is falling inside the home. Adding handrails and [[grab bars]] throughout the home, particularly in bathrooms and along stairways, helps reduce the risk of falling. Other adaptations that improve accessibility for seniors include: easy-to-reach work and storage areas in the kitchen; reaching devices to grab objects on high shelves; lever handles on doors; [[toilet seat riser]]s; walk-in showers; and bathtub and shower seats.

===Alzheimer disease and housing adaptations===

[[Alzheimer disease]] presents specific challenges for caregivers, who need to make the home as accessible as possible to the elderly resident, while keeping safety features in mind. Removable stove switch knobs, locks on kitchen cabinets, electric kettles with automatic shut-off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety in the kitchen |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/index.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610212818/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/index.cfm |archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person with Alzheimer disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacing, wandering and confusion |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/athoaldi_007.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611012925/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/athoaldi_007.cfm |archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7630">[[File:Anne Beatts visits Vancouver Film School Writing for Film &amp; Television.jpg|thumb|Anne Beatts at [[Vancouver Film School]] in 2010.]]
'''Anne Beatts''' (born February 25, 1947) is an  American [[comedy]] writer.

== Early life==
Beatts was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], to parents she has described as "[[beatniks]]".&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=85 The Paley Center for Media | She Made It | Anne Beatts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227194613/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=85 |date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatts grew to have what has been called an "aggressive, dark sensibility" &lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; which she later put to use in the world of comedy. Growing up in [[Somers, New York]], she later attended [[McGill University]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

It was at McGill University where Beatts discovered the darkly tragic humor of [[Jewish]] writers [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Philip Roth]], and [[Bruce Jay Friedman]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; At this time, Beatts converted to Judaism.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

== National Lampoon ==
After graduating from college, Beatts joined [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'' magazine]], a national offshoot of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. She brought her dark sense of humor to her work, and co-wrote a parody advertisement for [[Volkswagen]] which was conceived by Philip Socci for which the magazine was later sued by the car company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944670,00.html?promoid=googlep | work=Time | title=The Press: Lampoon's Surrender | date=12 November 1973 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement stated, "If [[Ted Kennedy]] drove a Volkswagen, he'd be President today," accompanied by a photograph of a [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] floating on a lake (an allusion to [[Ted Kennedy Chappaquiddick incident|Kennedy's Chappaquiddick incident]]).

Beatts became the first female editor of ''National Lampoon'' magazine, where she worked with [[Michael O'Donoghue]]. The two became romantically involved, and both soon joined the creative team of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the early years of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malcolmgladwell.com/2002/2002_12_02_a_snl.htm gladwell dot com - group think&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428053411/http://www.malcolmgladwell.com/2002/2002_12_02_a_snl.htm |date=April 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Beatts is regarded as something of a pioneer in TV and comedy circles, as an early female comedy writer and one of the very few female writers working in the ''National Lampoon''/''SNL'' comedy scene of the 1970s. At ''SNL'' she was nominated for an [[Emmy]] five times, winning once. She later won a Writer's Guild Award in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0064186/awards Anne Beatts - Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She created the cult hit 1982 CBS series ''[[Square Pegs]]'' and appeared in several episodes (she also did uncredited acting work on the early ''SNL''), and while the series lasted only one season it has been frequently rerun since and several of the cast members (most notably [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) have gone on to greater fame.

Since ''Square Pegs'', Beatts wrote the book for the 1985 [[Ellie Greenwich]] [[jukebox musical]] ''[[Leader of the Pack (musical)|Leader of the Pack]]'' and produced the first season of ''[[A Different World]]'' in 1987-1988 and since then has gradually dropped out of sight, writing for television very rarely. Her most recent TV credit was the 56th Annual Writers Guild Awards in 2004. In 2006, she directed  the series ''[[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] Presents Movies That Will Corrupt You'' with her writing and producing partner, Eve Brandstein for B-Girls Productions.

Beatts is currently serving as one of the judges for the comedy competition Project Breakout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comedy.projectbreakout.com/ Stand-Up vs. Sketch Comedy Showdown | Project Breakout&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142839/http://comedy.projectbreakout.com/ |date=May 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatts serves as Adjunct Professor in the Writing Division at the [[University of Southern California]]'s School of Cinematic Arts,&lt;ref name="USC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/faculty/beatts-anne.htm|title=Anne Beatts|publisher=University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts|accessdate=28 February 2010|location=Los Angeles, Calif.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100226035306/http://cinema.usc.edu/faculty/beatts-anne.htm| archivedate= 26 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. She also gives private lessons on writing sketch comedy.&lt;ref name="private lessons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernmirth.com/anne/annebeatts.html|title=Saturday Night Live in 5 Easy Lessons!|last=Beatts|first=Anne|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="private lessons" /&gt;

Beatts was portrayed by [[Natasha Lyonne]] in the 2018 [[Netflix]] film ''[[A Futile and Stupid Gesture (film)|A Futile and Stupid Gesture]]''.

The '''Asociación de Artistas Plásticos de El Salvador''' (ADAPES) is a prominent arts association in [[El Salvador]]. ADAPES was founded in 1980 by a group of recognized Salvadoran artists. The group's fundamental objective was initially the promotion of plastic arts in El Salvador. Since then, and with the collaboration of private and public institutions, ADAPES has branched out into promoting [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and related visual arts in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adapes.org/ |title=Web site of the Association of Artists ADAPES |access-date=2018-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731154051/http://www.adapes.org/ |archive-date=2008-07-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proudly UnAustralian.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Proudly UnAustralian'' by Azlan McLennan, confiscated by the Victoria Police in Melbourne, 2006.]]
Conceptually, McLennan's work tends to be unambiguous and antagonistic from a left-wing perspective, loosely following the traditions of [[agitprop]], [[anti-art]] and [[Institutional Critique]], incorporating elements of [[détournement]], [[readymade]] or [[installation art|installation]]. His works have often been characterised as controversial by conservative politicians, journalists and art critics, usually portraying the artist in a negative light.&lt;ref name="The politics"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/13/1084289821310.html "The politics of art"] ''The Age,'' 14 May 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, various liberal lawyers, academics and activists have defended his works, usually on the basis of [[free speech]], due to the offence sometimes caused by his art for its often overt left-leaning bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visualarts.net.au/files/NQ%20Dec%2008_fin.pdf "25 Years: NAVA at the forefront of Australia’s cultural policy agenda"] ''NAVA Quarterly''.

Accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The artist has expressed public criticisms over [[Zionism]], the [[War on Terror]], [[Australian nationalism]] and racism, the [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of [[asylum seekers]], various political figures and the [[managerial class]] of the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WhLNCpl6XgEJ:www.visualarts.net.au/files/Art_Censorship.pdf "Dealing With Art Censorship"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''National Association for the Visual Arts'' Media Release, 30 March 2009.

== Controversy ==

=== Victorian College of the Arts ===
In August 2003, McLennan hired a [[G4S|Group 4 Securicor]] guard to keep gallery punters out of an exhibition opening at the VCA. Group 4 run [[immigration detention]] centres in Australia, such as [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Baxter Detention Centre]] and the now closed [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Woomera Detention Centre]]. The security guard was reportedly humiliated due to the incident which occurred at a time of high criticism of the [[John Howard]] government's treatment of [[Refugee#Asylum seekers|asylum seekers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209182233/http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/09/03/1062548903857.html "VCA artwork raises ethics concerns"] ''The Age,'' 4 September 2003. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24seven ===
In May 2004, McLennan produced ''Fifty-six,'' an exhibition designed to coincide with [[Nakba Day]], the title drawing on the number of years since the establishment of [[Israel]]. The public exhibition in the shop front window space of 24seven Gallery on one of Melbourne CBD's busy streets, was censored by the [[City of Melbourne]] days after it was installed. The installation consisted of a large wall painting of an Israeli flag, with "debatable" statistics on the gallery's window about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The scandal made international news, many pro-Israel individuals and groups accusing McLennan of [[antisemitism]]. This put a number of Victorian political figures such as former Premier [[Steve Bracks]], Lord Mayor [[John So]] and former City of Melbourne councillor Kimberly Kitching under pressure to respond. The use of taxpayer's money to fund the space fuelled a lot of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.discoverymedia.com.au/artzinePub/story.asp?id=375&amp;section=ExNews "Making Space – spanking the hand that feeds it"] ''Art Right Now,'' 16 June 2007. Accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan also deeply outraged some critics by insinuating that the [[Nazis]] had a similar position on what they termed [[degenerate art]]. McLennan maintains a strong criticism of Israeli policies.&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt;

=== Citylights ===
In August 2004, McLennan displayed ''State Sponsored'', a collection of portraits of [[Hamas]] militants, including [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdul Aziz Rantisi|Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi]] and the dates they were assassinated. The work was exhibited at Citylights project – a public art space in a Melbourne CBD lane way. McLennan was accused of glorifying terrorism by Ted Lapkin, a senior policy analyst of the [[Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council]]. Andrew Mac, Citylights' curator and director defended the work on the grounds of diversity of opinion stating the artist's use of "state sponsored" referred to [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Jewish-group-blasts-offensive-artwork/2004/12/10/1102625519852.html "Jewish group blasts 'offensive' artwork"] ''The Age,'' 10 December 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Artists Group ===
In September 2005, the City of Melbourne intervened to terminate McLennan's ''Canberra's 18'' exhibition shortly before it was scheduled to be shown at the [[Platform artists group]]'s [[Artist-run initiative]] (ARI), Platform 2. The exhibition was to include images of the then 18 Islamic organisations proscribed as terrorists by the Australian Government and the basis for their formation. City of Melbourne Deputy Mayor [[Gary Singer]] claimed the proper guidelines were not followed. Human rights campaigner and barrister [[Julian Burnside]] claimed the censorship was about governments testing how much Australians would tolerate such occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/war-on-terrorism-is-claiming-victims-on-the-walls-of-art-galleries/2005/09/15/1126750082623.html "War on terrorism is claiming victims on the walls of art galleries"] ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' 16 September 2005.

=== Monash University ===
[[Monash University Art and Design Faculty]] in Melbourne withdrew McLennan's video ''Mind the Gap'' in October 2005, ironically made for the same exhibition Monash had agreed to show the censored ''Canberra's 18'' work. The video contained graphic footage of the [[beheading]] of British contractor [[Kenneth Bigley]] by [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] in 2004. The video criticised former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for his role in the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html "Azlan McLennan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520005543/http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html |date=20 May 2008 }} ''un Magazine,'' Volume 7, 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship is likely to have been motivated by the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005]], particularly the controversial return to the crime of [[sedition]] introduced by the Howard government some weeks later and passed into law the following month; a move highly unpopular amongst the arts sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 "Artists 'at risk' under terror laws"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627104653/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 |date=27 June 2006 }} ''NineMSN,'' 8 November 2005.

=== Urban Art ===
City of Melbourne and acting Transport Minister [[Bob Cameron (Victorian politician)|Bob Cameron]] censored ''Pay Your Way'' in January 2006 while McLennan was in residency in Indonesia. The posters – part of the Urbanart ARI program – were displayed in public tram shelters and pulled down only hours later due to complaints. The works featured images of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]], a Brazilian man shot dead by London police and accused Muslim terrorist, [[Joseph T. Thomas|Jack Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fare-game-shelters-feel-the-brush-of-protest/2006/01/09/1136771500463.html "Fare game!

Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trocadero Art Space ===
Only weeks after the ''Pay Your Way'' affair, McLennan's ''Proudly UnAustralian'' was removed by the [[Victoria Police]] in Melbourne. The exhibition – featuring a burnt Australian flag – took place at Trocadero Art Space who rents a public billboard to exhibiting artists. It was to coincide with the 2006 [[Australia Day]] in January. The work was removed some days prior this date and McLennan arrived back in Australia days later to a media furore. The scandal had been criticised as offensive by those such as Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] MP [[Bronwyn Bishop]] who attempted to introduce a ban on [[Flag desecration|flag burning]], and the national president of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]]. [[Free speech]] advocates such as the [[National Association for the Visual Arts]] and criminal defence lawyer Rob Stary denounced the police's actions as an attack on [[civil rights]]. This took place only a few short months after the [[2005 Cronulla riots]] and fuelled the broader debate about [[racism in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm "Art prompts call for flag-burning law change"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211040610/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm |date=11 February 2006 }} ''The 7.30 Report'' (Transcript), 6 February 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Centre for Contemporary Art ===
McLennan wrote an article in 2006 criticising the Artistic Director of the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA), Juliana Engberg over her reaction to artist and VCA student, Ash Keating and his appropriation of ACCA's waste disposal for the use of his art. The Engberg/Keating scandal became widely known amongst Melbourne art circles from the ACCA exhibition opening where it took place and later through the independent electronic magazine [[Crikey]]. McLennan's polemic further fuelled debate over Engberg's credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/power-of-one/2006/08/31/1156817027357.html "Power of one"] ''The Age,'' 1 September 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anna Schwartz Gallery ===
McLennan featured in ''Rules of Engagement'' at Melbourne ARI West Space in May 2007, which dealt with "relationships, power and exchange within the art system" according to the show's curator Mark Feary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westspace.org.au/projects/rules-of-engagement.html?Itemid=0 "Rules of Engagement"] ''West Space'' (Catalogue Essay), May 2006.

Schwartz has previously criticised McLennan&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt; and some have accused McLennan of taking revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/artists-dish-it-out-to-the-dealers/2007/06/14/1181414455138.html "Artists dish it out to the dealers"] ''The Age,'' 15 June 2007.

=== University of Melbourne ===
In a July 2009, ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'' interview, McLennan attacked the [[University of Melbourne]] over the merger with the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], the [[Melbourne Model]], the liquidation of the [[Victorian College of the Arts Student Union|VCA Student Union]] and likened the Vice-chancellor, [[Glyn Davis]]' perceived political censorship to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s use of [[Nazi art|Fascist Art]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s use of [[Socialist Realism]]. He also depicted Davis and the Provost, [[Peter McPhee (academic)|Peter McPhee]], as [[Sex Pistols]] musicians, [[Johnny Rotten]] and [[Sid Vicious]] in a parody of the [[Sex Pistols#Never Mind the Bollocks|Never Mind the Bollocks]] album cover as well as depicting Davis as the violent [[psychopath]], [[Alex DeLarge]] in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film adaptation of [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;"Report on the death of the VCA" ''Farrago,'' Edition 5, July 2009, p. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan had previously attacked Davis and the university administration as the former General Secretary of the VCA Student Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1659&amp;Itemid=106 Smashing jobs, courses and student unions: A 2020 vision?] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 128, May 2008.

[[Marine art]] was especially popular in Britain during the Romantic Era, and taken up readily by British artists in part because of England's geographical form (an island).&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Hart, 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; This article deals with marine art as a specialized [[genre]] practised by artists who did little or nothing else, and does not cover the marine works of the leading painters of the period, such as, and above all, [[J.M.W. Turner]].  The tradition of British marine art as a specialized genre with a strong emphasis on the shipping depicted began in large part with the artists [[Willem Van de Velde the Elder]] and his son, called the Younger in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, 1, Brook-Hart.&lt;/ref&gt; The Van Veldes, originally from Holland, moved to England to work for King Charles II).&lt;ref&gt;Brewington, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, marine art was commissioned mostly by merchant seamen and naval officers and created by marine art specialists (rather than artists in general). In part, marine art served as a visual portrayal of Britain's power on the sea and as a way of historically documenting battles and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy 3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As British sea captains began to recognize the ability of marine artists to bring Britain's success on the sea to the public on land, some took on an active role in supporting this type of artwork. For example, marine artist [[Robert Cleveley]] was hired by Captain [[William Locker (Royal Navy officer)|William Locker]] to work in {{HMS|Thames|1758|6}} as a clerk, and Captain Locker, interested in employing artists, is believed to have played a significant role in encouraging Cleveley to work as a marine painter.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Captains would act as marine artists' patrons, commissioning them to paint portraits of themselves and pictures depicting important battles. A few significant marine artists who were supported in this way by naval officers are (among others) [[Nicholas Pocock]], [[Thomas Luny]], and [[George Chambers (painter)|George Chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hodges]], for example, who was trained to draw at William Shipley's Academy (studying under Richard Wilson), was hired by the Admiralty to finish his pictures from Cook's 1772 voyage for publication upon reaching home in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Captains also commissioned artists to paint portraits of their ships.

==Dutch Influence and the Beginning of the British Marine Art Tradition==
The tradition of marine painting really began in Holland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, perhaps because of the significance of seafaring in establishing and maintaining the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Dewitt, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine painting began in keeping with medieval Christian art tradition, and so the original paintings portrayed the sea only from a bird’s eye view, and everything, even the waves, were organized and symmetrical. The viewpoint, symmetry, and overall order of these early paintings were to keep in mind the organization of the heavenly cosmos from which the earth was viewed.&lt;ref&gt;Dewitt, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Dutch artists like Hendrick Vroom and Cornelius Claesz, however, developed new methods for painting, often from a horizontal point of view, with a lower horizon and more focus on realism than symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Dewitt, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable of the Dutch artists’ who influenced the British marine art tradition were [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]], and his son, the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]] was especially admired and thus influential in England because he lived and worked there for thirty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The methods developed by the Dutch to successfully depict some of the sea’s more elusive features (light and shadow, or the reflection of the sky over the ocean’s uneven surface, for example) were adopted by British artists as they founded their own marine art tradition. Knowledge of Dutch methods of marine painting was considered so fundamental to a successful marine painting education that it was likened to “grammar school” for the British marine artist.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is not uncommon to find Dutch ships painted into the works of British marine artists as a tribute to the Dutch artists from whom they gained so much knowledge and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Romantic Era==
In the Romantic era, interest in marine art expanded from its initial exclusive audience of sailors and naval officers to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this increased interest may be the significance of the navy in Romantic British culture. With the increase of industry in Britain and the threatening resurgence of the French royal navy during the time after the Peace of Utrecht, England found means and motivation to improve its sea power on both the level of mercantilism and conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Later into the Romantic era the Napoleonic Wars, which were fought in large part on the sea, brought the British navy further to the forefront when the British navy played a significant role in defeated the French forces.&lt;ref&gt;Callender, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The infamous [[Glorious First of June]] which marks a major British naval victory over the French during the French Revolutionary Wars, happened within the Romantic era (June 1, 1794) as did the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] of the Napoleonic Wars (October 21, 1805). For a contemporary depiction of the British navy during the Romantic era one might look to the popular fictional series by Patrick O'Brian which follows naval officer Captain Aubrey and his companion Maturin during the Napoleonic Wars or the Hornblower Saga by C.S. Forester which follows Horatio Hornblower as his career in the British navy progresses (also during the Napoleonic Wars). Whatever the reason, a new group of marine artists now made their way onto the scene. Landscape painters found inspiration in the sea and began to create work which was not always accurate, but which could be sold among the less technically sea-savvy art collectors in England.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Marine Painting==
British marine paintings from this era can be divided into three main categories. These are: ship portraits, paintings of ships at sea, and inshore, coastal and harbour scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Hart, 16,28.&lt;/ref&gt;

::'''Ship portraits''', as mentioned above, were immensely popular before and throughout the Romantic era.  Ship portraits were, as apparent by the name, focused entirely on the ship, rather than on the surrounding sea, although the best-known of the ship portraitists strove to carry the accuracy of their drawing out into the atmosphere surrounding the ship (sky, sea, coastlines, etc). Accuracy in all the details of the ship above all was of the utmost importance in ship portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Hart, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

::'''Paintings of ships at sea''' fell into two categories. Paintings of large, full-rigged vessels (such as naval vessels), and paintings of smaller vessels. The former had more prestige and was more expensive, while the later was much easier to come by and generally cheaper. Artists didn't necessarily choose larger or smaller vessels based the skill involved, as their location was often a factor. While some artists worked on/amongst large vessels (travelling with explorers, for example), others worked primarily on the coasts, and so would encounter fishing vessels and the life more frequently than war vessels and such.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Hart, 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John J Lee - Sweethearts and Wives - Google Art Project.jpg|''Sweethearts and Wives'' (1860), a harbour scene by the [[pre-Raphaelite]], [[John Lee (artist)|John Lee]]|thumb|300px]]
::'''Inshore, coastal and harbour scenes''' were often paintings of smaller vessels, and were (again) more common than paintings of large ships at sea. Coastal pictures offer more possibilities for painters in their depiction of the scene since the depth, quality, and surrounding land of the harbours/coastal areas was much more variant than the monotonous, albeit impressive deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Hart, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
Since marine artists in the Romantic era varied in technical knowledge (as noted earlier), there seems to have been a certain amount of debate about how an artist should balance aesthetic/artistic qualities with accuracy in their pictures. This stands in contrast to earlier marine painting (most often in the form of ship portraits for seamen and officers), which was judged solely by accuracy and not valued for artistic quality.&lt;ref&gt;Brewington, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge required for accuracy wasn't necessarily easy to come by. The standards outlined in the ''Liber Nauticus'' by Dominic and [[John Thomas Serres]] makes clear the level of expertise some expected in marine art. In this instruction manual on how to create marine art, the Serreses' declared: "many are the obstacles to the attainment of a proficiency in drawing Marine subjects, particularly as it is not only requisite that a person desirous of excelling in the Art should possess a knowledge of the construction of a ship, or of what is denominated Naval Architecture together with the proportion of masts &amp; yards, the width &amp; cut of the sails, &amp;c; but he should likewise be acquainted with Seamanship".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Cordingly, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain expectation of accuracy is also expressed in a review of two different paintings depicting the Glorious First of June (one—more dramatic/fantastical—by [[Philip de Loutherbourg]] and the other by [[Robert Cleveley]], who had long worked as a sailor and whose painting is quite a bit more tame if not as artistically skillful) by [[Anthony Pasquin]] (John Williams).&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, 11, ''Benezit'', 1128.&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Loutherbourg's picture on this popular subject is too licentious in the points of historic fact to please any nautical observer. Mr. Cleveley's performance did not impress me, instantaneously, with so much pleasure as Mr. Loutherbourg's; but it had this very desirable effect, that my satisfaction was strengthened in proportion as I viewed it. It is evident that this Artist has a far deeper knowledge of his subject than his compeer, and has not violated authenticity upon any material point: he has not painted to amaze but to satisfy: he has grouped both his pictures with an admirable taste; all the minutiae of the marine are vigorously preserved, and the effect of his atmosphere at morning and evening is strictly compatible with truth and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Tracy, 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Marine Art and the British Public==
Paintings commissioned by senior naval officers and displayed in the Royal Academy (as were many marine paintings) were not necessarily accessible to the larger British population. However, this does not mean that marine art was confined to the upper classes. Some marine artists and engravers made etchings and aquatints of the pictures bought by art collectors and such, and these copies could be sold to the general public at more affordable prices.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Working as a print dealer rarely generated a livable income for artists, but a few found success. Thomas and [[William Daniell]], for example, had a reasonable amount of success selling aquatints to the public and to book publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in America==
Various English artists influenced the tradition of American marine art, most notably Thomas Butterworth, whose battles of naval depictions during the War of 1812 became very popular among American art collectors. Although Butterworth may have never actually gone there, his work reached America thanks to aquatints of his works done by the English engraver Joseph Jeakes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmerding, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; So, just as aquatints made British marine art accessible to the general British population, they made British marine art accessible to the American population across the Atlantic. Another British influence on American marine art was Robert Salmon, who began his career in England in 1800, but ended up moving to America and bringing along with him a British "topographical style" which the younger artists then in New England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmerding, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major British Marine Artists==
There are far too many talented British marine artists from the Romantic Era to name them all here, but a few are [[William Anderson (artist)|William Anderson]], [[Robert Cleveley]], [[Thomas Luny]], [[George Chambers (painter)|George Chambers]], [[Nicholas Pocock]], [[William Hodges]], and [[Philip de Loutherbourg]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;For more artists, Nicholas Tracy mentions in the preface to his work, ''Britannia's Palette'': E.H.H. Archibald's Dictionary of Sea Painters, David Cordingly's book referenced below, and Roger Quarm and Scott Wilcox's Masters of the Sea, British Marine Watercolours as "valuable dictionaries of sea painters."

'''Buxton Opera House''' is in The Square, [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England.  It is a 902-seat opera house that hosts the annual [[Buxton Festival]] and, from 1994 to 2013, the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]], among others, as well as [[pantomime]] at Christmas, [[musical theatre|musicals]] and other entertainments year-round.  Hosting live performances until 1927, the theatre then was used mostly as a cinema until 1976.  In 1979, it was refurbished and reopened as a venue for live performance.

It was built in 1903 and designed by [[Frank Matcham]], one of Britain's finest theatre architects. He also designed a number of famous [[London]] theatres, including the [[London Palladium]] (1910) and the [[Coliseum Theatre|London Coliseum]] (1904). 

The Opera House ran as a successful theatre, receiving touring companies until 1927, when it was turned into a cinema.  Silent films were shown until 1932 when the theatre was wired for sound and could present ‘talkies’.  The Opera House also became the venue for an annual summer theatre festival from 1936 to 1942, two of them in conjunction with [[Lillian Bayliss]] and her London-based [[Old Vic]] company.  After the Second World War, the theatre continued to serve primarily as a cinema, although the Literary and Dramatic Societies of local schools [[Buxton College]] and Cavendish Grammar School staged annual performances of either [[Shakespeare]], such as ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1966), ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (1968) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1970), or modern works, such as [[Bertold Brecht]]'s ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' (1967) and [[Dylan Thomas]]'s ''The Doctor &amp; the Devils'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Bolton King, R 1973 Buxton College, 1675–1970&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the opera house's former finance chief was jailed for two years for stealing nearly £250,000 from the opera house accounts in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buxtonadvertiser.co.uk/news/local/ex-finance-chief-jailed-for-250-000-buxton-opera-house-fraud-1-6712061 "Ex-finance chief jailed for £250,000 Buxton Opera House fraud"], ''Buxton Advertiser'', 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refurbishment and reception==
[[File:Buxtonstageandpit.jpg|thumb|left|Stage, boxes and orchestra pit]]
The Opera House gradually fell into disrepair.  In 1976, it was closed and rumours circulated that it would never reopen. In 1979, however, it was restored and an [[orchestra pit]] was added to the original Frank Matcham design.  Since then, the Opera House has been a full-time venue for stage productions, presenting approximately 450 performances per year, including opera, dance, [[musical theatre]], [[pantomime]], comedy, drama, children's shows and concerts.  The theatre is staffed by a small full-time technical crew for all the backstage work, setting up all the shows and artists that appear. Volunteers from the local community are also employed for front-of-house duties including bar work and as ushers.

By the 1990s, more work was needed to repair and modernise the theatre, and from 1999 to 2001 an extensive programme of internal and external restoration took place.  In February 2007, another refurbishment was completed at the Opera House that saw the installation of air conditioning in the gallery and backstage area, new seats in the gallery and upper circle, a new get-in lift to replace the ramp and new backstage working lights as well as re-wiring and painting the backstage area and dressing rooms.  The current capacity is 902 seats.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

In 2011, ''[[FT Magazine]]'' featured an article on opera house design.  In the section called "My favourite experiences", the writer praised the European opera houses "designed by the Viennese architectural firm of Fellner and Helmer (the [[Zurich Opera House]] is [an] example) ... [which] represent a near-ideal marriage of size, acoustic and decorative beauty. Their British equivalents are those designed by [[Frank Matcham]] – best of all the Buxton Opera House."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andrew. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/793470dc-faa5-11e0-8fe7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1bf0DIXqA "Something completely magical: My favourite opera experiences",] ''FT Magazine'', 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre complex==
The theatre complex also includes the adjacent Pavilion Gardens, the 369-seat Pavilion Arts Centre (rebuilt in 2010; formerly the Paxton Theatre),&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;Woolman, Natalie. [http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29520/buxton-opera-house-to-open-new-pavilion-arts "Buxton Opera House to open new Pavilion arts venue"]. ''The Stage'', 7 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the Octagon Hall auditorium (built in 1875), as well as a two-storey restaurant with a bar and gift shop.  The arts centre stage area can be converted into a separate 93-seat studio theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derbyshire.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/the-opening-of-the-pavilion-art-centre-buxton-derbyshire-24528/ "The opening of the Pavilion art centre Buxton"]. ''Derbyshire Life'', 26 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Since July 1979, the Opera House and theatre complex has been home to the [[Buxton Festival]], which runs for about two weeks in mid-July and has developed into one of Britain's largest opera-based festivals.  Typically, it includes a [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] opera (with conductors such as Harry Christophers) and other rarely seen operas as well as more popular classics.  Running alongside it is the [[Buxton Festival Fringe]].  It is popular as a warm-up for the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and it now claims to be the largest 'true' fringe festival in the UK.  From 1994 to 2013, the Opera House also hosted the annual three-week-long [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]], attracting audiences from all over the UK and from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Rupert. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10176800/Gilbert-and-Sullivan-Festival-bows-out-of-Buxton.html "Gilbert and Sullivan Festival bows out of Buxton"], ''The Telegraph'', 15 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opera House presents over 400 performances each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laughingaudience.co.uk/buxton-opera-house.html "Buxton Opera House"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Paul Iles &amp; The Laughing Audience, accessed 18 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, the Opera House and the neighbouring Pavilion Gardens have hosted the annual Four Four Time music festival which sees a wide variety of musical performances over one week in February.  Performers for the 2008 festival included [[Marc Almond]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[The Stranglers]] and [[Boy George]].

'''Came glasswork''' is the process of joining cut pieces of [[art glass]] through the use of [[came]] strips or foil into picturesque designs in a framework of soldered metal.

Final products include a wide range of glasswork, including [[stained glass]] and [[leadlight|lead light]] pieces. Came is made of different metals, such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[brass]] and [[copper]]. The metal came selected generally depends upon the size, complexity and weight of the project. As an alternative to came, copper foil may be used, for small, intricate pieces.

==Overview==
Came glasswork includes assembling pieces of cut and possibly painted [[Art glass|glass]] using [[came]] sections. The joints where the came meet are [[solder]]ed to bind the sections. When all of the glass pieces have been put within came and a border put around the entire work, pieces are [[cement]]ed and supported as needed.&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt; The work may be made [[waterproof]] by forcing a soft oily cement or [[Putty|mastic]] between the glass and the cames. A form of [[embellishment]] and [[gilding]], such as [[Angel gilding]] and [[Eglomise]], may be added to finish the piece.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Works may need to be reinforced, like large pieces or ones that will be exposed to the outdoor elements. Support can be provided as the piece is made through the use of reinforced and metal-covered lead came, the use of steel strips in the came channels, or use of rigid cames, such as [[copper]], [[brass]] or [[zinc]]. Bars of steel or [[steel]] [[rebar]] may be attached to the back of finished works as reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Shannon60&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Theophilus Presbyter]], the first to write about joining art glass using the came technique&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Daniel and Susan Chace. (editors). (1979). ''Reader's Digest Crafts &amp; Hobbies''. Readers Digest. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-89577-063-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the book ''De Divers Artibus''. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk who was a glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley, J. et al. (1998). Back to the Roots: The Raw Materials, Glass Recipes and Glassmaking Practices of Theophilus. In: McCray, P. (ed). ''The Prehistory and History of Ancient Glassmaking''. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone, I. (1992). ''Theophilus and the Composition of Medieval Glass, Materials Issues in Art and Archaeology III''. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Materials Research Society. p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Materials to complete a glasswork project may include the [[pattern]], [[Art glass|cut glass]], [[came]], [[wood]] [[Molding (decorative)|trim]], [[solder]], [[cement]]. Additional supplies include [[newspaper]], cutter oil, a [[plywood]] board, [[masking tape]], flux,{{refn|Flux is used during the soldering process to better disperse heat from the soldering iron, improve the soldering process and to clean. Care should be taken to avoid contact to the skin or inhalation of its fumes.&lt;ref name=Stevenson14&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004).

It is used to seal the glaze or cement. It is also used to clean residue off of the came and the project.&lt;ref name=Stevenson14/&gt;|group=nb}}

===Came===
Lead came is often supplied in lengths of 2&amp;nbsp;m and in widths of differing sizes. It also comes in flat or domed profiles.

====Brass and copper====
Brass and copper have been used to bring a copper or golden hue to the works.&lt;ref name=Berry10&gt;Berry, Leigh Ann. (2003). ''Basic Stained Glass Making: All the Skills and Tools You Need to Get Started''. Stackpole Books. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8117-2846-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, though, they were used only for windows between about 1890 and 1920. Both metals were often alternatives to zinc for [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed windows.&lt;ref name=DOI&gt;Department of Interior. (2004). ''The Preservation of Historic Architecture: The U.S. Government's Official Guidelines for Preserving Historic Homes''. Lyons Press Series. Globe Pequot. p. 397. {{ISBN|1-59228-126-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinz/&gt;

====Brass-capped lead====
Brass-capped lead is another type of came used for glasswork projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

====Lead====
The traditional method of creating "camework glass" uses [[lead]] [[came]], which ages into a dark blue-gray [[patina]]. In comparison to other came metal strips, like brass, copper and zinc, lead is softer and more flexible, making it easier to cut and bend. It's also inexpensive and durable. A downside is that the finished projects may be prone to sagging due to lead's softness. This can be mitigated somewhat by stretching the lead to make it more rigid before it is used.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 51. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12&gt;Stevenson, Christine. (2004). ''Creative Stained Glass: Modern Designs &amp; Simple Techniques''. Lark Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-57990-487-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Special precautions should be taken when working with this metal came to avoid to lead contamination.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;

The lead came windows of the medieval churches are sturdier than those of the 19th century and much of the 20th century. The composition of lead came changed over time, at first by removing other metals to make a "pure lead" and then again during war years when lead was needed for ammunition. Since the 1970s a new form of lead, restoration lead, was developed based upon medieval lead's metal composition. Restoration lead is stronger than lead came of the prior 100 years or so.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;

Water tightness is achieved by brushing [[adhesive|cement]] under the flanges of the leads to both faces prior to installation or by applying [[putty]] afterwards. Typically the cement consisted of [[linseed oil]], [[Chalk|whiting]], [[lamp black]] and [[white spirit]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Zinc====
Zinc makes a lightweight, strong and rigid came, which lends itself to glasswork projects that don't have many curved lines, are large, or have a number of straight lines that require greater support than lead would afford. Zinc accepts finishes, such as black and copper. Because of its strength, zinc is often used for border cames, which are U-channel cames for the outside edges.&lt;ref name=DOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, George and Pat Torlen. (2002). ''The new stained glass: techniques, projects, patterns, designs''. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 55-60. {{ISBN|1-895569-80-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Lloyd Wright used zinc came for his stained glass windows.&lt;ref name=Heinz&gt;Heinz, Thomas A. (September / October 1989). "Use &amp; Repair of Zinc Cames in Art-Glass Windows." ''Old House Journal''. pp. 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beveled glass]] work is generally done in zinc came, primarily because of its ability to manage the weight of heavy plate glass; whereas beveled glass works made of lead came are much more likely to buckle or sag over time.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Anita and Seymour Isenberg. (2002). ''How to Work in Beveled Glass: Forming, Designing, and Fabricating''. Dover Stained Glass Instruction Series. Courier Dover Publications. p. 21. {{ISBN|0-486-42062-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper foil===

This is an example of copper foil glasswork, an alternative to came glasswork.]]

Copper foil is an easy, versatile alternative to came and is particularly useful for small projects.&lt;ref name=Stevenson12/&gt; Using [[copper]] [[foil (chemistry)|foil]], the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with adhesive copper tape and [[soldering|soldered]] together along the adjacent copper strips. The copper foil technique (commonly called [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|''Tiffany'']] stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether [[John La Farge]] or [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] originated it) was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] works, in addition to [[two-dimensional]] ones to which the lead came method is limited. A patent for the method of "Joining Glass Mosaics" was issued to Sanford Bray in 1886. This new method of joining pieces of stained glass used copper/copper foil instead of lead sashes. By using copper foil, one could now make cylinders, cones, and globe-shaped shades or many other irregular forms.

[[File:CatalystArts.jpg|thumb|Catalyst Arts]]

'''Catalyst Arts''' a non-profit artist led organisation based in [[Belfast]] city centre.

Catalyst Arts was formed in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6054404.stm|title=Art brings bingo to the toilet|last=McCann|first=Nuala|date=16 October 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to what was seen as a cultural vacuum. In accordance with its constitution it is run by unpaid [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, and seeks to adopt a poly-vocal strategy towards the promotion of contemporary art practices by large selection of artists and projects from the widest possible range of disciplines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/Venue.aspx?venue_id=3062|title=Culture Northern Ireland|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716032002/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/venue.aspx?venue_id=3062|archivedate=2012-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalyst has strong links with the [[University of Ulster]]. Catalyst Arts has shown works of [[David Shrigley]], Ross Sinclair, [[Susan Phillipz]], Phil Collins, Michelle D Hannah, Roddy Buchanan, [[Simon Starling]], [[Bill Drummond]] to name a few, and has turned the gallery into a sauna with Joanna Karolini.
 
Catalyst Arts was envisioned as an agency that would act as a '[[catalyst]]' cajoling, supporting and promoting culturally engaged artistic endeavours on a local, national and international basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/northern-ireland/belfast/What-to-see/museumsandgalleries/Catalyst-Arts-Gallery_28242v|title=What to see in Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalyst Arts was founded on a constitution that provides a structure in which power flows from the roots of its membership to the committee of directors. Catalyst Arts boasts an archive of over 2000 unique documents of [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] art history, which it is currently preparing to make publicly accessible. Catalyst Arts has also organised projects internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/30/arts/art-in-review-366846.html|title=Art in Review|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=30 May 1997|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clach Biorach''' (in [[English language|English]], "Sharp Stone") is a three-metre [[Standing Stone]] located {{convert|1/4|mile|km}} north-west of the village of [[Edderton]] in [[Easter Ross]]. It dates to the [[Bronze Age]], but two Pictish-style symbols were later engraved on the north side, making it a Class I [[Pictish stones|Pictish symbol stone]]. The symbols are a 1) [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double-disc]] with a [[Z-rod (Pictish symbol)|z-rod]], and 2) a [[Salmon (Pictish symbol)|salmon]] above.

'''Czech folklore''' is the folk tradition which has developed among the [[Czechs|Czech people]] over a number of centuries. Czech folklore was influenced by a mix of [[Christian]] and [[pagan]] customs. Nowadays it is preserved and kept alive by various folklore ensembles uniting members of all ages, from children to seniors, showing their talent during competitions, folklore festivals or other performances. 

The [[Czech Republic]] is divided into a number of ethnographic regions. Each of them has special folklore traditions, songs or costumes and specializes in different [[crafts]]. As a result, Czech folklore provides a diverse source of entertainment.

==Music and dance==
Music played an important part in life of common people or [[peasants]] in the Czech Republic. It offered both means of expression and a vent for their emotions. Resulting music varies not only by the region of its origin but also in the purpose of its use. Therefore, there are myriads of distinct [[folk songs]].

[[File:Ľubomír Párička gra na dudach.webm|thumb|Ľubomír Párička playing bagpipes, Czech Republic]]
Music often addressed everyday issues and was passed down [[Oral tradition|orally]]. From the 19th century onward it was recorded by [[Ethnography|etnographs]]. Traditional celebrations such as '''welcome of the spring''', '''successful harvest''' are still among the occasions traditionally celebrated with songs. More lively themes were used specifically during celebrations, weddings or feasts. [[Funeral]]s and mournful occasions also had their own set of songs and tunes. 

Songs and especially dances were often linked to conscription of Czech young men to the Army; they are called [[Slovácko Verbuňk|“verbuňk”]] in some regions. Conscriptions usually happened during wartimes and these songs have a particular place in Czech folklore music. They are listed by [[UNESCO]] in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;id_page=33&amp;id_film=621|title=The Slovacko Verbunk|publisher=NULK|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of instruments associated with Czech folk music, which add to its distinct sound – violin and the [[double bass]]; instruments specific to [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] such as bagpipes [[Dudy|(bock)]], shepherd’s pipe, [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and trumpet. 

All of them are still in active use by the folklore groups during their shows.

[[Polka]] dance originated in [[Bohemia]] and still remains an integral part of folklore traditions especially in the western part of the country. Since the 19th century this dance has spread from Bohemia to many neighbouring European countries as well as overseas.

==Traditional Czech celebrations==
[[File:Svět knihy 2010 - Dětský folklórní soubor 1.JPG|thumb|[[Moravian Wallachia|Wallachian]] folk costumes]]
[[File:Wałaskie pisanki. Rožnov pod Radhoštěm. Czechy.webm|thumb|Decorating Wallachian Easter eggs. Rožnov pod Radhoštěm]]
In the past, emphasis was placed on changes connected to the four seasons of the year; every season had its own specific traditions. In the [[Spring (season)|spring]], people practiced customs which would ensure health of their crops and future successful [[harvest]]. In the [[winter]], it was most important to protect households and villagers against adverse effects of cold weather and supernatural forces. 

Many Czech regions still hold traditional celebrations, which also revel in folklore music, dance and costumes. Among the most typical is Drowning of Morana, Shrovetide, erecting the maypole, [[Harvest (wine)|grape harvest]] or celebration of Easter. 

* Drowning of [[Marzanna|Morana]]: to celebrate the end of the winter, young girls in a number of villages build an effigy of a woman out of straw and branches, and dress the figure in old clothes. The woman represents a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic goddess]] of winter and is associated with death. Therefore her destruction symbolizes the beginning of new life in spring. After taking the figure  out of the village in a solemn procession, Morana is set on fire and then thrown into the water by singing girls.
* Shrovetide ([[Slavic carnival|Masopust]]): also serves to celebrate spring and ensure the fertility of future harvest. It includes a [[carnival]]-like procession of singing people dressed in masks of beasts and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuča|first=Pavel|title=Masopust - Fašank|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=135067&amp;lng=1|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Easter]] celebrations: the most distinctive customs preserved in the Czech Republic are spanking women solemnly with a whip made of thin willow branches ([[pomlázka]]); or drenching them with cold water to symbolically guarantee their good health. In exchange, men often receive traditional food, [[Easter egg|decorated eggs]] and (recently), alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuncová|first=Romana|title=Celebrating Easter in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Celebrating-Easter-in-the-Czech-Republic|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313082422/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Celebrating-Easter-in-the-Czech-Republic|archivedate=13 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Burning of witches: also known as Walpurgis Night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubálková|first=Petra|title=Burning of Witches|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Burning-of-Witches|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705143727/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Burning-of-Witches|archivedate=5 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the traditional Czech stories, the night on the turn of April 30 and May 1 had a magical power. Not only was evil believed to be more powerful at this time, but also those who felt brave enough to go outside could find [[treasure]]s if they carried with them items such as wood fern flower, [[wafer]] or sanctified chalk. It was also believed that during the night [[witch]]es were flying and gathering for the [[Sabbath]]. To protect themselves, villagers burnt [[bonfire]]s on hills and set fire to brooms, which were then thrown into the air to reveal any flying witch. These celebrations are nowadays accompanied with music and traditional food and mark the opening of the tourist season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollý|first=Ladislav|title=Pálení čarodějnic|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=120943&amp;lng=1|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Erecting a Maypole: unmarried men in southern parts of the Czech Republic and in [[Slovácko|Slovacko]] cut off trees such as [[fir]], [[spruce]] or [[pine]] to make a traditional maypole out of it over night representing spring. The branches are cut off and only the top of the tree is left and decorated with ribbons and flowers. The [[maypole]] is then erected in the middle of the village. It is important to guard one’s maypole because men from other villages may try to cut it down as a form of contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollý|first=Ladislav|title=Stavění MÁJE a májový čas|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=120945&amp;lng=1|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional costumes==
[[File:Prague Pride 2013 - Moravian dress.jpg|thumb|upright|A participant of 2013 Prague Pride wearing a traditional Moravian costume ([[Haná|Hanakia]]) and a sign "Good day - [[Olomouc]] greets [[Prague]]"]]
Folklore is not merely about music. Czech folklore is characteristic for elaborate traditional costumes distinctive to each region or even village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk costumes|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Folk-costumes|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201061906/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Folk-costumes|archivedate=1 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific aspects such as colors, [[embroidery]], themes and fragments of traditional costumes varied on the basis of social, geographical and symbolical factors as well as according to the purpose of their use. Costumes worn on special occasions were usually lavishly decorated, colorful and accompanied with a wide range of accessories (scarves, [[ribbon]]s, [[headdress]]es, hats, belts, etc.) while everyday clothes tended to be rather simple and practical. Every region had a set of amusing peculiarities. For example:

* Women in the [[Plzen Region|Plzen region]] wore up to 24 underskirts, which restricted their movement but were nevertheless a show of their fashionableness. 
* While married women in [[Haná|Hanakia]] wore plain clothes and hid their hair under bonnets and headdresses even from their own husbands, their men wore their hair long and even their clothes were flauntingly colorful and decorated.

Traditional costumes are no longer commonly worn in most parts of the Czech Republic. They may be used during traditional celebrations or festivals when worn by members of folklore ensembles. In some families, costumes are handed down from generation to generation as they wish to preserve the tradition. Likewise, many stay protected in museums and private collections.

==Folklore festivals==
Multiple folklore shows and festivals are organized in the Czech Republic throughout the year. They are a display of rich Czech traditions and folklore. At the festivals, various folklore groups demonstrate the heritage of their country. The performers are presented in traditional costumes particular to different regions of the Czech Republic. They perform [[folk dance]]s, traditional folk songs and play musical instruments. Many festivals are not only demonstrations of music and dances, but also show traditional [[Czech food|cuisine]] and crafts.

There are many folklore festivals in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals|url=http://www.folklornisdruzeni.cz/en/festivals|work=Folklorní sdružení ČR|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/seznam.phtml?typ=44&amp;lng=2&amp;menu= |title=rezervační a informační systém |publisher=Czech.Republic.CZ |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vlčnov]]: probably the most famous one is a festival called “[[Ride of the Kings]]”. This festival takes place every year and can be also found on the list of UNESCO. 
* [[Strážnice]]: Another unique folklore festival. Not only does this festival present traditional Czech folklore, but also folklore groups from all over the world visit the town to show their own traditions. 
* [[Strakonice]]: The Bohemian city holds an annual bagpipe festival that attracts the locals, as well as foreign tourists. The festival is a parade and a meeting place of Czech and international bagpipe players.

==Folklore groups==
Czech Republic is abundant in folklore groups of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/seznam.phtml?typ=38,245&amp;lng=2&amp;menu= |title=rezervační a informační systém |publisher=Czech.Republic.CZ |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal is to preserve local traditions and folklore and to pass the [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] on to the following generations. Members of the folklore groups are enthusiasts of all ages: from little children through adolescents to adults. They all enjoy building up folklore spirit with dances, music and showing off beautiful folklore dresses, as well as performing in front of audiences at folklore festivals. Children are encouraged to participate in folklore ensembles from a very early age.

==Traditional arts and crafts==
Traditional arts and crafts are an inseparable part of Czech folklore. 
* [[Corn husk doll|Cornhusk dolls]]: among the most popular traditional products. These dolls made of cornhusk and a few strings are nowadays used as decorations but in the past children used them as toys. Cornhusk dolls are also great [[souvenir]]s tourists can buy in the Czech Republic if they are looking for something truly traditional. 
* Pottery: Another popular traditional artistic product. Bohemian and Moravian [[pottery]] is painted with various folklore patterns, simple or floral ornaments. The pottery serves for both decorative and practical purposes.
* [[Bobbin lace]]: also one of the popular traditional items. The most famous Czech bobbin lace products are made in [[Vamberk]], a city in Eastern Bohemia. 
* The Czech Republic is also renowned for its production of [[glass]]: crystal glasses, bowls, vases, and other products contribute to the richness of heritage of the Czech Republic. 
* [[Indigo]] print products: hand-made textile goods. Tablecloths, toys, and other accessories are made of this material.

'''Epode''',&lt;ref&gt;From {{lang-el|ἐπῳδός}}, ''epodos'', "singing to/over, an enchanter."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[poetry|verse]], is the third part of an [[ode]], which followed the [[strophe]] and the [[antistrophe]], and completed the movement.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Epode |volume=9 |page=707 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to right of the altar or stage, and then to left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the ''[[coryphaeus]]'' to sing for them all, while standing in the centre. With the appearance of [[Stesichorus]] and the evolution of [[choral poetry|choral lyric]], a learned and artificial kind of poetry began to be cultivated in [[Greece]], and a new form, the epode-song, came into existence. It consisted of a verse of iambic trimeter, followed by a verse of iambic dimeter, and it is reported that, although the epode was carried to its highest perfection by Stesichorus, an earlier poet, [[Archilochus]], was really the inventor of this form.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The epode soon took a firm place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In [[Latin]] poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious [[archaism]], both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of [[Catullus]], founded on an imitation of [[Pindar]], present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode of [[Horace]], beginning ''Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri'', possesses this triple character.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==''Epodes'' of Horace==

The word is now mainly familiar from an experiment of [[Horace]] in the second class, for he entitled his fifth book of odes ''Epodon liber'' or the ''Book of Epodes''. He says in the course of these poems, that in composing them he was introducing a new form, at least in [[Latin literature]], and that he was imitating the effect of the iambic distichs invented by Archilochus. Accordingly, we find the first ten of these epodes composed in alternate verses of [[iambic trimeter]] and [[iambic dimeter]], as at, for example, ''Epode'' 5.1–2:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{| style="border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space: nowrap;"
! scope="col" width="400px" |
! scope="col" width="400px" |
|- border="0"
|- Valign=top
|
At o Deorum quicquid in coelo regit&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Terras et humanum genus&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
|
But, o any of the gods in the heavens ruling&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the lands and the human race.
|}

In the seven remaining epodes Horace diversified the measures, while retaining the general character of the distich. This group of poems belongs mostly to the early youth of the poet, and displays a truculence and a controversial heat which are absent from his more mature writings. As he was imitating Archilochus in form, he believed himself justified, no doubt, in repeating the sarcastic violence of his fierce model. The curious thing is that these particular poems of Horace, which are really short lyrical satires, have appropriated almost exclusively the name of epodes, although they bear little enough resemblance to the epode of early [[Greek literature]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It was founded in October 1981 by Ken Spence with the partnership of [[Theatre Tulsa]] and has since produced more than one hundred shows including two dozen world premiers.  The theater is currently directed by Julie Tattershall operated by the Tulsa Parks and Recreation Department.

The theater was named the Oklahoma Community Theatre Association (OCTA) Theater of the Year in 2005. The Great Plains debut of [[Yasmina Reza]]'s “The Unexpected Man," translated by [[Christopher Hampton]], received high honors from (OCTA) in 2007.  Two of the Heller's most recent shows were named "Top Ten" performances of the Year by the ''[[Tulsa World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is centered on a 36-year-old character named Nirupama Rajeev (Manju Warrier) who works as a UD clerk in the Revenue Department. Her husband is Rajeev Narayanan (Kunchako Boban) who works at Akashavaani and aspires of migrating to Ireland, but Nirupama can't accompany him as most Irish companies turn down her job applications. There is nothing interesting about her life; she leads a normal life but craves for a change.

One fine day, she gets an invitation from the President and gets summoned to the IG's office and learns that the President of India would like to have a conversation with her, after a question which her daughter posed to the President who came to the school. Unfortunately, Nirupama faints in-front of the President and the meeting turns out to be a disaster. Post this, she becomes the laughing stock on Facebook.  Nirupama is then faced with an issue of being criticized by her family members.  Later Nirupama gets in a situation where she has to watch her husband and daughter fly to Ireland.

Susan David (Kanika), her old classmate, a successful business woman, reminds her of the woman she used to be and inspires her to rediscover her younger self.  Nirupama then explains her situation, when she met the president, to the social medias and clears her name.  Her inability to rise up to her daughter's expectations and the discomfiture of her husband being mistaken for her younger brother further troubles her.  Nirupama had a habit of having a vegetable garden on her roof, without the usage of chemicals or pesticides.  One day Nirupama visits an old woman whom she would meet everyday on her bus.  Both of them don't even know their names, and when she gets to know that the woman is sick, Nirupama turns up at her house with her own vegetable.  The old woman thanks her for the time she spent for her and for reminding that she is not alone in this world.  News of her pure vegetables spreads via the neighbor of the sick woman.  In between, Nirupama's daughter calls her to Ireland, but she hesitates as she has lots of work left to be done.  Her vegetables are asked for a wedding.  For this Nirupama encourages all her neighbors to cultivate vegetables on their rooftops as well, which turns out to be a huge success.  Her friend Susuan david encourages her into a seminar with important people as audience.  Her topic of biofarming influenced all the officials and gives her the job of making it a reality.  Once again the President meets her and family.

The meeting turned out to be a successful one.  The transformation of her character from a depressed woman to a steady and sprightly lady is almost predictable.  'How old are you' leaves behind a sharp note to its audience.  Near the end of the story, Nirupama reminds her husband to expect only what is given to her.

The '''Kildalton Cross''' is a monolithic [[high cross]] in [[Celtic cross]] form in the churchyard of the former parish church of Kildalton (from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Cill Daltain'', "Church of the Foster Son" (i.e. [[St John the Evangelist]]) on the island of [[Islay]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]], [[Scotland]].  It was carved probably in the second half of the 8th century AD, and is closely related to crosses of similar date on [[Iona]].  It is often considered the finest surviving Celtic cross in Scotland, and is certainly one of the most perfect monuments of its date to survive on western [[Europe]].  The cross and the adjacent roofless [[medieval]] parish church are in the care of [[Historic Scotland]] (access at all times) and are jointly a [[scheduled ancient monument]] &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM13236|title=Kildalton Church, church, High Cross, and cross 60m NE ofSM13236|publisher= Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate=5 September 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;.  A simpler cross of late medieval date stands nearby.

==Ornament==
The Kildalton Cross features an iconic image of the Virgin and Child, which is closely related to similar Virgin and Child iconography found on St. Martin's Cross and St. Oran's Cross at [[Iona]]. In addition, this panel displays similarities with folio 7v in the [[Book of Kells]]. This type of [[iconography]] of the [[Virgin and Child]] may be related to contemporary Marian iconography in the Mediterranean, specifically the Maria Regina which was used in Rome to refute [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humphrey|first1=Hayley|title=Representations of the Virgin Mary on Irish High Crosses: Icons, Narratives and Symbols of Power|date=2012|publisher=National University of Ireland, Galway|location=Galway, Ireland|url=http://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10379/2943/2011HumphreyPhD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Van Gogh spent the last few months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, a small town just north of Paris, after he left an asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] in May 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Van Gogh: The Life|year=2011|publisher=[[Random House]]|first1=Steven|last1=Naifeh|first2=Gregory|last2= White Smith|isbn=0-375-50748-5|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/119583/van-gogh-by-steven-naifeh-and-gregory-white-smith|page=822 ''ff.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the painting in the week following his portraits of [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Gachet]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980) p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint from above was a favourite perspective of his since his days sketching in the dunes of [[Scheveningen]] at [[Vincent van gogh#Etten.2C Drenthe and The Hague|The Hague]] with the aid of a perspective frame.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and Smith (2011) pp. 290-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh described the painting in a letter to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]]:&lt;ref name= "Letter 886 group= Letters" &gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 886: To Willemien van Gogh. Auvers, Friday, 13 June 1890|url= http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let886/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= Paragraph 1 ''ff.''|quote= Lately I’ve been working a lot and quickly ...|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Lately I’ve been working a lot and quickly; by doing so I’m trying to express the desperately swift passage of things in modern life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday in the rain I painted a large landscape viewed from a height in which there are fields as far as the eye can see, different types of greenery, a dark green field of potatoes, between the regular plants the lush, violet earth, a field of peas in flower whitening to the side, a field of pink-flowered lucerne with a small figure of a reaper, a field of long, ripe grass, fawn in hue, then wheatfields, poplars, a last line of blue hills on the horizon, at the bottom of which a train is passing, leaving behind it an immense trail of white smoke in the greenery. A white road crosses the canvas. On the road a little carriage and white houses with stark red roofs beside this road. Fine rain streaks the whole with blue or grey lines}}

The painting is in the collection of the [[Pushkin Museum| Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name= group= "Works"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vggallery.com/painting/p_0760.htm|title= Landscape with Carriage and Train in the Background|author=Brooks, D |date= |work=The Vincent van Gogh Gallery, endorsed by Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam | publisher=David Brooks (self-published) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shape note]]s are a system of music notation designed to facilitate choral singing. Shape notes of various kinds have been used for over two centuries in a variety of sacred choral music traditions practiced primarily in the Southern region of the United States.

"Shape-note singers used [[tune book]]s rather than [[hymnal]]s. Hymnals were pocket-size books with texts only. Tune books were large oblong-shaped books with hard covers (nine inches by six inches was a typical size), often running to over four hundred pages. They included both music and text and were introduced by an extended essay on the rudiments of singing. Each song was known by the name given to its tune rather than by a title drawn from the text."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Steve and Collins, Judy (2003). ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', p.118. {{ISBN|978-0-06-000219-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''partial list of the shape note tunebooks''' published over the last two centuries.  The list is divided according to the two main systems of shape notes—four-shape vs. seven-shape—and within these two categories is sorted chronologically.

[[Image:Ludic Interfaces Example.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Student experiment in Interface Design developed at UP Valencia]]
A '''ludic interface''' is a type of [[interface (computing)|computer interface]]. In the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), the term '''ludic Interfaces''' describes a discipline that focuses on [[user interface]]s that are inherently "playful". This field of interface research and design draws on concepts introduced by Dutch historian and cultural theorist [[Johan Huizinga]] in the book [[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]] ("Man the Player" or "Playing Man").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Huizinga
  | first = Johan
  | title = Homo ludens. Vom Ursprung der Kultur im Spiel
  | publisher = Rowohlt Verlag
  | year = 1994 (orig. 1938)
  | isbn = 3-499-55435-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huizinga's work is considered an important contribution to the development of [[game studies]].

The various tools and concepts associated with ludic interface development differ from mainstream technological systems that employ human computer interfacing and interaction. Ludic interfaces tend to be  more playful, are [[user-generated]] and user-driven, flexible, low-cost and [[cooperative]]. Such interfaces are often experimental and draw upon methods and knowledge from [[video game design]],  [[interactive media]], [[modding]] cultures, media conversion, and [[social networks|social networking]]. The goal of ludic interface design is to create interfacing technology that offers ease of use and is inherently playful.

==Core concept==
At its core, "ludic interfaces" is a subcategory of interfaces in general. The notion is not restricted to electronics or human–computer interaction, even if the terminology was developed in respect to digital technology. Various authors suggest to use the term "ludic interfaces" for non-digital phenomena, e.g. architectural facades, skins, wearable computers, media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Sommerer, Christa/ King,  Dorothée/ Mignonneau
  | first = Laurent
  | title = Interface Cultures: Artistic Aspects of Interaction
  | publisher = Transcript Verlag
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 3899428846}}
&lt;/ref&gt; "Ludic Interfaces" is also a Masters programme development on a European level. It is the title of a European collaboration in creating a network of academic institutions and of world leading media centres to investigate, design and test publicly shared digital content. The programme development is a joint project by the University of Potsdam, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Universität für künstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz, and by the [[University of Salford]] in Greater [[Manchester]].

==History==

Ludic interface design was first defined in 2002 by William Gaver, in "Designing for Homo Ludens",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Gaver
  | first = William
  | title = Designing for Homo Ludens
  | journal = I3 Magazine
  |date=June 2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt; expanded in a later article in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Gaver
 | first=William

 | editor2-last=Löwgren

 | publisher=Springer
 | year=2009
 | chapter=Designing for Homo Ludens, Still.
 | pages=163–178
 | location=London
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was revisited in 2008 by [[ISEA International|International Symposium on Electronic Art]]) curators Gunalan Nadarajan and Vladimir Todorović to describe a panel section of ISEA2008 in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Nadarajan
  | first = Gunalan
  | title = ISEA2008 Conference Proceedings
  | publisher = ISEA2008 Pte Ltd
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 978-981-08-0768-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced with the aim of counterbalancing the tendency of "infantilization of play" and stressing the "complicities between technology and pleasure".

In the same year a group of game artists and scholars at Leuphana University in Lueneburg started lecturing and writing about the theory of Ludic Interfaces and applied for a European grant to develop a Masters programme in Ludic Interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;An interview about Ludic Interfaces by Digital Arts and Architecture Lab with Mathias Fuchs can be found on http://inm.de/index.cfm?siteid=190&amp;CFID=3969946&amp;CFTOKEN=5bbbde746c0b288f-653F9F40-A892-243B-D200A47407920729&amp;jsessionid=80308ba15754$1E$2F$3&lt;/ref&gt; The application was successful and the development has successfully been completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2009-11-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "ludic interfaces" has also historical roots in artistic practice and analysis of interfaces (cf. Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Ludic Interfaces Kilby Tarot 200.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Ludic interface experiment by student Jess Kilby from University of Salford, using RFID tag technology for a digital tarot reader.]][[Image:Mathias Fuchs postvinyl resfest live.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Ludic interface by Mathias Fuchs, using Djing tools in combination with a game engine: "postvinyl"]]

Jess Kilby’s RFID Tarot table consists of a hand-painted black table with letters and signs drawn upon it, and a white set of cards containing radio-frequency tags. The installation is an example for a ludic set-up where the interface contributes significantly to the magic of the game. Hidden information within the blank cards allows the RFID reader, a digital tarot reader automaton, to interpret information hidden from the human eye. Kilby’s system interprets the information contained within the cards and displays videos of a frightening future. The game could certainly be implemented as a Flash simulation or be built for a 2D monitor display system, but without the materiality of the ludic interface, without the special lighting, and without the artist dressed in a fortune teller’s dress the game would not work at all. The same holds true for [[Mary Flanagan]]’s “Giant Joystick”. It is the interface with all its materiality, erotic connotations and haptic features which makes the ludic installation work so well. Ludic interfaces can also facilitate play in a musical sense. The "postvinyl" performance, originally commissioned by futuresonic festival [[Manchester]] in 2004 recontextualizes a computer game in a performance environment.

[[File:Rael Artel and Joanna Rajkowska's installation.jpg|thumb|Curator Rael Artel talking in front of the installation "Greeting from the Jerusalem Avenue" by Polish artist Joanna Rajkowska]]
'''''My Poland. On Recalling and Forgetting''''' is the first [[Holocaust]]-themed art exhibition in Estonia, taking place at [[Tartu Art Museum]] in early 2015,&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esimene"&gt;[http://www.muurileht.ee/eesti-esimene-holokaustiteemaline-kunstinaitus/ "SEL LAUPÄEVAL AVATAKSE EESTI ESIMENE HOLOKAUSTITEEMALINE KUNSTINÄITUS"] Müürileht, 3 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; seventy years after the end of World War II and the liberation of the [[Nazi extermination camp]]s.{{r|kataloog}} The exhibition, curated by museum's director [[Rael Artel]], received a lot of attention from Estonian society and from both Estonian and international media. It brough out the differences of opinion and initiated a public debate about the reflection of Holocaust and [[freedom of speech]], [[censorship]] and [[self-censorship]] in art. Originally, eight contemporary artworks were exhibited, one of them by an Estonian artist and seven from Polish artists (incl. one Polish–Israeli and one American with Polish Jewish roots). Soon after the opening of the exhibition the museum limited access to two works of art because of public criticism. Later, both of them were removed from the exhibition.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;

The name of the exhibition ''My Poland'' emphasizes curators personal perspective to [[Polish art|Polish contemporary art]] where Holocaust and the [[Second World War]] is a distinctive theme. The name refers to a popular Estonian books series ("My Estonia", "My Mexico", "My St. Petersburg", etc.) which also focuses on authors' personal impressions of different countries.

The works selected for the exhibition in Tartu Art Museum are made by well-known Polish artists most of whom have participated in the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="muuseum"&gt;[http://tartmus.ee/files/wordpress/?page_id=47 ''My Poland''] on the homepage of Tartu Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Rael Artel has said that although she tried to find comparable works from Estonian art, the only Holocaust themed work was John Smith's painting ''Holocaust''.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;

The exhibition is accompanied by a publication put together by Rael Artel and designed by Mikk Heinsoo. The exhibition was supported by [[The Cultural Endowment of Estonia]] and [[Estonian Ministry of Culture]]. ''My Poland'' is curated by the director of Tartu Art Museum Rael Artel and exhibition's coordinator is Julia Polujanenkova, museums' keeper of the contemporary art.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt;

==Removal of videos from the exhibition==
''My Poland'' was opened on Saturday, 7 February.&lt;ref name="muuseum" /&gt; On Tuesday, Tartu Art Museum announced that access to two most criticized videos was being limited. Visitors could only see those videos by stating a direct request and after being introduced to curator's written explanation. Museum's director Artel made a full apology to everyone the display offended.&lt;ref name="vabandust"&gt;[http://tartu.postimees.ee/3086437/tartu-kunstimuuseumi-direktor-palume-vabandust-koigilt-keda-valjapanek-on-riivanud "Tartu kunstimuuseumi direktor: palume vabandust kõigilt, keda väljapanek on riivanud"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian Ministry of Culture held a discussion which was attended by Minister of Culture [[Urve Tiidus]] and the representatives of [[Jews in Estonia|Jewish community in Estonia]]. After the discussion Tiidus called the videos offending and Tartu Art Museum removed them from the exhibition entirely.&lt;ref name="arutelul"&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/3088427/ministeeriumis-toimunud-arutelul-leiti-et-holokaustiteemaline-naitus-on-solvav "Ministeeriumis toimunud arutelul leiti, et holokaustiteemaline näitus on solvav"] Postimees, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As the museum was closed on Monday and Tuesday and the videos were already removed by Wednesday afternoon, the videos in question were introduced only to a small part of exhibition visitors. Therefore, majority of people who have participated in the debate have not been familiar with the content of the videos or knew them only on the basis of clips shown in the news and on the basis of written summaries.&lt;ref name="terev"&gt;[http://etv.err.ee/v/meelelahutus/terevisioon/saated/905777f5-f141-47fc-93a2-10b4d1763852 "Terevisioon"] ERR, 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of videos has been evaluated differently. For example, journalist Kadri Veermäe from major Estonian daily [[Postimees]] interpreted it as a censorship or self-censorship.&lt;ref name="kultuuriinimesi" /&gt; On the other hand, [[Kaarel Tarand]], former editor-in-chief of Estonian main cultural newspaper [[Sirp]], did not consider this as a result of censorship.&lt;ref name="tarand"&gt;Siim Randla [http://www.ohtuleht.ee/662580/kaarel-tarand-ei-nae-holokausti-naituselt-teoste-eemaldamises-tsensuuri "Kaarel Tarand ei näe holokausti näituselt teoste eemaldamises tsensuuri", 16 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian artist Kiwa regarded it as the criminalization of art.&lt;ref name="kiwa" /&gt;

After videos were removed, the museum decided to use that room do present the documentation about the public discussion about the exhibition on both traditional and social media, considering the themes of censure and self-censorship.&lt;ref name="Artel"&gt;Raimu Hanson [http://tartu.postimees.ee/3096479/rael-artel-naitustel-voiks-kaia-kunsti-aga-mitte-skandaali-parast "Rael Artel: näitustel võiks käia kunsti, aga mitte skandaali pärast"] Postimees, 19 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artists==
* In [[Yael Bartana]]'s video ''Dreams and Nightmares'' (''Mary Koszmary'', 2007), a politician is talking to a deserted overgrown stadium where only a handful of scouts are listening, about reconciliation on Jews and Poles, the need for Jews to return to restore Poland's cultural diversity and create a shared future.&lt;ref name="kataloog"&gt;[http://tartmus.ee/files/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Minu_Poola_A5_32lk_preview_final.pdf Näituse kataloog] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian art theorist Indrek Grigor considers it to be the central work of the exhibition: ˮFor a person like me, for whom Jews have largely been just literary characters from [[Isaac Babel]]'s ''[[Odessa Tales]]'', this video gave a glimpse of the actual cultural shock Poland went through after the genocide. If we were to translate that experience into the context of Estonian culture we could try to reappraise the influence of Russian culture on Estonia's cultural diversity and its very viability!"&lt;ref name="Grigor"&gt;Indrek Grigor [http://kultuur.postimees.ee/3094745/veel-kord-holokaustinaitusest-neil-seal-poolas "Veel kord holokaustinäitusest: Neil seal Poolas"] Postimees, 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zbigniew Libera]]'s photograph from the series ''Residents'' (2003) shows smiling people in analogous positions to people in a famous photograph depicting [[Auschwitz]] prisoners being released.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; 
* Documentation of ''Greetings from Jerusalem Avenue'' (2002) by [[Joanna Rajkowska]] introduces one of the most striking monuments of [[Warsaw]], the capital of Poland: an artificial palm tree, that artist conceived while visiting Jerusalem. This work reminds the cultural diversity of pre-war Poland. It is set up on the Jerusalem Avenue in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; ˮTo me the highlight of the documentation of Rajkowska's work presented on the exhibition is not actually connected with the author but with the human rights activist campaign where a traditional Palestinian headscarf was tied around the palm tree,ˮ says Indrek Grigor.&lt;ref name="Grigor" /&gt;
* John Smith's (a pseudonym used by [[Marko Mäetamm]] and [[Kaido Ole]]) painting ''Holocaust'' portrays two men driving through a landscape, seeing writing "Holocaust" on a hilltop in resemblance to the famous landmark "Hollywood". According to Artel, that painting draws attention to the commercialization of Holocaust by the movie industry led by Hollywood, as it has transformed the pain of millions of people into money.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;
* Installation ''Warsaw'' (2005) by [[Wilhelm Sasnal]] consists of the word ''Warsaw'' which is written on a white wall using a gunpowder-coated wire, cut in half into words WAR and SAW - "SAW WAR".&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;
* Short comic by American artist [[Art Spiegelman]] ''Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@?*!'' (2008) is describing Jewish family heirloom as a monster locked in a chest, creating a perpetual sense of guilt. It can be understood as the guilt of surviving Holocaust. [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning two-volume novel ''[[Maus]]'' (1991) by Spiegelman is also available on the exhibition.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; In the review of the exhibition, Indrek Grigor sees a parallel between Spiegelman's comic and the historical experience of Estonians: ˮ...just like the Jewish community is haunted by the Holocaust trauma from generation to generation as it has been shown on the exhibition by the autobiographical comics of American cartoonist Art Spiegelman; so, too, the present writer has a box of letters sent from Siberia to Estonia describing how people dug a pentagon shaped campfire, danced and played around it and thanked their dear leader Stalin for their daily bread."&lt;ref name="Grigor" /&gt;
* ''The Game of Tag'' (1999) by [[Artur Żmijewski (filmmaker)|Artur Żmijewski]] was exhibited on the 7th [[Berlin Biennale]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saksa"&gt;[http://maailm.postimees.ee/3086441/saksa-meedia-kirjutas-kullimangu-keelamise-puhul-tsensuurist-mitte-sokist "Saksa meedia kirjutas «Kullimängu» keelamise puhul tsensuurist, mitte šokist"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The author commented his work on the Estonian news program ''[[Aktuaalne kaamera]]'' as follows: ˮIt is a very serious situation. There are the bodies of living people, the situation is alive – instead of a tragedy we just have life."&lt;ref name="autor" /&gt; In the publication which accompanies the exhibition, curator Rael Artel connected ''The Game of Tag'' with the notion of 'bare life' by philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] referring to a human being who has lost all legal rights and is not protected by any cultural conventions.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; In ''Postimees'', Kadri Veermäe wrote about the background of the video: "Certainly, there are many of those who have watched Żmijewski's ''The Game of Tag'' on the Internet and have been surprised that they are actually not that shocked. The one who was shocked was Żmijewski himself when he was an assistant teacher and went on an excursion to the camps with school children who started cheerfully playing tag in the concentration camp's gas chambers."&lt;ref name="Veermäe"&gt;Kadri Veermäe [http://arvamus.postimees.ee/3087869/kadri-veermae-kullimang-gaasikambris "Kullimäng gaasikambris"] Postimees, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Estonian Jewish semiotician and culture theorist [[Mihhail Lotman]] interpretes the situation as follows: "A prospective viewer's cognitive dissonance between the game and Holocaust is the aspect that should be shocking. But this arises in the mind of the viewer, not on screen or at shooting. We can start by recognizing that none of the participants are Jewish /---/. Further, anyone who knows something about history knows that men and women were separated in the camps /---/. Maybe the best justification for this work (in terms of its quality I have big doubts) is that it can create a lot of grief. We need so little to bring back the memory of Holocaust."&lt;ref name="Lotman"&gt;Mihhail Lotman [http://www.lotman.ee/blogi/meie-vaike-holokaustiskandaal "Meie väike holokaustiskandaal"] Mihhail Lotman's blog, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* The video ''80064'' (2004) by Artur Żmijewski features a conversation with former prisoner of Auschwitz Józef Tarnawa who, after a negotiation, lets the artist to renew his concentration camp tattoo.&lt;ref name="kataloog" /&gt; According to Żmijewski, it symbolizes renewing the man's honour: ˮIn the video he is handled like a monument from the past which must be kept in good condition. The other meaning is to repeat the violent act from the past. In both films I tried to reopen up the past, truly reopen, not just recall, but really jump into that past moment when the tattoo was made and people were in the gas chambers."&lt;ref name="autor" /&gt; Semiotician Mihhail Lotman regards the video as shocking but also multidimensional: ˮ92-year-old Auschwitz survivor Józef Tarnawa eventually agrees and lets to renew his tattoo 80064. The man asks not to do so, saying that it is visible enough and after, it would not be authentic etc. But director Artur Żmijewski is ruthless and soon the old man surrenders and lets them to renew his tattoo. In the end he is not happy with the result, he feels like a piece of furniture. In another interview the director says that of course he agreed in the end because he got 500 euros for it and they had a contract. The message here is vague and might be multidimensional /---/. I draw the attention of watchful jewish community to the aspect that no one said it is a Jew in the video. There is nothing distinctive about his appearances, even the artist says that he does not know what the old man's nationality is and that it doesn't even really matter. Maybe it is the Polish community who should protest?"&lt;ref name="Lotman" /&gt;

==Public response==
On the opening day, [[Eesti Televisioon]]'s news program ''Aktuaalne kaamera'' asked the chairwoman of Tartu Jewish Community Ilona Smuškina to visit the exhibition My Poland. She found it to be emotionally uncomfortable: ˮI couldn't watch the video of the gas chamber for more than three seconds.

Among others, the [[Wiesenthal Center]]'s director [[Efraim Zuroff]] criticized the exhibition,&lt;ref name="zuroff"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/uudis/b0c88f71-10ba-44ef-9477-ac3870b6dce4 "Zuroff: Tartus avatud näitus on haiglane irvitamine juutide massimõrva üle"] ERR, 9 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; stating that it is not enough to remove two videos as the whole exhibition should be shut down.&lt;ref name="Sokol"&gt;Sam Sokol [http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Estonian-museum-apologizes-for-exhibit-making-light-of-Holocaust-391191 Estonian museum apologizes for exhibit making light of Holocaust] The Jerusalem Post, 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Main critical arguments include joking about Holocaust, mocking,&lt;ref name="Mikser" /&gt; lack of empathy amongst the artists and the authors of the exhibition,&lt;ref name="empaatiavõimes" /&gt; and the need to identify the boundaries of art. "I think that there should be ethical boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of expression of art that should not be prescribed by law but should be in the hearts of people," said Laine Randjärv. "Organizers of the exhibition have been ignoring the principles of good practices and the principles of respecting other people and nations," found Jüri Ratas.&lt;ref name="Nestor" /&gt; "The reaction and the triggered debate in the society leads us to ask again where are the boundaries of art," said Urve Tiidus.&lt;ref name="Tiidus juute"&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/3087253/tiidus-juute-solvanud-naitusest-minu-jaoks-on-kusimus-empaatiavoimes "Tiidus juute solvanud näitusest: minu jaoks on küsimus empaatiavõimes"] Postimees, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of days later, first statements supporting the curator and Tartu Art Museum started to appear, mostly made by people of art and culture. The criticism was also disputed by the interview to Eesti Televisioon by the author of the most criticized videos, Artur Żmijewski, who said: "We recall the past events and it is not a passive recalling but an active one. My purpose is not to provoke anyone. There are always those who feel provoked but it wasn't my intention."&lt;ref name="autor"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/964e50c1-80f5-4808-ab1d-a4c3cf2f7fa9 "Holokaustivideote autor AK intervjuus: minu tööd on valesti mõistetud"] ERR, 11.02.2015&lt;/ref&gt; Among the supporters of the exhibition have been a board member of the [[Contemporary Art Museum of Estonia]] [[Anders Härm]], artist Kiwa, artist [[Jaan Elken]], semiotician [[Mihhail Lotman]], artist [[Marko Mäetamm]] (the single Estonian artist represented on the exhibition), former Minister of Culture [[Rein Lang]], journalist Kadri Veermäe, artist [[Marge Monko]], etc.&lt;ref name="kultuuriinimesi"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/a0a9c12c-cc0e-46b1-ba63-a63f32239ff1 "Holokausti näitusele päitsete pähe panemine kurvastas Eesti kultuuriinimesi"] ERR, 15. veebruar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiwa"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kirjandus/489502c9-0482-4181-aad2-cbcb3cf178dc "Kiwa manifest: tagasi keskaega"] ERR, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="härm"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/69bb9349-f202-4dc9-bc63-82f3126b5225 Anders Härm: tõlgendada ilusaid poeetilisi kujundeid antisemiitlikena on absoluutne liialdus] ERR, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lubatavaks"&gt;[http://kultuur.err.ee/v/kunst/92455000-3bde-4112-853b-0bb653e7d3be "Kultuuritegelased hindavad holokausti teema kunstis lubatavaks erinevalt pornograafiast"] ERR, 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monko"&gt;Marge Monko [http://epl.delfi.ee/news/arvamus/marge-monko-kunstniku-lavastatud-kullimang-trauma-ja-maletamine?id=70833721 "Kunstniku lavastatud kullimäng, trauma ja mäletamine"] EPL, 20 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On ETV morning show ''Terevisioon'', Sirje Helme, the director of Estonian Art Museum Kumu, commented the situation as follows: ˮThis debate can't be about whether it is art or not. The question is, how far can an artwork go in its freedom to sharply touch this or that subject. /.../ I think that there are almost no limits in democratic freedom but some things are agreed upon not to be touched, and Holocaust is certainly one of those things. So the question is not whether it is a good or bad work of art, the problem is that it has touched a subject which is declared to be taboo in Europe and America. /.../ This is a political world, not a world of art. I think this subject does not belong to the art world." Anders Härm responded: ˮI think that there is no such rule. There is no theme more mediated than Holocaust if we talk about the horrors during the Second World War. The work by John Smith referred to this – commercialization of Holocaust. [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Umberto Eco]] have also talked about how Hollywood wouldn't let Jews to forgive and Germans to be forgiven." Sirje Helme said: ˮFor me, this question is in black and white. I will stick to my opinion that it is not about art with its aesthetical criteria and sensitivities. The question here is that the topic is sacred and only certain people can engage in it."&lt;ref name="härm" /&gt;

'''New European Painting''' emerged in the 1980s and reached a critical point of major distinction and influence in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Chris Dercon (ed.), 1980-1996 in: '' Face a l'Histoire'', Centre Georges Pompidou / Flammarion, 1996, pp.496-561.&lt;/ref&gt; with painters like [[Gerhard Richter]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Richter. ''Atlas''. D.A.P., NY, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Germer, "Des souvenirs inoppotuns," in: Jean-Paul Ameline, Brigitte Leal, Marc Bormand and Chris Dercon (eds.), '' Face a l'Histoire'', Centre Georges Pompidou / Flammarion, 1996, pp. 544-547.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Anselm Kiefer]] and [[Bracha Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi and Catherine de Zegher (eds.), ''Drawing Papers'' n.24. The Drawing Center, NY, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Armstrong and Catherine de Zegher (eds.), ''[[Women Artists]] at the Millennium''. Cambridge Massachusetts: October Books, MIT Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "Rencontre avec l'histoire," in: Jean-Paul Ameline, Brigitte Leal, Marc Bormand and Chris Dercon (eds.), '' Face a l'Histoire'', Centre Georges Pompidou / Flammarion, 1996, pp. 535-540.&lt;/ref&gt; whose paintings have established and continue to create a new dialogue between the historical archive, American Abstraction and figuration.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, "Aesthetic Wit(h)nessing in the Era of Trauma." In: ''EurAmerica''. Vol.40 n.4: 829-886. 2010.[http://euramerica.org/en_current_issue.php?quarterly_magazine_num=335]&lt;/ref&gt; The major new European painters of this era show strong engagements with painful personal and general history, as well as shared history; its memory and its oblivion; and with life under the shadow of World War II, utilizing research in new and old materials, photography and oil painting.

==Development==
These were followed by painters like [[Luc Tuymans]], [[Marlene Dumas]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;Sofie Van Loo, ''Gorge(l)''. The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa gabrielle Mark (ed.) and ''Marlene Dumas: Measuring Your Own Grave''. The Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerpen, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=March 2010}}. A third wave came with artists like [[Neo Rauch]], [[Michaël Borremans]] and [[Chris Ofili]].{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Neo-expressionism]] and other related movements in painting have emerged in the final two decades of the 20th century in Europe and in the United States, but this New Painting is not [[expressionist]]. Rather it is a renovative kind of abstraction and figuration that relates to the parallel practice of a turning into art of personal and historical photographic archives.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Laurence Bosse and Carolyne Christove-Bakargiev, ''La Ville, le Jardin, la Memoire / City, Garden, Memory''. Villa Medici, Rome, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns==
New European Painting relates to the post-traumatic traces of war&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock and Penny Florence, ''Looking Back to the Future''. G&amp;B Arts Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and it involves working oil painting and drawings with new media like photography,&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real''. MIT Press / October Book, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; xerox&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Francois Lyotard, "Scriptures: Diffracted Traces", ''Theory, Culture and Society''. (Vol.21 n.1), 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "Gleaning in history or coming after/behind the reapers. ''Generations and Geographies in the Visual Arts''. London: Routledge, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and digital media&lt;ref&gt;''ARS06 - Sense of the Real'', KIASMA Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Scholder and Jordan Crandall, ''Interaction''. NY: D.A.P., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; to create and develop a postmodern archive "fever".&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okwui Enwezor, Archive Fever: Photography Between History and the Monument [http://wiki.mediamind.org/images/5/59/Archive_Fever.pdf]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This painting relates through this aspect to the post-World War II "archive" art with artists like [[Christian Boltanski]] and [[Jochen Gerz]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosi Huhn, Das Problem der Entsorgung in Kunst und Kulture als Passage zum Positiven Barbarentum / Le Problème du traitement des résidus dans l'art et dans la culture, en tant que passage vers une 'Barbarie Positive, ''Passages [d']après]/ Passagen Nach Walter Benjamin''.Verlag Herman Schmidt, Mainz, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is often a part of this tendency. Yet, though this painting has a clear figurative stroke it is strongly connected to [[Lyrical Abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Alison Rowley, ''Helen Frankenthaler: Painting History, Writing painting'', I.B.Tauris Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to contemporary reconsiderations of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|Sublime]] in art while creating a new inner space in painting and in the series of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Buci-Glucksmann, "Inner Space of Painting", in: Catherine de Zegher (ed.)

'''''Madonna Enthroned''''', also known as the '''''Ognissanti Madonna''''', is a painting by the Italian late medieval artist [[Giotto di Bondone]], housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence, Italy]].

The painting has a traditional Christian subject, representing the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] seated on her lap, with saints and angels surrounding them on all sides. This particular representation of the Virgin is called a [[Maestà]], a popular representation at the time. It is often celebrated as the first painting of the [[Renaissance]] due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of [[Gothic art]].

It is generally dated to around 1310. While historians have had trouble finding specific information for indisputably attributing many of Giotto's works to the artist, ''Madonna Enthroned'' is one piece for which there are a few documents supporting its creation by Giotto.  There are many sources that show he spent many years living and creating in [[Florence]]. However, the main source that documents ''Madonna Enthroned'' specifically is artist [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s autobiography, ''I Commentarii'' (1447).  An earlier manuscript document of 1418 also attributes the painting to Giotto, but it is Ghiberti's autobiography that provides the most solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 676&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Giotto's later works, ''Madonna Enthroned'' was completed in [[Florence]], upon the artist's return to the city.  It was originally painted for the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] Franciscan church in Florence.  Built for the [[Humiliati]], a small religious order at the time, the church had many acclaimed paintings designed for it.  Specifically, Giotto's ''Madonna Enthroned'' was designed for the high altar.

==Influences==
The ''Madonna Enthroned'' shows the numerous styles of art that influenced Giotto. In both the gold coloring used throughout the artwork and the flattened gold background, Giotto's art continued the traditional Italo-Byzantine style so popular in the proto-Renaissance time period.  The altarpiece represents a formalized representation of an icon, still retaining the stiffness of Byzantine art, and Giotto retained the hierarchy of scale, making the centralized Madonna and the Christ Child much larger in size than the surrounding saints and religious figures.

Giotto's figures however escape the bounds of Byzantine art.  His figures are weighty and are reminiscent of three-dimensional sculptures, such as that in classical Roman sculpture.  The Madonna's intricately decorated throne, which itself is an Italian Gothic design, has a very specific use of colored marble as a surface decoration.  This method of decoration, based on a style called Cosmatesque or Cosmati, was popular in Rome since the Early Christian period and in Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages.

There were, additionally, a number of specific artists whose styles heavily influenced ''The Ognissanti Madonna''.  The influence of [[Cimabue]], traditionally recognized as Giotto's teacher, is shown first in the very symmetrical composition of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, 603&lt;/ref&gt; Cimabue portrayed the same subject in his 1280 ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', and both pieces share aspects of the Italo-Byzantine style, with Cimabue's having more Byzantine attributes.  Additionally, the two depictions of the angels' wings in Giotto and Cimabue's pieces clearly resemble each other. Both pieces share a similar, initial feeling of severity, yet there is more to each piece than the drama. Giotto adopted from his teacher the importance of, and the concern for, volume and forms in space.  

The tranquility of Giotto's figures resembled also the style of [[Pietro Cavallini]].  From this artist, who painted neo-Byzantine pieces, taking cues from both mosaics and frescos from Roman and Early Christian times, Giotto took important lessons in the technique of painting, and in rendering figures as statuesque and calm.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lastly, Giotto took cues from many contemporary sculptors, including [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], whose work shares influences of Northern Gothic art.  In the work of these artists, Giotto saw great, dramatic compositions that would certainly influence his ''Ognissanti Madonna''.

==Technique==
[[Giotto]] was the first artist to depict three-dimensional figures in western European art. Additionally, he used a much smaller space than other contemporary artists, further emphasizing the importance of the bodies in the artwork. Giotto did away with many aspects of Byzantine art that would flatten the painting.  Within [[Cimabue]]'s ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', there is the use of gold tracing to delineate the folds of the fabric.  In contrast to this, Giotto's fabric folds are more realistic, and instead of lines he used light, shadow, and color to create the appearance of fabric.  Contours of the body underneath these fabric folds are also visible, specifically in the Virgin's knees and also around her breasts. 

Giotto used a value scale, a distinct range of light and darks, to create a sense of volume in his figures, giving them the slight smokiness that is usually characteristic of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and later Renaissance artists.

The '''Ourense Torcs''' are a pair of [[Iron Age]] gold [[torc]] neck rings found near [[Ourense]] in Northwest Spain in the 1950s. They were acquired by the [[British Museum]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=35697&amp;plaA=35697-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The exact find spot of the two [[neck rings]] has never been confirmed but experts have determined, based on the shape and design of the torcs, that they originate from Ourense in the province of [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] near the Spanish/Portuguese [[border]].

==Description==
The two gold [[torc]]s are nearly identical with double [[reel]]-shaped terminals and circular body. The terminals have a large tapered central depression, with [[Repoussé and chasing|embossed]] ornamentation around the edge. Their [[Celts|Celtic]] design is characteristic of the torcs produced in Galicia and northern Portugal, in the [[Iberian Peninsular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castro Pérez|first=Ladislao|title=Os torques prehistóricos|date=1990|publisher=Univ. de Santiago de Compostela|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=8471916959|pages=148–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9063">[[File:Travels-map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s walking route, taken from ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879), a pioneering classic of outdoor literature]]
'''Outdoor literature''' is a [[literature]] genre about or involving the outdoors. Outdoor literature encompasses several different [[literature|subgenre]]s including exploration literature, adventure literature, mountain literature and [[nature writing]]. Another subgenre is the [[guide book]], an early example of which was [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]] published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; The genres can include activities such as exploration, survival, [[sailing]], [[hiking]], [[mountaineering]], [[whitewater]] boating, [[geocaching]] or [[kayaking]], or writing about nature and the environment.  [[Travel literature]] is similar to outdoor literature but differs in that it does not always deal with the out-of-doors, but there is a considerable overlap between these genres, in particular with regard to long journeys.

==History==
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' (1854) is an early and influential work. Although not entirely an outdoor work (he lived in a cabin close to civilization) he expressed the ideas of why  people go out into the wilderness to camp, backpack and hike: to get away from the rush of modern society and simplify life. This was a new perspective for the time and thus ''Walden'' has had a lasting influence on most outdoor authors.

{{quote|Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced […] Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labour movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement. Today, Thoreau's words are quoted with feeling by liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and conservatives alike.| [[Ken Kifer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phred.org/~alex/kenkifer/www.kenkifer.com/thoreau/index.htm Analysis and Notes on Walden]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Walden Pond, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Walden Pond]] ]]
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879), about his travels in [[Cévennes]] (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel with a Donkey in the Cevennes'' (1879); Re the first sleeping bag in 1876 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/gh5qCU47Ryyc2fOqSjKiLw]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, Joshua Slocum set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure:

{{quote|I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. […] A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.}}

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000&amp;nbsp;km).

The [[National Outdoor Book Award]] was established in 1997 as a [[United States|US]]-based non-profit program which each year honours the best in outdoor writing and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;National Outdoor Book Awards Official site:[http://www.noba-web.org/PastWins.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duke2costumePA.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Anderson design for ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', 1917]]
'''Percy Anderson''' (1851 – 30 October 1928) was an English stage designer and painter, best known for his work for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company at [[His Majesty’s Theatre]] and [[Edwardian musical comedies]].

==Life and career==
Anderson's first significant production was the comic opera ''Lady of the Locket'', composed by [[William Fullerton Jr.]] with a libretto by [[Henry Hamilton (playwright)|Henry Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin, pp. 25–27 and 34–39&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888), Anderson designed the costumes for all the original productions of the [[Savoy Operas]]. He continued to design costumes for D'Oyly Carte revivals in the early twentieth century, including for ''[[Trial by Jury]], [[H.M.S. Pinafore]], [[The Pirates of Penzance]], [[Patience (opera)|Patience]], [[Iolanthe]], [[Princess Ida]], [[Ruddigore]], The Yeomen of the Guard,'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]].'' For [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], Anderson designed ''[[Twelfth Night]], [[The Merry Wives of Windsor]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]], [[The Life and Death of King John|King John]], [[A Midsummer Night’s Dream]], [[The Tempest]]'', and two plays by [[Stephen Phillips]], ''Herod'' and ''Ulysses''.&lt;ref name=Times31&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 31 October 1928, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the costumes for [[Henry James]]’s ill-fated theatrical effort, ''[[Guy Domville]]''; ''The Times'' was not impressed by either the play or the costumes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 January 1895, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Anderson's other successes were ''[[Trelawny of the 'Wells']]'' (1898), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902), ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' (1904), the hit British premiere of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' in 1907, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909), ''[[Kismet (play)|Kismet]]'' (1911) and ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' (1916).  He designed the costumes for various productions of [[Edwardian musical comedies]] for [[George Edwardes]], such as the hit musical ''[[San Toy]]'' in 1899 and ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]'' in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lily-elsie.com/shows.htm Lily Elsie], Lily-Elsie.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Opera House]] commissioned Anderson to design costumes in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturenet.hr/v1/english/attachments/760.pdf |title=Biography of Milka Ternina describing Anderson costumes designed for her |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203025537/http://www.culturenet.hr/v1/english/attachments/760.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's designs were also used in a number of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?ID=25206 Percy Anderson at the IBDB database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson had private means, and for a time roomed with [[Morton Fullerton]]. He was part of a circle of rich, artistic homosexual men, who included [[Lord Ronald Gower]], the courtier Alec Yorke and [[Charles Hamilton Aide|Hamilton Aïdé]].&lt;ref&gt;Mainwaring, pp. 43 and 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s, Anderson was closely associated with the young novelist [[Hugh Walpole]]&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Times'', in its obituary notice, said of Anderson that he escaped from the pedantry of his predecessors and paved the way in a most interesting manner for [[Bakst]], [[Claud Lovat Fraser]] and [[Edward Gordon Craig|Gordon Craig]].&lt;ref name=Times31/&gt; As a painter, Anderson achieved a modest success, and his portraits hang in the collections of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], the [[Louvre]], and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploreart.co.uk/author_display.asp?SF1=sort_name&amp;ST1=ANDERSONPERCY Portrait of Winifred Dickinson by Anderson] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130420112034/http://www.exploreart.co.uk/author_display.asp?SF1=sort_name&amp;ST1=ANDERSONPERCY |date=2013-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated the 1907 book, ''Costume: Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical''.&lt;ref&gt;''Costume: Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical'', compiled by Mrs. Eliza Davis Aria. (1907) New York: The Macmillan Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson died in King's College Hospital, London, in 1928, aged 76 or 77.&lt;ref name=Times31/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20312">[[Image:40sotoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Chehel Sotoun]]'s garden]]
The tradition and style of [[garden design]] represented by '''Persian gardens''' or '''Iranian gardens''' ({{lang-fa|باغ ایرانی}}) has influenced the design of gardens from [[Andalusia]] to [[India]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Was the Persian Garden at Pasargadae a model for the Garden of Eden?|url = http://archaeology.about.com/od/pethroughpg/qt/persian_garden.htm|website = About.com Education|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Persian Garden - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1372|website = whc.unesco.org|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en|first = UNESCO World Heritage|last = Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens of the [[Alhambra]] show the influence of Persian garden philosophy and style in a [[Moors|Moorish]] palace scale, from the era of [[al-Andalus]] in [[Spain]]. [[Humayun's Tomb]] and [[Taj Mahal]] have some of the largest Persian gardens in the world, from the era of the [[Mughal Empire]] in India.

==Concept and etymology==
[[Image:Baghe Eram Shiraz edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eram Garden]] is a famous historic Persian garden in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]]]]
[[File:PersianGarden.png|thumb|A schematic diagram of a Persian garden. Note the quadripartite structure with focal water feature, connecting aqueducts, and surrounding trees, as well as the placement of the palace]]
[[Image:Shazdeh Garden Mahan Iran.jpg|thumb|[[Shazdeh Garden]] is one of the largest gardens of [[Kerman Province]].]]

From the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the idea of an earthly paradise spread through [[Persian literature]] and example to other cultures, both the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] gardens of the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom#Ptolemaic rulers|Ptolemies]] in [[Alexandria]]. The [[Avestan]] word ''pairidaēza-'', [[Old Persian]] *''paridaida-'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although the genuine Old Persian form must have been *''paridaida-'', Modern Persian ''palīz'' 'garden' from Middle Persian ''palēz'' presupposes a variant *''pardaiza-'' (with [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of ''-i-''), which seems to be the [[cognate]] of *''paridaida-'' from a different Iranian language (Avestan, Median or Parthian) borrowed into Persian still in an early period. See Proto-Iranian [[wikt:Reconstruction/paridaiźa-|''*paridaiźa-'']].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Median language|Median]] *''paridaiza-'' (walled-around, i.e., a [[walled garden]]), was borrowed into [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and then into Greek {{lang-grc|παράδεισος|parádeisos}}, then rendered into the [[Latin]] ''paradīsus'', and from there entered into European languages, e.g., [[French language|French]] ''paradis'', [[German language|German]] ''Paradies'', and [[English language|English]] ''[[paradise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fakour M., ''Achaemenid Gardens'' [http://www.com/CAIS/Culture/achaemenid_gardens.htm]; CAIS-Online - accessed Jan 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As the word expresses, such [[garden]]s would have been enclosed. The garden's purpose was, and is, to provide a place for protected relaxation in a variety of manners: [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[leisure]]ly (such as meetings with friends), essentially a ''paradise on earth''. The [[Proto-Iranian language|Common Iranian]] word for "enclosed space" was *''pari-daiza-'' (Avestan ''pairi-daēza-''), a term that was adopted by [[Christianity|Christian mythology]] to describe the [[garden of Eden]] or [[Paradise]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Persians: Masters of Empire, p 62, {{ISBN|0-8094-9104-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden's construction may be [[formality|formal]] (with an emphasis on structure) or casual (with an emphasis on nature), following several simple design rules. This allows a maximization, in terms of function and emotion, of what may be done in the garden.

==History==

More detail is needed here. --&gt; The outline of [[Pasargadae]], built around 500 BC, is viewable today.

During the reign of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (third to seventh century), and under the influence of [[Zoroastrianism]], [[water]] in [[art]] grew increasingly important. This trend manifested itself in garden design, with greater emphasis on [[fountain]]s and [[pond]]s in gardens.

During the Islamic occupation, the aesthetic aspect of the garden increased in importance, overtaking utility. During this time, aesthetic rules that govern the garden grew in importance. An example of this is the ''[[charbagh|chahār bāgh]]'' ({{lang|fa|چهارباغ}}), a form of garden that attempts to emulate the [[Garden of Eden]], with four rivers and four quadrants that represent the world. The design sometimes extends one axis longer than the cross-axis, and may feature water channels that run through each of the four gardens and connect to a central pool.

The invasion of Persia by the [[Mongols]] in the thirteenth century led to a new emphasis on highly ornate [[structure]] in the garden. Examples of this include [[Tree peony|tree peonies]] and [[chrysanthemum]]s.{{clarify|in what way are chrysanthemums structure?|date=September 2012}} The Mongols then carried a Persian garden tradition to other parts of their empire (notably [[India]]).

[[Babur]] introduced the Persian garden to [[India]]. The now unkempt [[Aram Bagh, Agra]] was the first of many Persian gardens he created. The [[Taj Mahal]] embodies the Persian concept of an ideal [[paradise garden]].

The [[Safavid dynasty]] (seventeenth to eighteenth century) built and developed grand and epic layouts that went beyond a simple extension to a palace and became an integral aesthetic and functional part of it. In the following centuries, [[Europe]]an garden design began to influence Persia, particularly the designs of [[France]], and secondarily that of [[Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Western influences led to changes in the use of water and the species used in bedding.

Traditional forms and style are still applied in modern Iranian gardens. They also appear in [[historic site]]s, [[museum]]s and affixed to the houses of the rich.

==Elements of the Persian garden==
[[File:Hafezeeyeh garden1.jpg|thumb|Elements of the Persian garden, such as the shade, the ''jub'', and the courtyard style ''hayāt'' in a public garden in Shiraz.]]
[[Sunlight]] and its effects were an important factor of structural design in Persian gardens. Textures and shapes were specifically chosen by [[architect]]s to harness the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pasargadae: The Persian Gardens {{!}} Kaveh Farrokh|url = http://kavehfarrokh.com/iranica/achaemenid-era/pasargardae-the-persian-gardens/|website = kavehfarrokh.com|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]]'s dry heat makes shade important in gardens, which would be nearly unusable without it. Trees and [[Trellis (architecture)|trellises]] largely feature as [[Biotic component|biotic]] shade; [[pavilions]] and [[wall]]s are also structurally prominent in blocking the sun.

The heat also makes water important, both in the design and maintenance of the garden. Irrigation may be required, and may be provided via a form of underground tunnel called a ''[[qanat]]'', that transports water from a local [[aquifer]]. [[Water well|Well]]-like structures then connect to the qanat, enabling the drawing of water. Alternatively, an animal-driven [[Persian well]] would draw water to the surface. Such wheel systems also moved water around surface water systems, such as those in the ''chahar bāgh'' style. Trees were often planted in a ditch called a ''juy'', which prevented water [[evaporation]] and allowed the water quick access to the tree [[root]]s.

The Persian style often attempts to integrate indoors with outdoors through the connection of a surrounding garden with an inner [[courtyard]]. Designers often place architectural elements such as [[vaulted arches]] between the outer and interior areas to open up the divide between them.

==Descriptions==
An early description (from the first half of the fourth century BCE) of a Persian garden is found in [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Oeconomicus]]'' in which he has [[Socrates]] relate the story of the Spartan general [[Lysander]]'s visit to the Persian prince [[Cyrus the Younger]], who shows the Greek his "paradise at Sardis". In this story Lysander is "astonished at the beauty of the trees within, all planted at equal intervals, the long straight rows of waving branches, the perfect regularity, the rectangular  symmetry of the whole, and the many sweet scents which hung about them as they paced the park"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xenephon|title=Oeconomicus|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1173/1173-h/1173-h.htm|website=Gutenberg Press|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest representational descriptions and illustrations of Persian gardens come from travelers who reached Iran from the west. These accounts include [[Ibn Battuta]] in the fourteenth century, [[Ruy González de Clavijo]] in the fifteenth century and [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] in the seventeenth century. Battuta and Clavijo made only passing references to gardens and did not describe their design,&lt;!--then better sources should be used--&gt; but Kaempfer made careful drawings and converted them into detailed engravings after his return to Europe. They show chahar bāgh type gardens that featured an enclosing wall, rectangular pools, an internal network of canals, garden pavilions and lush planting. There are surviving examples of this garden type at [[Yazd]] (Dowlatabad) and at [[Kashan]] ([[Fin Garden]]). The location of the gardens Kaempfer illustrated in [[Isfahan]] can be identified.

==Styles==
[[Image:Golestan-takht2.jpg|thumb|The garden in the [[Golestan Palace]] of Tehran.]]
The six primary styles of the Persian garden may be seen in the following table, which puts them in the context of their function and style. Gardens are not limited to a particular style, but often integrate different styles, or have areas with different functions and styles.

{|align=center

|'''Classical'''
|'''Formal'''
|'''Casual'''
|-
|'''Public'''

|[[Meidan|Meidān]]
|[[Park]]
|-
|'''Private'''
|Hayāt
|[[charbagh|Chahār Bāgh]]
|[[Bagh (garden)|Bāgh]]
|}

===Hayāt===
Publicly, it is a classical Persian layout with heavy emphasis on [[aesthetics]] over function. Man-made structures in the garden are particularly important, with [[arch]]es and [[swimming pool|pools]] (which may be used to bathe). The ground is often covered in [[gravel]] flagged with stone. Plantings are typically very simple - such as a line of trees, which also provide shade.

Privately, these gardens are often pool-centred and, again, structural. The pool serves as a focus and source of humidity for the surrounding atmosphere. There are few plants, often due to the limited water available in [[urban area]]s.

===Meidān===
[[File:Naghshe Jahan Square Isfahan modified.jpg|thumb|[[Naghsh-i Jahan square]], the charbagh Royal Square (Maidan) in [[Isfahan]], constructed between 1598 and 1629]]

{{Main|Meidan}}
This is a public, [[Formality|formal]] garden that puts more emphasis on the [[Biotic component|biotic]] element than the ''hayāt'' and that minimises structure. Plants range from [[tree]]s, to [[shrub]]s, to [[bedding plant]]s, to [[grass]]es. Again, there are elements such as a pool and gravel pathways which divide the [[lawn]]. When structures are used, they are often built, as in the case of pavilions, to provide shade.

===Chahar Bāgh===
{{Main|Charbagh}}
These gardens are private and formal. The basic structure consists of four quadrants divided by waterways or pathways. Traditionally, the rich used such gardens in work-related functions (such as entertaining [[ambassador]]s). These gardens balance structure with greenery, with the plants often around the periphery of a pool and path based structure.

===Park===
Much like many other [[park]]s, the Persian park serves a casual public function with emphasis on plant life. They provide pathways and seating, but are otherwise usually limited in terms of structural elements. The purpose of such places is relaxation and socialisation.

===Bāgh===
{{Main|Bagh (garden)}}
Like the other casual garden, the park, ''bāgh'' emphasizes the natural and green aspect of the garden. Unlike the park it is a private area often affixed to houses and often consisting of [[lawn]]s, trees, and ground plants. The waterways and pathways stand out less than in the more formal counterparts and are largely functional. The primary function of such areas is familial relaxation.

'''Perth Theatre''' at 185 High Street, (no longer registered address) [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]] opened in 1900 and was extended in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.culturalprofiles.net/scotland/Units/926.html|title = Perth Theatre|accessdate= 15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is [[listed building#Scotland|category B listed]] by [[Historic Scotland]],&lt;ref name=LBR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=39468 |title=Perth Theatre, listed Building Report |accessdate=2009-07-20 |publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is operated by the charitable organisation Horsecross Arts, alongside sister venue [[Perth Concert Hall (Scotland)|Perth Concert Hall]]. 
On 4 January 2014, the theatre closed to undergo renovations and expansions. Among the plans for the theatre are new seats, another smaller theatre, and a new entrance. The original auditorium has also now been restored to its original condition, and the theatre reopened to the public in December 2017 with a pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.horsecross.co.uk/transform-perth-theatre-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre opened on Perth High Street in 1900 and was planned to seat 950 in the auditorium, with pit, two balconies and boxes. It was created by the Perth Theatre &amp; Opera House Co Ltd and designed by Dundee`s City Architect, William Alexander. It is similar in style and layout to his design of Her Majesty`s Theatre, Dundee, but on a smaller scale. The foundation stone was laid in 1899 by actor George Alexander. The founding lessee was JH Savile, who owned Paisley Theatre, and in 1909 bought the Perth theatre outright. The Savile family continued to run the theatre until 1935, staging drama, opera, musicals, pantomime, revues and variety.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PerthTheatres.htm&lt;/ref&gt; JH Savile also founded his own Repertory Companies in Paisley and Perth &lt;ref&gt;The Stage Year Book of 1916&lt;/ref&gt; which at their height produced 40 plays a year.

In 1935, Perth Theatre was sold to a new company created in London, the Perth Repertory Theatre Ltd., by Ernest Dence in support of his actress daughter Marjorie Dence, who succeeded as owner in 1937 on his death. Marjorie Dence and actor David Steuart co-founded their new venture, the Perth Repertory Company,  whose annual and highly acclaimed work covered nine months of repertory in and around Perth with three months of touring of the Highlands &amp; Islands, to the Northern Isles, and to the lowland towns of the Borders. In the first year alone 51 plays were produced. Perth Theatre hosted the first Scottish Theatre Festival in 1939 and again in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PerthTheatres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders added a second repertory company from 1946 to 1958, which alternated with Perth, ensuring repertory at Kirkcaldy, mainly in its Adam Smith Hall. Perth Repertory continued throughout the war and thrived until Miss Dence`s passing in 1966.
 
In her will, Dence gave first option to buy the theatre to the Scottish Committee of the Arts Council, which did so and transferred it to Perth City Council. Joan Knight was appointed as Artistic Director in 1968, continuing the repertory company and mentoring performers and would-be-directors. During her 26-year tenure at Perth Theatre, she oversaw a major rebuilding programme in 1981 and 1985, adding a restaurant, studio theatre, rehearsal room, more dressing rooms and a workshop facility.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PerthTheatres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Perth Theatre's sister venue, Perth Concert Hall, was launched under the direction of the Jane Speirs, first CEO of Horsecross Arts. She also began fundraising for the theatre`s restoration and major redevelopment for which Richard Murphy, architects, were appointed by the Council in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richardmurphyarchitects.com/viewItem.php?id=2469&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
'''Historic B-listed, Victorian Auditorium''' will be restored to its former glory. The upper circle will be reinstated and an orchestra area will be re-introduced. The theatre will also benefit from improvements to seating, sightlines, circulation, ventilation, lighting and new equipment.

'''Studio Theatre'''
A new 200-seat capacity, courtyard-style studio theatre will be built to meet the demand for staging small to mid-scale performances.

'''Creative Learning'''
An extension will provide a number of spaces for creative learning activities and a home for Perth Youth Theatre.

'''Access'''
For the first time there will be level access to Perth Theatre's foyer, Box Office, auditorium, creative learning spaces and café, bar and restaurant from a new Mill Street entrance. There will also be a lift to allow ease of access to all other levels. The High Street entrance, complete with iconic arch, will be retained ensuring Perth Theatre's presence on the busy shopping street remains and offering shoppers a direct route into the building.

Richard Murphy Architects, UK were appointed architects for the project in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/scotland/perth-theatre|title=Perth Theatre, Scotland – Building – e-architect|website=e-architect|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the theatre's 1980s extension began on 19 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/140822/milestone-work-begins-perth-theatre/|title=Milestone work begins at Perth Theatre – The Courier|website=The Courier|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable figures==
Throughout its history, a number of star acts performed at Perth Theatre, including a young [[Alec Guinness]], [[Walter Carr (actor)]], [[Edward Woodward]], [[Una McLean]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. More recently [[Crieff]]’s own [[Ewan McGregor]] began his acting career at the theatre – McGregor is also Project Ambassador of Transform Perth Theatre.

==Perth Youth Theatre==
Established in 1966 by Brian Howard and Catherine Robins, Perth Youth Theatre was the first theatre-based youth theatre group in Scotland. Perth Youth Theatre has trained young people in acting and stage craft for 50 years. Perth Youth Theatre Alumni included [[Rhod Sharp]], [[Stuart Cosgrove]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Colin McCredie]] and [[Sally Reid]]

''"What happened to us there – boys and girls – was profound, and often profoundly funny. In the children's show, the name of which I cannot remember, I played my first custard pie scene with [[Stuart Cosgrove]]. It used a lot shaving foam and Stuart usually came off better. We didn't know who we would become, but few of us had doubts that we would become something." [[Rhod Sharp|Rhod Sharp, 2015]]''

'''''Portrait Miniature of Margaret Roper''''' is a painting by the German artist and printmaker [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] created between 1535–36, and today held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="met1"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/margaret_more_1505_1544_wife_of_william_roper_hans_holbein_the_younger/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110001105 Margaret More]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Roper]] (1505–44) was the eldest child of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and wife of the English biographer [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]]. It is the second and less well known of two portraits of Roper painted by Holbein. The first, ''Portrait of an English Woman'', is generally believed to show Roper but may depict another unknown lady of the English court. The New York work was painted during the artist's second visit to London, likely in the mid-1530s.&lt;ref name="G92"&gt;Goldberg, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/h/hans_holbein_the_younger,_port.aspx Hans Holbein the Younger, Portrait of an English Woman, a drawing]". [[British Museum]], Retrieved 11 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the work was created shortly after her father's beheading at the hands of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1535.&lt;ref name="mm12"&gt;"[http://12.151.120.44/toah/ho/08/euwb/ho_50.69.2.htm Margaret More (1505–1544), Wife of William Roper, 1535–36]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With a diameter of just {{convert|1+3/4|in|cm}}, the work was one of over a hundred [[Portrait miniature|miniature]]s and portraits painted by Holbein while in England. This work is one of a pair of [[pendant]]s; the second depicts the sitter's husband.

Roper is depicted in three-quarters view with a narrow face and wearing extravagant clothes that reflect her social position. She is wearing a [[gable hood]] with pinned up red/orange embroidered lappets (facing the viewer) and a long black veil (with one side pinned up). Her black gown is lined with a broad band of fur. She holds a green book in her hands which are decorated by gold rings. A horizontal gold inscription reads "Ao ÆTATIS XXX".&lt;ref name="met1" /&gt; The work was donated to the Metropolitan Museum by the Rogers Fund in 1950.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2644">'''''Pour une critique des traductions: John Donne''''' is a [[wikt:posthumous|posthumous]] [[book]] by [[Antoine Berman]], published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/ttr/1995/v8/n1/037207ar.pdf ''Pour une critique des traductions''], recension par Sherry Simon, dans : [[TTR : traduction, terminologie, rédaction]], vol. 8, n° 1, 1995, p. 282-287. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published posthumously in France, develops an original concept of “[[criticism of translation]]” and a methodology to anchor the practice of this criticism. The work of translation is a critical process as well as a creative one. Moving away from nonsystematic evaluative approaches that focus on the shortcomings of translations or the normative approaches that study the cultural and literary systems into which the translations are inserted, Berman applies the notion of [[ethics]] he developed in his earlier works, calling for a translation that is nonethnocentric and stipulating that the creativity required by translation be focused on the re-creation of the original in the other language without being over-determined by the personal poetics of the writer-translator.&lt;ref name="kenney"/&gt;

The book is divided into two parts, each focused on one element of the ethics of translation: theory (reflection) and practice (experience). In the first part Berman presents what he calls a general “productive criticism,” while in the second part he applies the general theoretical principles of this criticism to the analysis of the translations of [[John Donne]]’s work into French and Spanish.&lt;ref name="kenney"/&gt;

This book has been influential in the field of [[translation studies]] in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/ttr/2001/v14/n2/000575ar.pdf ''L’impact d’Antoine Berman sur la traductologie en Amérique latine : une enquête''], par Georges L. Bastin, dans : [[TTR : traduction, terminologie, rédaction]], vol. 14, n° 2, 2001, p. 181-194. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was [[translated]] into [[English language|English]] by [[Françoise Massardier-Kenney]], ''Toward a Translation Criticism: John Donne''.

'''''Principia philosophiae cartesianae''''' ('''''PPC'''''; "The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy") or '''''Renati Descartes principia philosophiae, more geometrico demonstrata''''' ("The Principles of René Descartes' Philosophy, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order") is a philosophical work of [[Baruch Spinoza]] published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1663. In the preface to this work, Ludovic Meyer explains that it is a reconstruction of [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Principles of Philosophy]] ''in the Euclidean or "geometric" fashion''[[Principles of Philosophy|.]] ''In the appendix, a series of non-geometric prose passages entitled ''Metaphysical Thoughts'' [''Cogitata Metaphisica''], Spinoza explicates [[Cartesian materialism|Descartes' views]] on traditional metaphysical topics (including [[essence]], [[existence]], [[idea]], [[potential]], [[Metaphysical necessity|necessity]], [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]], [[duration (philosophy)|duration]], and [[time]]) while furtively interpolating some of his own.

The '''Quadrangle''' is the common name for a cluster of museums and cultural institutions in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts]], on Chestnut Street between State and Edwards Streets.

The [[Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden]], in the center of the Quadrangle, is surrounded by a park, a library, four active museums, a fifth museum due to open in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Opening Announcement|url=https://springfieldmuseums.org/about/dr-seuss-museum/|website=Springfield Museums|publisher=Springfield Museums|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cathedral. A second cathedral is just on the Quadrangle's periphery.

==Merrick Park==
On the corner of Chestnut and State Streets, '''Merrick Park''' is distinguished by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] "[[The Puritan (Springfield)|The Puritan]]," a statue depicting one of Springfield's settlers, [[Deacon Samuel Chapin]]. Springfield Central Library and [[Christ Church Cathedral (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Christ Church Cathedral]] are adjacent to the park.

==Springfield City Library==
{{see also|List of Carnegie libraries in Massachusetts}}
[[File:Library, Springfield, Mass (61523).jpg|left|thumb]]
[[File:1891 Springfield public library Massachusetts.png|left|thumb|1891]]
The Central Library, constructed in 1913, was paid for by [[Andrew Carnegie]].  It is the second library to be built at that location.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  The nonfiction department is based in Rice Hall (named for [[William Rice (Methodist minister)|William Rice]]), consisting of a main floor and mezzanine.  Opposite Rice Hall is the Arts and Music Hall, where multimedia, periodicals, and the computer lab are based.  The circulation desk lies in the rotunda between the two halls.  [[Fiction]], children's literature, and community rooms are in the basement. The Central Library also has a Teen Advisory Board — a grouping of teenagers who help make decisions and organize events at the library geared towards teenagers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Cathedrals ==
The Roman Catholic [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Springfield|St. Michael's Cathedral]] adjoins the neo-classical Springfield City Library at the southeast corner of the Quadrangle.

Also located near that edge of the Quadrangle is the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts' [[Christ Church Cathedral (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Christ Church Cathedral]].

==Springfield Museums==

The '''George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum''' is the oldest museum on the Quadrangle.  The museum is named for the collection's original owner.  Its exhibits express the taste of Smith and his wife, Belle, and they bequeathed their notable collection to begin the museum.  The building dates from 1895 and was designed by [[Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell]] and Walter T. Owen.

The Ancient Treasures Gallery displays objects from ancient [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]].  The gallery also presents Greek and Roman sculpture from the recently acquired Blake/Purnell Collection of antiquities, and ancient Chinese ceramics and bronzes from the Bidwell Collection.

===Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden===
The Quadrangle's perimeter was at one time open to vehicles, but was closed off in the 1990s, becoming a pedestrian-only park.  Soon after that, the [[Dr. Seuss Memorial|Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden]] was opened.  Several statues depicting Springfield native Theodor Geisel ([[Dr. Seuss]]) and many of his creations were sculpted and placed on the Quadrangle green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catinthehat.org/|title=Theodor Seuss Geisel - "Dr. Seuss" Biography|publisher=Catinthehat.org|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 2017, the William Pynchon Memorial Building, which formerly housed the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum, reopened as the [[Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brien |first=George |url=http://businesswest.com/blog/it-will-be-a-real-draw/ |title=It Will Be a Real Draw |work=BusinessWest |date=2015-04-07 |accessdate=2015-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was selected No. 2 on the "10 South Parks that Changed the World" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-039-South-Park-039-Episodes-that-Changed-the-World-36019.shtml|title=The 'South Park' Episodes that Changed the World|author=Elena Gorgan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612151952/http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-039-South-Park-039-Episodes-that-Changed-the-World-36019.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also part of "South Park's Dirty Dozen."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletterarchive.org/2007/06/13/173395-South+Park+Booster+Club+Newsletter+-+The+Dirty+Dozen The Dirty Dozen] South Park Club Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, Father Maxi travels to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to confront the growing problem of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic priests molesting children]]. Meanwhile, Cartman discovers that it is possible to defecate from the mouth.

==Plot==
The parents of South Park are a bit concerned when [[List of recurring South Park characters#Father Maxi|Father Maxi]] informs them about the Young Men's Catholic Retreat and agree that they do not want their kids to go. They also decide to have a [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]] talk to the boys to find out if the priest had been [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] them. The counselor, assuming the children were molested, asks, "Did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?" Having never been abused by Father Maxi, the boys are completely baffled about the question's meaning. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has a "brilliant" idea, reasoning she meant it could be possible that eating food through the rectum can cause defecation through the mouth. The other boys (especially [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]) think it is stupid and disgusting, and Cartman bets him $20 it will work. While the counselor is questioning the boys, all the parents decide to become [[atheism|atheists]], as the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual molestation scandals]] have destroyed their faith in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[God]].

Cartman ultimately does defecate out of his mouth, winning the bet and continually boasts the fact to Kyle, who becomes increasingly angered by it. News of this spreads, and it is concluded nationwide that this method of eating is much healthier than the traditional method (with the surgeon general basing that on "absolutely nothing"). The adults of South Park immediately adopt the new method of eating, calling it ''interorectogestion'' and even start passing trash cans around at social situations to openly collect the waste (literally "spewing crap from their mouths"), completely disregarding the previously long-held custom that defecation should occur in private. 

Meanwhile, Maxi has gathered a meeting of Catholic priests in Colorado to discuss the problem of child molestation. Maxi is appalled by such behavior and wants it to cease entirely, but to Maxi's horror, all of the other priests there have molested their altar boys. Maxi decides he has to go to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]]. Once there, he quickly finds the same: priests from all over the world (and from other worlds, specifically an alien race known as the Gelgameks) are molesting children and claim [[Catholic sex abuse cases#Celibacy theory|they need to continue the practice to receive gratification]]. They claim the "Holy Document of Vatican Law" does not prohibit the behavior, so Maxi wants to change the canon law to outlaw sodomy, as well as to [[clerical marriage|allow sex with women]]. The Cardinal tells him that the Document cannot be changed as no one knows where it is. Maxi decides to try to find it. Meanwhile, Kyle has lost his patience with Cartman's incessant boasting and tells Cartman that he accepts the fact that he beat him fairly. This angers Cartman, as he wanted to hold the victorious bet over Kyle's head indefinitely.

Maxi searches through the lower levels of the Vatican, and goes through a gauntlet in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' in order to reach the Holy Document. But the [[Pope John Paul II|Pope]] says they must first consult the highest power. He summons the "Queen Spider", which has for centuries been responsible for the pedophilia in the church, and declares that the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed. Angered by this, Maxi finally snaps and tears the Document in two, and [[St. Peter's Basilica|the building]] begins to crumble. Maxi stands in front of the ruins, and tells everyone that Catholicism is not about the Holy Document of Vatican Law, molestation, or Queen Spiders, but about being a good person. He says by clouding the moral lessons of the [[Bible]] with needless ceremony and so many literal translations, the Vatican has caused people to reject religion and argues that "when they have no mythology to live their lives by, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths". The parents, watching this on TV, regain their faith in God, deciding to stop shoving food up their rectum and to start going to church again, wanting to owe God an apology.

==Production==
In the DVD commentary for this episode, [[Matt Stone|Stone]] and Parker refer to their irritation towards arguments from more socially liberal/atheistic/secular minded types of people, as well as from socially religious conservatives.  The scene where the parents discuss atheism while crapping out their mouths is based on Parker's annoyance with atheists. When Maxi searches for the Holy Document the scene is animated in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' Randy's nightmare about the priest molesting the boys is done using footage from [[The Love Boat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2005|title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: "Red Hot Catholic Love" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">Many organizations have used [[sticker]]s to publicize their philosophy or cause. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), which during its colorful history has [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|pioneered a variety of creative tactics]], calls its stickers '''silent agitators''', or '''silent organizers'''. Professor [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]] has written about the history of such media,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wobbly organizers were revolutionary fish swimming in the sea of [[bindle]] stiffs and [[Hobo|tramp]] workers. The Wobbly card was a ticket to ride the rails. "Side door coaches," as box cars were called, were plastered with paper stickers, "silent organizers," that Wobs put up everywhere they passed: "Join the One Big Union," "I Will Win," "Win a World." &lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]], pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Silent agitators were produced by the millions.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Margolis described the way such stickers were used when the Wobblies [[Columbine Mine massacre|called a strike]] in 1927:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bill Lloyd, Superintendent at the Puritan Mine (in [[Colorado]]'s northern coal field), went to work one chilly Autumn morning to discover Wobbly stickers pasted on every timber and cross beam in the place: "Join the Wobblies, Join the Wobblies," he said indignantly, "From the bottom of the shaft clear to the working faces, see, they had these posters."&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. Eric Margolis, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]] described in his autobiography how the IWW issued stickers to propagandize against [[World War I|the war]]. The stickers declared, "Don't be a soldier, be a man. Join the I.W.W. and fight on the job for yourself and [[Working class|your class]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The How and the Why''''' is a play by [[Sarah Treem]] who is a staff writer for HBO 's ''[[In Treatment (U.S. TV series)|In Treatment]]''. The play depicts two women biologists meeting for the first time, one near the end of her career and the other at the beginning. The older woman has earned fame for her work on the [[Grandmother hypothesis]]. The younger wants to present a radical new hypothesis to explain why human females [[menstruate]] while most mammals do not. The play deals with the workings of science and its impact on the personal lives of women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/nyregion/a-review-of-the-how-and-the-why-at-penguin-rep-theater.html New York Times review]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6040">[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 116.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Victor Chocquet&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Victor Chocquet''' (9 December 1821 – 7 April 1891) was a French art collector and an ardent propagandist of [[Impressionism]]. As a senior editor at the [[Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes]], he was present at all the exhibitions where he defended painters confronted with mockery and insults. His collection was huge. It was dispersed after his death in 1899. Many of the paintings are currently in American museums.

== Life ==
Chocquet was born in [[Lille]] in a wealthy family of [[silk mill]]ers. At a very young age, he devoted all his resources to the purchase of works of art: paintings (including those of [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]]) porcelain, and furniture.  In 1875, when he attended the 1875 Impressionist sale at the [[Hôtel Drouot]], he fell in love with the paintings hooted by the audience.&lt;ref name="Monneret T1 139"&gt;{{harvsp|Monneret|1987|p=139|id=Monneret T1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked [[Auguste Renoir]] to paint a portrait of his wife and their little daughter Marie-Sophie who died at the age of five, based on a photograph.&lt;ref name="Sue 167 "&gt;{{harvsp|Sue Roe|2007|p=167|id=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this first sale of the "Société anonyme des artistes" at the Hôtel Drouot on 24 March 1875, the painters' receipts did not cover their expenses, the average price of a painting amounting to 100 fr. That day he was one of the first supports of the artists with [[Ernest Hoschedé]] and {{ill|Georges de Bellio|fr}}.&lt;ref name="CM 104"&gt;{{harvsp|Collectif Meyon|2010|p=104|id=CM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly enthusiastic about [[Paul Cézanne]] whose paintings he saw at [[Père Tanguy]]'s home, he spent a lot of energy verbally defending the painters at the 1876 and 1877 exhibitions to which he lent works from his collection. Despite the quolibets that welcomed Cézanne's presentation of his own portrait and despite violent criticism from the press, he was not discouraged, even when his resources diminished when he took early retirement (1877). From 1882, his mother-in-law's inheritance allowed him to resume his purchases and he acquired a property in [[Hattenville]] (Normandy) where a large number of works, including ''Ferme à Hattenville'', by Cézanne, were painted.&lt;ref name="Monneret T1 140"&gt;{{harvsp|Monneret|1987|p=140|id=Monneret T1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His collection rivaled those of the greatest collectors: he was often quoted at the same time as Georges de Bellio and [[Eugène Murer]] in the press.&lt;ref name="SMB 111"&gt;{{harvsp|Colin B.

In Paris, Victor Chocquet first lived in an apartment [[rue de Rivoli]] that overlooked the [[Tuileries Garden]]. It is from there that Monet painted several paintings, including ''Vue sur le jardin des Tuileries'' (1876).&lt;ref name="Sue 157"&gt;{{harvsp|Sue Roe|2007|p=157|id=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; huile sur toile de 53.97 x 73.2&lt;ref name="CM 146"&gt;{{harvsp|Collectif Meyon|2010|p=146|id=CM}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his life, he moved to a small 18th century mansion house, [[rue Monsigny]].&lt;ref name="Sue 235 "&gt;{{harvsp|Sue Roe|2007|p=235|id=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chocquet died in Paris on 7 April 1891 at age 69.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">'''Vlastenské Theatre''' ('Vlastenské divadlo') was a historic theatre in [[Prague]], active between 1786 and 1811. It was a pioneer institution as the first Czech language theatre in Prague. While the [[Estates Theatre]] occasionally gave Czech language performances from 1785 onward, the Vlastenské was the first theatre to give exclusively Czech language plays. The theatre had numerous names during its relatively short existence, and it changed building several times.

'''WinCustomize''' is a [[website]] that provides content for users to customize [[Microsoft Windows]]. The site hosts thousands of [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[theme (computer)|themes]], [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other graphical content to modify the Windows [[graphical user interface]].  There are some premium or paid content, however the vast majority of the content is free for users to download.

== Site history ==
WinCustomize was launched in March 2001 by [[Brad Wardell]] and [[Pat Ford (businessman)|Pat Ford]], both of whom work at [[Stardock]]. After the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com recession]] had taken down many popular [[skin (computing)|skin]] sites, WinCustomize quickly grew in popularity due to a combination of wide variety of content, uptime reliability, and being the preferred content destination by [[Stardock]] customers.

The site has grown at a far greater pace than its founders had anticipated. It has managed to avoid having to put many limitations on users or having to resort to pop-up advertising because of its corporate patron Stardock subsidizing its costs.
This growth has prompted several site redesigns to offer improved functionality and reliability to users.

Since launch, WinCustomize has undergone several iterations:

'''WinCustomize 2k5''' - Launched at the end of 2004, WinCustomize was redesigned for improved stability, and added functionality (personal pages for subscribers, an articles system, tutorials etc.).

'''WinCustomize 2k7''' - Launched January 15, 2007, WC2k7 was a from-the-ground-up rewrite using [[ASP.NET]]. The focus was to build a foundation that was easier to maintain and, in the future, expand.

'''WinCustomize v6''' - Planned for Late 2008/Early 2009, the WC v6 project aims be a major revision to how users navigate and interact with the site and the community as a whole. Where 2k7 was focused on the core codebase, v6 is focused on the user interface and experience.

In July 2007 the WinCustomize Wiki was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.wincustomize.com/?aid=157328|title=Welcome to the WinCustomize Wiki!|author=Mike Crassweller|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WinCustomize 2010''' - WinCustomize 2010 was launched on April 20, 2010.  This major revision represents a major change in the sites look and navigation for users. A guided tour of the new site was published for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wincustomize.com/article/378698/|title=WinCustomize 2K10 Guided Tour|author=Frogboy|date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forum criticisms==
{{peacock|section|date=July 2011}}
While nearly all users visit WinCustomize.com to download [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[Theme (computing)|themes]], [[icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other content for their personal computers, WinCustomize does have extensive forums and articles areas. As with most large sites, WinCustomize is not without its critics with regards to how the forums are run and the content in the articles and forums area.

The site's news contains a great deal of editorial content. As a result, some users are occasionally concerned with stories that they feel are biased against policies or issues they disagree with. For example, site owner [[Brad Wardell]] has written articles that are critical of Apple, European policy, commercialism, anti-commercialism, and more. One recent article criticized Norway's banning of the iPod music store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wincustomize.com/articles.aspx?aid=142193 Norway bans iTunes store, cuts nose, spites face]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of WinCustomize is the site's close association with [[Stardock]] which owns the site. Some feel there is a [[conflict of interest]] in the world's largest skinning site (over 20 million visitors monthly){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} being operated by a software developer that sells skinning solutions.

== Popular skinning programs ==
Programs heavily associated with Windows customization include:

*''[[WindowBlinds]]'' – enables users to customize the look and feel of the Windows GUI
*''[[Winamp]]'' – A skinnable media player from Nullsoft
*''[[IconPackager]]'' – A program that enables users to change their Windows icons
*''[[Rainlendar]]'' — A skinnable calendar and small desktop application (widgets &amp; monitoring) program
*''[[DesktopX]]'' — A program that enables users to build their own desktop with objects and widgets
*''[[Windows Media Player]]'' — Microsoft's skinnable media player.
*''[[LiteStep]]'' – A noted desktop shell replacement for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
*''[[ObjectDock]]'' — provides a dock that adds functionality to the Windows interface, similar but not an emulation of the dock in Mac OS X
*''[[LogonStudio]]'' — alters the [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] [[welcome screen]]
*''[[BootSkin]]'' — alters the [[Windows 2000]] and Windows XP [[boot screen]]
