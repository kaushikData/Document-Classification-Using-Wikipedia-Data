The '''Potato riots''' in June-July 1917 was a popular uprising in the Dutch capital city [[Amsterdam]] that was caused by the food shortage in the Netherlands during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Potato eaters shot |url=https://socialhistory.org/en/today/potato-eaters-shot |website=International Institute of Social History |date=7 July 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article90284213 |title=Potato riots in Amsterdam. |newspaper=[[Bendigo Advertiser]] |date=6 July 1917 |page=7 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the beginning of the 20th century food was more within the reach of the workers. The First World War changed this. The Netherlands was a neutral country, but experienced discomfort and hard circumstances. Imports and exports of goods stagnated. Bread and other food was rationed and soup kitchens sprang up. A bread ration was established in January 1917. On 28 June 1917, there was a shortage of potatoes. It became known in the neighborhoods of Amsterdam that there was a ship with potatoes in the [[Prinsengracht]], but these were for the army. In order to feed their families, the working women of the [[Oostelijke Eilanden|Eastern Islands]] and the Czar Peter Neighborhood plundered the ship. According to the Councillor Josephus Jitta, there was no overall shortage of food as the workers had an extra supply of rice provided.

===Blood rebellion===
[[File:Potato_revolt_police_Aardappeloproer_politie_1917.jpg|thumb|300px|Police vs. Civilians during the Riots.]]
In the first week of July of that year, the unrest grew and the workers themselves also saw action. Warehouses and shops were looted. The police were powerless and the army acted. The revolt culminated in a battle on 5 July 1917, in which soldiers opened fire on a crowd that had gathered at the Haarlemmerplein. The revolt was beaten. There were nine dead and 114 people wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aardappeloproer |url=http://amsterdam-eerstewereldoorlog.nl/item/394-2/ |website=Amsterdam en de Eerste Wereldoorlog |publisher=Stadsarchief Amsterdam |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post 1917 food shortages==

The food situation deteriorated further in the last year of the war 1918. Many people lived on the brink of starvation and unemployment rose. The [[Spanish flu]] epidemic hit and killed thousands of people, weakened as they were by starvation. The armistice on 11 November 1918, came just in time for the Netherlands. For the workers another winter of hunger and cold was prevented, as well as an impending revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3207">Prof '''Alexander Mair''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRSE]] DPH (1912–1995) was a Scottish public health expert.

==Life==

He was born in [[Portknockie]] in northern Scotland on 9 September 1912, the son of local herring fisherman, Alexander Mair (1881–1941) and his wife, Jessie Slater. His father worked on the Zulu class trawler "Evangeline".&lt;ref name="tiscali"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/pirie/history/PFWv1-o/p1892.htm|website=myweb.tiscali.co.uk|title=Pirie Family Website|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated locally and left school at the then normal UK age of 14. He worked in the fishing industry (the mainstay of the local community) but was an on-shore clerk overseeing catches in [[Buckie]] rather than being a fisherman.&lt;ref name="mtcserver6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rse.mtcserver6.com/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/mair_alexander.pdf|title=ALEXANDER MAIR OBE, MD(Aberd), FRCPE, FSPH, FFCM|author=Ivor Batchelor|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until the onset of the [[Second World War]] was he inspired to study Medicine, joining [[Aberdeen University]] as a mature student in 1939 and graduating MB ChB in 1942. He then joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and was stationed first in Normandy in the aftermath of the [[D-Day landings]] and later in [[Brussels]], rising to the rank of Captain.

After the war he returned to academia gaining a Diploma in Public Health at Aberdeen then beginning lecturing in Public Health 1948. In 1952 he became Senior Lecturer in Public Health at [[St Andrews University]] and was given his Professorship in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1980. His proposers were [[John McQueen Johnston]], [[Anthony Elliot Ritchie]], [[John Cameron, Lord Cameron]], [[R. M. S. Smellie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1982 and died of a cardiac arrest in [[Broughty Ferry]] on 6 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal obituary August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried with his parents at Portknockie.

The '''American Sexual Health Association''' ('''ASHA''') is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] established in 1914, that cites a mission to improve the health of individuals, families, and communities, with an emphasis on sexual health, as well as a focus on preventing sexually transmitted infections and their harmful consequences. ASHA uses tools such as education, communication, advocacy and policy analysis activities with the intent to heighten public, patient, provider, policymaker and media awareness of STI prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment strategies.
 
==History==
ASHA was born out of the early 20th century [[social hygiene movement]]. At the beginning of the twentieth century venereal disease (VD), or what we now call sexually transmitted diseases or infections (STDs/STIs), was a prevalent concern for social health organizations. Sexuality was not an acceptable topic for polite conversation in Victorian society, and VD largely remained behind a veil of shame. At the same time, however, reports of rising incidence rates for syphilis and gonorrhoea gave cause for serious concern. For example, by one perhaps inflated but widely accepted estimate in 1901, as many as 80 percent of all men in New York City had a gonorrhoea infection at one time or another. Early efforts to eradicate "social diseases" focused on prostitution on one hand, as both a threat to the family as a source of infection, and the threat to public health on the other, with the focus on addressing the problem through both medical and educational means.

In 1913, at a conference in [[Buffalo, New York]], several organizations dedicated to fighting prostitution and venereal disease joined together to form the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA). The association was established to stop the venereal disease epidemic through public education on STIs and working to break down the social stigma attached to VD. In 1914, ASHA established its national headquarters in New York City. Founders and supporters included [[Charles William Eliot|Charles Eliot]], president of Harvard University; [[Jane Addams]] of Chicago's Hull House; Edward Keyes, Jr., M.D.; [[Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn|Dr. Thomas N. Hepburn]], leader of the Connecticut social hygiene movement; Grace Dodge, philanthropist; [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], initial financial contributor; and Dr. William Freeman Snow, Stanford University professor and secretary of the California State Board of Health.
 
===World War I===
ASHA's early worked focused on education and awareness efforts within the armed forces. ASHA worked with the US War Department during World War I when VD occurrences surged among soldiers. Their efforts included educating soldiers about venereal diseases and their transmission and attempting to eliminate prostitution, which was believed to be the primary vehicle for VD transmission among the armed forces.  ASHA was successful in shutting down many of the prostitution rings that traditionally surrounded military bases. Due to its contribution to the war effort, ASHA gained national attention and succeeded in creating public awareness of VD.

===Between the wars===
During the 1920s, ASHA served as a central coordinator for the local or regional committees, doctors, public health officials, and social welfare agencies that were combating sexually transmitted infections. In addition, ASHA published the Journal of Social Hygiene and the Social Hygiene Bulletin, conducted studies on the prevalence of syphilis, undertook surveys on VD, published synopsis of laws concerning prostitution, and supported legislation that required a premarital exam for syphilis. The program also promoted character and sex education as a means of preventing the spread of STIs. The ASHA educational program emphasized preparation for a wholesome family life, avoiding VD, and physical as well as moral fitness. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

ASHA had developed into a mature organization by the 1930s with an effective network of supporting local organizations. ASHA also was involved in cooperative projects with a variety of organizations. In a single year, ASHA collaborated with the Federal Council of Churches and the National Congress of Parents and Teachers to promote sex education programs and materials; provided leadership for efforts by the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection to consider the social hygiene elements of child health; conducted institutes for public health nurses under the auspices of the National Organization of Public Health Nursing; and provided data to the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in preparation for Indian Health Programs. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===World War II===
[[File:SMASH THE PROSTITUTION RACKET - NARA - 515431.jpg|thumb|American Social Health Association [[World War II]] poster]]
During World War II, ASHA fulfilled a role reminiscent of its work during World War I, serving on the VD Coordinating Committee for the US military and working against prostitution. ASHA's efforts contributed to a 50% drop in VD infection rates in the military during the first years of the war. In 1944, the military began using penicillin as a cure for syphilis and by the late 1950s it was believed that syphilis was no longer a serious health threat. As a result, the Journal of Social Hygiene discontinued publication.

===Kinsey era===
The release of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey reports]] on sexual behavior in 1948 and 1954 created national controversy. ASHA played a prominent role in the debate, organizing a national conference to bring together leading authorities in the fields of psychology, statistics, education, medicine, law, religion, anthropology and sociology to exchange views as to the significance of Kinsey's new information. The goal was to look at the information as scientific data instead of pornography. As Walter Clark, ASHA president from 1937 to 1951, commented, "The truth never harms . . . And it seems reasonable to hope that when today's older generation, conditioned against frankness in sex matters, passes away and today's youth takes over tomorrow's world, the truth about sex shall indeed make them free—free of the diseases, the exploitations, the ignorance and superstitions which for ages have burdened and blighted society."

Also in the 1950s, ASHA began to distribute a comprehensive annual questionnaire to health officers across the country. The responses, tabulated by ASHA and analyzed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], were published annually as Today's VD Control Problem, continuing under ASHA auspices until 1975. Today's VD Control Problem provided the statistical basis for testimony before Congress, as ASHA returned year after year to urge adequate federal appropriations for STD control.

===The 1960s and 1970s===
As ASHA began to recognize that the STD issue connected with other issues, it reflected its broader approach in a name change, moving from American Social Hygiene Association to American Social Health Association in 1960. Among the issues of concern identified by ASHA was the link between STDs and drug use. In 1961 ASHA launched a new program that was the first to focus on the prevention of narcotic addiction and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. The agency evaluated existing programs, issued position papers and informational booklets, maintained a clearinghouse, and sponsored four community-based pilot projects. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

By the 1970s, though, additional novel problems led to soaring STD rates, including the sexual revolution, more international travel, gay liberation, birth control for women, and increasing drug use. Scientists were also recognizing more sexually transmitted pathogens, and viral STDs were making an appearance as well, from herpes simplex virus (HSV) to human papilloma virus (HPV). ASHA's public outreach efforts in this era included the creation of the Herpes Resource Center in 1979, the first program in the U.S. for people living with a viral STD. ASHA also established the National VD Hotline, where trained volunteers offers scientifically accurate information and support. ASHA also launched its first modern public awareness campaign, VD is For Everybody.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/ashastd#p/u/2/SN9_J3_9wPc&lt;/ref&gt; Working with the National Advertising Council, ASHA called attention to the alarming increase in the number of STDs by means of radio, television, and print public service announcements.

During the 1980s, ASHA continued to educate the public about sexually transmitted infections, primarily by means of telephone information and referral hot-lines, such as the National STD Hotline and the National AIDS Hotline. ASHA established the latter hotline in 1986, at that time the largest health-related hotline in the world. By the 1990s, the hotline was answering more than 1.5 million calls per year. The association also continued to advocate for public policies to combat STDS and increased funding for research. The identification of the AIDS virus added a new area of concern to the association's fight against sexually transmitted infections.

==ASHA Today==
ASHA continues its mission to improve the health of improving the health of individuals, families and communities with a focus on preventing sexually transmitted diseases and their harmful consequences, and has broadened its efforts into the field of sexual health. Its current programs include:

'''STI Resource Center''', that provides information, materials and referrals to the public who have questions or concerns about sexually transmitted infections. Through its telephone hotline and online message boards, the Center answers questions on such topics as transmission, risk reduction, prevention, testing, and treatment and partner communication.

'''Herpes Resource Center''', founded in 1979, continues to provide information and support through its multiple web pages, message board and publications. The center also offers The Helper, a quarterly journal that discusses the latest in herpes information, research, treatment, testing and patient-advocacy.

'''HPV and Cervical Cancer Prevention Resource Center''', established in 1991, offers information and referrals about the Human Papillomavirus to patients, health care providers, and policy makers. The HPV Resource Center focuses on issues including HPV vaccines, partner communication and cervical cancer screening. The Center also offers a bimonthly electronic journal, HPV News, that covers the latest in HPV research, treatment and testing options, and policy issues. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

'''ASHA's Research division''' conducts numerous research projects among local, regional, and national constituents focusing on a variety of populations and an assortment of health topics including sexually transmitted infections. ASHA's Washington staff works to educate members of Congress and other important voices in health policy about the urgency of research and frontline programs in the STI field. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

'''Advocacy:''' ASHA has maintained a policy office in Washington, DC and has worked in partnership with other organizations in the area of sexual and reproductive health to advocate for proper attention and funding to STD research and programs.

'''National Cervical Cancer Coalition:''' NCCC became an ASHA program in the fall of 2011. Founded as a grass-roots organization in 1996, NCCC supports cervical cancer patients/survivors, families, and caregivers. NCCC has chapters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nccc-online.org/index.php/findchapter |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804011602/http://www.nccc-online.org/index.php/findchapter |archive-date=2014-08-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; across the U.S.

The ''Amoreira Aqueduct'' ({{lang-pt|Aqueduto da Amoreira}}) is a 16th-century [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] (begun in 1537) that spans the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Elvas]], bringing water into the fortified seat.

==History==

By around 1498, the only fountain and source of potable water since the Moorish occupation had been the ''Poço de Alcalá'', alongside the ''Porta do Bispo''.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3217 |title=Aqueducto da Amoreira (IPA.00033609/PT071901130112) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Rosário |last=Gordalina |first2=Maria |last2=Fernandes |year=2008 |accessdate=5 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412171433/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3217 |archivedate=12 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/70195/ |title=Aqueduto da Amoreira |editor=IGESPAR|accessdate=5 April 2015 |date= 9 May 2005 |location=Lisbon, Portugal |publisher=IGESPAR-Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico |first=Catarina |last=Oliveira |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amilcar"&gt;Amílcar Morgado (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; As the well had already begun drying-up, and owing to the difficulty of gathering water from the wells surrounding the town, King D. [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]] authorized a tax (the ''Real de Água'') to fix the ''Poço de Alcalá''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Yet, the attempts did not meet with success, and an idea developed to collect water from Amoreira, some {{convert|8|km|mi}} away.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Consequently, in 1529 the first works to build the aqueduct were begun. In 1537, then King [[John III of Portugal|John III]] intervened by sending architect Francisco de Arruda to Elvas, to make changes to the primitive plan.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"&gt;Jorge Rodrigues and Mário Pereira (1995), p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the lack of funds for such a project, the King then authorized the diversion of monies from fines and sales associated with the sale of municipal lands for the project, including some loans from the children's orphanages in Elves and Estremoz.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

These early problems with the aqueduct's construction, were portents of future problems. Sometime during 1533, the work done by Lourenço Domingues (the receiver for the public works in Elvas, Campo Maior and Olivença) must have been unsatisfactory, for he was discharged on 9 September. Following various diversions of water, the post of ''Visitador do Cano'' (''Seer of Pipe'') was established in 1542.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; A year later, Diogo Mendes was responsible for the maintenance of the aqueduct, receiving 6000 [[Portuguese real|reais]], paid by the town.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, by 1547, the construction was suspended due to a lack of funds, but were re-initiated in 1571.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; But, on 20 March 1558, Queen D. [[Catherine of Portugal|Catherine]] recommended that the town work on the aqueduct. King D. [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] later authorized the application of a levy on the residents of Elvas, considered equivalent to each's income.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Later that year, on 23 August, Sebastian personally inspected the aqueduct and finding the works incomplete, he ordered the Senate (on 29 May 1573) to correct the remaining sections, along with Afonso Álvares.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; The King's successor would have similar problems with this project; in 1579, Cardinal King [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henrique]] solicited the bishops of Elvas to participate monetarily in the aqueduct's construction.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 
 
===Philippian dynasty===
With the Castilian invasion in 1580, priority was given to the city's fortifications and it was decided, if necessary, to drop the project. One of the conditions made by the Portuguese, during the surrender negotiations of the city, was that the Amoreira Aqueduct be complete.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The city looked into new springs in the foothills, sometime around 1602, in order to improve the water pressure/volume.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The aqueduct project was restarted in 1606, with the imposition of a new ''Real de Água'' tax.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, following various stops on the project, on 5 March 1610, the municipal council solicited the King to re-continue the aqueduct's construction, while proposing alterations in the project in order to provide water to the higher settlements of the region.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; King [[Phillip II of Spain|Phillip II]] authorized the continuation of project on 11 July 1610, and sent Diogo Marques Lucas to study the plan in order to improve its efficiency on 26 July. Lucas determined the need to elevate the aqueduct an additional 25 palms in order to better improve water delivery to the ''Largo da Misericórdia''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amilcar/&gt;

The first waters reached into the city gates in 1620, to a provisionary fountain at the Church of Madalena.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; On 23 June 1622, the aqueduct and Fonte da Misericórdia was inaugurated, but, owing to structural problems with the "completed" project, interventions were needed.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; In 1625, it was decided to construct hollowed buttresses, filled in with dirt and loose stone. Ancillary projects began to develop following the completion of the main project, including diversion of water down the ''Rua de São Lourenço'', a lengthy project owing to the rock substrata.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; These projects resulted in the extension of the taxes on 1 August 1627, for another two years, that included the construction of city's fountains.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; By 1628, the aqueduct was successfully fed the Fonte da Misericórdia, Chafariz da Madalena, Chafariz de São Lourenço, Chafariz de São Domingos, Chafariz de São Vicente and the Chafariz da Alameda, and construction of fountains of Biquinha, Cavaleiros and São José were underway.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Independence===
In 1641, King D. [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] authorized the demolition of the aqueduct in order to construct a new fortification.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Martinho Afonso de Melo, Count of São Lourenço, proposed the construction of a cistern, in order that most of the aqueduct could be maintained functioning.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; It was not until 1650 that the huge cistern was built beneath Elvas, under the direction of Nicholas de Langres, allowing for the storage of water capable of providing enough for the entire population for four months, when rationed judiciously.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodrigues/&gt; Two arches of the aqueduct were destroyed following a tempest in 1646, and two years earlier Castilian forces had already destroyed or damaged segments of the vital resource.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Therefore, it came as no surprise that in May 1648 a discussion began on whether destroying the aqueduct was necessary, in order to improve the city's defences.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; In 1652, the Count of Soure ordered the construction of subterranean pipe to feed water the city, thereby maintaining the city's defences (but also resulting the partial loss of the aqueduct).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Three years later, Governor André de Albuquerque Ribafria also requested that that aqueduct be demolished, and that the segments that corresponded with the citadel be converted to subterranean passages.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

During the 1663 Castilian invasions by John of Austria, the aqueduct suffered some damage. In order to remedy its vulnerability, two redoubts were constructed in Outeiro dos Pobres and Outeiro de São Francisco, reinforced by a zone that crossed the two by casements of canon emplacements.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A new plan for the aqueduct was drafted in 1683 by Francisco Álvares Ribeiro, that included {{convert|7790|m|ft}} system. On 30 March 1689, Manuel Moniz was nominated to the position of master-builder for the aqueduct, on the death of Francisco Ferreira (who exercised this post), receiving a stipend of 12$000 reis annually.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1698, there was a rupture that linked the hospital.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

By the beginning of the 18th century water pressure was already much reduced, due to the accumulation of calcium (a problem that persisted until the 19th century).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; A sedimentation arch was constructed at the Borracha spring to alleviate some of these problems. João Fernandes Cordeiro was named master-builder, and on 20 June 1702, Francisco Martins was named "master of pipe" for the Amoreira Aqueduct, following the death of Manuel Moniz, receiving 12$000 reis annually.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1708, protests resulted in damage to the structure. King [[John V of Portugal|John V]] suggested substituting the piping to a fountain system (or inverted siphon system).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, the municipal authority could only decide on reconstructing the arches, since the system was impractical in case of ruptures, requiring opening-up the entire network in case of localizing the problem. Alternately, the structure was reinforced with piers and in 1715, the system was expanded with waters from the ''Poço do Concão'', later nine assorted springs, including one from the Serra do Bispo region.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On 5 June 1727, João Fernandes Cordeiro was confirmed as the new aqueduct master-builder. The system was also expanded in 1733 with the waters from the nine springs situated in the Herdade de Trinta-Alferes, reinforced in 1739 with the exploration of the ''Poço do Gorgulhão'' in 1743.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On 17 March 1745, José Ramalho Rogado took over the position of aqueduct master-builder, responsible for expanding the water supply with the piping to  the ''Poço Seco'' spring. In January 1796, a earthquake destroyed two arches in the Outeiro dos Pobres, which was quickly repaired.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1825, the discovery of new springs in the Herdade de Trinta-Alferes, resulted in the exploration by Lieutenant Francisco de Paulo de Sousa Pegado.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This man later directed new repairs on the aqueduct between 1825 and 1827. Between 26–27 February 1846, a seasonal storm destroyed a buttress.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first municipal azulejos were erected in 1864, and were later supported with alternates dating to 1873.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1870, the aldermen requested that the Cortes provide funding to repair and clean the structure, as well as construct a supplementary canal to facilitate future cleaning. During these motions, it was indicated that calcium buildup in the pipes should be removed every ten years, to remedy these problems.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the 19th century, the exploration of the Herdade dos Vales de Santarém springs was initiated.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 1872 and 1890, the aqueduct underwent important public works to conserve and restore the aqueduct, that included the construction of a secondary pipe and construction of 462 supplementary arches.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; By 1902, the springs were considered impotable, except those at Ruy de Mello and São Lourenço, and continued to feed the aqueduct.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In the 1980s, the aqueduct continued to feed the city of Elves, by way of the cistern, using waters raised from the Trinta-Alferes and Algaravenha springs. Repair and cleaning of the piping occurred in 1995.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Elvas - Aqueduto da Amoreira (4).jpg|thumb|235px|The four registers of the waterway at the extreme height]]
The aqueduct crosses the rural-urban divide, covering the plains across the valley of São Francisco and Rossio, encountering the springs at Fonte da Amoreira (in the Serra do Bispo) and terminating at the Fonte da Misericórdia.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In front of the Elvas portion of the aqueduct is the Municipal Gardens, while to the south is the link to the Convent of São Francisco, protected in the southwest by a ravelin.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The aqueduct has a length of {{convert|7054|m|ft}} from its spring in the Serra do Bispo until the Chafariz do Jardim, and another {{convert|450|m|ft}} to the town fountain.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; Its track includes {{convert|1367|m|ft}} subterranean segments, to a maximum altitude of {{convert|4049|m|ft}} above sea level, while {{convert|1683|m|ft}} include arcade segments.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; From Outeiro de São Francisco is the second canal, which redirects waters to Outeiro dos Pobres, identifiable in the arcade at Rossio.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In total there are 833 arches, with at most four registers at any one time (diminishing size at higher altitudes), supported by rectangular pillars and strengthened by semi-circular and pyramidal buttresses.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; The structure includes the municipal coat-of-arms constructed of marble or azulejo.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; A reservoir is located in Horta de Trinta-Alferes, a rounded arch in the São Gonçalo downtown (Herdade da Serra do Bispo), as well as an arch and tank at the spring of Borracha.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

'''Beating Bowel Cancer''' is the support and campaigning charity for everyone affected by bowel cancer in the UK. The charity provides support and information for bowel cancer patients and their families through the UK's only nurse-led specialist helpline for bowel cancer, their online forum and booklets and fact sheets. The charity also works tirelessly to raise public awareness of bowel cancer and campaign to ensure Governments and health services provide the highest quality care and treatments.

==Mission statement==

The charity's mission statement is as follows:

"We are dedicated to saving lives by working in partnership with individuals, local communities, clinical communities and government to improve public awareness of bowel cancer and to increase the rate of early diagnosis. We help patients access the treatment they need and provide emotional and practical support to improve the lives of everyone affected by bowel cancer."

Beating Bowel Cancer is the secretariat for the National Colorectal Cancer Nurses Network (NCCNN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCCNN summer 2013 RCN|url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/development/communities/rcn_forum_communities/gastro_and_stoma_care/news_stories/nccnn_summer_2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity organises a Patient Day for patient and family once per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beating Bowel Cancer |url=http://www.beatingbowelcancer.org/patient-day-2013 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710110828/http://www.beatingbowelcancer.org/patient-day-2013 |archivedate=10 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], '''[[blood]]''' and other tissues are collected by [[NHS Blood and Transplant]] (NHSBT), which also processes and supplies blood products to hospitals in the country through the Bio Products Laboratory. [[NHSBT Blood Donation]] was previously known as the National Blood Service until it merged with UK Transplant in 2005 to form a [[NHS special health authority]]. Other official blood services in the United Kingdom include the [[Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service]], the [[Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service]] and the [[Welsh Blood Service]].

==Donations==
{{see also|Blood donation}}
The service depends entirely on voluntary donations from the public. Originally, Blood was collected from various donor clinics located over the country. In 1994, the first mobile session was held in Elstree, hosted by the Joely Bear Appeal. Currently, [[Blood donation]] sessions are set up throughout the country and take place in many diverse venues. From village halls, to mobile collection units (known as [[Bloodmobile]]s), and sessions set up companies and organisations so people can donate at work.  Donors are generally required to be fit and healthy, weigh {{convert|50|kg|lb stlb|0}} and be aged between 17 and 60. However, regular (healthy) donors are permitted to donate past the age of 60 as long as they remain healthy. Donors are encouraged to give blood up to three times a year (once every 16 weeks) for women and four times a year (every 12 weeks) for men.[https://www.blood.co.uk/who-can-give-blood/]

===Pre-donation and exceptions===
Prior to each donation, the donor's [[iron]] level is checked to make sure they are not [[anaemic]].  The donor will be required to fill in a questionnaire to provide consent and declare that the donation will be safe (for example, stating that the donor does not have a heart condition), and it is safe to give the donor's blood to someone else.

;Weight
*To give blood donors must weigh over {{convert|50|kg|lb stlb|0}}. For donors who are female, aged under 20 years old, weigh under {{convert|60|kg|lb stlb|0}} and are under {{convert|168|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} height, the blood service will need to confirm their estimated blood volume is over 3500&amp;nbsp;ml.&lt;ref name='BloodFAQ'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blood.co.uk/giving-blood/faqs/index.asp |title=Give Blood - FAQs |publisher=NHS Blood and Transplant |accessdate=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206033717/http://www.blood.co.uk/giving-blood/faqs/index.asp |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;HIV
*Every single blood donation is tested for [[HIV]] (the virus that causes [[AIDS]]) and [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]]. Infected blood is not used in transfusions but tests may not always detect the early stages of viral infection.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blood.co.uk/giving-blood/who-cant-give-blood/ |title=Who Can't Give Blood|publisher=NHS Blood and Transplant |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pregnancy/Travel
*Women should not give blood if they are pregnant or have had a baby in the last six months. People should wait six months after returning from a malarial area before giving blood, and should inform the National Blood Service if they have visited Central or South America at any time.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;

;People who cannot give blood

*People should not give blood if they have donated with less than 12 weeks' interval between donations, or 16 weeks if they are female. If they have a chesty cough, sore throat or active cold sore, are currently taking antibiotics or you have just finished a course within the last seven days or have had any infection in that last two weeks.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;
*If they have had [[hepatitis]] or [[jaundice]] in the last 12 months, or had a [[tattoo]], [[Permanent makeup|semi-permanent make up]] or any cosmetic treatments that involves skin piercing in the last 4 months.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;
*If they have had [[acupuncture]] in the last 4 months, unless this was done within the NHS or by a qualified healthcare professional registered with a statutory body.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;
*If a member of their family (parent, brother, sister or child) has suffered with CJD ([[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]]) or if they have ever received human pituitary extract (which was used in some [[Growth hormone treatment|growth hormone]] or [[Assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatments]] before 1985).&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;
*If they have received blood or think they may have received blood during the course of any medical treatment or procedure anywhere in the world on or after the 1st January 1980.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;

;People who may not be able to give blood:

*People who have had a serious illness or major surgery in the past or are currently on medication, or if they have had complicated dental work. People who have had simple fillings are ok to give blood after 24 hours, as are simple extractions after 7 days.
*People who have been in contact with an infectious disease or have been given certain immunisations in the last four weeks, as well as people presently on a hospital waiting list or undergoing medical tests.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;

;People who can never give blood

*People who have ever had [[syphilis]], HTLV ([[Human T-lymphotropic virus]]), [[HIV]] or [[Hepatitis C]], worked as a prostitute, or have ever injected themselves with drugs.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;

;People should not give blood for 3 months after sex with&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/23/gay-men-blood-donation-three-months-after-sex]&lt;/ref&gt;:

*A man (if they are male). 
*Men who have had anal or oral sex with another man (with or without a condom) are deferred from blood donation for 3 months. 
*A man who has had sex with another man (if you're a female). 
*A prostitute.  
*Anyone who has ever injected themselves with drugs. 
*Anyone with haemophilia or a related blood clotting disorder who has received clotting factor concentrates.
*Anyone of any race who has been sexually active in parts of the world where AIDS/HIV is very common.&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;

Note: This 3 month deferral period only applies to England, Wales and Scotland - not Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland still has a 12 month ban in place for these groups.

===Donating blood===
Once the preliminary checks are complete, the donor lies on a bed and a [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[hypodermic needle]] connected to a bag is inserted into a [[vein]] in their inner [[elbow]].  The donation usually lasts between five and 10 minutes, during which {{convert|470|mL|impoz}} of [[whole blood]] is given.

===Post-donation===
[[File:Blooddonor after.png|thumb|right|The dressing applied to a donor's arm after giving blood]]
Following the donation (and subsequent dressing of the wound), donors are invited to refreshments.  This period serves two vital purposes: to replace certain lost fluids{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}, and to allow staff to monitor the donor's wellbeing.

Donations can also be taken by machines called cell separators, usually in larger blood donation centres located in city centres. These machines use a process called [[apheresis]] to collect either [[blood plasma]] only, or plasma and [[platelets]], the other blood cells being returned to the patient. Platelets are the tiny fragments of cells in the blood which help it to clot and so stop bleeding, and are used in the treatment of [[cancer]] and [[leukaemia]]. A constant supply  is vital because platelets only last five days once collected. People who give plasma and/or platelets can donate every two weeks, and each donation usually gives two or three adult doses. One adult dose of platelets would otherwise require four whole blood donations.

===Blood Component donations===
Blood is made in the bone marrow. It is composed of red blood cells, platelets, plasma and white blood cells, collectively referred to as blood components. Donations given at regular blood donation sessions are referred to as "Whole Blood". 
Platelets are very small cells. They work with the clotting factors in plasma to form a mesh "plug" to stop or prevent bleeding. Plasma is the fluid part of the blood. It contains protein, salts and clotting factors. White cells fight harmful bacteria and help prevent infection. Red cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.

Most platelet donations are given to patients who are unable to make enough platelets in their bone marrow. For example, patients with leukaemia or other cancers may have too few platelets as the result of their disease or treatment. Also after major surgery or extensive injury, patients may need platelet transfusions to replace those lost through bleeding. Platelets are often life-saving and special in that they can help up to 3 adults or even 12 children. As platelets can only be stored for a few days, regular and frequent donors are in great demand and that is why platelet donors are asked to attend at least 8 - 10 times per year.

==Controversy==
{{main|MSM blood donor controversy}}
The service had come under criticism for a long implemented policy of banning [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) from ever being blood donors. University students in both [[England]] and [[Scotland]] protested against the ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-423.html|title=Students protest gay donor ban|work=[[Pink News]]|date=6 February 2006|accessdate= 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4743020.stm|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date= 23 February 2006|title=Students want gay blood rethink|accessdate= 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[University of Birmingham]]'s Guild of Students banned the National Blood Service from setting up a recruitment stall during Freshers' week.

The policy was changed in 2011 to prevent MSMs from donating for 12 months after having anal or oral sex with another man (with or without a condom). This also applied to women who have had sex with a MSMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blood.co.uk/who-can-give-blood/men-who-have-sex-with-men/|title=Men who have sex with men|work=NHS Blood Donation|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017 the referral period on MSMs was reduced to 3 months for both MSMs and women who have sex with them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/23/gay-men-blood-donation-three-months-after-sex]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='WhoCantGiveBlood'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">'''Brent Dean Robbins''' is Associate Professor of [[psychology]] at [[Point Park University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. His areas of research include grief, humor, self-consciousness, spirituality/religion, death anxiety, and the medicalization of the body. He is Editor-in-Chief and founder of ''Janus Head: Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature, Continental Philosophy, Phenomenological Psychology, and the Arts'', and is a Board member for a number of journals, including ''[[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]]'', the ''International Journal of Existential Psychology and Psychotherapy'', ''PsyCRITIQUES'', and ''Terrorism Research''. Robbins is a co-editor of ''The Legacy of [[R.D. Laing]]'', published by Trivium Press. Robbins is a recipient of the Harmi Carari Early Career Award, from the [[Society for Humanistic Psychology]]. He holds a doctorate in [[clinical psychology]] from [[Duquesne University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipjp.org/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=64%3Abrent-dean-robbins&amp;catid=4%3Aeditorialboard&amp;Itemid=14 |title=Brent Dean Robbins  |author= |date= |work=Janus Head Editorial Board }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pointpark.academia.edu/BrentRobbins/CurriculumVitae |title=Brent Robbins CV |author= |date= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Robbins co-authored an open letter from the Society for Humanistic Psychology regarding the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''{{'}}s fifth edition, the [[DSM-5]]. The letter has been endorsed by thirteen other [[American Psychological Association]] divisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointpark.edu/NewsArtsSciences.aspx?id=467 |title=Professor co-authors letter about America's mental health manual |author= |date=December 12, 2011 |work=Point Park University |access-date=2012-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329184708/http://www.pointpark.edu/NewsArtsSciences.aspx?id=467# |archive-date=2012-03-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been signed as a petition by over 15,000 people. In a recent ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article about the debate over the DSM-5, Robbins noted that, under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/26/MNJJ1M3DFK.DTL |title=

The '''Bristol heart scandal''' occurred in [[England]] during the 1990s. At the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]], babies died at high rates after cardiac surgery. An inquiry found "staff shortages, a lack of leadership, [a] ... unit ... 'simply not up to the task' ... 'an old boy's culture' among doctors, a lax approach to safety, secrecy about doctors' performance and a lack of monitoring by management".&lt;ref name="BHS Telegraph"&gt;Rebecca Smith (29 July 2010) "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7914795/Bristol-heart-scandal.html Bristol heart scandal]" ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. Accessed 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal resulted in cardiac surgeons leading efforts to publish more data on the performance of doctors and hospitals.&lt;ref name="BHS Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith R |title=All changed, changed utterly.

An investigation chaired by [[Ian Kennedy (lawyer)|Professor Ian Kennedy]] QC was set up in 1998. It reported in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/about/whos_who/index.htm | title=Who's who | publisher=The Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090811143745/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/about/whos_who/index.htm | archivedate=11 August 2009 | accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that paediatric cardiac surgery services at Bristol were "simply not up to the task", because of shortages of key surgeons and nurses, and a lack of leadership, accountability, and teamwork. In fact the unit, which had “not been up to the task” in 5 years (1991-1995) had left 34 children under one year of age dead, who would have survived in other NHS units (Ref ). Overall 170 children died in the Bristol unit between 1986 – 1995 who would have survived in other NHS hospitals as estimated by Laurence Vick, the lawyer most closely involved in the Bristol Scandal (Ref https://www.enablelaw.com/news/published-articles/loneliness-nhs-whistleblower/). Sadly the same expert estimates that 25-30 children suffered permanent brain damage after cardiac surgery by the Bristol surgeons over the same 10 year time span (Ref https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=9d6ebc53-0371-48cf-b2bd-0324f800f8da).      

The [[NHS Plan 2000]] published a year earlier, included the establishment of the [[Commission for Health Improvement]], which was intended to tackle such problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bristol Royal infirmary inquiry: the issue explained |first=Patrick |last=Butler |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/jan/17/5 |accessdate=1 October 2016 |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, the mortality rate within 30 days of a child's heart operation had fallen from 4.3% in 2000 to 2.6%.  Plans to reduce the number of centres performing children's heart surgery have been opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child heart surgery deaths in UK 'halved'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32162803|accessdate=1 September 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report to [[NHS England]] in July 2015 proposed a “three tier” model for all hospitals providing congenital heart disease care. It suggested that they would work within “regional, multi-centre networks, bringing together foetal, children’s and adult services” and noted that since 2001 there “have been subsequent reviews each making a series of recommendations, but no coordinated programme of change, and concerns have remained”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England review calls for shake-up of children's heart surgery|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/nhs-england-review-calls-for-shake-up-of-childrens-heart-surgery/5088105.article#.Vef-b5ZIgYA|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''condom machine''' is a [[vending machine]] for the sale of [[condom]]s.  Condom machines are often placed in public toilets, subway stations, railway stations and airports as a [[public health]] measure to promote [[safe sex]].  Many pharmacies also keep one outside, for after-hours access.  Rare examples exist that dispense [[female condom]]s.&lt;ref name=fem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebody.com/cdc/news_updates_archive/mar14_02/france_condoms.html|title = First Female Condom Machine Is Launched in France|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Condom vending machines were introduced in 1928 by [[Julius Fromm]]'s company.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Popular culture==
In the novel ''[[Porterhouse Blue]]'', conflict over an attempt to introduce such a device to a Cambridge college, is one of the factors that leads to murder.

==Safety Advice==
According to the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], when using condoms from a machine, one should check the [[Shelf life|expiration date]], that the condoms are [[latex]] and labelled for disease prevention, and that the machine is not exposed to direct sunlight or other source of extreme temperatures.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/condom.html|title = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Dunn''' is a fictional character and the main [[protagonist]] in the [[Unbreakable (film series)|''Unbreakable'' film series]], portrayed by American actor [[Bruce Willis]]. Dunn is a former college football prodigy and presently a security guard who discovers he has superhuman abilities. He is the protagonist in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', a minor cameo character in ''[[Split (2016 American film)|Split]]'', and will return in ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'' as the main protagonist.

==Fictional Character Biography==
David Dunn was a football player until an auto car accident occurred. Sometime after the accident, he went off to marry Audrey who together have a son named Joseph.

In the present, David is a security guard looking for a new job. On his way home from an interview in New York, he gets involved in another accident, this time in a train explosion, which he became the only unharmed sole survivor. He is stalked by comic book store and art gallery owner Elijah Price who contacts him to explain his unique abilities but David challenges him with the theory by using a childhood incident when he almost drowned with Elijah further stating that water is his weakness. He later believes that he is a superhero which Joseph convinces him to be later on. Later that day, David begins to train using a 350 pound bench press. David uses one his abilities; one where he can see visions of crimes when people bump into him, at a train station. He finds a janitor who David follows home where he is holding children hostage. David rescues the family and is claimed a "Superhero" in the papers the following day which he shows to Joseph as a secret. David attends an exhibition at Elijah's art gallery where he meets Elijah's mother. Elijah calls David to the back of his room where he forces his hand on Elijah which visions on him show Elijah conducting the train explosion. David calls police to arrest Elijah, who is taken to an institution for the criminally insane. 

In 2016, David now has a new job. He visits a coffee shop where a woman asks about a man which David realises she was talking about Elijah, who had taken on his childhood nickname "Mr. Glass". 

==Development==
When [[M. Night Shyamalan]] conceived the idea for ''Unbreakable'', the outline had a comic book's traditional three-part structure (the superhero's "birth", his struggles against general evil-doers, and the hero's ultimate battle against the "archenemy"). However, he found the [[origin story]] most interesting, and chose to write ''Unbreakable'' as one. Willis became attached while shooting ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', also directed by Shyamalan.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;[[M. Night Shyamalan]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Barry Mendel]], [[Sam Mercer]], [[Eduardo Serra]], [[James Newton Howard]], ''The Making of Unbreakable'', 2001, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in films==
===''Unbreakable''===
{{main article|Unbreakable (film)}}
''Unbreakable'' was first released in November 2000. In the film, Dunn is a security guard who discovers he has supernatural abilities, with superhuman levels of strength, stamina, and invulnerability, as well as an extrasensory ability to see the crimes people have committed by touching them. Throughout the film, he is encouraged by Elijah Price, also known as "Mr. Glass" ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) to become a superhero. Price, whose bones break easily because of a disease, develops a theory that if there is an extreme fragility there must be an "unbreakable" human in existence. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invaded a family home, killed the parents and is holding the children captive. David follows the janitor to the victims' house and frees the children, but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off a balcony into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns (since he cannot swim), but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. At the end of the film, through his abilities, Dunn senses that Elijah orchestrated the train crash he had been in previously and countless other disasters that have resulted in massive losses of life, in an attempt to find David. His justification for this seemingly is claiming the purpose of his life and condition was to be David's archenemy. Dunn turns Price in to authorities, and Price is arrested for murder and terrorism and later committed to an institution for the criminally insane.

===''Split''===
{{main article|Split (2016 American film)}}
In a final reveal in the 2016 film ''Split'', Dunn appears in a cameo role, revealing that the film takes place in the same universe as ''Unbreakable''.&lt;ref name=THR&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 22, 2017|author=Couch, Aaron|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/split-movie-ending-explained-unbreakable-2-bruce-willis-planned-966669|title='Split': M. Night Shyamalan Explains an Ending Years in the Making}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While sitting in a diner, Dunn and several other patrons listen to the media coverage of the crimes committed by [[Kevin Wendell Crumb]], a man who has been nicknamed "The Horde". The patron sitting next to Dunn notes the resemblance between "The Horde" and a wheelchair-bound criminal who was arrested 15 years prior. When she struggles to remember the man's name, Dunn tells her it was "Mr. Glass".&lt;ref name=THR/&gt;

===''Glass''===
{{main article|Glass (2019 film)}}
Shyamalan expressed hope for a third installment following ''Split'', saying, "I hope [a third ''Unbreakable'' film happens]. The answer is yes. I'm just such a wimp sometimes. I don't know what's going to happen when I go off in my room, a week after this film opens, to write the script. But I'm going to start writing. [I have] a really robust outline, which is pretty intricate. But now the standards for my outlines are higher. I need to know I've won already. I'm almost there but I'm not quite there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/20/split-m-night-shyamalan-ending-interview/?xid=entertainment-weekly_socialflow_twitter |title=Split spoiler: M.

Jackson]], [[Anya Taylor-Joy]], and [[James McAvoy]] reprising their respective roles in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1651749/the-unbreakable-and-split-crossover-movie-reveals-official-title-and-four-stars|title=The Unbreakable And Split Crossover Movie Reveals Official Title And Four Stars|author=Eric Eisenberg|date=April 26, 2017|website=Cinemablend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Willis received critical praise for his performance as Dunn in ''Unbreakable''. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] believed that Willis' "subtle acting" was positively different from the actor's usual work in "brainless action movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Roger Ebert | title = Unbreakable | url =http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20001122/REVIEWS/11220302/1023 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 2000-11-22 | accessdate = 2008-12-20 | authorlink = Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quentin Tarantino]], who directed Willis in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', has also praised his performance in ''Unbreakable'', saying he considers it his best work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Tarantino's Top 20|url=http://www.spike.com/video/tarantinos-top-20/3228451|publisher=[[Spike (TV network)|Spike]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dietary exposure assessments''' involve the evaluation of dietary consumption and chemical residue data while taking into consideration additional factors that may affect a specified population of interest or sensitive population.&lt;ref name = "Baker"&gt;Baker S., Driver J., McCallum D.B. 2001. Residential Exposure Assessment: A Sourcebook. Kulwer Academic/Plenum Publishers: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of conducting a dietary exposure assessment involves the determination of the chemical residues on a particular food or foods and the calculation of the dietary exposure to these chemicals based on consumption data for the specified food or foods.&lt;ref name = "Boisrobert"&gt;Boisrobert C., Stepanovic., Oh S., Lelieveld H. 2009. Ensuring Global Food Safety: Exploring Global Harmonization. Academic Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; In the most simplified form, a dietary exposure assessment can be summarized with the following calculation:

* Dietary exposure = food consumption X food chemical concentration
 
The purpose of calculating dietary exposure to a given chemical or contaminant is so the estimated dietary exposure can be compared to a relevant health standard such as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), the acute reference dose (ARfD) or [[reference dose]] (RfD), or a level known to cause adverse effects in animal or human health studies.&lt;ref name="Boisrobert"/&gt; From this comparison, one can begin to assess the risk of adverse effects from a chemical or contaminant due to dietary exposure.

Quantifying dietary exposure most often involves the use of models. Dietary exposure models vary in complexity depending on the tier, or level of detail of the assessment in which they are utilized. Lower tier models may be [[deterministic]] and use single point estimates for inputs whereas higher tier models may be more [[stochastic]], utilizing probabilistic  inputs. Simple dietary exposure models calculate dietary intake of the chemical of concern as the product of the mass of the food item consumed during the specified time period and the average concentration of the contaminant in the item.&lt;ref name = "who 2005"&gt;WHO. 2005. Principles of characterizing and applying human exposure models.&lt;/ref&gt; This basic approach is also used in more complex models; however, the contributions of various food items and types are summed as inputs.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; Exposure model outputs can be expressed as a single point estimates or as a probability distribution.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; In general, the more robust and extensive the input data, the more accurate the estimate of exposure.&lt;ref name="Boisrobert"/&gt;

Modeling dietary exposure is important to support dietary risk assessments. Validated dietary exposure models can be used in total ingestion studies which focus on the level of exposure to a contaminant from all food sources and they can also be used in aggregate exposure models which may include exposure to a chemical or contaminant through additional means of exposure such as [[inhalation]] and [[dermal]] or skin contact exposure.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; In addition, dietary exposure models are useful for identifying at risk populations and potential exposure “hot-spots”.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; For government agencies, modeling dietary exposure is especially useful in estimating possible exposure to a chemical during a pre-market review.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; An example of such review would the evaluation of a new pesticide by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine if it is safe for use or to determine regulations to control such use.

== Components of a Dietary Exposure Assessment ==

=== Consumption data ===

In order to assess dietary exposure, it is necessary to understand the dietary consumption of the population being assessed. One must understand the diet of the population of interest, including the quantity and types of foods consumed, in order to determine the exposure to a chemical via the diet. Consumption data for a population of interest can be generated through various types of consumption surveys or it may be available in databases maintained by various government agencies and world organizations. These consumption surveys and databases are discussed in the following sections.

==== Consumption surveys ====

Food consumption surveys are conducted by government agencies and world organization in order to maintain their respective databases. These consumption surveys are also conducted independently to generate data for specific assessment needs. Different types of surveys are used to generate consumption data. It is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses associated with the different types of surveys in order to choose the appropriate survey and interpret existing survey data properly.

===== Food supply surveys =====

Food supply surveys, also known as food balance sheets or food disappearance data are conducted countrywide by almost every country.&lt;ref name = "Krieger 2001"&gt;Krieger R. 2001. Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology. Academic Press: San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; These surveys provide data on food availability and disappearance rather than actual food consumption.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; This information does allow for the indirect estimation of the foods consumed by the country’s population but does so as an overall average consumption and does not account for consumption variation within the population.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; Food supply surveys do not take into account food waste or processing but they do allow for assessments at the international level using comparable data.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; Food supply data is generated from the following equation:

*Food availability = (food production + imports + beginning inventory) – (exports + ending inventory + non-food uses)&lt;ref name = "Burdock"&gt;Burcock G.A. 1997. Encyclopedia of Food and Color Additives. Vol 1. CRC Press, Inc. Boca Raton, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Then the mean per capita availability of a particular food of interest is calculated by dividing the “food availability” by the total population.&lt;ref name="Burdock"/&gt;
In the United States food supply data is generated by the USDA Economic Research Service. The FAO and WHO collect food supply data for countries all over the world and in Europe food supply surveys are conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Statistical Office of the European Communities.&lt;ref name="Burdock"/&gt;

===== Household inventory surveys =====

Household inventories account for what food is available in the household.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; Surveys may include: what food enters the household and where they were purchased, grown or obtained; what foods were used; how they were used; and who used them.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; Quantities of food are often inventoried as well.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt;

===== Household use surveys =====

Household use survey methods typically include food accounts, inventories, and list recalls which are used to account for all food used in the household during a survey period.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; Limitations of household use surveys are that they do not include food consumed outside of the household, food waste is often not accounted for and consumption by different subpopulations within the household cannot be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt;

===== Individual consumer surveys =====

Individual consumption studies provide data at the individual consumer level.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; These surveys can be retrospective, prospective, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; The most commonly used surveys are retrospective food recall studies or prospective food record studies.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2001"/&gt; Individual consumption surveys obtain diaries from a population-based probability sample of respondents who report detailed information of their food consumption by type.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt;

==== Consumption Databases ====

Food consumption databases are available through various government agencies and international organizations. Utilization of consumption databases is useful when it is not possible or not desired to generate new consumption data for an assessment. Choosing the appropriate database is important in order to accurately assess the consumption of the target population being evaluated.

===== USDA Food Availability Data System =====

The [http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-(per-capita)-data-system/food-availability-documentation.aspx#.UnBOLHQo4eE USDA Food Availability Data System] is one of the primary databases tracking consumption in the United States. The data in this database reflects the amount of food available for human consumption in the United States and is the only source of time series data on U.S. food availability in the country.&lt;ref name = "USDA ERS"&gt;USDA ERS. 2013. Food availability (per capita) data system: Food Availability Documentation. http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-(per-capita)-data-system/food-availability-documentation.aspx#.Um1iQHQo5es.&lt;/ref&gt; This database takes regularly consumed foods and aggregates them into approximately 800 core foods with similar raw agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; Converting these regularly consumed foods into raw agricultural commodities allows for easier cross referencing with chemical residue databases.

===== WHO GEMS/Food Database =====

The [[World Health Organization]] implements the Global Environment Monitoring System – Food Contamination Monitoring and Assessment Program, or [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/chem/gems/en/ GEMS/FOOD] which informs governments, institutions and the public on levels and trends of contaminants in food, their contribution to total human health exposure and the significance with regard to public health.&lt;ref name = "who 2013"&gt;WHO. 2013. Global Monitoring System – Food Contamination Monitoring and Assessment Program. http://www.who.int/foodsafety/chem/gems/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Data includes per capita food consumption with diets based on the per capita data compiled by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] which provides statistics on a country’s annual food production, imports and exports found in the [http://faostat.fao.org/site/291/default.aspx FAOSTAT] database.&lt;ref name="who 2013"/&gt; This database also includes individual food consumption data based on national surveys and a database of the level of chemicals in raw food commodities as well as in food as consumed by final consumer.&lt;ref name="who 2013"/&gt;

=== Chemical residues ===

In order to quantify the level of dietary exposure to a chemical residue, the level of the residue of interest within a particular food of interest or the whole food supply must be estimated. It is important to understand that each source of chemical residue data has a unique bias or limitation such as geographical limitation, limited number of commodities, analytical method limitations or sample size limitations.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt;

==== Types of residues ====

There is an extensive range of the types of residues evaluated in dietary exposure assessment. These include naturally occurring chemicals, intentionally applied chemicals, and inadvertently applied chemicals. Some examples of chemicals include [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s or other chemicals used for agricultural purposes. These chemical residues may be found as a result of intentional application or from inadvertent application when wind or water carries them away from the source of application. Other residues may be antibiotics, [[heavy metals]] such as lead, or naturally occurring toxins such as [[mycotoxin]]s, [[phycotoxin]]s and [[phytotoxin]]s.

==== Chemical Residue Databases ====

Although chemical residue data can be generated independently for specific research or assessment needs, primary sources for chemical residue data are various databases maintained by government agencies. These databases typically contain data for residues found on raw agricultural commodities which is collected during routine monitoring and enforcement.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt;

===== FDA Total Diet Study =====

The [http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm FDA Total Diet Study] (also referred to as the market basket study)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt; determines levels of various contaminants such as pesticide residues, industrial chemicals, toxic and nutrient elements and other nutrients in foods. The foods analyzed are purchased at the retail level and prepared as they would be consumed prior to analysis so that the analytical results are indicative of realistic estimates of dietary intake.&lt;ref name = "fda 2013"&gt;FDA. 2013. Total Diet Study. http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/TotalDietStudy/default.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete overview of FDA Total Diet Study and data from 1991 to present can be found be found on the FDA’s website which is linked above.

===== USDA Pesticide Data Program =====

A database containing pesticide residue data at the raw agricultural commodity level is the USDA Pesticide Data Program [http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateC&amp;navID=&amp;rightNav1=&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=ScienceandLaboratories&amp;page=PesticideDataProgram&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=pestcddataprg USDA Pesticide Data Program](PDP). The USDA initiated the PDP in 1991 to test commodities in the U.S food supply for pesticide residues. Since the passage of the [[Food Quality Protection Act]] (FQPA), one of the focuses of the PDP has been testing foods that are most likely consumed by infants and children.&lt;ref name = "USDA 2013"&gt;USDA AMS. 2013. USDA Release 2011 Annual Summary for Pesticide Data Program Release Report confirms that U.S food does not pose a safety concern based upon pesticide residues. www.ams.usda.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The monitoring program is run by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) which partners with state agencies to collect and analyze pesticide residue data.&lt;ref name="USDA 2013"/&gt; The EPA uses this data to enhance its programs for food safety and evaluate dietary exposure to pesticides.&lt;ref name="USDA 2013"/&gt;

=== Supplemental information ===

In addition to dietary consumption data and chemical residue data, dietary exposure assessments often need to consider other real world factors that may affect the level of exposure or a corresponding adverse effect for a particular population. A couple of the most common examples of supplemental information are the evaluation of any sensitive populations that fall within the scope of the assessment and the evaluation of the point at which residue data is collected compared to how foods are consumed. These two factors are discussed in the following sections.

==== Sensitive populations ====

Exposure assessments must also take into consideration sensitive subgroups of the population such as infants, children, nursing women and the elderly who may be more susceptible to adverse health effects of exposure.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; A sensitive population could also be one in which the exposure level is much greater than the average for reasons such as geography, culture, or traditional diets. When characterizing exposure, it is necessary to evaluate it in the context of these more susceptible populations as well as the general public.

==== Raw agricultural commodities compared to food as consumed ====

Residue data is often collected on raw agricultural commodities at the time of harvest which is not necessarily representative or the residue levels present at the time of consumption. The processing and preparation of commodities is subject to increase or decrease the level of residues at the time of consumption. For example, dehydration of a product may increase the concentration of antibiotic residue whereas washing of produce may reduce the concentration of a pesticide residue. Since chemical residue data is often only available at the raw agricultural commodity level and consumption data is often available for foods as consumed, it is necessary to convert between foods as consumed and raw agricultural commodities. This can be completed with custom models or with national databases.

===== USDA Food Intakes Converted to Retail Commodities =====

The [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=21993 USDA Food Intakes Converted to Retail Commodities Database]  converts foods consumed in national dietary surveys to retail-level commodities. The databases were developed by USDA Agricultural Research Service and Economic Research Service from six dietary surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008.&lt;ref name = "USDA ARS"&gt;USDA ARS. 2013. Food intakes converted to retail commodities. http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=21993.&lt;/ref&gt; Foods from these surveys are converted into 65 retail-level commodities grouped into eight major categories.&lt;ref name="USDA ARS"/&gt;

== Dietary Exposure Model Examples ==

Dietary exposure assessments are often completed using models to simulate exposure. Once dietary consumption data, chemical residue data and any additional supplemental information has been compiled, one can utilize the data to model the dietary exposure of the population of interest to the chemical of interest. Most commonly, computer models are used to combine dietary intake and residue data.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; These models can be designed specifically for an intended application or there are standard models available that can be used for dietary exposure assessments. Two existing models are detailed in the following sections.

=== Dietary Exposure Potential Model (DEPM) ===

[http://www.epa.gov/microbes/depm.html DEPM] is an EPA dietary exposure model.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; The DEPM database system contains numerous national, government-sponsored food intake surveys and chemical residue data from monitoring programs.&lt;ref name = "Krieger 2010"&gt;Krieger R. 2010. Hayes’ Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology Volume 1. Third edition. Academic Press: Burlington, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, consumption is expressed in terms 11 food groups containing 800 core foods which were selected to allow matching between food consumption and chemical residue data.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt; These 800 core food items were established from mean values of consumption of over 6,700 foods commonly identified in food surveys.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt; This model utilizes per capita food consumption rates for these 800 core foods for the population in the USA and also for roughly 24 subpopulations defined by different demographic factors such as gender, age, and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; A critical component of the DEPM model is the recipes which convert food as consumed to the raw agricultural commodities for which the chemical residue data is collected.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt; The residue database contains average values of residues for more than 350 pesticides and environmental contaminants.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt;

The model is run by selecting a food consumption database, a chemical residue database and a population.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; Based on these selections the model output is the average daily intake of a chemical for an individual with the average diet for the selected population.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; A diet can be specified based on selecting core foods then that diet can be matched with residue data and used to estimate exposure.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt;

=== Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model (DEEM) ===

[http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/2004/april/deemmanual.pdf DEEM] is a computer based model developed by Novigen Sciences, Inc. that estimates dietary intake of chemical residues and provides output including dietary exposure estimates for different time ranges for populations or for individuals.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt; This model converts food consumed to raw agricultural commodities using the [http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/docs.htm?docid=14514 USDA-EPA Food Commodity Intake Database] recipes.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt; DEEM utilizes [[Monte Carlo analysis]] to provide probabilistic assessments of dietary pesticide exposure.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt; The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs uses DEEM for exposure and risk assessments.&lt;ref name="who 2005"/&gt;
The DEEM can be used for cumulative exposure analysis when multiple chemicals on multiple foods must be evaluated for a total exposure assessment.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt; Also, DEEM software can be used with Calendex which is a cumulative aggregate exposure assessment software used to combine dietary and non-dietary or residential exposures.&lt;ref name="Krieger 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Dusty-dirty PC.jpg|thumb|The inside of this computer has accumulated a lot of dust and has become dirty.]]
'''Dirt''' is unclean matter, especially when in contact with a person's clothes, skin or possessions. In such case they are said to become '''dirty'''.  Common types of dirt include:
* [[Soil]]: the mix of clay, sand, and humus which lies on top of bedrock
* [[Dust]]: a general powder of organic or mineral matter
* [[wikt:filth|Filth]]: foul matter such as [[excrement]]
* [[wikt:grime|Grime]]: a black, ingrained dust such as [[soot]]

==Exhibitions and studies==
A season of artworks and exhibits on the theme of dirt was sponsored by the [[Wellcome Trust]] in 2011.  The centrepiece was an exhibition at the [[Wellcome Collection]] showing pictures and histories of notable dirt such as the great dust heaps at [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] in the 19th century and the [[Fresh Kills Landfill|Fresh Kills]] landfill which was once the world's largest landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/8390859/Dirt-the-Filthy-Reality-of-Everyday-Life-Welcome-Collection.html |title=Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life, Welcome Collection |date=23 March 2011 |journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Brian Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleaning==
When things are dirty they are usually [[Housekeeping|cleaned]] with solutions like [[hard surface cleaner]] and other chemicals solutions; much domestic activity is for this purpose — [[washing]], [[broom|sweeping]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSEDkuksOI8C |title=Dirt: Commonly found in Minecraft: Pocket Edition.  |author=Notch Persson |isbn= 9781580052610 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a commercial setting, a dirty appearance gives a bad impression. An example of such a place is a restaurant. The dirt in such cases may be classified as temporary, permanent, and deliberate.  Temporary dirt is streaks and detritus that may be removed by ordinary daily cleaning.  Permanent dirt is ingrained stains or physical damage to an object, which require major renovation to remove.  Deliberate dirt is that which results from design decisions such as decor in dirty orange or grunge styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WuPh5C9QpQC&amp;pg=PA115 |year=2003 |title=Expectations and the Food Industry |isbn=9780306477096 |author=John B. Hutchings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal==
As cities developed, arrangements were made for the disposal of trash through the use of waste management services. In the United Kingdom, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required households to place their refuse into a container which could be moved so that it could be carted away.  This was the first legal creation of the [[dustbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Environmental Pollution and Awareness in the 21st Century |author=V.K. Prabhakar |page=10 |isbn=9788126106516 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Modern society is now thought to be more hygienic.  Lack of contact with [[microorganism]]s in dirt when growing up is hypothesised to be the cause of the epidemic of [[allergy|allergies]] such as [[asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8373690.stm |title=Dirt can be good for children, say scientists |publisher=BBC |date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The human [[immune system]] requires activation and exercise in order to function properly and exposure to dirt may achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4qRXShukoYC |title=Why Dirt Is Good: 5 Ways to Make Germs Your Friends |author=Mary Ruebush |isbn=9781427798046 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the presence of [[staphylococcus]] bacteria on the surface of the skin regulates the [[inflammation]] which results from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Lai |url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.2062.html |journal=Nature Medicine |first1=Y |last2=Di Nardo |first2=A |last3=Nakatsuji |first3=T |last4=Leichtle |first4=A |last5=Yang |first5=Y |last6=Cogen |first6=AL |last7=Wu |first7=ZR |last8=Hooper |first8=LV |last9=Schmidt |first9=RR |title=Commensal bacteria regulate Toll-like receptor 3–dependent inflammation after skin injury |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1377–82 |publisher=Nature Medicine |date=22 November 2009 |pmid=19966777 |pmc=2880863 |doi=10.1038/nm.2062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when no visible dirt is present, contamination by microorganisms, especially [[pathogen]]s, can still cause an object or location to be considered dirty. For example,  [[computer keyboard]]s are especially dirty as they contain on average 70 times more [[microbe]]s than a [[lavatory seat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15108662 |publisher=[[The Economist]] |title=The joy of dirt |date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People and animals may [[geophagia|eat dirt]].  This is thought to be caused by [[mineral deficiency]] and so the condition is commonly seen in [[Pica (disorder)|pregnant women]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Neurosis==
People may become obsessed by dirt and engage in fantasies and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|compulsive behaviour]] about it, such as making and consuming mud pies and pastries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.006.0388a |title=The Fantasy of Dirt |author=Lawrence S. Kubie |journal=The Psychoanalytical Quarterly |volume=6 |pages=388–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The source of such thinking may be genetic, as the emotion of [[disgust]] is common and the location for this activity in the brain has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |volume=44 |issue=1 |year=2001 |pmid=11253302|doi=10.1353/pbm.2001.0001 |author=Valerie Curtis, Adam Biran |title=Dirt, Disgust, and Disease: Is Hygiene in Our Genes?|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |pages=17–31|citeseerx=10.1.1.324.760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distraction''' is the process of diverting the [[attention]] of an individual or group from a desired area of focus and thereby blocking or diminishing the reception of desired information. Distraction is caused by: the lack of ability to pay attention; lack of interest in the object of attention; or the great intensity, novelty or attractiveness of something other than the object of attention. Distractions come from both external sources, and internal sources. External distractions include factors such as visual triggers, social interactions, music, text messages, and phone calls. There are also internal distractions such as hunger, fatigue, illness, worrying, and daydreaming. Both external and internal distractions contribute to the interference of focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Executive Learning: Successful Strategies for College Reading and Studying|last = Post|first = Sean|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages = |last2 = Schumm|first2 = Jeanne Shay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the car ==
[[Distracted driving]] is a dangerous threat to [[Road traffic safety|road safety]] across the world. While [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] rates have been on the decline since 1983, distracted driving has been increasing in recent years. Many feel this incline is due to the widespread prevalence of [[Mobile phone|cell phones]]. While distracted driving can be attributed to anything that diverts attention away from the road, it is often the cell phone that receives the blame for distracted driving incidents. Most of the recent Studies have shown that cell phone usage while driving has striking similarities to the effects of drinking while driving; Cell phones tend to take the driver's attention away from the road and onto itself. With drunk driving, drivers often experience the "looking but not seeing" phenomena. While their eyes do indeed view objects on the road, their brains do not comprehend the meaning behind the image. All levels of distraction while driving are dangerous, and potential drivers are cautioned to keep awareness of their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bingham|first=C. Raymond|date=May 2014|title=Driver Distraction: A Perennial but Preventable Public Health Threat to Adolescents|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X14000974|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume= 54|issue=5|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.02.015|pmid=|access-date=14 September 2016|via=Science Direct|pages=S3–S5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the classroom ==
Many psychological studies show that switching between tasks, use of technology, and overstimulation has increased levels of distraction in the school setting. At school, distraction is often viewed as a source of poor performance and misbehavior. Distraction makes focusing on singular, assigned tasks more difficult. Digital components of learning are an emerging component to classroom distraction. Parents, teachers, students, and scholars all have opinions about how technology either benefits or harms a students’ focus in an academic setting. Research studies show that neuron circuits indicate a decrease in ability to be attentive to goal relative stimulus with the addition of distracting stimuli interference. School-aged students, with developing brains, are more apt to conflicting stimuli while trying to focus. Large classroom sizes, technology use in and outside the classroom, and less natural stimuli have been seen as contributing factors to deflating test scores and classroom participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/48/10941.short|title = The Neural Mechanisms for Minimizing Cross-Modal Distraction|last = Weissman|first = D.H.|date = 2004|journal = The Journal of Neuroscience|doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3669-04.2004|pmid = 15574744|access-date = February 16, 2016|volume=24|pages=10941–10949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Some office workers use so many computer programs at once that they have to use two screens.]]

[[Human multitasking|Multitasking]] could also be considered as distraction in situations requiring full attention on a single object (e.g., sports, academic tests, performance). The issue of distraction in the workplace is studied in [[interruption science]]. According to Gloria Mark, a leader in interruption science, the average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker takes nearly a half-hour to resume the original task.&lt;ref name=marci&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alboher|first1=Marci|title=Fighting a War Against Distraction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/jobs/22shifting.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
In works of [[fiction]], distraction is often used as a source of [[comedy]], whether the amusement comes from the [[gullibility]] of those distracted or the strangeness of whatever is utilized to create the distraction. Examples of comedic distraction, also called [[comic relief]], can oftentimes be found in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] plays. In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Shakespeare includes a scene in which two [[gravedigger]]s joke around about [[Ophelia]]'s death. While her [[death]] is by no means meant to be funny, a small break from the sadness helped to appease the [[groundling]]s in Shakespeare's time, as well as allow the rest of the [[audience]] to take a break from the constant "doom and gloom" of his [[Tragedy|tragedies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Peter|date=November 2003|title=Shakespeare and Comedy: An Annual Survey of Shakespeare Studies and Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvKUm7D2vckC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=shakespeare+use+of+distraction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y4Kk4d4FIk&amp;sig=lb88v52gPHuaxs-dS-1udD8dlEA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqr86K8I_PAhUM5SYKHV5FDM0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=shakespeare%20use%20of%20distraction&amp;f=false|journal=Shakespeare Survey|volume= 56|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=14 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
[[Rabbi]] Allen Lew in his book, ''This is Real and You are Completely Unprepared'', writes, "The thoughts that carry our attention away [during [[prayer]] or meditation] are never insignificant thoughts and they never arise at random. We lose our focus precisely because these thoughts need our attention and we refuse to give it to them. This is why they keep sneaking up on our attention and stealing it away. This is how it is that we come to know ourselves as we settle deeply into the act of prayer [or [[meditation]]]". According to philosopher [[Damon Young]], distraction is chiefly an inability to identify, attend to or attain what is valuable, even when we are hard-working or content.

==In warfare==
* Fake targets:
** In open field with mass military strategy, sometimes a contingent of troops distracts the enemy army to expose their flank, or to draw them away from a key point or fortification.
** [[Flare (countermeasure)|Flares]] can divert enemy soldiers' gaze.
Distraction was a key battle [[strategy]] in tales from the [[Trojan War]]. According to the legend, the [[Greeks]] seemed to have retreated by pretending to [[sail]] away. In their stead, they left a large wooden horse, which the [[Troy|Trojans]] then chose to bring back within their walls in order to celebrate their supposed [[victory]]. The Greeks used the Trojans' [[pride]] as a distraction, as they actually hid men within the [[Trojan Horse]] in order to let the rest of the army in during the cover of night. The Greeks then entered and destroyed the city of [[Troy]], effectively ending the 10-year standoff that was the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broeniman|first=Cliff|date=1996|title=Demodocus, Odysseus, and the Trojan War in "Odyssey" 8|jstor=4351895|journal=The Classical World|volume=90|issue=1|doi=10.2307/4351895|pmid=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medicine==
[[Image:CloveEssOil.png|thumb|[[Clove oil]] (''Syzygium aromaticum'') essential oil in glass vial]]
Distraction is useful in the management of pain and anxiety. Dentists, for example may intentionally hum an annoying tune or engage in small talk just to create a diversion from the dental surgery process. Topical ointments containing [[capsaicin]], provide a superficial burning sensation that can momentarily distract a patient's attention away from the more serious pain of arthritis or muscle strain. A similar effect is made by [[oil of cloves]], which produces a burning sensation on the gums, and distracts from [[toothache]].

Distraction is often used as a coping mechanism for short-term [[emotion]] regulation. When presented with an unpleasant reality, humans often choose to occupy their [[attention]] with some other reality in order to remain in a positive mental state. This is referred to as ‘[[procrastination]]’ when the unpleasant reality is in the form of work. The natural human inclination to distract oneself was put to the test when the Department of [[Psychology]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]] (Humboldt University of Berlin) held an [[experiment]] to study distraction. The goal of the experiment was to examine whether the effects of distraction on where subjects held their attention during repeated picture processing is changed by regular emotional functions. Furthermore, they [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] that while distraction assists in short-term emotional regulation, it is actually harmful in the long term. In order to do so, the experimenters had subjects view 15 unpleasant pictures (Set A) and “attend” to them (meaning the subjects were asked to pay full attention to the pictures). Next, the subjects were shown 15 unpleasant pictures (Set B) and were asked to distract themselves from the pictures (meaning they were to think about anything other than the picture on the screen; their example was to think about “the way to the supermarket”). Finally, the subjects were shown 15 neutral pictures (Set C) and were asked to attend to them. After 10 minutes of rest, the subjects entered the “re-exposure phase”, which repeated the experiment- this time requiring the subjects to pay attention to all of the sets, including Set B. This experiment was performed on 3 separate blocks of participants. To examine the state of the subjects’ brain, the subject was to wear “Ag/AgCl-electrodes from 61 head sites using an EasyCap electrode system with an equidistant electrode montage. Additional external electrodes were placed below the left (IO1) and right eye (IO2), below T1 (ground), on the nasion, and on the neck.” The subjects were also asked to rate the unpleasantness of the picture on the screen on a scale of 1-9. To test whether distraction in the first phase resulted in increased responsiveness during the re-exposure phase, experimenters “compared mean unpleasantness ratings between unpleasant pictures that were previously presented in the attend (previous attention) versus distract (previous distraction) condition using a paired t-test”. The end results of the experiment were as such:
* When presented with repeated neutral and unpleasant images, subjects had reduced unpleasant stimuli as reflected in their decreased LPP (late positive potential) [[amplitude]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, but only when the participants were asked to attend to those pictures.
* When the subjects avoided confrontation with the unpleasant pictures through distraction, decrease in responsiveness was prevented as reflected in their constant LPP amplitudes.
Essentially, when exposed to an unpleasant image, the subject feels initial discomfort. However, after being exposed to it once with their full attention, the subject feels much less discomfort the second time they are exposed. When the subject distracts themselves from the initial unpleasant image, the subject feels more discomfort the second time when they are required to attend to the image. The experimenters’ conclusion is thus: “the obtained results suggest that distraction inhibits elaborate processing of the stimulus' meaning and adapting to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 2016|title=The costs of distraction: The effect of distraction during repeated picture processing on the LPP|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051116300953|journal=Biological Psychology|volume= 117|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.04.002|pmid=|access-date=10 September 2016|via=Science Direct|pages=225–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In crime==
[[Con artist]]s and [[shoplifter]]s sometimes create a distraction to facilitate their crimes. Armed robbers may create a distraction after their robbery, such as pulling a fire alarm, to create confusion and aid in their getaway. In a more serious case of crime, Norwegian [[Anders Behring Breivik]] exploded a car bomb in Oslo city. It was a reportedly distraction that directed police resources to Oslo city, allowing him to carry out his shooting spree unopposed on Utøya island.

==In "magic"==
Magicians use distraction techniques to draw the audience's attention away from whichever hand is engaged in [[sleight of hand]]. Magicians can accomplish this by encouraging the audience to look elsewhere or by having an assistant do or say something to draw the audience's attention away.
Sleight of hand is often used in [[close-up magic]], performed with the audience close to the magician, usually within three or four meters, possibly in physical contact. It often makes use of everyday items as props, such as cards and [[Coin Magic|coins]]. The guiding principle of sleight-of-hand, articulated by legendary close-up magician [[Dai Vernon]], is "be natural". A well-performed sleight looks like an ordinary, natural and completely innocent gesture, change in hand-position or body posture.

It is commonly believed that sleight of hand works because “the hand is quicker than the eye” but this is usually not the case. In addition to manual dexterity, sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, timing, misdirection, and natural [[choreography]] in accomplishing a magical effect. [[Misdirection (magic)|Misdirection]] is perhaps the most important component of the art of sleight of hand. The magician choreographs his actions so that all spectators are likely to look where he or she wants them to. More importantly, they do not look where the performer does not wish them to look. Two types of misdirection are timing and movement. Timing is simple: by allowing a small amount of time to pass after an action, events are skewed in the viewer's mind. Movement is a little more complicated. A phrase often used is "A larger action covers a smaller action". Care must be taken however to not make the larger action so big that it becomes suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=Gustav|date=12 October 2010|title=Misdirected by the gap: The relationship between inattentional blindness and attentional misdirection|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810010001790|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=20|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.013|pmid=20943415|access-date=18 September 2016|via=Elsevier Science Direct|pages=432–436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By media==
Propagandizing techniques of distraction are used in [[media manipulation]]. The idea is to encourage the public to focus on a topic or idea that the compliance professional feels is supportive of their cause. By focusing attention, a particular [[ideology]] can be made to seem the only reasonable choice. Oftentimes, media competition is the driving force for [[media bias]], manipulation, and distraction. If a media company can find an audience with a united ideology, it then develops a loyal consumer base, as its consumers will be happy with the way media is presented. A so-called "conservative" media outlet would not hire a "liberal" reporter, as they would run the risk of alienating its viewership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Daniel F.|date=2 February 2011|title=Ideological media bias|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268111000291|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization|volume=78|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2011.01.013|pmid=|access-date=18 September 2016|via=Science Direct|pages=256–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubious

Distraction is also important in studies of [[media multitasking]], or the simultaneous use of multiple media at once. This [[behavior]] has emerged as increasingly common{{when|date=March 2012}}, especially among younger media users.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The MultiTasking Generation|magazine=[[Time Magazine]]|date=March 19, 2006|first=Claudia|last=Wallis|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1174696,00.html}}. Wallis describes a survey by [[Donald F. Roberts]] and others for the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] that found that [[human multitasking|multitasking]] children were able to view media for an average of 8.5 hours inside the 6.5 hours spent interacting with electronic media.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that while humans are predisposed to the desire to multitask, most people struggle to have legitimate [[productivity]] while multitasking. Instead of giving a task full attention, the split attention that multitasking necessitates can cause one task to be a distraction to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenella|first=Saunders|date=December 2009|title=Multitasking to Distraction: Users of many concurrent media streams actually are less able to switch between tasks|jstor=27859416|journal=American Scientist|volume=97|issue=6|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some studies show that multitasking has the [[potential]] for a high-risk high-reward situation, leading to the idea that success can arise from multitasking if one is good at the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanbonmatsu|first=David M.|date=23 January 2013|title=Who Multi-Tasks and Why?

The WHO has published a model list of essential medicines. Each country is encouraged to prepare their own lists taking into consideration local priorities. Over 150 countries have published an official essential medicines list.&lt;ref name=Sey2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seyberth|first1=Hannsjörg W.|last2=Rane|first2=Anders|last3=Schwab|first3=Matthias|title=Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642201950|page=358|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jM1gob3MeVYC&amp;pg=PA358|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential medicines list enables health authorities, especially in developing countries, to optimize [[pharmaceutical]] resources. The WHO List contains a core list and a complementary list.

The core list presents a list of minimum medicine needs for a basic health care system, listing the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions. Priority conditions are selected on the basis of current and estimated future public health relevance, and potential for safe and [[cost-effective]] treatment.

The complementary list presents essential medicines for priority diseases, for which specialized diagnostic or monitoring facilities are needed. In case of doubt medicines may also be listed as complementary on the basis of higher costs or less attractive cost-effectiveness in a variety of settings. The list is important because it forms the basis of [[national drugs policy]] in more than 155 countries, both in the [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing world]]. Many governments refer to WHO recommendations when making decisions on health spending.

==Theory and practice==
The definition of essential medicines has changed over time.

The original 1977 WHO definition was that they were medicines "of utmost importance, basic, indispensable, and necessary for the healthcare needs of the population".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |publisher= WHO |series= Progress report by the Director - General |title= Action Programme on Essential Drugs |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/153132/1/WHA32_10_eng.pdf |format= pdf |date= 26 Mar 1979 |page= 1 point 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was mentioned in one of the ten points of the 1978 [[Alma Ata Declaration]] on [[primary health care]].

In 2002 definition was changed to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= WHO
|title= Trade, foreign policy, diplomacy and health |work= Essential Medicines |date= Dec 6, 2010 |url= http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story025/en/ }} &lt;!-- see html "&lt;meta name="DC.date.published" " --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And this remains the current definition as of 2017.&lt;ref name=WHO2017Web&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential medicines|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/services/essmedicines_def/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection===
Items are chosen as essential medicines based on how common the disease is that they treat, evidence of benefit and the degree of side effects, and the cost compared to other options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalle|first1=H|title=Essential Medicines for Children|journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=101|issue=6|pages=718–720|date=9 February 2017|pmid=28182281|doi=10.1002/cpt.661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost-to-benefit ratio===
[[Cost effectiveness]] is the subject of debate between producers (pharmaceutical companies) and purchasers of drugs (national health services). It is estimated that access to essential medicines could save 10 million people a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zacher|first1=M.|last2=Keefe|first2=Tania J.|title=The Politics of Global Health Governance: United by Contagion|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230611955|page=107|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=FdnGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] has been updated every two years since 1977. The current version, the 20th, was published in March 2017.

===Children's list===
The first edition of the "WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children", was published in 2007 while the 5th edition was published in 2015.&lt;ref name=Sey2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2015EC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EMLc_2015_FINAL_amended_AUG2015.pdf |title=5th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (April 2015) |date=April 2015 |accessdate=19 December 2015 |publisher=WHO }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to make sure that the needs of children were systematically considered such as availability of proper [[pharmaceutical formulation|formulations]].&lt;ref name=Sey2011/&gt; The first edition contained 450 formulations of 200 different medications.&lt;ref name=Sey2011/&gt;

===Number of medications===
The number of medications has nearly doubled, from the original 208 in 1977 to more than 340.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 facts on essential medicines|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/essential_medicines/en/|accessdate=15 August 2015|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range has increased over the years and now includes an [[antimigraine]] drug, [[antidote]]s, and [[antineoplastic]] drugs.  The third list for children from 2011 contains 269 medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bansal|first1=D|last2=Purohit|first2=VK|title=Accessibility and use of essential medicines in health care: Current progress and challenges in India|journal=Journal of Pharmacology &amp; Pharmacotherapeutics|date=January 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=13–8|pmid=23662019|doi=10.4103/0976-500X.107642|pmc=3643337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Access to essential medicines are part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], specifically goal 3.8.&lt;ref name=Lancet2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wirtz|first1=VJ|last2=Hogerzeil|first2=HV|last3=Gray|first3=AL|last4=Bigdeli|first4=M|last5=de Joncheere|first5=CP|last6=Ewen|first6=MA|last7=Gyansa-Lutterodt|first7=M|last8=Jing|first8=S|last9=Luiza|first9=VL|last10=Mbindyo|first10=RM|last11=Möller|first11=H|last12=Moucheraud|first12=C|last13=Pécoul|first13=B|last14=Rägo|first14=L|last15=Rashidian|first15=A|last16=Ross-Degnan|first16=D|last17=Stephens|first17=PN|last18=Teerawattananon|first18=Y|last19='t Hoen|first19=EF|last20=Wagner|first20=AK|last21=Yadav|first21=P|last22=Reich|first22=MR|title=Essential medicines for universal health coverage.|journal=Lancet|date=28 January 2017|volume=389|issue=10067|pages=403–476|pmid=27832874|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31599-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations, which are global in scope, use the list to determine which medications they will supply.&lt;ref name=Sey2011/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6639">'''Flour extraction''' is the common process of refining Whole Grain Flour first milled from [[Grain|grain]] or [[Grist|grist]] by running it through sifting devices.

== Definition ==
For centuries, much of the flour milled for human consumption has been run through some kind of “bolting”, sifting or “extraction” process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hazen |first1=Theodore |title=Flour Bolting (Sifting) and Bolting Cloth |url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millbuilder/boulting.html |website=Mill Builder |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This flour is extracted from whole grains for one of two reasons; firstly, to decrease the [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|tendency for rancidity]]. The milling systems with a lower extraction percentage discard most of the rancidity prone nutritional minerals and oils associated with the [[bran]] and germ elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Wheat Germ |url=http://kretschmer.com/about-wheatgerm |website=Kretschmer Wheat Germ |publisher=Kretschmer |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the wheat kernel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wheat Kernel |url=http://www.conejobread.com/wheat_kernel.htm |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Baking functionality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sakhare |first1=Suresh |last2=Ubandar |first2=Aashitosh |last3=Indrani |first3=Soumya |last4=Rao |first4=G. Venkateswara |title=Effect of flour particle size on microstructural, rheological and physico-sensory characteristics of bread and south Indian parotta |journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology |date=December 2014 |volume=51 |issue=12 |pages=4108–4113 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13197-013-0939-5 |accessdate=1 June 2018|doi=10.1007/s13197-013-0939-5 |pmc=4252461 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the other issue, with increased loaf volume accomplished by simply removing just the larger flour particles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Naifu |last2=Hou |first2=Gary |last3=Dubat |first3=Arnaud |title=Effects of flour particle size on the quality attributes of reconstituted whole-wheat flur and Chinese southern-type steamed bread |journal=LWT Food Science and Technology |date=1 December 2016 |volume=82 |pages=147–153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Like the lower extraction white flour, higher extraction flour still creates a smoother dough more inclined to hold the gas created during fermentation. However, higher extraction flour also retains the sensory flavors and nutrition associated with the smaller bran and germ elements that are also extracted along with the endosperm.

== History ==
“White flour”, extracted from whole grains by [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|Roller mills]] that eliminates the rancidity prone bran and germ elements of the wheat kernel was introduced in the late 19th century. By first hydrating the outer wheat kernel bran and germ elements to keep them intact, this new system then employed steel rollers instead of circulating stones to repetitively fracture the remaining starchy endosperm element into fine particles. The extracted endosperm flour came to be known as “white flour” as this element of the wheat kernel is white. This system ingeniously accomplished the extraction of most of the starchy endosperm while separating out virtually all of the bran and germ elements, extracting about 72% of the whole grain kernel. Roller milling eventually came (and continues) to dominate the world’s flour production. Well over 90% of U.S. flour production in 2017 was roller milled white enriched flour.   

Once roller milling made white flour affordable for almost everyone, public health issues arose.  As scientists learned more about the crucial health contributions of the bran and the germ, [[Enriched flour|artificial enrichment]] of white flour was introduced that restores a small part of the nutrition lost by eliminating all the bran and germ elements.

==Benefits==
There are generally two benefits from extraction:
#The highest extraction typically retains over 85% of the original volume by focusing on just improving functionality (increased loaf volume) without a significant sensory loss. A fine Whole Grain Flour is used to just remove the larger flour particles and is commonly referred to by Artisan bakers as High Extraction flour. It is primarily used to produce a variety of non-whole grain [[Bread|bread]] products.
#More aggressive sifting focuses on both functionality and reduction of the potential for rancidity by eliminating 100% of the bran and germ in the kernel.  This lower extraction (typically 72% or less) is most commonly [[Roller Milled White Enriched Flour|Roller Milled White Enriched flour]] yielding a significant selection of flour types used for a variety of baking applications, the most significant of which is [[white bread]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, David, ''Britain's War Machine: Weapons, Resources, and Experts in the Second World War'', p. 179, Oxford University Press, 2011 {{ISBN|9780199832675}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Higher extraction flour ==
The general availability of refrigeration and even flour itself, has diminished the significance of the rancidity/shelf life/keeping quality issue of whole grain flour.   Higher extraction rates just focus on the elimination of the larger flour particles to increase loaf volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=Scott |title=Extraction Flour Bench Test Results |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/extraction-flour-bench-test-results |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining the majority of the nutritional bran and germ elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Addendum to the Scott Mangold May 2015 Extraction Flour Baking Bench Test Comparative Flour Lab Analysis |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/comparative-flour-lab-analysis |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the endosperm.  This is accomplished by direct extraction of the fine whole grain flour output of [[Impact mill|impact or attrition mills]].  Millers have been able to match the finer particle size distribution of low extraction roller milled white flour (72% extraction) that eliminated all the bran and germ elements with a higher +88% extraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mangold |first1=Scott |title=Extraction Flour Bench Test Results |url=https://unifinemill.com/news/item/extraction-flour-bench-test-results |website=Unifine Flour Mill |publisher=Unifine Mill |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that retains most of them.

'''''Fusarium''''' {{Audio|Fusarium Pronunciation.ogg|/fjuˈzɛəriəm/}} is a large [[genus]] of [[Hypha|filamentous]] [[fungi]], part of a group often referred to as [[hyphomycetes]], widely distributed in soil and associated with plants. Most species are harmless [[saprobe]]s, and are relatively abundant members of the soil microbial community. Some species produce [[mycotoxin]]s in cereal crops that can affect human and animal health if they enter the food chain. The main toxins produced by these ''Fusarium'' species are [[fumonisins]] and [[trichothecenes]]. Despite most species apparently being harmless, some ''Fusarium'' species and subspecific groups are among the most important fungal pathogens of [[plant pathology|plants]] and [[pathology|animals]]. 

The name of ''Fusarium'' comes from Latin ''fusus'', meaning a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]].

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of the genus is complex. A number of different schemes have been used, and up to 1,000 species have been identified at times, with approaches varying between wide and narrow concepts of speciation ('lumpers' and 'splitters').{{sfn|Nelson|1994}}{{sfn|Moretti|2009}}{{sfn|Watanabe|2011}}

[[Phylogenetic]] studies indicate seven major clades within the genus.{{sfn|Watanabe|2011}}

=== Subdivision ===
Various schemes have subdivided the genus into subgenera and sections. There is a poor correlation between sections and phylogenetic [[clades]].{{sfn|Watanabe|2011}}

Sections previously described include;
* ''[[Arachnites]]''
* ''Arthrosporiella''
* ''Discolour''
* ''Elegans''
* ''Eupionnotes''
* ''Gibbosum''
* ''Lateritium''
* ''Liseola''
* ''Martiella''
* ''Ventricosum''
* ''Roseum''
* ''Spicarioides''
* ''Sporotrichiella''

=== Species ===
Selected species include;
* ''[[Fusarium avenaceum|F. avenaceum]]''
* ''[[Fusarium bubigeum|F. bubigeum]]''
*''[[Fusarium circinatum|F. circinatum]]''
*''[[Fusarium culmorum|F. culmorum]]''
* ''[[Fusarium graminearum|F. graminearum]]''
* ''[[Fusarium langsethiae|F. langsethiae]]''
* ''[[Fusarium oxysporum|F. oxysporum]]''
* ''[[Fusarium poae|F. poae]]''
* ''[[Fusarium solani|F. solani]]''

* ''[[Fusarium verticillioides|F. verticillioides]]''
* ''[[Fusarium virguliforme|F. virguliforme]]''
* ''[[Fusarium proliferatum|F. proliferatum]]''

=== Etymology ===
The name of ''Fusarium'' comes from Latin ''fusus'', meaning a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]].

== Pathogen ==
[[File:Fusarium chlamydospores 160X.png|thumb|left|''Fusarium'' chlamydospores]]
[[File:Fusarium Micro and Macro conidia.jpg|thumb|The image of Fusarium Micro and Macro conidia under 45 X Magnification]]
[[File:Fusarium conidiophores and macroconidia 160X.png|thumb|left|''Fusarium'' macroconidia]]
The genus includes a number of economically important plant [[pathogen]]ic species.

''[[Fusarium graminearum]]'' commonly infects barley if there is rain late in the season. It is of economic impact to the malting and brewing industries, as well as feed barley. ''Fusarium'' contamination in barley can result in [[Fusarium ear blight|head blight]], and in extreme contaminations, the barley can appear pink.&lt;ref name=BrewingMicro&gt;''Brewing Microbiology'', 3rd edition. Priest and Campbell, {{ISBN|0-306-47288-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genome of this wheat and maize pathogen has been sequenced. ''F. graminearum'' can also cause root rot and seedling blight. The total losses in the US of barley and wheat crops between 1991 and 1996 have been estimated at $3 billion.&lt;ref name=BrewingMicro/&gt;

''[[Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense]]'' is a fungal plant pathogen that causes [[Panama disease]] of [[banana]] (''Musa'' spp.), also known as fusarium wilt of banana. Panama disease affects a wide range of banana [[cultivars]], which are propagated asexually from offshoots and therefore have very little genetic diversity. Panama disease is one of the most destructive plant diseases of modern times, and caused the commercial disappearance of the once dominant [[Gros Michel]] cultivar. A more recent strain also affects the [[Cavendish banana|Cavendish]] cultivars used as a substitute for Gros Michel. It is considered inevitable that this susceptibility will spread globally and commercially wipe out the Cavendish cultivar, for which there are currently no acceptable replacements.

''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' f. sp. ''narcissi'' causes rotting of the bulbs (basal rot) and yellowing of the leaves of daffodils ([[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissi]]).

=== In humans ===
Some species may cause a range of [[opportunistic infection]]s in humans. In humans with normal immune systems, fusarial infections may occur in the [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] ([[onychomycosis]]) and in the [[cornea]] ([[keratomycosis]] or mycotic keratitis).&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Walsh TJ, Dixon DM | title =  Spectrum of Mycoses.

== Use as human food ==
''[[Fusarium venenatum]]'' is produced industrially for use as a human food by Marlow Foods, Ltd., and is marketed under the name [[Quorn (food product)|Quorn]] in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].

Some consumers of fusarium products have shown food allergies similar in nature to peanut and other food allergies.  People with known sensitivities to molds should exercise caution when consuming such products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Katona SJ, Kaminski ER | title = Sensitivity to Quorn mycoprotein (Fusarium venenatum) in a mould allergic patient | journal = Journal of Clinical Pathology | volume = 55 | issue = 11 | pages = 876–7 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12401831 | pmc = 1769805 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.55.11.876-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological warfare ==
Mass casualties occurred in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s and 1940s when ''Fusarium''-contaminated wheat flour was baked into bread, causing alimentary toxic aleukia with a 60% mortality rate.  Symptoms began with [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]], and [[prostration]], and within days, [[fever]], [[chills]], [[myalgia]]s and [[bone marrow]] depression with [[granulocytopenia]] and secondary [[sepsis]] occurred.  Further symptoms included [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] or [[Larynx|laryngeal]] [[oral ulcer|ulceration]] and diffuse bleeding into the skin ([[petechiae]] and [[ecchymoses]]), [[melena]], bloody diarrhea, [[hematuria]], [[hematemesis]], [[epistaxis]], [[vaginal bleeding]], [[pancytopenia]] and [[gastrointestinal]] ulceration.  ''Fusarium sporotrichoides'' contamination was found in affected grain in 1932, spurring research for medical purposes and for use in [[biological warfare]].  The active ingredient was found to be [[trichothecene]] [[T-2 mycotoxin]], and it was produced in quantity and weaponized prior to the passage of the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] in 1972.

Following an outbreak of ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' that affected [[coca]] plantations in [[Peru]], and other crops planted in the area, the [[United States]] has proposed the use of the agent as a [[mycoherbicide]] in drug eradication.  In 2000, a proposal was passed to use the agent as part of [[Plan Colombia]].  In response to concerns use of the fungus could be perceived as [[biological warfare]], the [[Clinton Administration]] "waived" this use of ''Fusarium''.  A subsequent law passed in 2006 has mandated the testing of [[mycoherbicide]] agents - either ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' or ''[[Crivellia papaveracea]]'' - in field trials in U.S. territory.&lt;ref name="tni"&gt;{{cite web | author = Center for International Policy, Drug Policy Alliance, Amazon Alliance, Institute for Policy Studies, Washington Office on Latin America | url = http://www.tni.org/docs/200705111419584743.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625202551/http://www.tni.org/docs/200705111419584743.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 25 June 2008 |title=Evaluating Mycoherbicides for Illicit Drug Crop Control: Rigorous Scientific Scrutiny is Crucial }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' for these tests has raised concerns because resistant [[coca]] from the previous outbreak has been widely cultivated, and the fungus has been implicated in the birth of 31 [[anencephalic]] children in the [[Rio Grande]] region of [[Texas]] in 1991{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, the loss of [[palm tree]]s in [[Los Angeles]], and eye infections from [[contact lens]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Imamura Y, Chandra J, Mukherjee PK, Lattif AA, Szczotka-Flynn LB, Pearlman E, Lass JH, O'Donnell K, Ghannoum MA | title = Fusarium and Candida albicans biofilms on soft contact lenses: model development, influence of lens type, and susceptibility to lens care solutions | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 171–82 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17999966 | pmc = 2223913 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00387-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alternative ''[[Crivellia papaveracea]]'' is less well known; despite decades of study in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biowarfare lab in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], the relevant mycotoxins reportedly have not yet been isolated, named, or studied.&lt;ref name="tni" /&gt;

Fusarium has posed a threat to the ancient cave paintings in [[Lascaux]] since 1955, when the caves were first opened to visitors.

'''Genital Autonomy America''', formerly '''NOCIRC''' (the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers), is an educational [[nonprofit organization]] headquartered in [[California]] and with centers in other US states and countries. In 2016 the organization changed its name from NOCIRC to Genital Autonomy America.
 
Its goal is to secure "the birthright of male, female, and [[intersex]] children and babies to keep their [[sex organ]]s intact."&lt;ref name = "AboutNOCIRC"&gt;{{cite web 
| accessdate = 2006-07-14 | title = About NOCIRC | url = http://nocirc.org/about.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The organization was founded in 1985&lt;ref name = "AboutNOCIRC" /&gt; by [[registered nurse]] [[Marilyn Milos]], who remains the director today. The organization was the first national clearinghouse in the US for information about [[circumcision]]. In its first decade, NOCIRC grew into an international network and now has over 110 centers worldwide, including at least 17 outside of the US.&lt;ref name="NOCIRCcenters"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nocirc.org/centers/centers.php | title = NOCIRC Centers | accessdate = 2006-07-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627232557/http://www.nocirc.org/centers/centers.php | archive-date = 2007-06-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the International Coalition for Genital Integrity (ICGI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.icgi.org | title = International Coalition for Genital Integrity | accessdate = 2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position ==

NOCIRC opposes the non-therapeutic [[circumcision]] of children.&lt;ref name = "NOCIRCdeclaration" &gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.nocirc.org/declare.php | publisher = NOCIRC | date = 1989-03-03 
| title = Declaration of the First International Symposium on Circumcision | accessdate = 2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization suggests that circumcision be performed only when it is absolutely medically necessary and after alternative non-invasive therapies have failed, or when an adult gives consent, after he has been fully informed about the risks and harm of the procedure.&lt;ref name = "AboutNOCIRC" /&gt; NOCIRC also provides material on their view of circumcision and care of the [[foreskin]]. NOCIRC states that their position is based on the understanding that there is not a national or international [[health association]] in the world that recommends routine infant circumcision, yet declare that they hold the medical community accountable for "misconstruing the scientific database available on human circumcision in the world today".&lt;ref name = "NOCIRCdeclaration" /&gt; In a 1996 press release, NOCIRC stated that "We expect this professional organization [the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]] that is concerned with the health of infants and children to reveal the harm of genital cutting and to protect every child's birthright to keep his or her sex organs intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = http://www.nocirc.org/press/pr092796.php | title = AAP's new task force on circumcision to receive information from NOCIRC | publisher = NOCIRC | date = 1996-09-27 | accessdate = 2006-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics said in 1999 that the perceived benefits of circumcision are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision, but that it should be the decision of informed parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| issn = 0031-4005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

NOCIRC publishes a number of brochures for parents, providing their recommendations about infant circumcisions, penile care and several related topics.  NOCIRC also distributes an annual newsletter to its members. Most of the organization's material is directly available on their website.

== International symposia ==
Since 1989 NOCIRC has sponsored and organized international symposia on circumcision, [[human rights]], and [[genital integrity]]. The twelfth international symposium took place in September and October 2012 in Finland. The following list details the history of NOCIRC's symposia:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''Glisodin''' is the [[registered trademark]] of a [[nutritional supplement]] based on two constituents:
* [[Cantaloupe]] extract, which typically contains high quantities of the [[enzyme]] [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD)
* [[Gliadin]], a wheat [[protein design]]ed to protect SOD during the digestive process

==Background==
As [[oxygen]] metabolizes in the body, potentially harmful [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are created.  The human body implements an [[antioxidant]] defense system to protect against ROS.  In the event that these defenses are overpowered by the ROS, [[Cell (biology)|cell]] damage results (which is a major cause of aging in the body).

[[Superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) helps to slow the creation of ROS, ultimately playing a key role in the defense against [[Cell (biology)|cell]] damage.  However, due to a very fragile [[molecular structure]], it is particularly prone to damage from stomach acids and digestive [[enzymes]] when taken orally.  [[Gliadin]], which is well known as a [[carrier protein]] for controlled drug release, helps to protect SOD.

==Research==
A wide range of clinical research has been undertaken to study glisodin's antioxidant capacities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  This has extended into a wide range of applications, including protection from ultraviolet radiation, athletic performance, cardiovascular health, ischemia and reperfusion injury.

A group of researchers in France and Germany led by Dr. Claus Muth concluded that glisodin is helpful in protecting against DNA damage caused by hyperbaric oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.

The '''Goose Guandong virus''' refers to the strain '''A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/Gd)-like H5N1 HPAI viruses'''. It is a strain of the [[Influenzavirus A]] subtype [[H5N1]] virus that was first detected in a [[goose]] in [[Guangdong]] in 1996. It is an HPAI (High Pathogenic Avian Influenza) virus, meaning that it can kill a very high percentage of chickens in a flock in mere days. It is believed to be the immediate precursor of the current dominant strain of HPAI A(H5N1) that evolved from 1999 to 2002 creating the Z genotype (also called "Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)") that is [[global spread of H5N1|spreading globally]] and is [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the [[culling]] of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread.&lt;ref&gt; [http://lib.bioinfo.pl/auth:Vijaykrishna,D lib.bioinfo.pl] article ''Characterization of low pathogenic H5 subtype influenza viruses from Eurasia: Implications for the origin of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses.'' published J Virol. 2007 May 16; : 17507485 says "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are now endemic in many Asian countries, resulting in repeated outbreaks in poultry and increased cases of human infection.

[[Rwanda]] faces a generalized [[epidemic]], with an [[HIV]] prevalence rate of 3.1 percent among adults ages 15 to 49. The prevalence rate has remained relatively stable, with an overall decline since the late 1990s, partly due to improved HIV surveillance methodology. In general, HIV prevalence is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and women are at higher risk of HIV infection than men. Young women ages 15 to 24 are twice as likely to be infected with HIV as young men in the same age group. Populations at higher risk of HIV infection include people in prostitution and men attending clinics for sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Rwanda is among the world's [[least developed countries]], ranking 166 of 187 in the United Nations Development Program's 2011 [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]]. Some 60 percent of the population lives in [[poverty]]. During the three months of genocide in 1994, mass rape, sexual torture and psychological trauma were common. Massive population flows following the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan genocide]] of 1994 have resulted in an increase in the urban population. The shortage of human resources throughout the health sector is a significant constraint. Of Rwandans killed or displaced during the genocide, a disproportionate number were highly skilled and educated members of [[society]], including [[Physician|doctors]], [[nurses]] and other [[health workers]]. Many health centers lack essential physical facilities, equipment and supplies. Electricity supply is erratic throughout Rwanda, affecting hospitals, health centers and laboratories. Blood safety, data management and drug storage are all impacted by the erratic electricity supply. While stigma continues to be a problem for people living with HIV/AIDS, the situation is slowly improving due to good information sharing at all levels about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=un&gt;[http://www.pepfar.gov/pepfar/press/81639.htm "2008 Country Profile: Rwanda"].

== Overview ==

=== History and emergence in Africa ===
[[HIV/AIDS|Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)]] is a disease comprising associated conditions caused by a [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]] infection.  Despite myriad research studies, unresolved questions about origins and epidemic emergence of HIV/AIDS remain. At the beginning of the global AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, HIV/AIDS was considered a disease [[Gay-related immune deficiency|exclusive to homosexual men]] and intravenous drug users, but in Africa, new HIV/AIDS cases were observed across numerous subpopulations. Proposed reasons for the emergence of HIV in Africa in the 20th century include, but are not limited to, rapid population growth, change in population structure, and clinical interventions that provided the opportunity for rapid human-to-human transmission.

=== Emergence and prevalence of HIV in Rwanda  ===
The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is a major public health concern in Rwanda as HIV/AIDS-related mortality has substantial negative social and economic consequences for residents and the government. The first case of HIV infection in Rwanda was reported in 1983.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van de Perre|first=P.|last2=Rouvroy|first2=D.|last3=Lepage|first3=P.|last4=Bogaerts|first4=J.|last5=Kestelyn|first5=P.|last6=Kayihigi|first6=J.|last7=Hekker|first7=A.

According to the 2014–2015 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS), "In Rwanda, much of the information on national HIV prevalence is derived from the antenatal care (ANC) sentinel surveillance system. Although surveillance data do not provide estimates of HIV prevalence for the general population, they do provide results specific to women attending antenatal clinics. The inclusion of HIV testing in the 2005, 2010, and 2014–15 RDHS surveys offer[ed] the opportunity to better understand the magnitude and patterns of infection in the general population of reproductive age, including men age 15–59 who are not tested as part of antenatal sentinel surveillance. The 2014–15 RDHS is the third RDHS survey to anonymously link HIV testing results with key behavioral and sociodemographic characteristics of both male and female respondents, the first being the 2005 RDHS. These surveys provide national, population-based trend data on HIV prevalence among women age 15–49 and men age 15–59. In addition, for the first time, the 2014–15 RDHS included HIV testing of children age 0–14."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR316/FR316.pdf|title=Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey, 2014-15 Final Report|last=National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|last2=Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning|last3=Ministry of Health|last4=The DHS Program ICF International|year=2016|location=Kigali, Rwanda and Rockville, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rwanda, HIV prevalence has been stable since 2005 and remains at 3% among adults age 15–49 (4% among women and 2% among men). The prevalence of HIV is higher in urban areas (6%) than rural areas (2%); HIV prevalence is 6% in the capital city of Kigali and 2–3% in each of the other provinces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The HIV prevalence increases with age. Less than 1% of children (ages 0–14) are living with HIV. Across age groups, the highest HIV prevalence is observed among women age 40–44 (8%) and men age 45–49 (9%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Regardless of sex, HIV prevalence is closely related to marital status. Fifteen percent of widows and 8% of those divorced or separated reported being HIV positive, as compared with only 3% of those who were married at the time of the survey.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By wealth, HIV prevalence is highest among both young women and young men in the highest wealth quintile. However, the relationship between HIV prevalence and household wealth quintile is not linear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Among youth in Rwanda, HIV prevalence by educational attainment. Five percent of young women with no education are HIV-positive whereas 2% of young women with a primary education and 1% with a secondary education or higher are HIV-positive. Among young men, HIV prevalence is higher among those with any education than among those with none.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== National policy and programmatic responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic ==

=== History of Rwanda's HIV/AIDS response ===

==== Early responses ====
Rwanda's HIV/AIDS surveillance efforts began in 1984 with the establishment of a national AIDS case reporting system in hospitals and health centers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The country's early response to its HIV/AIDS epidemic was relatively rapid and sustained. In 1985, the [[Ministry of Health (Rwanda)|Rwandan Ministry of Health]] and the Red Cross established one of the first and most effective blood donor screening programs in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=S.|last2=Lindan|first2=C.|last3=Serufilira|first3=A.|last4=Van de Perre|first4=P.|last5=Rundle|first5=A.

==== The 1990–1994 civil war and genocide ====
[[Rwandan Civil War|Rwanda's civil war]] began in 1990. Between April and July 1994, genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 800,000 Rwandese, displaced nearly four million people, and had a devastating impact on national health infrastructure. In addition to severe limitations being placed on the ability of the Rwandan government to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS during the genocide, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda noted the use of 'genocidal rape' as a weapon of war during this time, with between 250,000 and 500,000 women and girls being subjected to rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donovan|first=Paula|date=2002-12-01|title=Rape and HIV/AIDS in Rwanda|pmid=12504487|journal=Lancet|volume=360 Suppl|pages=s17–18|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11804-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberate infection with HIV was observed as a pattern of warfare. The exact effect of these actions on HIV/AIDS prevalence is, however, not known.

==== Rebuilding after the civil War ====
After the civil war and the genocide, Rwanda's health system had been devastated, with life expectancy at just 30 years and four out of five children dying before their first birthday.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/rwandas-historic-health-recovery-what-the-us-might-learn/273226/|title=Rwanda's Historic Health Recovery: What the U.S. Might Learn|last=Emery|first=Neal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 2002, the country recorded steadily increasing numbers of new AIDS cases with between 1,000 and 4,000 new case reports per year. This was followed more recently by dramatic increases in cases in 2003 and 2004 (over 6,000 and 12,000 cases reported, respectively).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Overall, HIV prevalence is thought to have stabilized since its peak in the early 1990s, partly also due to the effects of the genocide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rwanda adopted a [[Healthcare in Rwanda|community-based healthcare model]] (called Mutuelles de Santé, the insurance requires community members to pay a premium based on their income and a 10% upfront charge for each visit) to counter shortages in skilled professionals and prioritized national ownership of healthcare as a central aspect of its health reconstruction efforts after the war.

''Vision 2020'', the national development plan which aims to make Rwanda a lower-middle income-country by 2020, includes health as a central aspect of development and guides the national allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sida.se/globalassets/global/countries-and-regions/africa/rwanda/d402331a.pdf|title=Rwanda Vision 2020|last=Republic of Rwanda Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rwanda favors a multi-sectoral approach to health care, and, while funding for the health system is heavily dependent on donor aid, State ownership and control over policy is strong.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== HIV/AIDS policies and programs in the past ====
There has been growing availability of HIV testing, care, and treatment services in Rwanda since 2000. [[Retrovirus|Anti-retroviral]] therapy (ART) was first introduced in 1999. The 2005–2009 Health Sector Strategic Plan names as one of its goals the curbing and reversal of the spread of HIV infection by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.equinetafrica.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/RWArights02.pdf|title=Health Sector Strategic Plan 2005-2009|last=Republic of Rwanda|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes as goals increasing demand for HIV prophylaxis and treatment through the development of public education campaigns and 'gender-specific' implementation. In 2006, it was reported that voluntary testing and counseling was available at 226 sites. Large-scale Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) and health promotion initiatives were also reported in at least 208 sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2009, Rwanda published its first National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS, outlining the overarching goals for the country's multi-sector response. "It is based on the most up-to-date understanding of the epidemic and the strengths and weaknesses of the systems and mechanisms that are used to respond." The Plan calls for "universal access to HIV and AIDS services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s18409en/s18409en.pdf|title=Rwanda National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS 2009-2012|last=Republic of Rwanda|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it counts the reduction of infections, reduced morbidity and mortality and equal opportunities for persons living with HIV/AIDS as goals. The plan also targeted behavior change and risk reduction as important outcomes. In 2012, it was estimated that 80% of people in need of ART were able to access it through the community-based healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/rwandas-health-care-miracle/?_r=0|title=In Rwanda, Health Care Coverage That Eludes the U.S.|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Strategic Plan (2009–2012) was succeeded by the Second National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS (2013–2018).

=== Current legal and policy framework ===
HIV/AIDS is prioritized in several policy instruments, including Vision 2020 and the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy 2013–2018 (EDPRS II),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsb.gov.rw/~rbs/fileadmin/user_upload/files/EDPRS_2_Abridged_Version.pdf|title=EDPRS-II}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a framework for multi-sectoral responses to HIV/AIDS. Each sector within EDPRS II has specific HIV mainstreaming strategies and targets, including education, health, labor, military, transport, gender, young people, agriculture, finance and social welfare. The third Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP-III)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moh.gov.rw/fileadmin/templates/Docs/HSSP_III_FINAL_VERSION.pdf|title=HSSP III}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a framework document for the development and shaping of health policy in Rwanda. Among its goals are the reduction of HIV infections, reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality, strengthened management of HIV/AIDS and equal opportunities for people living with HIV.

==== Second National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS (National Strategic Plan 2013–2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://rbc.gov.rw/IMG/pdf/final_nsp_2013-2018.pdf|title=Rwanda HIV and AIDS National Strategic Plan 2013-2018|last=Ministry of Health|publisher=Rwanda Biomedical Center|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The National Strategic Plan is a reference document for all sectors, institutions and partners involved in the fight against HIV and AIDS. The National Strategic Plan goals include:
* Lowering the new infection rate by two thirds from an estimated 6,000 per year currently to 2,000;
* Halving the number of HIV-related deaths from 5,000 to 2,500 per year; and
* Ensuring that people living with HIV have the same opportunities as all others.

The National Strategic Plan addresses issues of key populations and vulnerable groups. These include men who have sex with men, sex workers, mobile populations, persons in uniform, young people, women and girls and people with disabilities. Key settings such as prisons, schools and workplaces are also taken into account. Cross cutting issues related to human rights protection, stigma and discrimination, gender inequality, poverty and involvement of people living with HIV also feature in the National Strategic Plan. The National Strategic Plan outlines strategies such as creating public awareness of stigma and discrimination and addressing the legal barriers that prevent key populations from accessing and utilizing services. Due to the lack of a mid-term progress report, it is unclear if this objective has been met.

Prevention of sexual transmission of HIV and [[sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted infections]], prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV, counselling and testing and prevention of HIV in health care settings are stated priorities of the National Strategic Plan. In addition, the key drivers of HIV in Rwanda have been identified through the Mode of Transmission model. The strategies for prevention have since been revised and updated to be more consistent with new developments and technology. For example, male circumcision using [[Prepex]] is currently being rolled out in the Rwanda. According to the National Strategic Plan, priority interventions relating to HIV treatment include increasing access and enrolment on ART, providing treatment for TB/HIV co-infection and community and home-based palliative care. There has been a lot of progress in the area of treatment including more people being able to access ART, the adoption of the test and treat strategy for discordant couples, sex workers, and the adoption of the new WHO treatment guidelines and the availability of treatment for prisoners. However, challenges still remain with regard to pre-ART care, treatment for opportunistic infections and improving adherence.

With regard to orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), the development of OVC standards of care has recently taken place. The National Strategic Plan focuses on strategic needs of OVC such as protecting their human rights and ensuring access to adequate food, shelter, education and health services, and protection from abuse. Major challenges include the continuous increase in OVC, poor data collection and lack of a national OVC database.

The National Strategic Plan includes indicators and targets, making it possible to track progress and follow up on commitments made. It will be evaluated both at midterm and at the end of the cycle. Thus far, there have not been any mid-term reports published.

==== Other relevant legislation and policy ====
The Constitution of Rwanda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rwandahope.com/constitution.pdf.|title=Constitution of Rwanda|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regulation regarding labor in Rwanda (N° 13/2009 of 27/05/2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lip.alfa-xp.com/lip/AmategekoDB.aspx?Mode=r&amp;pid=8858&amp;iid=2465|title=LAW N° 13/2009 OF 27 MAY 2009 REGULATING LABOUR IN RWANDA|last=|first=|date=|website=lip.alfa-xp.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits discrimination within certain contexts. These are general laws with no specific reference to HIV and AIDS. With regard to the laws to reduce violence against women, the Law on Prevention and Punishment of Gender-Based Violence was enacted in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4a3f88812.html|title=Refworld {{!}} Rwanda: Law No. 59/2008 of 2008 on Prevention and Punishment of Gender-Based Violence|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It outlaws gender-based violence which is defined broadly to include physical, sexual, economic and psychological violence. Read with the Penal Code, the Act criminalizes willful HIV transmission. This is due to the fact that the Act defines sexual abuse to include "the engagement of another person in sexual contact, whether married or not, which includes sexual conduct that abuses, humiliates or degrades the other person or otherwise violates another person's sexual integrity, or sexual contact by a person aware of being infected with HIV or any other sexually transmitted infection with another person without that other person being given prior information of the infection."

==  HIV interventions and achievements ==

=== Prevention ===
Rwanda uses a number of HIV/AIDs prevention strategies. These include social and educational programs, condom distribution, volunteer medical male circumcision, and prevention of mother to child transmission.

==== Testing and counseling programs ====
HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services are provided free of charge in all public health facilities and accredited private clinics in Rwanda. Outreach HCT campaigns are regularly carried out to deliver services to areas with less access to the health system. These campaigns are conducted in partnership with community-based organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and faith-based organizations.

In 2013, Rwanda introduced testing using "finger prick" blood collection in all health facilities. The number of health facilities offering voluntary counseling and testing has increased from 15 in 2001 to 493 in 2013.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/RWA_narrative_report_2014.pdf|title=Rwanda Global AIDS Response Progress Report (GARPR) 2014.|last=Republic of Rwanda Ministry of Health|publisher=Rwanda Biomedical Center|year=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special attention is given to the prevention of HIV among vulnerable groups. Of these vulnerable groups, female sex workers were identified as key in preventing the further spread of HIV. In 2010, the prevalence of HIV among sex workers was 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://rbc.gov.rw/library/sites/default/files/behavioral_and_biological_survey_among_female_sex_workers_rwanda_2010.pdf|title=Behavioral and Biological Surveillance Survey Among  Female Sex Workers, Rwanda: Survey Report|last=Republic of Rwanda Ministry of Health|year=2010|location=Kigali, Rwanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address female sex workers, national guidelines for HIV prevention in this vulnerable population were developed and disseminated as a part of the HIV National Strategic Plan 2013–2018. ROADS II, a USAID project, has been key in facilitating trainings, mentorships and peer groups to improve knowledge of HIV and prevention strategies, and condom distribution through peer education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roads to a Healthy Future (ROADS II) Project in Rwanda: Final Project Report|last=Family Health International (FHI 360)|publisher=USAID|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Condom distribution ====
Rwanda has made gains in the distribution of condoms through social marketing and rapid sales outlets. The private sector has also been active in the uptake of condom use. From 2009 to 2013, 5 million more condoms have been distributed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Circumcision ====
In 2014, the prevalence of male circumcision was 30% between the ages of 15-49.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Voluntary medical male circumcision was added to the 2013–2018 National Strategic Plan of HIV. Surgical kit for voluntary medical male circumcision were provided to all facilities and two healthcare workers were trained per facility. These services are now regularly provided.

==== Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) ====
PMTCT services have been scaled up throughout the country with 97% of all facilities provide PMCTC services by 2013.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The national elimination of mother to child transmission strategy of 2011–2015 integrated PMTCT services into the regular healthcare system. Community health workers are also active in seeking out women who have missed follow-up appointments.

Services for PMTCT provided during antenatal care visits include pre and post-test HIV counseling, blood draws for [[CD4]], an appointment for CD4 results, partner testing, hemoglobin testing, WHO HIV clinical classification and enrolment in care, the initiation of ART, counseling on infant feeding and counseling on family planning.

Option B+, an alternative PMTCT method, starts pregnant women on ARTs and continues treatment through pregnancy and life regardless of CD4 count. This treatment has been initiated in Rwanda and is being scaled to every health facility.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Care, treatment, and support ===
Rwanda has been updated its management and protocols in accordance with 2013 WHO recommendations. New efforts include treatment as prevention for female sex workers and men who have sex with men and test and treat protocols for tuberculosis-HIV co-infection, hepatitis B virus-HIV co-infection, and hepatitis C virus-HIV co-infection.

Over the course of the last ten years, treatment of HIV patients with ARTs has been considerably scaled up. In 2002, only four facilities delivered ARTs compared to 465 in 2013.  Now 91% of cases receive care and treatment.

== Current challenges in the HIV/AIDS response ==

=== External donor funding ===
Continued, rapid decline in donor funding from external resources may affect targets set by the government "to reduce by 75% new HIV infections, reduce by 50% AIDS related deaths, and reach zero stigma and discriminations for people infected and affected by HIV, the government of Rwanda is putting in all efforts to takeover, however the reduction trend from external resources".[[# edn36|[xxxvi]]]

=== Stigma ===
Widespread stigma and discrimination toward those living with HIV and AIDS can adversely impact willingness to be tested for HIV and compliance with ART.

=== Targeting subpopulations ===
Key populations – female workers, youth, and men with higher educational attainment – play an important role in the dynamic of HIV in Rwanda.

== Financing for the national HIV response ==
Health expenditures on HIV are tracked through the Health Resource Tracking tool. All health sector actors, including Government institutions and Development Partners, are required to report annually their HIV expenditures for the previous fiscal year, as well as their budgets for the current fiscal year. Rwanda's Global AIDS Response Progress Report 2014 provides recent national HIV financing information for fiscal year 2011–2012 and fiscal year 2012–2013.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Key development partners ===
Rwanda's key HIV development and funding partners include the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculous and Malaria]] and [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]]. Additional development partners (including international foundations and NGOs, bilateral agencies, and the United Nations (UN)) provide financial and technical support and aid in Rwanda's process of HIV policy and program development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Development partners work with the Rwandan Government to set and achieve targets outlined in the National Strategic Plan 2013–2018. Development partners conduct joint planning and coordination with the Government and submit annual reports and budgets to ensure the Government can monitor and maximize development partners' resources. Rwanda has a common monitoring and evaluation system managed by Rwanda Biomedical Center-HIV Division where development partners can utilize reporting tools. National and international partners are encouraged to work together to maximize time spent supporting beneficiaries and minimize the reporting burden.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Rwanda fiscal year 2011–2012 ===
Public and external funding sources for HIV/AIDS in Rwanda in fiscal year 2011–2012 totaled USD 234.6 million.  Of the total funding, USD 17.7 million (7.6% of total HIV/AIDS spending) came from public funding, and USD 216.8 million (92.4% of total HIV/AIDS spending) came from external funding. This total funding excludes out-of-pocket and private sector contribution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Among external HIV/AIDS funding sources in Rwanda, the Global Fund made up 48.8% of HIV/AIDS funding, followed by the U.S. government (39.3%), international NGOs (2.8%), and UN agencies (1.8%). Additional bilateral organizations played a smaller role, with the Government of Luxembourg and Swiss Development Cooperation combined contributing 0.2% of total HIV/AIDS funding. The only other multilateral agency contributing to the total funding included the World Bank, representing 0.01% of total HIV/AIDS funding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Rwanda fiscal year 2012–2013 ===
Public and external funding sources for HIV/AIDS in Rwanda in fiscal year 2012–2013 totaled USD 243.6 million, a four percent increase from the previous fiscal year spending.  Of the total funding, USD 20.0 million (8.2% of total HIV/AIDS spending) came from public funding, and USD 223.6 million (91.8% of total HIV/AIDS spending) came from external funding. This total funding excludes out-of-pocket and private sector contribution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Among external HIV/AIDS funding sources in Rwanda, Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculous and Malaria made up 54.7% of HIV/AIDS funding, followed by the U.S. government (34.6%), international NGOs (1.0%), and UN Agencies (1.0%). Additional bilateral organizations contributed less than 0.5% of total HIV/AIDS funding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Healing Simurgh '''(Simorgh, Seemorgh) ([[Persian Language|Persian]]: [[wikt:سیمرغ درمانگر|سیمرغ درمانگر]]) is the symbol of medicine in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/81016615/%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%AA/%D8%A7%D8%B2_%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%BA_%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%B1-_%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF_%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9%DB%8C_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C_-_%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C_%D8%B4%D8%AF|title = IRNA: The Healing Simurgh, New Emblem of Medicine in Iran|last = |first = |date =Jan 29, 2014|work =Irna.ir |accessdate= Apr 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is inspired by [[Simurgh]] the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] mythical flying creature, to which healing capacities have been attributed in Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]].

==History of Simurgh==
[[File:Senmurv.svg|left|thumb|Simurgh goes back to ancient Iranian empires. This is a stylized design of Simurgh which was used as the emblem of the Sassanid dynasty.]]
The concept and the logo design of the Healing Simurgh was approved by the supreme board of the [[Islamic]] Republic of [[Iran]]'s Medical Council in November 2013 as the emblem of the Physicians Guild of Iran, replacing the [[Caduceus]].

In summer of 2013, the emblem was introduced by Mahmoud Fazel, MD, the vice president of Iran's Medical Council. It was later developed by a group of renowned scholars including Jalal al-Din Kazzazi, Persian literary scholar, Mehdi Mohaghegh, author and director of the Society for the Appreciation of Cultural works and Dignitaries, Alireza Zali, President of Iran's Medical Council, Professor Nasrin Moazzemi, Biologist and member of [[UNESCO]]'s Scientific Board of the International Basic Sciences Programme, and Ali Javadi Pouya, sustainable development activist and the CEO of Iran's Sustainable Development Strategy Group. The board formed a permanent association to continue with the subsequent activities required for the overhaul of Iran's national emblem for medicine, and for safeguarding this intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The previous sign (bowl and snakes) was considered to be primarily focused on physical health. However, in the works of the prominent Iranian scholar and one of the precursors of medicine in the world, [[Avicenna]], there is a more comprehensive understanding of health. He claims that health (''sihha)'' is the "disposition of human body with respect to its temperament and structure such that all of [its] actions [or functions] proceed from it in a sound and unimpaired way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Canon of Medicine, Volume I|last = Avicenna|first = |publisher = Kazi Publications|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = 6–7|translator = Cameron Gruner|translator2 = Mazar H. Shah}} Cited in McGinnis, Jon. ''Avicenna''. London: [[Oxford University Press]], 2010: 235-236.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the board argued that the Healing Simurgh can better represent the Iranian historical concept of health.

== The Healing Simurgh's Logo ==

The official logo of the Healing Simurgh was designed by Touraj Saberivand, and Iranian graphic designer, and was also published as a posting stamp by the Islamic Republic of Iran Post Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.iribnews.ir/NewsBody.aspx?ID=44013|title = نماد جدید جامعه پزشکی رونمایی شد|last = |first = |date = Jan 29, 2015|work = |access-date = Apr 27, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of '''health in Japan''' is due to a number of factors including cultural habits, isolation, and a [[Universal health care|universal]] [[Health care system in Japan|health care system]].  John Creighton Campbell, a professor at the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Tokyo University]], told the [[New York Times]] in 2009 that Japanese people are the healthiest group on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health-care-abroad-japan/ | work=The New York Times | first=Sarah | last=Arnquist | title=Health Care Abroad: Japan | date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese visit a doctor nearly 14 times a year, more than four times as often as Americans.  Life expectancy in 2013 was 83.3 years - among the highest on the planet. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new measure of expected [[human capital]] calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] in September 2018. [[Japan]] had the highest level of expected human capital among the 20 largest countries: 24.1 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Stephen |last2=et |first2=al |title=Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31941-X/fulltext |accessdate=5 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronic illness==
Obesity in Japan in 2014 was about 3.3%, about 10% of that in USA, presumably because of the Japanese diet. It has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide problem==
{{main|Suicide in Japan}}
Japan's [[suicide]] rate is high compared to the USA; the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' reported in June 2008 that more than 30,000 people had killed themselves every year for the past decade. A study published in 2006 suspects that health problems were a factor in almost 50 percent of Japan's suicides in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Freire, [http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/11/09/1084313-japans-suicide-rate-remains-high "Japan's suicide rate remains high"], [[Associated Press]], November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However the ''Yomiuri''{{'}}s 2007 figures show 274 school children were among those who took their own lives. [[Bullying]] is often a factor in such cases. In 2011, suicide remained over 30,000 for the 14th year running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/gkb47-suicide-prevention-slogan-inspired-by-akb48-comes-under-fire |title=GKB47 suicide prevention slogan inspired by AKB48 criticized ‹ Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion |publisher=Japantoday.com |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - E-Goyomi (Lady Smoking) - Korinsai.jpg|thumb|''E-Goyomi'' ''(Lady Smoking)'' woodblock print dating between 1700 and 1800]]
{{main|Smoking in Japan}}
One of the biggest public health issues is [[smoking in Japan]], which according to Tadao Kakizoe (honorary president of the National [[Cancer]] Center) kills more than 100,000 people per year and is responsible for one in ten deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', 8/9/2008(?). Cited in Scott, Doug. [http://www.apspa.net/Docs/AAPA_News_Article_mission.pdf "Japanese Delegation Visits AAPA to Learn about PA Profession"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203033206/http://www.apspa.net/Docs/AAPA_News_Article_mission.pdf |date=2010-12-03 }}. ''AAPA News'', July 15, 2008, p. 5. Accessed 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol and health issues==
A team led by Professor Osaki of [[Tottori University]] estimated the social cost of [[Long-term effects of alcohol|excessive drinking]] in Japan to be 4.15 trillion [[yen]] a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120209006829.htm |title=The Japan News - Breaking News from Japan by The Yomiuri Shimbun |publisher=Yomiuri.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to care==
{{Main|Health care system in Japan|National Health Insurance (Japan)}}
In [[Japan]], services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge higher for those without a referral{{Fact|date=January 2018}}. However, space can be an issue in some regions. More than 14,000 emergency patients were rejected at least three times by Japanese hospitals before getting treatment in 2007, according to the latest government survey. In the worst case, a woman in her 70s with a breathing problem was rejected 49 times in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Mari. [http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=6801348 "Injured Man Dies After Rejection by 14 Hospitals"]. [[ABC News]] ([[Associated Press]]), February 4, 2009. Accessed 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Public health insurance covers most citizens/residents and pays 70% or more cost for each care and each prescribed drug.  Patients are responsible for the remainder (upper limits apply). The monthly insurance premium is 0–50,000 [[Japanese yen|JPY]] per household (scaled to annual income).  Supplementary private health insurance is available only to cover the co-payments or non-covered costs, and usually makes a fixed payment per days in a hospital or per surgery performed, rather than per actual expenditure. In 2005, Japan spent 8.2% of GDP on health care or US$2,908 per capita. Of that, approximately 83% was government expenditure.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="WHOSIS_spending"/&gt;  --&gt;

==Cultural influences==

Traditional [[Chinese medicine]] was introduced to Japan with other elements of Chinese culture during the 5th to 9th century. Since around 1900, Chinese-style herbalists have been required to be licensed medical doctors. Training was professionalized and, except for East Asian healers, was based on a biomedical model of the disease. However, the practice of biomedicine was influenced as well by Japanese social organization and cultural expectations concerning education, the organization of the workplace, and social relations of status and dependency, decision-making styles, and ideas about the human body, causes of illness, gender, individualism, and privacy. Anthropologist Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney notes that "daily hygienic behavior and its underlying concepts, which are perceived and expressed in terms of biomedical germ theory, in fact, are directly tied to the basic Japanese symbolic structure."

Western medicine was introduced to Japan with the [[Rangaku]] studies during the [[Edo period]]. A number of books on pharmacology and anatomy were translated from Dutch and Latin to Japanese. During the [[Meiji period]] (late 19th century), the Japanese health care system was modeled after the model of Western biomedicine. At that time, western doctors came to Japan to create medical faculties at the newly built [[Higher education in Japan|Japanese universities]], and students also went abroad. Innovations like [[vaccine]]s were introduced to Japan, improving average life expectancy. From the Meiji period through the end of World War II, [[German language|German]] was a mandatory foreign language for Japanese students of medicine. Patient charts in Japanese teaching hospitals were even written in German.

But even today, a person who becomes ill in [[Japan]] has a number of alternative options. One may visit a [[priest]], or send a family member in his or her place. There are numerous folk remedies, including hot springs baths ([[onsen]]) and chemical and herbal over-the-counter medications. A person may seek the assistance of traditional healers, such as [[herbalist]]s, [[masseur]]s, and [[acupuncturist]]s.

==AIDS==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Japan}}
Although the number of [[AIDS]] cases remained small by international standards, public health officials were concerned in the late 1980s about the worldwide epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The first confirmed case of AIDS in Japan was reported in 1985. By 1991 there were 553 reported cases, and by April 1992 the number had risen to 2,077. While frightened by the deadliness of the disease yet sympathetic to the plight of [[hemophilia]]c AIDS patients, most Japanese are unconcerned with contracting AIDS themselves. Various levels of government responded to the introduction of AIDS awareness into the heterosexual population by establishing government committees, mandating AIDS education, and advising testing for the general public without targeting special groups. A fund, underwritten by pharmaceutical companies that distributed imported blood products, was established in 1988 to provide financial compensation for AIDS patients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33187">A '''health professional''', '''health practitioner''' or '''healthcare provider''' (sometimes simply "provider") is an individual who provides preventive, curative, promotional or rehabilitative [[health care]] services in a systematic way to people, families or communities.

A health professional may operate within all branches of [[health care]], including [[medicine]], [[surgery]], [[dentistry]], [[midwifery]], [[pharmacy]], [[psychology]], [[nursing]] or [[allied health professions]].  A health professional may also be a [[Public health|public]]/[[community health]] expert working for the common good of the society.

and a wide variety of other [[Health Human Resources|human resources]] trained to provide some type of health care service.

They often work in hospitals, healthcare centres and other service delivery points, but also in academic training, research and administration. Some provide care and treatment services for patients in private homes. Many countries have a large number of [[community health worker]]s who work outside formal healthcare institutions. [[Health administration|Managers of healthcare services]], [[Health information management|health information technicians]], and other [[unlicensed assistive personnel|assistive personnel]] and support workers are also considered a vital part of health care teams.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, 2006. ''World Health Report 2006: working together for health.'' Geneva: WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare practitioners are commonly grouped into [[health professions]].
Within each field of expertise, practitioners are often classified according to skill level and skill specialization. “Health professionals” are highly skilled workers, in professions that usually require extensive knowledge including university-level study leading to the award of a first degree or higher qualification.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, 2010. ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816123657/http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This category includes physicians, physician assistants, dentists, midwives, radiographers, registered nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, optometrists, operating department practitioners and others. Allied health professionals, also referred to as "health associate professionals" in the [[International Standard Classification of Occupations]], support implementation of health care, treatment and referral plans usually established by medical, nursing, and other health professionals, and usually require formal qualifications to practice their profession. In addition, [[unlicensed assistive personnel]] assist with providing health care services as permitted.

Another way to categorize healthcare practitioners is according to the sub-field in which they practice, such as mental health care, pregnancy and childbirth care, surgical care, rehabilitation care, or public health.

=== Mental health practitioners ===

{{anchor|shortage}}

=== Shortages of health professionals ===
{{See also|Health workforce|Doctor shortage|Nursing shortage}}
Many jurisdictions report shortfalls in the number of trained [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] to meet population health needs and/or service delivery targets, especially in medically underserved areas. For example, in the United States, the [[2010 United States federal budget|2010 federal budget]] invested $330 million to increase the number of doctors, nurses, and dentists practicing in areas of the country experiencing shortages of trained health professionals. The Budget expands [[loan]] repayment programs for physicians, nurses, and dentists who agree to practice in medically underserved areas. This funding will enhance the capacity of [[nursing school]]s to increase the number of nurses. It will also allow states to increase access to [[oral health care]] through dental workforce development [[Grant (money)|grant]]s. The Budget’s new resources will sustain the expansion of the health care workforce funded in the [[Recovery Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/A_New_Era_of_Responsibility2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306211818/https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/A_New_Era_of_Responsibility2.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 15.7 million health care professionals in the US as of 2011.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/765348|title = Slipping, Tripping, and Falling at Work|date = June 11, 2012|accessdate = |website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last = Collins|first = James W.|last2 = Bell|first2 = Jennifer L.|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203232137/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/765348|archivedate = December 3, 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the 2011 federal budget announced a [[Student loans in Canada|Canada Student Loan]] forgiveness program to encourage and support new family physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses to practice in underserved rural or remote communities of the country, including communities that provide health services to [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada. 2011.

Other stressors include the emotional labor of caring for ill people and high patient loads. The consequences of this stress can include [[substance abuse]], [[suicide]], [[major depressive disorder]], and [[anxiety]], all of which occur at higher rates in health professionals than the general working population.

In general, appropriate [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is the first-line mode of protection for healthcare workers from infectious diseases. For it to be effective against highly contagious diseases, personal protective equipment must be watertight and prevent the skin and mucous membranes from contacting infectious material. Different levels of personal protective equipment created to unique standards are used in situations where the risk of infection is different. Practices such as triple gloving and multiple respirators do not provide a higher level of protection and present a burden to the worker, who is additionally at increased risk of exposure when removing the PPE. Compliance with appropriate personal protective equipment rules may be difficult in certain situations, such as tropical environment or low-resource settings. A 2016 Cochrane systematic review found low quality evidence that using more breathable fabric in PPE, double gloving, and active training reduce the risk of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub2/full|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2|issn=1465-1858|journal=Reviews|pmid=27093058|volume=4|author=Verbeek JH, Ijaz S, Mischke C, Ruotsalainen JH, Mäkelä E, Neuvonen K, Edmond MB, Sauni R, Kilinc Balci FS, Mihalache RC|page=CD011621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female health care workers may face specific types of workplace-related health conditions and stress. According to the [[World Health Organization]], women predominate in the formal health workforce in many countries, and are prone to [[musculoskeletal injury]] (caused by physically demanding job tasks such as lifting and moving patients) and burnout. Female health workers are exposed to hazardous drugs and chemicals in the workplace which may cause adverse reproductive outcomes such as [[Miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]] and [[congenital disorder|congenital malformations]].

Healthcare workers are at higher risk of on-the-job injury due to violence. Drunk, confused, and hostile patients and visitors are a continual threat to providers attempting to treat patients. Frequently, assault and violence in a healthcare setting goes unreported and is wrongly assumed to be part of the job.&lt;ref name="Hartley" /&gt; Violent incidents typically occur during one-on-one care; being alone with patients increases healthcare workers' risk of assault.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the United States, healthcare workers suffer ⅔ of nonfatal workplace violence incidents.&lt;ref name=Hartley&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/12/hcwviolence-prevention/ |title = Free On-line Violence Prevention Training for Nurses |date = 12 August 2013 |first1 = Dan |last1 = Hartley |first2 = Marilyn |last2 = Ridenour |accessdate = 15 January 2015 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150116120810/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/12/hcwviolence-prevention/ |archivedate = 16 January 2015 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric units represent the highest proportion of violent incidents, at 40%; they are followed by geriatric units (20%) and the emergency department (10%).

The Occupational Health Safety Network is a system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care providers. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities from throughout the U.S. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare providers: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence.&lt;ref name=Hartley/&gt; Slips, trips, and falls are the second-most common cause of worker's compensation claims in the US, and cause 21% of work absences due to injury. These injuries most commonly result in [[strain (injury)|strain]]s and [[sprains]]; women, those older than 45, and those who have been working less than a year in a healthcare setting are at the highest risk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Health care professionals are also likely to experience [[sleep deprivation]] due to their jobs. Many health care professionals are on a [[shift work]] schedule, and therefore experience misalignment of their work schedule and their [[circadian rhythm]]. In 2007, 32% of healthcare workers were found to get fewer than 6 hours of sleep a night. Sleep deprivation also predisposes healthcare professionals to make mistakes that may potentially endanger a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/768414|title = Running on Empty: Fatigue and Healthcare Professionals|date = August 2, 2012|accessdate = |website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last = Caruso|first = Claire C.|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130511070909/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/768414|archivedate = May 11, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation and registration of professionals ===
{{Main|Health professional requisites}}

[[Practicing without a license]] that is valid and current is typically illegal. In most jurisdictions, the provision of health care services is regulated by the government. Individuals found to be providing medical, nursing or other professional services without the appropriate certification or license may face sanctions and criminal charges leading to a prison term. The number of professions subject to regulation, [[Healthcare provider requisites|requisites for individuals to receive professional licensure]], and nature of sanctions that can be imposed for failure to comply vary across jurisdictions.

In the United States, under [[Michigan]] state laws, an individual is guilty of felony if identified as practicing in the health profession without a valid personal license or registration. Health professionals can also be imprisoned if found guilty of practicing beyond the limits allowed by their licences and registration. The state laws define the [[scope of practice]] for medicine, nursing, and a number of allied health professions.&lt;ref&gt;wiki.bmezine.com --&gt; Practicing Medicine.

In the United Kingdom, healthcare professionals are regulated by the state; the UK [[Health and Care Professions Council]] (HCPC) protects the 'title' of each profession it regulates. For example, it is illegal for someone to call himself an Occupational Therapist or Radiographer if they are not on the register held by the HCPC.

[[File:AIDS sign in Tanzania.jpeg|thumb|240px|AIDS awareness sign in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania]]
[[Tanzania]] has a hierarchical health system which is in tandem with the political administrative hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[Human resources for health care delivery in Tanzania: a multifaceted problem, Fatuma Manzi et al https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3311084/],Human resources for health care delivery in Tanzania: a multifaceted problem, Fatuma Manzi et al, PubMed.&lt;/ref&gt; At the bottom there are the dispensaries found in every village where the village leaders have a direct influence in its running. The health centres are found at ward level and the health centre in charge is answerable to the ward leaders. At the district there is a district hospital and at regional level a regional referral hospital. The tertiary level is usually the zone hospitals and at national level there is the national hospital. There are also some specialized hospitals which do not fit directly into this hierarchy and therefore are directly linked to the ministry of health. 

The government has several key plans and policies guiding '''healthcare''' provision and development. The Health Sector Strategic Plan III (2009–15) is guided by the Vision 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mof.go.tz/mofdocs/overarch/Vision2025.pdf], more text.&lt;/ref&gt;  and guides planning for health facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tzdpg.or.tz/fileadmin/documents/dpg_internal/dpg_working_groups_clusters/cluster_2/health/Key_Sector_Documents/Induction_Pack/Final_HSSP_IV_Vs1.0_260815.pdf], United Republic of Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Health Sector Strategic Plan July 2015- June 2020 Reaching all Households with Quality Healthcare.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big Results Now (BRN)]] was copied from the [[Malaysian Model of Development]] and placed health as a key national result area and mainly was for priority setting, focused planning and efficient resource use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/648601468112497753/Tanzania-Big-Results-Now-for-Health-Project], documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/648601468112497753/Tanzania-Big-Results-Now-for-Health-Project.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other policies aiming at improving the health system and health acre provision in Tanzania.

The leading causes of mortality in [[Tanzania]] include: HIV 17%, lower respiratory infections 11%, malaria 7%, diarrheal diseases 6%, tuberculosis 5%, cancer 5%, ischemic heart disease 3%, stroke 3%, STDs 3% and sepsis 2%&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/tanzania/], Global Health- Tanzania Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; and this shows the double burden of disease the country has to bear. 

==Health care financing==

[[Health]] care financing is among the key component of a functional health system.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, World Health Report: Health Syetem Financing: The Path to Universal Coverage. 2010: Geneva&lt;/ref&gt; Financing involves three aspects, namely revenue collection, risk pooling, and purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;WHO 2000. Health Systems: Improving performance. Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a growing demand for access to high-quality and affordable care for all, thus the government is committed to respond with a process of developing health financing strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haazen|first1=Dominic|title=Making Health Financing Work for Poor People in Tanzania|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2240|website=World Bank Group Open Knowledge Repository|publisher=[[World Bank Group]]|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is underway since early 2013. An inter-ministerial steering committee has been developed, composed of key ministries and department to ensure that the proposed reforms meet the needs of the population. Improving the prepayment mechanisms are the main agenda in the development of the strategy, which is assumed to be a potential facilitator in the progress towards UHC.

===The evolution of health care financing in Tanzania===

The Arusha Declaration in 1967 was initiated by the president Julius Nyerere, outlining the principles of [[Ujamaa]] (Nyerere vision of social and economic policies) to develop the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last1=Hyden|first1=G.|year=1980|title=Beyond Ujamaa in Tanzania: Underdevelopment and an Uncaptured Peasantry|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the start of a series of health sector reforms with the intention of increasing universal access to social services to the poor and those living in marginalized rural areas. Followed by the Government banning private-for-profit medical practice in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolstad|first1=J. R.|last2=Lindkvist|first2=I.|year=2013|title=Pro-social preferences and self-selection into the public health sector: evidence from an economic experiment|journal=Health Policy Plan|volume=28|pages=320-327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took on the task of providing health services free of charge.

{{refimprove|paragraph|date=March 2016}}
However, by the early 1990s, the strain of providing free health care for all became evident in the face of rising health care costs and a struggling economy. Early 1990s the government adopted health sector reforms that changed the financing system from free services to mixed financing mechanisms including cost sharing policies. Cost sharing in the form of user fees was introduced in four phases: Phase I from July 1993 to June 1994 to referral and some services in regional hospital; Phase II from July 1994 to December 1994 to regional hospital; Phase III from January 1995 onwards to district hospital and Phase IV introduced to health centre and Dispensary after completion of introduction to all district hospital. Exemption and waiver were integral part of the cost sharing policy introduced in 1994.

===Health spending===

Current data shows in Tanzania there has been an increase in budget allocation for health over the years: Total Health Expendinture (THE) increased from US$734 million in 2002/2003 to US$1.75 billion in 2009/2010 as indicated in the [[National Health Accounts]] 2010 report. However donors have been the main financier of health, despite the decrease in their share of health expenditure from 44 percent in 2005/2006 to 40 percent in 2009/2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthsystems2020.org/files/92800_file_TANZANIA_NHA_2009_2010_A4_FINAL.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; (Table 1). Overall, the government allocation for health spending has remained almost constant at about 7 percent since 2002/2003, far away from reaching the Abuja declaration target of 15% of total government expenditure. The increase in donor funding is attributed to the commencement of financing for HIV and AIDS by the Global Fund in 2001 and the commencement of health financing through Sector wide Approach (SWAp)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swisstph.ch/about-us/departments/swiss-centre-for-international-health/the-swap-website/swap-references/sector-wide-approach.html.|title=Swiss TPH|work=swisstph.ch|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in early 2000.

On the other hand, there has been a commitment to expand the insurance coverage in the country, however the insurance schemes are highly fragmented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=D.|year=2008|title=Beyond fragmentation and towards universal coverage: insights from Ghana, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=86|pages=871-876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=A.|last2=Ataguba|first2=J.

Recent statistics shows that there were about 7 private firms as indicated in the Tanzania Insurance Regulatory authority (TIRA)&lt;ref&gt;TIRA 2010. ''Annual insurance Market Performance Report. For The Year Ended 31st December 2010'': Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority&lt;/ref&gt; which were providing health insurance per se, while a few of other general insurance firms combine health insurance benefit under life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last1=Bultman|first1=J.|last2=Kanywanyi|first2=J. L.|last3=Maarifa|first3=H.|last4=Mtei|first4=G.|year=2012|title=Tanzania Health Insurance Regulatory Framework Review|publisher=Ministry of Health and Social welfare and Social Security Regulatory Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)===

The NHIF was established by the Act of Parliament No. 8 of 1999 and began its operations in June 2001. The scheme was initially intended to cover public servants but recently there have been provisions which allow private membership.&lt;ref name="NHIF, 2011"&gt;NHIF, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The public formal sector employees pay a mandatory contribution of 3% of their monthly salary and the government as an employer matches the same. This scheme covers the principal member, spouse and up to four below 18 years legal dependants. There has been a steady increase in coverage from 2.0% of the total population in 2001/2002 to 7.1% in 2011.&lt;ref name="NHIF, 2011"/&gt;

===Social Health Insurance Benefit (SHIB)===

Social Health Insurance Benefit (SHIB) is part of the National Social Security Benefits introduced in 2007. All members of [[National Social Security Fund (Tanzania)|NSSF]] have access to medical care through SHIB after undergoing registration process with only one facility of their choice. The scheme accredits both public and private providers.The benefit is part of their 20% contribution to the NSSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=nssf|title=Social Health Benefits in Tanzania|url=https://www.nssf.or.tz/index.php/benefits/english/social-health-insurance|website=nssf|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Health Fund (CHF) and Tiba Kwa Kadi (TIKA)===

Community Health Fund is the scheme that targets the largest population in the rural informal sector and membership is voluntary. There is a counterpart called TIKA which mainly targets the informal sector individuals in urban areas. The CHF and TIKA are both regulated under the CHF act 2001 and managed at district level. At the district level, council health service boards (CHSB) and health facilities governing committees (HFGC) are responsible to oversee the operation of CHF and sensitization. In 2009 the National management role of CHF was given to the NHIF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borghi|first1=J.|last2=Maluka|first2=S.|last3=Kuwawenaruwa|first3=A.|last4=Makwai|first4=S.|last5=Tantau|first5=J.|last6=Mtei|first6=G.|last7=Ally|first7=M.|last8=Macha|first8=J.|year=2013|title=Promoting universal financial protection: a case study of new management of community health insurance in Tanzania|journal=Health research policy and systems, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private insurance schemes===

Strategis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategistz.com/.|title=Strategis Insurance (Tanzania) Ltd|work=strategistz.com|accessdate=26 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925201137/http://strategistz.com/|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first registered (2002) private health insurance firms in Tanzania. Members of Strategies insurance are corporate employees and become members through their company.

AAR&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhealth.com/aar_tz&lt;/ref&gt; is another private health insurance in Tanzania. The firm started as a health-maintenance organisation (HMO) in 1999 but in 2007 it was re-registered as a private health insurance company.

Jubilee Insurance, Resolution Health and Metropolitan Insurance are other examples of private health insurance firms with more less similar features as strategies and AAR.&lt;ref&gt;JAMU, N., NDUHIYE, L., MACHA, J., KESSY, F. &amp; BORGHI, J. 2009. A Feasibility Study for the Introduction of TIKA in the Three Municipalities of Dar es Salaam Report prepared for the Ministry of Health and Social.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health insurance coverage===

Health insurance coverage is still low in Tanzania. As of June 2013 NHIF was estimated to be covering about 6.6% of the population while CHF covers about 7.3% of the population based on 2012 Census. Beneficiaries of NHIF includes the contributing members, spouse and up to four dependants. The CHF beneficiaries include head of household, spouse and all children below 18 years. Other prepayment schemes cover less than 1% of the population. CHF mainly focuses its coverage in rural population while private health insurance schemes target urban population. Low insurance coverage leads to overreliance on direct payment at the point of use of health care, which is among the fundamental problem that restrain the move towards [[universal health coverage]] in many developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, World Health Report: Health Syetem Financing: The Path to Universal Coverage. 2010: Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct payment can lead to high level of inequity, and in most cases denying the poorest access to needed health care.&lt;ref&gt;Mtei, G., et al., Who pays and who benefits from health care? An assessment of equity in health care financing and benefit distribution in Tanzania. Health Policy and Planning, 2012. 27(suppl 1): p. i23-i34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of hospitals''' has stretched over 2500 years.

==Early examples==
[[File:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of the ''Askleipion'' of [[Kos]], the best preserved instance of a Greek Asklepieion.]]
In ancient cultures, religion and medicine were linked. The earliest documented institutions aiming to provide cures were [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temples]]. 

=== Ancient Greece ===
In [[ancient Greece]], temples dedicated to the healer-god [[Asclepius]], known as ''Asclepieia'' ({{lang-grc|Ἀσκληπιεῖα}}, sing. ''Asclepieion'', {{lang|grc|Ἀσκληπιεῖον}}), functioned as centres of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenter B. Risse|Risse, G.B.]] ''Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals.'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1990. p. 56 [https://books.google.com/books?id=htLTvdz5HDEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=History+of+Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenter B. Risse|Risse, G.B.]] ''Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals.'' Oxford University Press, 1990. p. 56 [https://books.google.com/books?id=htLTvdz5HDEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=History+of+Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his Roman name Æsculapius, he was provided with a temple (291 B.C.) on an island in the [[Tiber]] in Rome, where similar rites were performed.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick E. McGrew, ''Encyclopaedia of Medical History'' (Macmillan 1985), pp.134–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At these shrines, patients would enter a dream-like state of induced sleep known as ''enkoimesis'' ({{lang|grc|ἐγκοίμησις}}) not unlike anesthesia, in which they either received guidance from the deity [[Sleep temple|in a dream]] or were cured by surgery.&lt;ref name="Books.Google.com"&gt;Askitopoulou, H., Konsolaki, E., Ramoutsaki, I., Anastassaki, E. ''Surgical cures by sleep induction as the Asclepieion of Epidaurus.'' The history of anaesthesia: proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium, by José Carlos Diz, Avelino Franco, Douglas R. Bacon, J. Rupreht, Julián Alvarez. Elsevier Science B.V., International Congress Series 1242(2002), p.11-17. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TM-8NIDPowoC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=History+of+Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guenter B. Risse|Risse, G.B.]] ''Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals.'' Oxford University Press, 1990. p. 56 [https://books.google.com/books?id=htLTvdz5HDEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=History+of+Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Asclepieion of [[Epidaurus]], three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.&lt;ref name="Books.Google.com" /&gt; The worship of Asclepius was adopted by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Under his Roman name Æsculapius, he was provided with a temple (291 BC) on an island in the [[Tiber]] in Rome, where similar rites were performed.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick E. McGrew, ''Encyclopaedia of Medical History'' (Macmillan 1985), pp. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===


Institutions created specifically to care for the ill also appeared early in [[India]]. [[Fa Xian]], a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled across India ca. 400 AD, recorded in his travelogue &lt;ref&gt;Legge, James, A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms: Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fâ-Hien of his Travels in India and Ceylon (399–414 CE) in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; that {{quotation|The heads of the Vaishya [merchant] families in them [all the kingdoms of north India] establish in the cities houses for dispensing charity and medicine. All the poor and destitute in the country, orphans, widowers, and childless men, maimed people and cripples, and all who are diseased, go to those houses, and are provided with every kind of help, and doctors examine their diseases. They get the food and medicines which their cases require, and are made to feel at ease; and when they are better, they go away of themselves.}}
[[File:Sri Lankan Traditional Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of a two thousand years old hospital were discovered in the historical city of [[Anuradhapura]] [[Mihintale]] [[Sri Lanka]]]]
The earliest surviving encyclopaedia of medicine in Sanskrit is the Carakasamhita (Compendium of [[Caraka]]). This text, which describes the building of a hospital is dated by the medical historian [https://dominikwujastyk.academia.edu/ Dominik Wujastyk] to the period between 100 BCE and 150 CE.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;https://www.academia.edu/1262042/_The_Nurses_should_be_able_to_Sing_and_Play_Instruments._The_Evidence_for_Early_Hospitals_in_South_Asia Cited on 2017-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The description by Fa Xian is one of the earliest accounts of a civic hospital system anywhere in the world and this evidence, coupled with Caraka’s description of how a clinic should be built and equipped, suggests that India may have been the first part of the world to have evolved an organized cosmopolitan system of institutionally-based medical provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49872366|title=The Roots of Ayurveda: selections from Sankskrit medical writings|last=Wujastyk|first=D|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|isbn=0140448241|location=London; New York|pages=passim|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]] is wrongly said by many secondary sources to have founded at hospitals in ca. 230 BCE&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Medical History'' - McGrew, Roderick E. (Macmillan 1985), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mahavamsa]], the ancient chronicle of Sinhalese royalty, written in the sixth century CE, King [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka]] (reigned 437 BCE to 367 BCE) had lying-in-homes and hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country.

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] constructed buildings called ''valetudinaria'' for the care of sick slaves, gladiators, and soldiers around 100 BCE, and many were identified by later archeology. While their existence is considered proven, there is some doubt as to whether they were as widespread as was once thought, as many were identified only according to the layout of building remains, and not by means of surviving records or finds of medical tools.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.novaesium.de/news/1998-1220-valetudinaria.htm The Roman military Valetudinaria: fact or fiction]'' – [[Patricia Anne Baker|Baker, Patricia Anne]], [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], Sunday 20 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration of [[Christianity]] as an accepted religion in the Roman Empire drove an expansion of the provision of care. Following [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 CE construction of a hospital in every [[cathedral]] town was begun. Among the earliest were those built by the physician [[Sampson the Hospitable|Saint Sampson]] in [[Constantinople]] and by [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil, bishop of Caesarea]] in modern-day Turkey. Called the "Basilias", the latter resembled a city and included housing for doctors and nurses and separate buildings for various classes of patients.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'' – ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07480a.htm]'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; There was a separate section for lepers.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick E. McGrew, ''Encyclopedia of Medical History'' (1985), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hospitals maintained libraries and training programs, and doctors compiled their medical and pharmacological studies in manuscripts. Thus in-patient medical care in the sense of what we today consider a hospital, was an invention driven by Christian mercy and Byzantine innovation.&lt;ref&gt;James Edward McClellan and Harold Dorn, ''Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006), pp. 99, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine hospital staff included the [[Chief Physician]] (archiatroi), professional nurses (hypourgoi) and the orderlies (hyperetai). By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two well-organized hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialized wards for various diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Byzantine medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A hospital and medical training centre also existed at [[Gundeshapur]]. The city of [[Gundeshapur]] was founded in 271 CE by the Sassanid king [[Shapur I]]. It was one of the major cities in [[Khuzestan]] province of the Persian empire, in Iran. A large percentage of the population were [[Syriac Christians|Syriacs]], most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of [[Khusraw I]], refuge was granted to Greek [[Nestorian Christian]] philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] ([[Urfa]]) (also called the Academy of Athens), a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahfuz Söylemez | first1 = Mehmet | year = | title = The Jundishapur School: Its History, Structure, and Functions | url = | journal = The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 2| page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical centre at Gundeshapur.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Marlow Taylor, ''The Physicians of Jundishapur'', (University of California, Irvine), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It included a medical school and hospital ([[bimaristan]]), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Elgood, ''A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate'', (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of Mankah and of the Indian doctor Sustura were translated into Arabic at [[Baghdad]]'s [[House of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Elgood, ''A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate'', (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
[[File:LesInvalidesFull.JPG|thumb|The church at [[Les Invalides]] in Paris, showing the typically close connection between hospitals and the Catholic church]]
Medieval hospitals in Europe followed a similar pattern to the [[Byzantine]]. They were religious communities, with care provided by [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. (An old French term for hospital is ''hôtel-Dieu'', "hostel of God.") Some were attached to monasteries; others were independent and had their own endowments, usually of property, which provided income for their support. Some hospitals were multi-functional while others were founded for specific purposes such as leper hospitals, or as refuges for the poor, or for [[pilgrim]]s: not all cared for the sick. 

Around 529 A.D. St. [[Benedict of Nursia]] (480-543 A.D.), later a Christian saint, the founder of western [[monasticism]] and  the [[Order of St. Benedict]], today the [[patron saint]] of Europe, established the first [[monastery]] in Europe ([[Monte Cassino]]) on a hilltop between [[Rome]] and [[Naples]], that became a model for the Western monasticism and one of the major cultural centers of Europe throughout the Middle Ages. St. Benedict wrote the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] which mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick.

The first Spanish hospital, founded by the Catholic [[Visigoth]] bishop [[Masona]] in 580 CE at [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], was a ''[[xenodochium]]'' designed as an inn for travellers (mostly pilgrims to the shrine of [[Eulalia of Mérida]]) as well as a hospital for citizens and local farmers. The hospital's endowment consisted of farms to feed its patients and guests. From the account given by Paul the Deacon we learn that this hospital was supplied with physicians and nurses, whose mission included the care the sick wherever they were found, "slave or free, Christian or Jew." &lt;ref&gt;See Florez, "Espana Sagrada", XIII, 539; Heusinger, "Ein Beitrag", etc. in "Janus", 1846, I.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 650, the "[[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]]" was found in Paris,&lt;ref name="London Science Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/hoteldieu.aspx|publisher=London Science Museum|accessdate=2009-09-14|title=Hotel Dieu}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered as the oldest worldwide hospital still operating today.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Milestones in Midwifery and the Secret Instrument|author=Radcliff, Walter|publisher=Norman Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73AEtDaG2RsC&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;ots=h8-5DxVtss&amp;dq=%22h%C3%B4tel-dieu%22%20%2Bparis%20-wiki%20-hospitel&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a multipurpose institution which catered for the sick and poor, offering shelter, food and medical care.

During the late 8th and early 9th centuries, Emperor Charlemagne decreed that those hospitals that had been well conducted before his time and had fallen into decay should be restored in accordance with the needs of the time.&lt;ref name="capitulary_duplex_803_iii"&gt;Capitulary Duplex, 803, chapter iii&lt;/ref&gt; He further ordered that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery.&lt;ref name="capitulary_duplex_803_iii"/&gt;

During the 10th century, the monasteries became a dominant factor in hospital work. The famous Benedictine Abbey of Cluny, founded in 910, set the example which was widely imitated throughout France and Germany. Besides its infirmary for the religious, each monastery had a hospital in which externs were cared for. These were in charge of the ''eleemosynarius'', whose duties, carefully prescribed by the rule, included every sort of service that the visitor or patient could require.

As the eleemosynarius was obliged to seek out the sick and needy in the neighborhood, each monastery became a center for the relief of suffering. Among the monasteries notable in this respect were those of the Benedictines at Corbie in Picardy, Hirschau, Braunweiler, Deutz, Ilsenburg, Liesborn, Pram, and Fulda; those of the Cistercians at Arnsberg, Baumgarten, Eberbach, Himmenrode, Herrnalb, Volkenrode, and Walkenried.

[[File:Hotel Dieu in Paris about 1500.gif|thumb|left|[[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]] c. 1500. The comparatively well patients (on the right) were separated from the very ill (on the left).]]
No less efficient was the work done by the [[diocese|diocesan clergy]] in accordance with the disciplinary enactments of the councils of Aachen (817, 836), which prescribed that a hospital should be maintained in connection with each collegiate church. The canons were obliged to contribute towards the support of the hospital, and one of their number had charge of the inmates. As these hospitals were located in cities, more numerous demands were made upon them than upon those attached to the monasteries. In this movement the [[bishop]] naturally took the lead, hence the hospitals founded by [[Heribert]] (d. 1021) in [[Cologne]], [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Godard]] (d. 1038) in [[Hildesheim]], [[Conrad of Constance|Conrad]] (d. 975) in [[Constance]], and [[Ulrich]] (d. 973) in [[Augsburg]]. But similar provision was made by the other churches; thus at [[Trier]] the hospitals of [[Maximin of Trier|Saint Maximin]], [[Saint Matthew]], [[Simon Peter|Saint Simeon]], and [[James the Just|Saint James]] took their names from the churches to which they were attached. During the period 1207–1577 no less than one hundred and fifty-five hospitals were founded in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Virchow in "Gesch. Abhandl.", II&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ospedale Maggiore]], traditionally named Ca' Granda (i.e. Big House), in [[Milan]], northern Italy, was constructed to house one of the first community hospitals, the largest such undertaking of the fifteenth century. Commissioned by [[Francesco Sforza]] in 1456 and designed by [[Antonio Filarete]] it is among the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Lombardy.

The Normans brought their hospital system along when they conquered England in 1066. By merging with traditional land-tenure and customs, the new charitable houses became popular and were distinct from both English monasteries and French hospitals.  They dispensed alms and some medicine, and were generously endowed by the nobility and gentry who counted on them for spiritual rewards after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = Sethina | year = 2006 | title = The Origins of the English Hospital | journal = Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Sixth Series | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 75–94 | jstor=25593861 | doi=10.1017/s0080440106000466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late medieval Europe ===
[[File:LesInvalidesFull.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LesInvalidesFull.JPG|right|thumb|The church at [[Les Invalides]] in France showing the often close connection between historical hospitals and churches]]
The Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, founded in 1099 (The Knights of Malta) itself has - as its raison d’être - the founding of a hospital for pilgrims to the Holy Land.   In Europe, Spanish hospitals are particularly noteworthy examples of Christian virtue as expressed through care for the sick, and were usually attached to a monastery in a ward-chapel configuration, most often erected in the shape of a cross.  This style reached a high point during the hospital building campaign of Portuguese St. John of God in the sixteenth-century, the founder of the Hospitaller Order of the Brothers of John of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Benjamin, Medieval and Renaissance Medicine, (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959) , 313. Catholic Encyclopedia, ed. Charles Herberman, et al., Vol. VII, “Hospitals”, (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910), 481-2. By 1715, 150 years after the death of St. John of God, over 250 hospitals had been constructed throughout Europe and the New World through the assistance of the Order he founded.   See Grace Goldin, Work of Mercy (Ontario: Boston Mills Press, 1994), 33, 50-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon many monasteries were founded  throughout Europe, and everywhere there were hospitals like in Monte Cassino. By the 11th century, some monasteries were training their own physicians. Ideally, such physicians would uphold the Christianized ideal of the healer who offered mercy and charity towards all patients and soldiers, whatever their  status and prognosis might be. In the 6th–12th centuries the Benedictines established  lots of monk communities of this type. And later, in the 12th–13th centuries the Benedictines order built a network of  independent hospitals, initially to provide general care to the sick and wounded and then for treatment of syphilis and  isolation of patients with communicable disease. The hospital movement spread  through Europe in the subsequent  centuries, with a 225-bed hospital being  built at York in 1287 and even larger facilities established at Florence, Paris, Milan, Siena, and other medieval big European cities.

In the North during the late Saxon period, monasteries, nunneries, and hospitals functioned mainly as a site of charity to the poor. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of 1066, hospitals are found to be autonomous, freestanding institutions. They dispensed alms and some medicine, and were generously endowed by the nobility and gentry who counted on them for spiritual rewards after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watson Sethina|year=2006|title=The Origins of the English Hospital|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Sixth Series|volume=16|issue=|pages=75–94|doi=10.1017/s0080440106000466|jstor=25593861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, hospitals became popular charitable houses that were distinct from both English monasteries and French hospitals.

The primary function of medieval hospitals was to worship to God. Most hospitals contained one chapel, at least one clergyman, and inmates that were expected to help with prayer. Worship was often a higher priority than care and was a large part of hospital life until and long after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. Worship in medieval hospitals served as a way of alleviating ailments of the sick and insuring their salvation when relief from sickness could not be achieved.&lt;ref name="English Hospital"&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Hospital|last1=Orme|first1=Nicholas|last2=Webster|first2=Margaret|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06058-4|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowers"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval Hospital and Medical Practice|last1=Bowers|first1=Barbara S.|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|isbn=978-0-7546-5110-9|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secondary function of medieval hospitals was charity to the poor, sick, and travellers. Charity provided by hospitals surfaced in different ways, including long-term maintenance of the infirm, medium-term care of the sick, short-term hospitality to travellers, and regular distribution of alms to the poor.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|58}} Though these were general acts of charity among medieval hospitals, the degree of charity was variable. For example, some institutions that perceived themselves mainly as a religious house or place of hospitality turned away the sick or dying in fear that difficult healthcare will distract from worship. Others, however, such as St. James of Northallerton, St. Giles of Norwich, and St. Leonard of York, contained specific ordinances stating they must cater to the sick and that "all who entered with ill health should be allowed to stay until they recovered or died".&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|58}}

The tertiary function of medieval hospitals was to support education and learning. Originally, hospitals educated chaplains and priestly brothers in literacy and history; however, by the 13th century, some hospitals became involved in the education of impoverished boys and young adults. Soon after, hospitals began to provide food and shelter for scholars within the hospital in return for helping with chapel worship.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|65}}

Three well-documented medieval European hospitals are St. Giles in Norwich, St. Anthony's in London, and St. Leonards in York.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hospital Life : Theory and Practice from the Medieval to the Modern|last=Abreu|first=Laurinda|publisher=Pieterlen Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|year=2013|isbn=978-3-0353-0517-3|location=|pages=21–34|ref=Hospital Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Giles, along with St. Anthony's and St. Leonards, were open ward hospitals that cared for the poor and sick in three of medieval England's largest cities.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|23}} The study of these three hospitals can provide insight into the diet, medical care, cleanliness and daily life in a medieval hospital of Europe.

==== St Giles, Norwich ====
[[File:The_ruins_of_St._Giles_Leper_Hospital_-_geograph.org.uk_-_834044.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_ruins_of_St._Giles_Leper_Hospital_-_geograph.org.uk_-_834044.jpg|left|thumb|The ruins of St. Giles Hospital.]]
Discrepancies exist among sources regarding the founding of St. Giles of Norwich, or the "[[Great Hospital]]" as it is known today. Some sources maintain that it was founded in 1246.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name="Bowers" /&gt;{{rp|140}} &lt;ref name="Soul"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medicine for the Soul: The Life, Death and Resurrection of an English Medieval Hospital- St. Giles's Norwich, c. 1249–1550|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|date=1999|publisher=Sutton Publishing|isbn=978-0-7509-2009-4|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that it was founded in 1249.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Though the date may be debatable, it seems agreed upon that The [[Great Hospital]] was founded by Walter Suffield, a Bishop known to be very liberal to the poor especially in the city of Norwich.&lt;ref name="England"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Medieval Hospitals of England|last1=Clay|first1=Rotha Mary|date=1909|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-7905-4209-6|location=London|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Giles provided thirty beds and maintained within its ten-acre precinct, many meadows courtyards, ponds, and fruit trees until the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|23, 34}} The hospital cultivated many productive gardens abundant in [[apples]], [[leeks]], [[garlic]], [[onions]] and [[honey]]. The gardens were so productive that surplus goods were sold on the open market. St Giles of Norwich owned six manors and advowson of eleven churches.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|34}}

St Giles was unique in that food was provided for children who were getting free education elsewhere.&lt;ref name="England" /&gt;{{rp|27}} It is also noted that St Giles arranged for seven poor scholars to receive board at the hospital during their term at Norwich School.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|65}} Accommodations of early medieval hospitals were frequently communal. For example, in St Giles, the master and brothers ate in the common hall while sisters ate by themselves.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|90}} St Giles hospital was a complex building that housed a community of clergy with cloister and residential accommodation, a hospital and a parish church. St Giles was also wealthy enough to maintain its own kitchen and staff. This allowed poor men to receive a dish of meat, fish, eggs or cheese in addition to the customary daily ration of bread and drink.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|122}}

==== St Anthony's, London ====
St Anthony's was erected in the thirteenth century (some time before 1254), in the heart of London on Threadneedle Street, atop the less than ideal site of a Jewish synagogue.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|43,88}} &lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|23}} The chapel of St. Anthony's was built in 1310 without permission of the bishop of London. To prevents its degradation, the hospital petitioned for a chapel on the bishops terms.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|88}} Unlike St. Giles, there was insufficient land at St. Anthony's, London, for recreation or food production. As a result, herbs or 'erbys' and vegetables had to be bought on a daily basis for consumption by the entire community.&lt;ref name="Soul" /&gt;{{rp|178}} Accounts of foreign expenses at St. Anthony's also show the purchase of various spices, often with intrinsic medicinal qualities that could alter the level of heat and moisture within the body. Some of the spices bought include, saffron, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, lavender, pepper and mustard.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|35}} The amount spent on herbs, produce, and spices were far surpassed by the amount spent on fish and meat.

According to quarterly expenditure reports, fifty-eight percent of the quarterly budget was spent on meat, thirty-four percent on fish, three percent on pottage, two percent on dairy, one percent herbs and one percent on eggs.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The unusually detailed records of diet and expenditures at St. Anthony's have revealed that the diet of the clerical establishment ('the hall') and the diets of the almsmen, patients and children ('the hospital') were quite different and class-based.&lt;ref name="Soul" /&gt;{{rp|179}} During a typical week, "the entire community shared dishes of pottage, veal, mutton and eggs; the hall alone consumed pork, ribs of roast beef, duck, fresh salmon and eels; and the hospital was supplied with mutton, plaice and haddock."&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|41}} It is clear that the hall, or more wealthy, enjoyed extravagant meals of meat and fish, while the hospital, the patients and the poor, were fed simpler and cheaper food.

In addition to its reputation of spending lavishly on food, St. Anthony's was famous for its grammar school, choir and pigs, which roamed freely among the streets identified by bells.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Pigs on sale in London, which were considered by officials to be unfit for food were handed over to St. Anthony's. The pigs were fed through charity or by scavenging and later, when their condition improved, they were then taken by the hospital for use as food for the poor or sick.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|122}}

As mentioned, medieval hospitals became concerned in education and in the feeding and housing of students as early as the thirteenth century. In 1441, John Carpenter, the master of St. Anthony London, was able to finance a grammar school whose teachings were without fees to any student. This was the first source of free education in London and remained one of London's leading schools for one hundred years following its founding.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|144}}

In 1449, St. Anthony's received a handsome legacy for the support of a clerk to train scholars in both [[polyphony]] and [[plainsong]]. St. Anthony's became so famous for its choir that in 1469, the royal [[Minstrel|minstrels]] set up a fraternity at the hospital so they may also study music.&lt;ref name="Soul" /&gt;{{rp|125}}

==== St Leonards, York ====
[[File:Remains_of_St_Leonards_Hospital,_York_-_panoramio.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_St_Leonards_Hospital,_York_-_panoramio.jpg|right|thumb|The remains of St Leonard's hospital.]]
St Leonard's was one on England's largest and richest hospitals with a primary purpose of caring for the poor, the sick, the old and infirm.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|24}} It maintained 200 beds and in its prosperous days, "maintained up to eighteen clergy, 16 sister and female servants, 30 choristers, 10 private boarders (corrodarians) and between 144 and 240 poor sick people."&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|36}} Additionally, during Easter of 1370, records show accommodation of 224 sick and poor in the infirmary and 23 children in the orphanage.&lt;ref name="England" /&gt;{{rp|156}}

The records of St Leonard provide the best details of daily hospital worship and patient life. In 1249, for example, [[matins]] and [[lauds]] were said in the morning hours of darkness, followed by mass of the [[Virgin Mary]] held by members of the clergy. The "lesser hours and mass of the day were said at mid-morning, vespers in the afternoon and compline in the early evening after supper." &lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|50, 52}} Sisters at St. Leonard's were instructed to feed the poor and the sick, wash them, and lead them around the grounds.&lt;ref name="Hospital Life" /&gt;{{rp|43}} Although the food given to the sick were the simple, and often quite cheap, daily provisions, sisters were allowed to distribute special food if they were very ill.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|62}}

At St Leonard's, charity and care for the sick was not only given to inmates of the hospitals, but also to the poor in other neighboring institutions as well as inmates of local leper houses.&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|63}} Additionally, one or two of the chaplains at St Leonard's were instructed to "minister spiritually to the poor by speaking consoling words, hearing confessions, and administering the sacraments".&lt;ref name="English Hospital" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], the word "[[bimaristan]]" referred to a hospital establishment where the ill were welcomed, cared for and treated by qualified staff.

The [[United States National Library of Medicine]] credits the hospital as being a product of [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic civilization]]. Compared to contemporaneous Christian institutions, which were poor and sick relief facilities offered by some monasteries, the Islamic hospital was a more elaborate institution with a wider range of functions. In [[Islam]], there was a moral imperative to treat the ill regardless of financial status. Islamic hospitals tended to be large, urban structures, and were largely secular institutions, many open to all, whether male or female, civilian or military, child or adult, rich or poor, Muslim or non-Muslim. The Islamic hospital served several purposes, as a center of medical treatment, a home for patients recovering from illness or accidents, an insane asylum, and a retirement home with basic maintenance needs for the aged and infirm.&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_12.html Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Hospitals], [[United States National Library of Medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical hospital was divided into departments such as systemic diseases, surgery and orthopedics with larger hospitals having more diverse specialties. "Systemic diseases" was the rough equivalent of today's [[internal medicine]] and was further divided into sections such as fever, infections and digestive issues. Every department had an officer-in-charge, a presiding officer and a supervising specialist. The hospitals also had lecture theaters and libraries. Hospitals staff included sanitary inspectors, who regulated cleanliness, and accountants and other administrative staff.&lt;ref name=aramco0317/&gt; The hospital in Baghdad employed twenty-five staff physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Husain F. Nagamia, ''Islamic Medicine History and Current Practice'', (2003), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The hospitals were typically run by a three-man board comprising a non-medical administrator, the chief pharmacist, called the shaykh saydalani, who was equal in rank to the chief physician, who served as mutwalli (dean).&lt;ref name=aramco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aramcoworld.com/en-US/Articles/May-2016/The-Islamic-Roots-of-Modern-Pharmacy|title=The Islamic roots of modern pharmacy|publisher=aramcoworld.com|accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical facilities traditionally closed each night, but by the 10th century laws were passed to keep hospitals open 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name =sdouglas/&gt;

For less serious cases, physicians staffed outpatient clinics. Cities also had first aid centers staffed by physicians for emergencies that were often located in busy public places, such as big gatherings for Friday prayers to take care of casualties. The region also had mobile units staffed by doctors and pharmacists who were supposed to meet the need of remote communities. Baghdad was also known to have a separate hospital for convicts since the early 10th century after the vizier ‘Ali ibn Isa ibn Jarah ibn Thabit wrote to Baghdad’s chief medical officer that “prisons must have their own doctors who should examine them every day”. The first hospital built in Egypt, in Cairo's Southwestern quarter, was the first documented facility to care for [[Psychology in medieval Islam|mental illness]]es while the first Islamic [[psychiatric hospital]] opened in Baghdad in 705.&lt;ref name="Medicine And Health"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/history/islam-science-technology-health/sub12.html Medicine And Health], "Rise and Spread of Islam 622–1500: Science, Technology, Health", ''World Eras'', [[Thomson Gale]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aramco0317&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aramcoworld.com/en-US/Articles/March-2017/The-Islamic-Roots-of-the-Modern-Hospital|title=The Islamic Roots of the Modern Hospital|publisher=aramcoworld.com|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical students would accompany physicians and participate in patient care. Hospitals in this era were the first to require medical diplomas to license doctors.&lt;ref name=Alatas&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From Jami'ah to University: Multiculturalism and Christian–Muslim Dialogue|first=Syed Farid|last=Alatas|journal=Current Sociology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=112–32|doi=10.1177/0011392106058837|year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing test was administered by the region's government appointed chief medical officer. The test had two steps; the first was to write a treatise, on the subject the candidate wished to obtain a certificate, of original research or commentary of existing texts, which they were encouraged to scrutinize for errors. The second step was to answer questions in an interview with the chief medical officer. Physicians worked fixed hours and medical staff salaries were fixed by law. For regulating the quality of care and arbitrating cases, it is related that if a patient dies, their family presents the doctor's prescriptions to the chief physician who would judge if the death was natural or if it was by negligence, in which case the family would be entitled to compensation from the doctor. The hospitals had male and female quarters while some hospitals only saw men and other hospitals, staffed by women physicians, only saw women.&lt;ref name=aramco0317/&gt; While women physicians practiced medicine, many largely focused on [[obstetrics]].&lt;ref name=aramco0816&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.org/8597/pioneer-muslim-physicians/|title=Pioneer Muslim Physicians|publisher=aramcoworld.com|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitals were forbidden by law to turn away patients who were unable to pay.&lt;ref name =sdouglas&gt;

==Early modern Europe==
[[File:Physician in hospital sickroom printed 1682.jpg|thumb|A physician visiting the [[disease|sick]] in a hospital, German [[engraving]] from 1682]]
In Europe the medieval concept of Christian care evolved during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into a secular one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Cunningham|author2=Ole Peter Grell|title=Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe 1500–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dd-44kXLh1QC&amp;pg=PA130|year= 2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=130–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theology was the problem.  The Protestant reformers rejected the Catholic belief that rich men could gain God's grace through good works – and escape purgatory – by providing endowments to charitable institutions, and that the patients themselves could gain grace through their suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

After the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in 1540 by King [[Henry VIII]] the church abruptly ceased to be the supporter of hospitals, and only by direct petition from the citizens of [[London]], were the hospitals [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St Bartholomew's]], [[St Thomas's Hospital|St Thomas's]] and [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|St Mary of Bethlehem's]] (Bedlam) endowed directly by the crown; this was the first instance of secular support being provided for medical institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keir Waddington|title=Medical Education at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1123–1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mi5cV5D0SkAC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at St. Bartholomew that [[William Harvey]] conducted his research on the circulatory system in the 17th century, [[Percivall Pott]] and [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]] developed important principles of modern surgery in the 18th century, and Mrs. Bedford Fenwich worked to advance the nursing profession in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = James O. | year = 1993 | title = The Royal and Ancient Hospital of St Bartholomew (Founded 1123) | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Biography | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 23–30 | doi=10.1177/096777209300100105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 28 asylums in [[Sweden]] at the start of the [[Reformation]]. [[Gustav Vasa]] removed them from church control and expelled the monks and nuns, but allowed the asylums to keep their properties and to continue their activities under the auspices of local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Virpi Mäkinen|title=Lutheran Reformation And the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Dkk1CDZ1UsC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|pages=227–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of Europe town governments operated small Holy Spirit hospitals, which had been founded in the 13th and 14th centuries. They distributed free food and clothing to the poor, provided for homeless women and children, and gave some medical and nursing care. Many were raided and closed during the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–48), which ravaged the towns and villages of Germany and neighboring areas for three decades.

Meanwhile, in Catholic lands such as [[France]], rich families continued to fund convents and monasteries that provided free health services to the poor.  French practices were influenced by a charitable imperative which considered care of the poor and the sick to be a necessary part of Catholic practice. The nursing nuns had little faith in the power of physicians and their medicines alone to cure the sick; more important was providing psychological and physical comfort, nourishment, rest, cleanliness and especially prayer.&lt;ref&gt;	    Olwen Hufton, ''The Prospect before Her. A History of Women in Western Europe, 1500–1800'' (1995), pp 382–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Protestant areas the emphasis was on scientific rather than religious aspects of patient care, and this helped develop a view of nursing as a profession rather than a vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McHugh, "Expanding Women’s Rural Medical Work in Early Modern Brittany: The Daughters of the Holy Spirit," ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' (2012) 67#3 pp  428-456.

==Enlightenment==
In the 18th century, under the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the modern hospital began to appear, serving only medical needs and staffed with trained physicians and surgeons. The nurses were untrained workers. The goal was to use modern methods to cure patients. They provided more narrow medical services, and were founded by the secular authorities. A clearer distinction emerged between medicine and poor relief. Within the hospitals, acute cases were increasingly treated alone, and separate departments were set up for different categories of patient.

[[Image:Guy's Hospital00.jpg|thumb|left|1820 Engraving of [[Guy's Hospital]] in [[London]] one of the first voluntary hospitals to be established in 1724.]]
The voluntary hospital movement began in the early 18th century, with hospitals being founded in London by the 1710s and 20s, including [[Westminster Hospital]] (1719) promoted by the [[private bank]] [[C. Hoare &amp; Co]] and [[Guy's Hospital]] (1724) funded from the bequest of the wealthy merchant, [[Thomas Guy]]. Other hospitals sprang up in London and other British cities over the century, many paid for by private subscriptions.  St. Bartholomew's in London was rebuilt in 1730, and the London Hospital opened in 1752.

These hospitals represented a turning point in the function of the institution; they began to evolve from being basic places of care for the sick to becoming centres of medical innovation and discovery and the principle place for the [[medical education|education]] and training of prospective practitioners. Some of the era's greatest [[surgeon]]s and doctors worked and passed on their knowledge at the hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-70967-3_4|title=Corpus Curricula: Medical Education and the Voluntary Hospital Movement |accessdate=2012-12-17|author=Reinarz, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also changed from being mere homes of refuge to being complex institutions for the provision of medicine and care for sick. The [[Charité]] was founded in Berlin in 1710 by King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] as a response to an outbreak of plague.

The concept of voluntary hospitals also spread to [[Colonial America]]; the [[Bellevue Hospital]] opened in 1736, [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] in 1752, [[New York Hospital]] in 1771, and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in 1811.  When the [[Vienna General Hospital]] opened in 1784 (instantly becoming the world's largest hospital), physicians acquired a new facility that gradually developed into one of the most important research centres.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick E. McGrew, ''Encyclopedia of Medical History'' (Macmillan 1985), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era charitable innovation was the dispensary; these would issue the poor with [[medicine]]s free of charge. The London Dispensary opened its doors in 1696 as the first such clinic in the British Empire. The idea was slow to catch on until the 1770s, when many such organizations began to appear, including the [[Public Dispensary of Edinburgh]] (1776), the [[Metropolitan Dispensary and Charitable Fund]] (1779) and the [[Finsbury Dispensary]] (1780). Dispensaries were also opened in New York 1771, Philadelphia 1786, and Boston 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Marks Davis|author2=Andrew Robert Warner|title=Dispensaries, Their Management and Development: A Book for Administrators, Public Health Workers, and All Interested in Better Medical Service for the People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QME0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2|year=1918|publisher=MacMillan|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Europe medical schools still relied primarily on lectures and readings. In the final year, students would have limited clinical experience by following the professor through the wards. Laboratory work was uncommon, and [[dissection]]s were rarely done because of legal restrictions on [[cadaver]]s. Most schools were small, and only [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], with 11,000 alumni, produced large numbers of graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H.  Broman, "The Medical Sciences,"   in Roy Porter, ed, ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th-century Science'' (2003) pp. 465–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Rosner, ''Medical Education in the Age of Improvement: Edinburgh Students and Apprentices 1760–1826'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish Americas===
[[File:Hospicio Cabañas.JPG|thumb|[[Hospicio Cabañas]] was the largest hospital in colonial America, in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico]]
The first hospital founded in the Americas was the Hospital San Nicolás de Bari [Calle Hostos] in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Distrito Nacional]] [[Dominican Republic]]. Fray [[Nicolás de Ovando]], Spanish governor and colonial administrator from 1502–1509, authorized its construction on December 29, 1503. This hospital apparently incorporated a church. The first phase of its construction was completed in 1519, and it was rebuilt in 1552.&lt;ref name="Micheli 2005 p. 59"&gt;Alfredo De Micheli, En torno a la evolución de los hospitales, ''Gaceta Médica de México'', vol. 141, no. 1 (2005), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoned in the mid-18th century, the hospital now lies in ruins near the Cathedral in Santo Domingo.

[[Conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] founded the two earliest hospitals in North America: the [[Immaculate Conception]] Hospital and the Saint Lazarus Hospital. The oldest was the Immaculate Conception, now the [[Hospital de Jesús Nazareno]] in [[Mexico City]], founded in 1524 to care for the poor.&lt;ref name="Micheli 2005 p. 59"/&gt;

==Modern hospitals==
English physician [[Thomas Percival]] (1740–1804) wrote a comprehensive system of medical conduct, ''[[Medical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons]]'' (1803) that set the standard for many textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waddington | first1 = Ivan | year = 1975 | title = The Development of Medical Ethics – A Sociological Analysis | url = | journal = Medical History | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 36–51 | doi=10.1017/s002572730001992x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 19th century, hospitals and the medical profession became more professionalized, with a reorganization of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines. The [[Apothecaries Act 1815]] made it compulsory for medical students to practice for at least half a year at a hospital as part of their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages=316–17 | last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter | title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present | publisher=W.

By 1821 it was treating nearly 10,000 patients a year, and it was relocated to larger quarters near [[Charing Cross]] in the heart of London. Its [[Charing Cross Hospital Medical School]] opened in 1822.  It expanded several times and 1866 added a professional nursing staff.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Minney, ''The Two Pillars Of Charing Cross: The Story of a Famous Hospital'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ER room after a trauma.jpg|thumb|[[Resuscitation]] room bed after a [[physical trauma|trauma]] intervention, showing the highly technical equipment of modern hospitals]]

[[Florence Nightingale]] pioneered the modern profession of [[nursing]] during the [[Crimean War]] when she set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. The first official nurses’ training programme, the Nightingale School for Nurses, was opened in 1860, with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals, to work with the poor and to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWP2AAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Fundamentals of Mental Health Nursing|author=Kathy Neeb|year=2006|publisher=Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital, by improving [[sanitation]] standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die, to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing. She also emphasized the importance of [[statistics|statistical measurement]] for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for [[Public administration|administrative reform]] at hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRpgFsQ7nqkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=sanitary+commissioner+Scutari |title=Florence Nightingale: Measuring Hospital Care Outcomes |publisher=|date= August 1999|accessdate=13 March 2010|isbn=0-86688-559-5|author1=Nightingale, Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the middle of the 19th century, the [[Vienna General Hospital|Second Viennese Medical School]] emerged with the contributions of physicians such as [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]], [[Josef Škoda]], [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra]], and [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]]. Basic medical science expanded and specialization advanced. Furthermore, the first dermatology, eye, as well as ear, nose, and throat clinics in the world were founded in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Erna Lesky, ''The Vienna Medical School of the 19th Century'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the modern hospital was beginning to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems. By the 1870s, hospitals had more than tripled their original average intake of 3,000 patients. In [[continental Europe]] the new hospitals generally were built and run from [[public fund]]s. Nursing was professionalized in France by the turn of the 20th century. At that time, the country's 1,500 hospitals were operated by 15,000 [[nun]]s representing over 200 [[religious order]]s. Government policy after 1900 was to [[secularism|secularize]] public institutions, and diminish the role the [[Catholic Church]]. This political goal came in conflict with the need to maintain better quality of medical care in antiquated facilities. New government-operated nursing schools turned out nonreligous nurses who were slated for supervisory roles. During the [[First World War]], an outpouring of [[patriotism|patriotic volunteers]] brought large numbers of untrained middle-class women into the military hospitals. They left when the war ended but the long-term effect was to heighten the prestige of nursing. In 1922 the government issued a national diploma for nursing.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Schultheiss, ''Bodies and Souls: politics and the professionalization of nursing in France, 1880–1922'' (2001), pp. 3–11, 99, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the number of hospitals reached 4400 in 1910, when they provided 420,000 beds.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; These were operated by city, state and federal agencies, by churches, by stand-alone non-profits, and by [[for-profit hospital|for-profit]] enterprises. All the major denominations built hospitals; the 541 Catholic ones (in 1915) were staffed primarily by unpaid nuns. The others sometimes had a small cadre of [[deaconesses]] as staff.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Statistics of the United States'' (1976) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-profit hospital]]s were supplemented by large [[public hospital]]s in major cities and research hospitals often affiliated with a medical school. The largest public hospital system in America is the [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation]], which includes [[Bellevue Hospital]], the oldest U.S. hospital, affiliated with [[New York University Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbra Mann Wall, ''American Catholic Hospitals: A Century of Changing Markets and Missions'' (Rutgers University Press; 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Health Service]], the principal provider of health care in Britain, was founded in 1948, and took control of nearly all the hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gorsky, "The British National Health Service 1948–2008: A Review of the Historiography," Social History of Medicine, Dec 2008, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp. 437–60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paris Medicine ===
At the turn of the 19th century, Paris medicine played a significant role in shaping clinical medicine. New emphasis on physically examining the body led to methods such as [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]], inspection, [[palpation]], [[auscultation]], and [[autopsy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Dora B.|last2=Sauter|first2=Michael J.|date=2003-01-01|title=The city of Paris and the rise of clinical medicine|journal=Osiris|volume=18|pages=23–42|issn=0369-7827|pmid=12964569|doi=10.1086/649375}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation in Paris was particularly unique due to the fact that there was a very large concentration of medical professionals in a very small setting allowing for a large flow of ideas and the spread of innovation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the innovations to come out of the Paris hospital setting was [[René Laennec|Laennec]]'s [[stethoscope]]. Weiner states that the widespread acceptance of the stethoscope would likely not have happened in any other setting, and the setting allowed for Laennec to pass on this technology to the eager medical community that had gathered there. This invention also brought even more attention to the Paris scene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Before the start of the 19th century, there were many problems existing within the French medical system. These problems were outlined by many seeking to reform hospitals including a contemporary surgeon Jacques Tenon in his book ''Memoirs on Paris Hospitals''. Some of the problems Tenon drew attention to were the lack of space, the inability to separate patients based on the type of illness (including those that were contagious), and general sanitation problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs on Paris Hospitals|last=Tenon|first=Jacques|publisher=Science History Publications|year=1996|isbn=0881350745|location=Canton, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the secular revolution led to the nationalization of hospitals previously owned by the Catholic Church and led to a call for a hospital reform which actually pushed for the deinstitutionalization of medicine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=William|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780521272056|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to the state of disarray Paris hospitals soon fell into which ultimately called for the establishment of a new hospital system outlined in the law of 1794. The law of 1794 played a significant part in revolutionizing Paris Medicine because it aimed to address some of the problems facing Paris Hospitals of the time.

First, the law of 1794 created three new schools in Paris, Montpellier, and Strasbour due to the lack of medical professionals available to treat a growing French army. It also gave physicians and surgeons equal status in the hospital environment, whereas previously physicians were regarded as intellectually superior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to the integration of surgery into traditional medical  education contributing to a new breed of doctors that focused on [[pathology]], [[anatomy]] and diagnosis. The new focus on anatomy was further facilitated by this law because it ensured that medical students had enough bodies to dissect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, pathological education was furthered by the increased use of autopsies to determine a patient's cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, the law of 1794 allocated funds for full-time salaried teachers in hospitals, as well as creating scholarships for medical students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Overall, the law of 1794 contributed to the shift of medical teaching away from theory and towards practice and experience, all within a hospital setting. Hospitals became a center for learning and development of medical techniques, which was a departure from the previous notion of a hospital as an area that accepted people who needed help of any kind, ill or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals|last=Risse|first=Guenter|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780195055238|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift was consistent with much of the philosophy of the time, particularly the ideas of [[John Locke]] who preached that observation using ones senses was the best way to analyze and understand a phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Michel Foucault|Foucalt]], however, criticized this shift in his book ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]],'' stating that this shift took attention away from the patient and objectified patients, ultimately resulting in a loss of the patient's narrative. He argued that from this point forward, in the eyes of doctors, patients lost their humanity and became more like objects for inspection and examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780521732567|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next advancement in Paris medicine came with the creation of an examination system, that after 1803, was required for the licensing of all medical professions creating a uniform and centralized system of licensing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This law also created another class of health professionals, mostly for those living outside of cities, who did not have to go through the licensing pricess but instead went through a simpler and shorter training process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another area influenced by Paris hospitals was the development of specialties. The structure of a Paris hospital allowed physicians more freedom to pursue interests as well as providing the necessary resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of a physician who used this flexibility to conduct research is [[Philippe Pinel|Phillipe Pinel]] who conducted a four-year study on the hospitalization and treatment of mentally-ill women within the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtriére]] hospital. This was the first study ever done of this magnitude by a physician, and the Pinel was the first to realize that patients dealing with similar illnesses could be group together, compared, and classified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Church-sponsored hospitals and nurses==

===Protestants===
{{main|deaconess}}
[[File:Diacones Kerk Engeland.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Elizabeth Ferard|Elizabeth Catherine Ferard]], first deaconess of the [[Church of England]].]]
The [[Protestant church]]es reentered the health field in the 19th century, especially with the establishment of orders of women, called [[deaconess]]es who dedicated themselves to nursing services. This movement began in Germany in 1836 when [[Theodor Fliedner]] and his wife opened the first deaconess motherhouse in [[Kaiserswerth]] on the Rhine. It became a model, and within half a century there were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe. The [[Church of England]] named its first deaconess in 1862. The North London Deaconess Institution trained deaconesses for other dioceses and some served overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henrietta Blackmore|title=The beginning of women's ministry: the revival of the deaconess in the nineteenth-century Church of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LQxO03zXygC&amp;pg=PA131|publisher=Boydell Press|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Passavant]] in 1849 brought the first four deaconesses to Pittsburgh, in the United States, after visiting Kaiserswerth. They worked at the Pittsburgh Infirmary (now Passavant Hospital).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.oefgroup.com/34.html Christ Lutheran Church of Baden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007222534/http://www.oefgroup.com/34.html |date=2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[Methodist]]s made medical services a priority from the 1850s. They began opening charitable institutions such as orphanages and old people's homes. In the 1880s,  Methodists began opening hospitals in the United States, which served people of all religious beliefs. By 1895, 13 hospitals were in operation in major cities.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Crawford Berkeley, ''History of Methodist Missions: The Methodist Episcopal Church 1845–1939'' (1957) pp. 82, 192–93, 482&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholics===
In Quebec, Catholics operated hospitals continuously from the 1640s; they attracted nuns from the provincial elite. [[Jeanne Mance]] (1606–73) founded Montreal's city's first hospital, the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal]], in 1645. In 1657 she recruited three sisters of the [[Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph]], and continued to direct operations of the hospital. The project, begun by the niece of [[Cardinal de Richelieu]] was granted a royal charter by King [[Louis XIII]] and staffed by a colonial physician, [[Robert Giffard de Moncel]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Emery, "Angel of the Colony," ''Beaver'' (Aug/Sep 2006) 86:4 pp. 37–41. online&lt;/ref&gt;  The General Hospital in Quebec City opened in 1692.  They often handled malaria, dysentery, and respiratory sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rousseau | first1 = François | year = 1977 | title = Hôpital et Société en Nouvelle-France: L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec À la Fin du XVIIie Siècle | url = | journal = Revue d'histoire de L'Amerique francaise | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 29–47 | doi=10.7202/303581ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s–1880s era, Catholics in Philadelphia founded two hospitals, for the Irish and German Catholics. They depended on revenues from the paying sick, and became important health and welfare institutions in the Catholic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farr Casterline | first1 = Gail | year = 1984 | title = St. Joseph's and St. Mary's: The Origins of Catholic Hospitals in Philadelphia | url = | journal = Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 289–314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1900 the Catholics had set up hospitals in most major cities. In New York the Dominicans, Franciscans, Sisters of Charity, and other orders set up hospitals to care primarily for their own ethnic group. By the 1920s they were serving everyone in the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCauley | first1 = Bernadette | year = 1997 | title = 'Sublime Anomalies': Women Religious and Roman Catholic Hospitals in New York City, 1850–1920 | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine &amp; Allied Sciences | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 289–309 | doi=10.1093/jhmas/52.3.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In smaller cities too the Catholics set up hospitals, such as St. Patrick Hospital in [[Missoula, Montana]]. The Sisters of Providence opened it in 1873. It was in part funded by the county contract to care for the poor, and also operated a day school and a boarding school. The nuns provided nursing care especially for infectious diseases and traumatic injuries among the young, heavily male clientele. They also proselytized the patients to attract converts and restore lapsed Catholics back into the Church. They built a larger hospital in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savitt | first1 = Todd L. | last2 = Willms | first2 = Janice | year = 2003 | title = Sisters' Hospital: The Sisters of Providence and St. Patrick Hospital, Missoula, Montana, 1873–1890 | url = | journal = Montana: The Magazine of Western History | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 28–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic hospitals were largely staffed by Catholic orders of nuns, and nursing students, until the population of nuns dropped sharply after the 1960s.  The Catholic Hospital Association formed in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Barbra Mann Wall, ''Unlikely Entrepreneurs: Catholic Sisters and the Hospital Marketplace, 1865–1925'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbra Mann Wall, ''American Catholic Hospitals: A Century of Changing Markets and Missions'' (Rutgers University Press; 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Klah rug.jpg|thumb|A weaving based on a Whirling Log ceremony [[sand painting]] by Klah, circa 1925.]]
'''Hosteen Klah''' ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|'''Hastiin Tłʼa'''}}}}, 1867– February 27, 1937)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heardguild.org/hosteen-klah/|title=Hosteen Klah|website=www.heardguild.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] artist and medicine man. He documented aspects of Navajo religion and related [[Ceremonies|ceremonial practices]]. He was also a master [[weaving|weaver]].

==Background==
Hosteen Klah, also spelled Hastiin Klah, was born in 1867 at Bear Mountain, near [[Fort Wingate, New Mexico]]. His name essentially means Sir Left Handed in Navajo; in his youth, he was called Ahway Eskay ({{spell-nv|Awééʼ ashkii}}). Hoksay Nolyae was his father and Ahson Tsosie, of the {{spell-nv|Tsétaaʼáanii}} Clan, was his mother.&lt;ref name=lapahie&gt;Lapahie, Harrison, Jr. [http://www.lapahie.com/Hosteen_Klah.cfm Hosteen Klah (Sir Left Handed).] ''Lapahie.com.'' 2001 (retrieved 19 Oct 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Klah was born after the Navajos’ return to their homelands from forced government [[internment]] at [[Bosque Redondo]]. Klah avoided attending government school;&lt;ref name=bp&gt;Berlo and Philips, 34&lt;/ref&gt; rather, he received training in the traditionally male realm of ceremonial practices (chanting and [[sandpainting]]) from his uncle. While most individuals master only one or two complete chants, Klah mastered at least eight.

==Gender==
Hosteen Klah is most commonly believed to be [[intersex]].&lt;ref name=lapahie/&gt; Klah was important to the development of Navajo weaving. Among the Navajo, weavers are typically women, and chanters ({{spell-nv|hataałii}}) are normally male. Hosteen Klah was both a weaver and a chanter. This was possible because of his particular gender status. Klah was a ''{{spell-nv|[[Nádleehi]]|nádleeh}}'' (meaning [[two-spirit|"one who is transformed"]] or "one who changes"). A {{spell-nv|nádleeh}} could be born male, female, or intersex.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;

==Weaving==
Identified as a {{spell-nv|nádleeh}} in adolescence, Klah began his training in the traditionally female craft of weaving with his mother and sister in the 1880s. Klah wove his first complete weaving at the 1892–1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=lapahie/&gt;&lt;ref name=bp/&gt; where he was probably part of a [[sandpainting]] demonstration.

In 1916, Klah wove imagery from the {{spell-nv|Yéʼii bicheii}} dance into a rug. He incorporated more representations of Navajo religion into his weaving, including sandpainting imagery by 1919. This practice was regarded as sacrilegious by many Navajo traditionalists&lt;ref name=lapahie/&gt;&lt;ref name=bp/&gt; and is regarded as such by some Navajo people today.

Klah taught his two nieces both his weaving techniques and designs.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;

==Wheelwright Museum==
In 1921, Hosteen Klah was introduced to [[Mary Cabot Wheelwright]], a Boston heiress. The two became friends and collaborated in founding the [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Fearing for the future of Navajo religion after witnessing decades of assimilationist assaults on traditional culture by missionaries and the US government, Klah wanted to document Navajo religion and make it available for future generations. The museum was initially called the Navajo House of Prayer and House of Navajo Religion, but then renamed the Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art, and ultimately renamed in 1977, when the museum repatriated sensitive cultural patrimony back to the [[Navajo Nation]].&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;[http://www.wheelwright.org/about.html "About the Museum."] ''Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.'' (retrieved 19 Oct 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hosteen Klah died on February 27, 1937 from [[pneumonia]], and he is buried on the grounds of the Wheelwright Museum.&lt;ref name=lapahie/&gt;

The '''International Federation for Emergency Medicine''' ('''IFEM''') is an organisation promoting [[international emergency medicine|international]] [[emergency medicine]] around the world.&lt;ref name = Arnold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold |first=Jeffrey L. |title=International Emergency Medicine and the Recent Development of Emergency Medicine Worldwide |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=33 |issue=1 |date=January 1999 |pages=97–103 |pmid=9867895 |doi=10.1016/s0196-0644(99)70424-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a consortium of over 60 national [[emergency medicine]] organisations. IFEM organises the [[International Conference on Emergency Medicine]] (''ICEM'').

==International emergency medicine==
International emergency medicine has been defined as "the area of emergency medicine concerned with the development of emergency medicine in other countries."&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt; In that definition, "other countries" refers to nations that do not have a mature emergency care system (exemplified by [[board certified]] emergency physicians and academic emergency medicine, among other things). Included in those nations are some that are otherwise quite developed but lack a complete emergency medical system, such as Armenia, China, Israel, Nicaragua, and the Philippines.&lt;ref name = Arnold /&gt; Work in international emergency medicine can be broken down into two main categories: 1) the promotion of emergency medicine as a recognized and established specialty in other countries, and 2) The provision of [[humanitarian assistance]].&lt;ref name= Sistenich&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sistenich |first=Vera |title=International Emergency Medicine: How to Train for It |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=August 2012 |pages=435–441 |pmid=22862762 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2012.01563.x|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1038653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, and Kenneth Iserson have criticized the above definition for being an oxymoron, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From their point of view, international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as the training required for, as well as the reality of, practicing the specialty abroad from one's native country.&lt;ref name = Burdick&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burdick |first1=William P. |first2=Mark |last2=Hauswald |first3=Kenneth V. |last3=Iserson |title=International Emergency Medicine |journal=Academic Emergency Medicine |volume=17 |issue=7 |year=2010 |pages=758–761 |pmid=20653591 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2010.00805.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The precursor to the International Foundation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) was the [[International Conference on Emergency Medicine]] (ICEM), which was first held in 1986 in London. The idea of having such a conference had been first suggested by William Rutherford and Gautam Bodiwala at the Scientific Assembly of the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] (ACEP) in 1984.&lt;ref name=Bodiwala&gt;{{cite journal |title=Emergency Medicine: A global specialty |last1=Bodiwala |first1=Gautam |year=2007 |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |pmid=17655627 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2007.00989.x |volume=19 |pages=287–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only four organizations present at this first conference were ACEP, the [[British Association for Emergency Medicine]] (BAEM), the [[Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians]] (CAEP), and the [[Australasian College for Emergency Medicine]] (ACEM). In 1988, at the second ICEM in Brisbane, Australia, the idea of creating an international emergency medicine organization was first proposed.&lt;ref name=Bodiwala/&gt; The following year, the four organizations agreed to form IFEM, although their presidents did not sign the charter until 1991.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM/History.aspx |title=History |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Alliance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalsepsisalliance.com/gsa-members/the-international-federation-for-emergency-medicine/ |title=The International Federation for Emergency Medicine |website=Global Sepsis Alliance |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial purpose was to assist them in running ICEM, which was important because it allowed "the founding nations to share experiences, network, develop collaborations and assist trainees and specialists to rotate between countries and learn new approaches to old problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Peter |last2=Hobgood |first2=Cherri |last3=Mulligan |first3=Terrence |year=2009 |title=Developments in International Emergency Medicine |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |volume=21 |pages=339–341 |publisher=Australasian College for Emergency Medicine and Australasian Society for Emergency Medicine |url=http://www.acep.org/uploadedFiles/ACEP/Membership/Sections_of_Membership/intnatl/news/INTERNATIONAL%201209EditorialforEMAonInternationalCurriculum.pdf |pmid=19840083 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01211.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = holliman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM.aspx |title=The International Federation for Emergency Medicine: Its History, Structure, and Plans for the Future |last1=Holliman |first1=Jim |last2= |first2= |year=2012 |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, IFEM opened up membership to other national emergency medicine organizations. Since then, membership has grown rapidly, with 15 additional national emergency medicine organizations joining by 2003, bringing the total number of members to 19.&lt;ref name= alagappan2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alagappan |first1=Kumar |last2=Holliman |first2=C. James |year=2005 |title=History of the Development of International Emergency Medicine |journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America  |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages= 1–10|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |doi=10.1016/j.emc.2004.09.013 |pmid=15663970}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, IFEM had more than 40 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curry |first1=Chris |year=2013 |title=Setting up a Emergency Medicine Training Program |journal=Journal of Nepal Health Resource Council |volume=11 |issue=23 |pages=76–79 |publisher=Nepal Health Research Council |pmid=23787532}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, IFEM represents over 60 national emergency medicine organizations.&lt;ref name = Alliance/&gt;

==Mission==
The stated mission of IFEM is "to promote at an international level interchange, understanding and cooperation among physicians practicing emergency medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collemergencymed.ac.uk/Development/International/IFEM/default.asp |title=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |website=The College of Emergency Medicine |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has nine principles and sixteen aims, all of which be summarized by IFEM's general aim "to be recognized as the international voice for quality emergency medical care."&lt;ref name=Mission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Mission_and_Goals.aspx |title=Mission and Goals |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |accessdate=9 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920172435/http://ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Mission_and_Goals.aspx |archivedate=20 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it supports the following principles: 
:1. All countries should provide unrestricted access to emergency healthcare. 
:2. Emergency medicine encompasses a unique and specified body of knowledge and should be recognized as a distinct independent medical specialty in all countries.&lt;ref name=Mission/&gt;

==Organization==

===Types of members===

IFEM has three levels of membership: full members, affiliate members, and [[ex officio]] members.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt;

A full member is defined as "the leading national emergency medicine organization for physicians in a country in which emergency medicine is officially recognized as a medical specialty and where there also exists at least one recognized training program in emergency medicine." They may appoint one representative to the IFEM Board; this representative has one vote. Full members can apply to host ICEM.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt; As of 2013, there are 34 full members.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt;

An affiliate member is defined as "any national emergency medicine organization for physicians practicing emergency medicine in a country where the specialty of emergency medicine is not yet officially recognized or residency equivalent training programs in emergency medicine do not yet exist." They may also be any additional national emergency medicine organization for physicians practicing emergency medicine from a country already represented by a full or founding member. Affiliate members may appoint one non-voting member to the IFEM Board. Like full members, they can apply to host ICEM."&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt; As of 2013, there are 14 affiliate members.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt;

An ''ex officio'' member is defined as a multinational emergency medicine organisation.  They may appoint one non-voting member to the IFEM Board.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt; As of 2013, there are 5 ''ex officio'' members.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt;

|-
| Affiliate || Yes || No || Yes || Yes
|-
| ''Ex officio'' || Yes || No || No || No
|}

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;An organization from a country with a per capita [[Gross national income|GNI]] below a certain threshold will have its annual subscription waived.

===Governing structure===

IFEM was incorporated as a public company limited by guarantee in Australia in 2010. As of 2013, it has three components to its governing structure: a board, an executive, and an assembly.&lt;ref name=Governance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Governance.aspx |title=Governance |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine  |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2011, the IFEM Board was composed of a representative from each member country,&lt;ref name=Governance/&gt; with full members having one voting representative and affiliate and ''ex officio'' members having one non-voting representative.&lt;ref name=Membership/&gt; By that point, IFEM has over 50 full, affiliate, and ''ex officio'' members, resulting in a board whose size was unwieldy. It was then agreed that a new board of 12 members would be established in 2012. Six of these members consist of office-bearers from the IFEM Executive, with the other six being representatives from six geographic regions: Africa, Australasia, Europe, North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaem.org/calendar/current-news&amp;item=2785 |title=AAEM Members Honored by International Federation for Emergency Medicine |website=American Academy of Emergency Medicine |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South America.&lt;ref name=Governance/&gt;

The IFEM Executive was established in 2006 to improve responsiveness. It consists of six office-bearers: a president, vice-president, president-elect, secretary, treasurer, and member-at-large. As of 2013, the president is Peter Cameron, the vice-president is James Ducharme, the president-elect is C. James Holliman, the secretary is Robert Schafermeyer, the treasurer is Andrew Singer, and the member-at-large is Hiu-fai Ho.&lt;ref name=Governance/&gt;

To replace the former Board, which previously represented all members, the IFEM Assembly was created. It is composed of one voting representative from each founding member and one voting representative from each full member. Representatives from affiliate members may attend and participate in Assembly meeting but do not have voting rights. The Assembly’s primary purpose is to ratify or reject proposals brought forward by either the board or the executive. Thus, it has the final decision-making power for major issues related to the IFEM.&lt;ref name=Governance/&gt;

===Committees and special interest groups===

The IFEM Board can establish committees to perform focused work on behalf of IFEM. Committees established by the board include a finance committee, a core curriculum and education committee, nominations committee, specialty implementation committee, governance committee, clinical practice committee, and research committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ifem.cc/site/DefaultSite/filesystem/documents/IFEM%20Documents/IFEM%20Bylaws%2017%20Oct%202011.pdf| title=Bylaws of the International Federation for Emergency Medicine |date =17 October 2011 |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |pages=11–13 |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership on a committee is open to anyone who is part of an IFEM member society or college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Committees1.aspx |title=Committee |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFEM has four special interest groups: pediatric emergency medicine, triage, ultrasound, and disaster medicine.&lt;ref name=Governance/&gt; Each group reports to the clinical practice committee. Unlike committees, "other interested individuals" who are not part of an IFEM member society or college may join special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Special_Interest_Groups.aspx |title=Special Interest Groups |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other initiatives==

===Awards===

IFEM offers two main awards: Order of the IFEM and IFEM Humanitarian Award.&lt;ref name=Award&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Awards.aspx#FIFEM |title=Awards |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Order of the IFEM (FIFEM) was established in 1999 "to recognise those individuals who have contributed significantly to the development of emergency medicine in their country and to the development of the International Federation for Emergency Medicine." More than 70 Fellows of the IFEM have been inducted since 2000, when it was first awarded at the 8th ICEM;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ifem.cc/About_IFEM/Awards/FIFEM_Honour_Roll.aspx |title=FIFEM Honour Roll |website=International Federation for Emergency Medicine |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; new fellows are inducted biennially at the ICEM. The IFEM Humanitarian Award was established in 2000&lt;ref name=History/&gt; and is given to either an individual physician or an organization whose work "has a major humanitarian or public health benefit." It has been awarded 11 times since it was first inaugurated in 2004 at the 10th ICEM, twice to organizations and nine times to individuals.&lt;ref name=Award/&gt;

===Curriculum===

One of the goals of IFEM is to equip nations to develop emergency medical systems, and one key component of doing so is to identify the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. Although countries have very different needs and resources, a standard curriculum is still useful for identifying core issues. Thus, IFEM developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to the specific needs of the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.&lt;ref name=Slinger&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Slinger |first1=Ai |first2=C |last2=Hobgood |first3=D |last3=Kilroy |first4=G |last4=Bandiera |first5=J |last5=Holliman |first6=N |last6=Jouriles |first7=P |last7=Cameron |first8=P |last8=Halperin |first9=T |last9=Mulligan |first10=V |last10=Anantharaman |title=International Federation for Emergency Medicine Model Curriculum for Medical Student Education in Emergency Medicine |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |volume=21 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=367–372 |pmid=19840085 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

''[[Emergency Medicine Journal]]'' calls ICEM a major international emergency medicine conference,&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neill|first1=A |last2=Cronin |first2=JJ |last3=Brannigan |first3=DD |last4=O'Sullivan |first4=R |last5=Cadogan |first5=M |year=2013 |title=The impact of social media on a major international emergency medicine conference |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal  |publisher=BMJ Journals |pmid=23423992 |doi=10.1136/emermed-2012-202039 |volume= 31|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Kumar Alagappan and C. James Holliman refer to IFEM as "probably the most active, broad-based, international organization dealing with international EM [emergency medicine] development issues."&lt;ref name= alagappan2005/&gt; The IFEM has played a part in helping to increase global acceptance of the specialty of emergency medicine.&lt;ref name=Bodiwala/&gt;

Additionally, IFEM serves as the "umbrella group" for all of the national and regional societies representing international emergency medicine. It has also been described as "the peak EM [emergency medicine] in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recognizing the common end-point of different emergency medicine specialty training curricula |last1=Mulligan |first1=Terrence |last2=Hobgood |first2=Cherri |last3=Cameron |first3=Peter |year=2011 |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |pmid=21995465 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2011.01490.x |volume=23 |pages=525–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jónína Kristín Berg''' (born 3 September 1962) is an Icelandic art teacher, [[Aromatherapy|aromatheratist]] and [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] leader. She is the regional ''[[gothi]]'' of the [[Western Region (Iceland)|Western Region]] for [[Ásatrúarfélagið]] since 1996 and acted as interim ''[[Allsherjargoði (Ásatrúarfélagið)|allsherjargoði]]'' in 2002-2003.

== Biography ==
She was born in Akranesi and grew up in Giljahlíð in Flókadal, [[Borgarfjörður]]. She was educated at the Reykjavík School of Visual Arts, from 1985 at the Icelandic Academy of Fine Arts and Crafts where she completed her degree in 1989, then studied at the school's graphic department until 1990, after which she studied at the [[Reykjavík University]] where she completed her teaching degree. She has also studied massage and [[essential oil]] therapy at Lífsskólann – Aromatherapyskóla Íslands from which she graduated in 2002.&lt;ref name="mbl"&gt;[https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1435060/ Borgfirskt náttúrubarn]. 3 September 2012. [[Morgunblaðið]].&lt;/ref&gt; She has worked with individual training for disabled people in [[Kópavogur]], but since 2004 lives in [[Borganesi]] where she works as a primary school art teacher. She has also participated in group exhibitions with her own art. She performs [[aromatherapy]] and has served on the Board of Icelandic Healers.&lt;ref name="mbl" /&gt;

She followed [[Ásatrúarfélagið]] from its inception as she was a neighbour of the co-founder [[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]]. She became active in the organization in 1985.&lt;ref name="allsherjargodar"&gt;[https://asatru.is/allsherjargodar Allsherjargoðar]. [[Ásatrúarfélagið]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she was elected as a board member.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/118428/ Ný stjórn í Ásatrúarfélaginu]. 14 December 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">The '''Kalasa-Banduri Nala''' is a project undertaken by the Government of Karnataka to improve drinking water supply to the Districts of [[Belagavi]], [[Dharwad]] and [[Gadag]]. It involves building across Kalasa and Banduri, two tributaries of the [[Mahadayi river]] to divert 7.56 [[Tmcft|TMC]] of water to the [[Malaprabha river]], which supplies the drinking water needs of the said 3 districts, i.e., Dharwad, Belagavi and Gadag.
This project had been on paper for decades and the Karnataka government decided to implement it during [[S M Krishna]]'s regime.  Clearance for the project was received from the center in 2002.  The project however, soon ran into trouble when the then [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) government of Goa headed by [[Manohar Parrikar]] raised objections to the project claiming that the project would harm Goa's flora and fauna. Following this, the then [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) government which was in power at the center put on hold its approval and funding of the project.

Karnataka and Goa have since then been at loggerheads over the project. The project which had been put in abeyance for four years was revived after H. D. Kumaraswamy became the Chief Minister. In September 2006, the coalition government in Karnataka headed by Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy decided to go ahead with the construction work.  It was inaugurated on September 22 at Kanakumbi in [[Khanapur]] Taluk of [[Belgaum District]]. The Goa government, however, soon moved the courts and brought a stay on the construction work. The matter is now before the [[Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal]].

'''Protest to Implement the Project'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Communist Party of India(Marxist)]] organized a rally in Belagavi on 16th Sept, 2015 to implement this long time pending project. CPI(M) State Secretary GV Srirama Reddy along with his colleague Swamy, Varalaxmi and district secretary G.M. Jaine Khan lead this rally. GV Srirama Reddy said "The present imbroglio on the projects to the long pursued politics between the Congress and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] in Karnataka and Goa." Srirama Reddy was critical of Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] for throwing the ball in the courts of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] instead of taking a lead to resolve the dispute: “It is unbecoming of a Prime Minister to take a political stand based on his political differences with Congress on an issue concerning people.”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpimkarnataka.org/implement-kalasa-banduri-nala-drinking-water-project Protest to Implement the Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
A statewide bandh was organized by pro-Kannada organizations on Sept 26, 2015 demanding the implementation of the project.
The agitation in the malaprabha catchment area under various organisations has now reached 265 days.

'''NHS Digital''' is the trading name of the '''Health and Social Care Information Centre''', which is the national provider of information, data and IT systems for commissioners, analysts and clinicians in health and social care in [[England]], particularly those involved with the [[National Health Service (England)]].  

It provides digital services for the NHS and social care, including the management of large health informatics programmes.&lt;ref name=govuk&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Health|title=HSCIC changing its name to NHS Digital|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hscic-changing-its-name-to-nhs-digital}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They deliver national systems through in-house teams, and by contracting private suppliers.  These services include managing patient data including the Spine, which allows the secure sharing of information between different parts of the NHS, and forms the basis of the Electronic Prescription Service, Summary Care Record. and Electronic Referral Service.&lt;ref name=spine&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NHS Digital|title=Spine|url=https://digital.nhs.uk/spine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHS Digital is also the national collator of information about health and social care, and publishes over 260 statistical publications each year, including Official Statistics and National Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=UK Statistics Authority|title=List of National Statistics|url=https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/what-we-do/list-of-national-statistics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also runs the [[NHS.UK]] (formerly [[NHS Choices]]) website, which is the national website for the NHS in England.

The organisation is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]],&lt;ref name=2017Annual&gt;{{cite publication|publisher=NHS Digital|title=Annual Report 2016/17|url=https://digital.nhs.uk/our-governance/annual-report-and-accounts-2016-to-2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was re-branded as NHS Digital on 1 August 2016.

NHS Digital has taken on the roles of a number of predecessor bodies including the '''NHS Information Centre''', [[NHS Connecting for Health]], and parts of [[NHS Direct]].   The organisation produces more than 260 official and national statistical publications. This includes national comparative data for secondary uses, developed from the long-running '''Hospital Episode Statistics''' which can help local decision makers to improve the quality and efficiency of frontline care.

==History==
The organisation was created as a [[NHS special health authority|special health authority]] on 1 April 2005 by a merger of parts of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], parts of the [[NHS Information Authority]], and the Prescribing Support Unit.

Following the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]], the HSCIC changed from a special health authority to an executive non-departmental public body (ENDPB) on 1 April 2013. Effective at this time, HSCIC took over parts of the troubled [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) from the agency [[NHS Connecting for Health]] (CfH) which ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229062/0332.pdf|title=The Health and Social Care  Information Centre Annual Report and Accounts 2011/12|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs the [[Health Survey for England]] (HSE).

On 20 April 2016, it was announced that HSCIC would be rebranding, changing its name to NHS Digital in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/technology-and-innovation/hscic-renamed-nhs-digital-and-new-chair-hired/7004172.article |title=HSCIC renamed NHS Digital and new chair hired |first=Charlotte |last=Santry |work=[[Health Service Journal]] |date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=govuk/&gt;

==Business areas==
===Handling patient data===
NHS Digital runs the Spine service for the NHS, which is a central, secure system for patient data in England.&lt;ref name=spine/&gt;   This enables a number of services for patients, including:
* the Electronic Prescription Service, which sends prescriptions digitally from GP surgeries and other NHS providers to pharmacies, without needing a printed prescription&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NHS Digital|title=Electronic Prescription Service|url=https://digital.nhs.uk/Electronic-Prescription-Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Summary Care Record which allows authorised NHS staff (such as hospital or ambulance staff) to see a summary of important information about a patient, to help give the best care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NHS Digital|title=Summary Care Records|url=https://digital.nhs.uk/summary-care-records}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the e-referral service which manages the booking of first time appointments with hospitals and specialists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NHS Digital|title=NHS e-referral Service|url=https://digital.nhs.uk/e-Referral-Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Child Protection - Information Sharing system, which helps ensure that any child protection concerns are known by the NHS when they are treated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Protection - Information Sharing|publisher=NHS Digital|url=https://digital.nhs.uk/child-protection-information-sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the HSCIC, the organisation ran the [[care.data]] programme, which was cancelled in 2016.

NHS Digital collects the national 'Hospital Episode Statistics', which is a record of every 'episode' of admitted patient care (counted by completing care with a consultant, meaning that more than one episode can be associated with a single stay in hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)|url=http://www.natcansat.nhs.uk/data/hes.aspx|website=National Clinical Analysis and Specialised Applications Team|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) delivered by the NHS in England, including those done under contract by private providers.  This involves the tracking of around 16 million 'episodes' of care every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital Episode Statistics|url=http://content.digital.nhs.uk/hes|publisher=Health and Social Care Information Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information is used for a range of statistical analysis, as well as for determining payments to providers.

===Central technology team===
A troubleshooting operation was established in 2018 to help [[NHS trust]]s when major IT deployments go wrong. Eight trusts needed emergency assistance in 2018 after a deployment led to severe service disruptions.  Funding of £2 million a year for the service has been allocated and expansion is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New tech team to clean up trust IT fiascos |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/new-tech-team-to-clean-up-trust-it-fiascos/7023650.article |accessdate=1 December 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics and data===
NHS Digital compiles national data about the NHS and social care, with over 260 publications every year.&lt;ref name=govuk/&gt;  In addition, they provide data analysis, and access to data and clinical indicators.

===Public facing services===
NHS.UK (formerly [[NHS Choices]]) is the public website for the NHS Services in England, and is run by a team at NHS Digital; mandated by DOH with input from PHE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">In [[Newport News, Virginia]], '''asbestos litigation''' is driven by the presence of [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] and other defense contractors.  Asbestos was widely used in the shipbuilding industry.

==Cases==
About 500 people have died due to asbestos exposure at the Newport News shipyard.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stefanini |first=Sarah |date=13 April 2007 |title=Widow Gets $9M Over Asbestos Poisoning
 |url=https://www.law360.com/articles/22598/widow-gets-9m-over-asbestos-poisoning |newspaper=Law 360 |location=United States |access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exxon===
In March 2011, a jury in Newport News awarded about $25 million to a former shipyard worker named Rubert Minton. Minton had worked on 17 different Exxon tankers over the course of his career. Decades later he began to suffer from [[mesothelioma]]. He filed suit against Exxon in 2009. Minton's lead attorney was Robert Hatten. Hatten said the award would be reduced to about $17.5 million because the $12.5 million in punitive damages awarded by the jury exceeded the $5 million that had been demanded by Minton.&lt;ref name="Exxon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dujardin |first=Peter |date=17 March 2011 |title=Newport News jury hands down $25 million verdict against Exxon in asbestos case |url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2011-03-17/business/dp-nws-asbestos-verdict-20110317_1_asbestos-case-bobby-hatten-million-verdict |newspaper=Daily Press |location=Newport News, Virginia |access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suits against ship owners were a novel legal development. Most of the asbestos suits in Newport News had previously been brought against parts makers. Shipyards have immunity from asbestos suits under worker's compensation laws. Exxon said the shipyard was solely responsible for the safety of its workers and that there was no proof on its ships. Minton lawyers said Exxon new about health risks from asbestos in the 1930s and created rules to protect its own workers but did nothing to warn shipyard workers.&lt;ref name="Exxon"/&gt;

===Dorthe Crisp Gibbs v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co.===
Gibbs was an active-duty member of the United States Navy when he was exposed to asbestos after being ordered to take part in pre-commission tests of a nuclear submarine. He later developed mesothelioma and died in 2009. Gibbs sued Newport News in 2008. His wife continued that suit and sued for wrongful death.&lt;ref name="insurance"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ciniceros |first=Roberto |date=7 November 2012 |title=Virginia workers comp act no bar to Navy widow's wrongful death claim |url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20121107/NEWS08/121109919 |newspaper=Business Insurance |location=United States |access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state circuit court dismissed her case. The court ruled that worker's compensation was her exclusive remedy. The Virginia state supreme court overturned the circuit court's decision in 2012. It found that because the Navy was not liable under worker's compensation Gibbs could file suit against Newport News.&lt;ref name="insurance"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[American Tort Reform Association]] (ATRA) has named Newport News a "Judicial Hellhole" for allegedly applying the law in biased manner in favor of plaintiffs.

A '''nurse's cap''' or '''nursing cap''' is part of the female [[Nurse uniform|nurse's uniform]], introduced early in the history of the profession.  The cap's original purpose was to keep the [[nurse]]'s hair neatly in place and present a modest appearance. Male nurses do not wear caps.

In some schools, a ''capping ceremony'' presents new nursing students their caps before beginning their clinical (hospital) training.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-076-05A, NSV-Mütterheim.jpg|240 px|left|thumb|The German nurse in this photo wears a heavily starched nurse's cap. 1939.]]
The nurse's cap originated from a group of women in the early Christian era, called "deaconesses."  Deaconesses are now recognized as religious order nuns.  These women were distinguished from other women during this time by white coverings worn on their heads.  This particular head covering was worn to show that this group of women worked in the service of caring for the sick.  Originally, this head covering was more of a veil, but it later evolved into a white cap during the Victorian era.  It was during this era that proper women were required to keep their heads covered.  The cap worn was hood-shaped with a ruffle around the face and tied under the chin, similar to cleaning ladies of that day.  Long hair was fashionable during the Victorian era, so the cap kept the nurse's hair up and out of her face, as well as keeping it from becoming soiled.&lt;ref name= "Catalano2012pp29-30"&gt;{{cite book |last= Catalano |first= Joseph T. |title= Nursing Now!: Today's Issues, Tomorrow's Trends |edition= 6th |location= Philadelphia, PA |publisher= [[F. A. Davis Company|F.A. Davis]] |year= 2012 |pages= 29–30 |ref= {{harvid|Catalano|2012}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nurse's cap was derived from the nun's habit and developed over time into two types:
* A ''long'' cap, that covers much of the nurse's hair, and
* A ''short'' cap, that sits atop the nurse's hair (common in North America and the United Kingdom).
The nursing cap was originally used by [[Florence Nightingale]] in the 1800s.

Different styles of caps were used to depict the seniority of the nurse, the frillier and longer the more senior the nurse.

==Advantages==
[[Image:POL chelm Liceum med.jpg|thumb|Polish nurses, wearing a uniform that includes a nursing cap, care for a patient in 1993.]]
The nursing cap is a nearly universally recognized symbol of nursing. It allows patients to quickly identify a nurse in the hospital from other members of the health team.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "The Nurse’s Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion", ''Fashion Theory'', Vol.21, No.5. (2015), pp. 523-552. [https://doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Some claim the cap is a potential carrier of [[bacteria]] and other disease-causing [[pathogens]] that could then be transmitted from patient to patient.&lt;ref name= "Houweling2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Image, function, and style: A history of the nursing uniform. |last= Houweling |first= Lynn |journal= American Journal of Nursing: [[American Journal of Nursing]] |volume= 104 |issue= 4 |pages= 40–8 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15171114}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such incidents can be prevented when infection control procedures are followed.

==Standardized school caps==
Around 1874, the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]] in New York City adopted a special nursing cap as a way to identify nurses who had graduated from Bellevue.  The Bellevue cap covered the entire head except the ears, and can be compared to a current ski hat, although it was made out of white linen and had fringe around the bottom.  As the number of nursing schools increased, so did the need for unique caps.  Each nursing school decided to design their own style of nurse’s cap.  Some became very elaborate and some were even different shapes. Because each school had their own cap, it became very easy to determine which school the nurse had graduated from.&lt;ref name= "Catalano2012pp29-30"/&gt;
It was common for a black stripe (usually a black velvet ribbon) on the cap to signify a Registered Nurse.  In some regions, two thinner stripes were used to signify the award of a Bachelors of Science in Nursing (BSN).  The caps needed to be washed regularly and the black stripe(s) needed to be easy to remove and reattach.  Water soluble lubricants such as KY jelly became solid when dried and were plentiful in hospitals. Nurses often used a thin layer of these lubricants applied to the back of the ribbon to attach stripes to their caps.

==Nurses' caps since the 1980s==
In a global perspective, the nurses' cap continues to be widely used. However, the use of the nurses' cap had begun to slowly decline in Western Europe and Northern America by the mid 1970s. The use of nurses' caps in the medical facilities of the [[United States]] all but disappeared by the late 1980s with the near universal adoption of "[[Scrubs (clothing)#Modern scrubs|scrubs]]." {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In areas where healthcare facilities no longer required their nurses to wear nurse’s caps, nursing schools eliminated the cap as a mandatory part of the students’ uniform.  In addition, with the growth of technology in the health-care setting, some felt that the nurse’s caps was an obstacle for nurses wearing them, while others disagreed.&lt;ref name= "Catalano2012pp29-30"/&gt;  Also, with the rapid growth of the number of men in nursing, some felt a need for a unisex uniform, while others saw no difficulty with gender specific uniforms as is the case in many uniformed professions. However, nurses' caps can still be found in many developing and developed nations. Japan and South Korea are examples of developed countries with near universal use of the nurses' cap. It is also common for students of nursing to have their graduation portraits taken while wearing nurses' caps.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In countries where the nursing cap is no longer required as a part of a nurse’s uniform, it still holds the same significance that it did during the time of Florence Nightingale.  The nursing cap symbolizes the goal of the nurse, which is to provide “service to those in need.”  Furthermore, the cap is a sign of the industry’s ageless values of dedication, honesty, wisdom, and faith.&lt;ref name= "Catalano2012pp29-30"/&gt;

'''Orin Levine''' is a recognized expert in the fields of international [[public health]], [[child survival]], and [[pneumonia]].  He is currently the Director of Vaccine Delivery at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, USA. In the past he was the Executive Director of the [http://www.jhsph.edu/ivac International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)], the Co-Chair of the [[Pneumococcal Awareness Council of Experts]] (PACE),&lt;ref name="Sabin Institute"&gt;[http://sabin.org/about-us/executive/dr-orin-levine Sabin Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a Professor at [[The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] in the Department of International Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.jhsph.edu/?faculty_id=52 JHSPH]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an adjunct assistant professor of Epidemiology at The [[Rollins School of Public Health]] at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta.  Additionally, he is currently president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) Council on Global Health. He resides in Washington, DC.

==Biography and Education==
Orin Levine was born in Richmond, Virginia.  He graduated with a bachelor's degree from [[Gettysburg College]] in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  He continued his studies at The [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where he received a PhD in epidemiology.&lt;ref name="Sabin Institute"/&gt;

==Research==
After receiving his PhD, Levine spent 5 years working for [[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in Atlanta.  There, he served first as an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, and then as a staff epidemiologist in the Respiratory Diseases Branch.  He then spent 3 years working at the [[National Institutes of Health]] in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;ref name="Sabin Institute"/&gt;  In 2003, he joined the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and started (with [[Katherine O'Brien]]) the PneumoADIP, a small, focused organization dedicated to accelerating access to pneumococcal vaccines for the world's poorest children.&lt;ref name="PneumoADIP"&gt;[http://preventpneumo.com PneumoADIP]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past 6 years, Levine and the PneumoADIP team have successfully competed for and been awarded over 100 million dollars in research grants from the [http://www.gavialliance.org/ GAVI Alliance] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20121012112446/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]. He's now at the Gates Foundation in Seattle.

As the executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC),&lt;ref name="IVAC"&gt;[http://www.jhsph.edu/ivac]&lt;/ref&gt; Levine leads nearly 30 professionals with experience in epidemiology, economics, policy analysis, financing, and advocacy. The mission of IVAC is to accelerate global access to vaccines through the development and implementation of evidence-based policies. As a consultant who works both nationally and internationally, Levine's knowledge of epidemiology places him in high demand. Levine's professional memberships align with his special interests. Currently, he is a steering committee member of [http://www.jhsph.edu/vaccineinitiative Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative (JHVI)], at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and President of the American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene's Committee on Global Health. He is also a steering committee member of the [http://www.dovcollaboration.org/ Decade of Vaccines Collaboration], and the co-chair of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration's Global Access Working Group.

Levine has authored over 100 peer-reviewed publications and book chapters. He also writes [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-orin-levine a regular blog for the Huffington Post] on global health and vaccine-related issues, and appears regularly on radio, television, and in print as an expert authority on these topics.

Levine's research has predominantly been focused on the two most common causes of fatal pneumonia, [[pneumococcal infection|S. pneumoniae]] and [[haemophilus influenzae|H. influenzae]] type b.  Pneumonia kills over 2 million children each year and &gt;98% of these deaths occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Pneumonia_The_Forgotten_Killer_of_Children.pdf The Forgotten Killer of Children]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pneumococcal and Hib pneumonia are preventable by vaccination, but these vaccines have not reached the children who needed them the most: those in developing countries. Levine's efforts, and those of PneumoADIP, are aimed at accelerating access to these life-saving vaccines so that children everywhere can benefit from them.

Two of his current research projects are: Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH), which is funded by a 43 million dollar grant from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/10793 Global Health Council]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Accelerated Vaccine Introduction (AVI) Project, which is funded by the [[GAVI Alliance]].&lt;ref name="PneumoADIP"/&gt;  The purpose of PERCH is to achieve a greater understanding of the causes of pneumonia around the world.  Better pneumonia surveillance is critical to the global fight against this disease.  The purpose of AVI is to accelerate access to life-saving pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines for children in the world's poorest countries. Levine is also involved in dengue vaccines, acting as the lead at Johns Hopkins in the institution's involvement in the Dengue Vaccine Initiative, a consortium created to accelerate development and subsequent use of dengue vaccines.

===Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH)===
Pneumonia is the leading infectious disease cause of death among children worldwide.  Existing knowledge on the etiologies of childhood pneumonia is largely based on studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s.  With expanded use of new pneumonia vaccines and changes in host and environmental factors, a new evidence base that harnesses novel diagnostic technologies is needed.

PERCH is a multi-center, case-control study of the etiology of severe and very severe pneumonia in children aged 1–59 months. With seven sites in Africa and Asia and a projected sample size of over 12,000 patients and controls, PERCH is the largest study of the etiology of pneumonia among hospitalized pediatric pneumonia patients in developing countries that has ever been undertaken. Over two years, PERCH will enroll approximately 6,500 hospitalized cases with WHO-defined severe and very severe pneumonia. Approximately the same number of community-based controls will be enrolled to assess the community prevalence of pathogens, as well as known and unstudied risk factors for pneumonia.  Seven research sites were selected to be representative of areas where most of the severe pneumonia cases in children are expected to occur in 2015. There are five sites in Africa (Gambia, Mali, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia) and two in Asia (Bangladesh and Thailand). The study will be carried out using standardized clinical and laboratory methods and techniques, in combination with innovative diagnostic and specimen collection methods. The data will be analyzed using advanced statistical methods and their interpretation will be considered prior to the release the specific microbiologic results.

More information on the study protocol and the PERCH project is available at http://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/perch.html.

===The Hib Initiative===
The mission of the Hib Initiative is to expedite and execute evidence-based decisions regarding the use of Hib vaccination in order to prevent childhood meningitis and pneumonia. The Hib Initiative strategic plan provides a roadmap to fulfill this mission, and focuses on three strategic areas to support evidence-based decisions at the country level: coordination, communication and research.

===PneumoADIP - The Gambia &amp; Kenya===

====The Gambia====
In conjunction with the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Gambia, the team will coordinate and perform a range of surveillance and research activities designed to determine the burden of pneumococcal infections among and demonstrate the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on children and adults in the Upper River Division in The Gambia. The surveillance and post-vaccination evaluation being conducted by MRC Gambia is a multi-year project.

====Kenya====
In conjunction with the University of Oxford, this team will coordinate and perform a range of activities designed to estimate the total reduction in disease burden attributable to programmatic use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine following introduction into the routine childhood immunization schedule. The pneumococcal surveillance and post-vaccine introduction evaluation being conducted is a multi-year project.

===Serotype Replacement===
This program was conceived to develop an evidence-based, rigorous, and transparent process for collecting, analyzing and interpreting the evidence for pneumococcal serotype replacement and placing it in this larger context.  The approach is to develop hypothesis-driven analyses and to evaluate them on the basis of comparable data from different settings in order to formulate a set of “best-practice principles” for pneumococcal disease surveillance in developing countries planning to introduce PCV. In this way, new data on pneumococcal vaccine impact may be collected and reported in ways that are useful in understanding the true effects of PCV. The process of determining the proportionate role of serotype replacement in post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine nonvaccine-serotypes invasive pneumococcal disease changes will provide a framework for countries to evaluate their own data and make decisions related to their PCV immunization program.

===LEAP: Evaluation of the Binax NOW® S. pneumoniae test for use in blood of pneumonia and sepsis patients in low- and middle-income countries===
The project aims to evaluate the utility of the Binax NOW® S. pneumoniae immuno-chromatographic test, for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis in low- and middle-income countries.  Detection of pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis is limited by the poor sensitivity of existing diagnostic methods, hindering accurate measurement of disease burden where the Binax NOW® test may enable the identification of additional pneumococcal cases among patients with pneumonia and sepsis.

===LARI: Landscape Analysis of Routine Immunization in Nigeria===
The project aims to identify the key supply- and demand-side bottlenecks to routine immunization coverage in Nigeria and determine drivers of low coverage and inequalities. Specific aims include to describe the landscape and status of previous and current routine immunization strengthening programs in Nigeria and to identify context-specific opportunities and strategies for improving immunization service access and delivery, utilization, uptake and demand.

==Advocacy==
In addition to his academic publishing, Levine appears frequently as an expert in print, on the radio, and on television.  He has authored and/or co-authored Op-Eds that have appeared in publications around the world.  His television appearances include two BBC World documentaries on pneumococcal disease and prevention by vaccination, and news interviews on BBC World, BBC News, Al-Jazeera (The Pulse), South African Broadcasting Corporation, and Arirang (South Korea).  His work on pneumonia research and prevention has been profiled in the New York Times (see [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/health/05pneum.html New York Times Article: '''A Campaign to Get a Disease Some Respect''']).  On August 4, 2009, Levine was featured in an episode of the "Kill or Cure" series on BBC World. This episode, called "Saving Lives" (http://www.rockhopper.tv/programmes/262/), focused on efforts to increase access to pneumococcal vaccines through an initiative called the Advance Market Commitment (http://www.vaccineamc.org).  Click here to access all the episodes of Kill or Cure on the Rockhopper.tv website (http://www.rockhopper.tv/programmes/18/).  Most recently Levine was featured in the [http://www.jhsph.edu Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health] [http://magazine.jhsph.edu/2010/fall/departments/frontiers_of_public_health/page_1/ magazine] for his work on advancing vaccine access.

==Awards==
* In 2000, Levine was awarded the CDC's Iain Hardy award for his outstanding contribution to the control of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;ref name="Sabin Institute"/&gt;
* In 2008, in light of his outstanding achievements in pneumococcal disease and its prevention, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases selected Levine as the first Dr. Robert Austrian Memorial Lecturer at the National Vaccine Research Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-technology-1/Annual-Conference-on-Vaccine-Research-to-Highlight-Not-Only-Health-Benefits-But-Also-Economic-Gains-1970-3/ Bio-medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;  The lecture is named for Dr. Robert Austrian, former chair of medical research at the University of Pennsylvania, who developed the first multivalent vaccine against pneumococcus bacteria. Austrian died in March 2007 at the age of 90.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
An '''ovarian cyst''' is a fluid-filled sac within the [[ovary]].&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Often they cause no symptoms.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Occasionally they may produce bloating, lower abdominal pain, or lower back pain.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; The majority of cysts are harmless.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; If the cyst either [[ruptured ovarian cyst|breaks open]] or causes [[ovarian torsion|twisting of the ovary]], it may cause severe pain.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; This may result in vomiting or [[Lightheadedness|feeling faint]].&lt;ref name=Women2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/ovarian-cysts.html?from=AtoZ#|title=Ovarian cysts|date=November 19, 2014|website=Office on Women's Health|accessdate=27 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629070544/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/ovarian-cysts.html?from=AtoZ|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Most ovarian cysts are related to [[ovulation]], being either [[follicular cyst of ovary|follicular cyst]]s or [[corpus luteum cyst]]s.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Other types include [[Endometrioma|cysts due to endometriosis]], [[dermoid cyst]]s, and [[cystadenoma]]s.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Many small cysts occur in both ovaries in [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; [[Pelvic inflammatory disease]] may also result in cysts.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Rarely, cysts may be a form of [[ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Diagnosis is undertaken by [[pelvic examination]] with an [[ultrasound]] or other testing used to gather further details.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Often, cysts are simply observed over time.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; If they cause pain, medications such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) or [[ibuprofen]] may be used.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; [[Hormonal birth control]] may be used to prevent further cysts in those who are frequently affected.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; However, evidence does not support birth control as a treatment of current cysts.&lt;ref name=Grime2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=DA|last2=Jones|first2=LB|last3=Lopez|first3=LM|last4=Schulz|first4=KF|title=Oral contraceptives for functional ovarian cysts.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 April 2014|volume=4|issue=4|pages=CD006134|pmid=24782304|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006134.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they do not go away after several months, get larger, look unusual, or cause pain, they may be removed by surgery.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Most women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Large cysts that cause problems occur in about 8% of women before [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Ovarian cysts are present in about 16% of women after menopause and if present are more likely to be cancer.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mimoun|first1=C|last2=Fritel|first2=X|last3=Fauconnier|first3=A|last4=Deffieux|first4=X|last5=Dumont|first5=A|last6=Huchon|first6=C|title=[Epidemiology of presumed benign ovarian tumors].|journal=Journal de Gynecologie, Obstetrique et Biologie de la Reproduction|date=December 2013|volume=42|issue=8|pages=722–9|pmid=24210235|doi=10.1016/j.jgyn.2013.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Signs and symptoms==
Some or all of the following symptoms may be present, though it is possible not to experience any symptoms:&lt;ref name=HELM2013 /&gt;
* [[Abdomen|Abdominal]] pain. Dull aching pain within the abdomen or pelvis, especially during intercourse.
* [[Uterus|Uterine]] bleeding. Pain during or shortly after beginning or end of menstrual period; irregular periods, or abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting.
* Fullness, heaviness, pressure, swelling, or [[bloating]] in the abdomen.
* When a cyst ruptures from the [[ovary]], there may be sudden and sharp pain in the lower abdomen on one side.
* Change in frequency or ease of [[urination]] (such as inability to fully empty the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]), or difficulty with [[bowel movement]]s due to pressure on adjacent [[pelvic]] anatomy.
* [[Constitutional symptom]]s such as [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[headache]]s
* Nausea or vomiting
* Weight gain
Other symptoms may depend on the cause of the cysts:&lt;ref name=HELM2013 /&gt;
* Symptoms that may occur if the cause of the cysts is [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] (PCOS) may include increased [[facial hair]] or [[body hair]], [[acne]], obesity and [[infertility]].
* If the cause is [[endometriosis]], then periods may be heavy, and intercourse painful.

The effect of cysts not related to PCOS on fertility is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Legendre|first1=G|last2=Catala|first2=L|last3=Morinière|first3=C|last4=Lacoeuille|first4=C|last5=Boussion|first5=F|last6=Sentilhes|first6=L|last7=Descamps|first7=P|title=Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=March 2014|volume=101|issue=3|pages=608–14|pmid=24559614|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2014.01.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyst rupture===
A ruptured ovarian cyst is usually self-limiting, and only requires keeping an eye on the situation and [[analgesic|pain medication]]s. The main symptom is abdominal pain, which may last a few days to several weeks, but they can also be asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/253620-overview#showall Ovarian Cyst Rupture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928090329/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/253620-overview |date=2013-09-28 }} at [[Medscape]]. Authors: Nathan Webb and David Chelmow. Updated: Nov 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Rupture of large ovarian cysts can cause [[hemoperitoneum|bleeding inside the abdominal cavity]] and in some cases shock.

===Ovarian torsion===
Ovarian cysts increase the risk for [[ovarian torsion]]; cysts which are larger than 4&amp;nbsp;cm are associated with approximately 17% risk. The torsion can cause obstruction of blood flow and lead to [[infarction]].&lt;ref name=eMedHealth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/ovarian_cysts/article_em.htm |title=Ovarian Cysts Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment |work=eMedicineHealth.com |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307143243/http://www.emedicinehealth.com/ovarian_cysts/article_em.htm |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:2cmleftovariancyst.png|thumb|A 2&amp;nbsp;cm left ovarian cyst as seen on ultrasound]]
Ovarian cysts are usually diagnosed by [[ultrasound]], [[CT scan]], or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and correlated with clinical presentation and endocrinologic tests as appropriate.
[[File:Trichromatic Color MRI of ovarian cysts.jpg|thumb|Four kinds of ovarian cysts on MRI]]
===Ultrasound===
Follow-up imaging in women of reproductive age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound is not needed until 5&amp;nbsp;cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5&amp;nbsp;to 7&amp;nbsp;cm in [[menopause#Diagnosis|premenopausal]] females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7&amp;nbsp;cm require further imaging with [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone because it may be difficult to see the soft tissue nodularity or thickened septation at their posterior wall due to limited penetrance of the ultrasound beam. For the [[corpus luteum]], a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with circumferentially thickened walls and [[crenulation|crenulated]] inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. In [[menopause#Diagnosis|postmenopausal]] patients, any simple cyst greater than 1&amp;nbsp;cm but less than 7&amp;nbsp;cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7&amp;nbsp;cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.&lt;ref name="levine1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=D|last2=Brown|first2=DL|last3=Andreotti|first3=RF|last4=Benacerraf|first4=B|last5=Benson|first5=CB|last6=Brewster|first6=WR|last7=Coleman|first7=B|last8=Depriest|first8=P|last9=Doubilet|first9=PM|last10=Goldstein|first10=SR|last11=Hamper|first11=UM|last12=Hecht|first12=JL|last13=Horrow|first13=M|last14=Hur|first14=HC|last15=Marnach|first15=M|last16=Patel|first16=MD|last17=Platt|first17=LD|last18=Puscheck|first18=E|last19=Smith-Bindman|first19=R|title=Management of asymptomatic ovarian and other adnexal cysts imaged at US: Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference Statement.|journal=Radiology|date=September 2010|volume=256|issue=3|pages=943–54|pmid=20505067|doi=10.1148/radiol.10100213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ovarian Cyst.JPG|thumb|right|An Axial CT demonstrating a large hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. The cyst is delineated by the yellow bars with blood seen anteriorly.]]For incidentally discovered [[Dermoid cyst|dermoids]], diagnosed on ultrasound by their [[pathognomonic]] [[Echogenicity|echogenic]] fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age. For [[peritoneal inclusion cysts]], which have a crumpled tissue-paper appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. [[Hydrosalpinx]], or [[fallopian tube]] dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.&lt;ref name="levine1"/&gt;

For multiloculate cysts with thin septation less than 3&amp;nbsp;mm, surgical evaluation is recommended. The presence of multiloculation suggests a [[neoplasm]], although the thin septation implies that the neoplasm is benign. For any thickened septation, nodularity, or vascular flow on [[color doppler]] assessment, surgical removal should be considered due to concern for malignancy.&lt;ref name="levine1"/&gt;

===Scoring systems===
There are several systems to assess risk of an ovarian cyst of being an [[ovarian cancer]], including the RMI (risk of malignancy index), LR2 and SR (simple rules). [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivities and specificities]] of these systems are given in tables below:&lt;ref name="KaijserSayasneh2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaijser J, Sayasneh A, Van Hoorde K, Ghaem-Maghami S, Bourne T, Timmerman D, Van Calster B | title = Presurgical diagnosis of adnexal tumours using mathematical models and scoring systems: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 449–462 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24327552 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt059 | issn = 1355-4786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovarian cysts may be classified according to whether they are a variant of the normal [[menstrual cycle]], referred to as a functional or follicular cyst.&lt;ref name=HELM2013&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helm|first=William|title=Ovarian Cysts|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/255865-overview|accessdate=30 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907142104/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/255865-overview|archivedate=7 September 2013|df=|date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovarian cysts are considered large when they are over 5&amp;nbsp;cm and giant when they are over 15&amp;nbsp;cm. In children, ovarian cysts reaching above the level of the umbilicus are considered giant.

===Functional===
Functional cysts form as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. There are several types of cysts:
*[[Follicular cyst of ovary|Follicular cyst]], the most common type of ovarian cyst. In menstruating women, a follicle containing the [[ovum]], an unfertilized egg, will rupture during ovulation. If this does not occur, a follicular cyst of more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter may result.&lt;ref name=HELM2013 /&gt;
*[[Corpus luteum cyst]]s appear after ovulation. The [[corpus luteum]] is the remnant of the follicle after the ovum has moved to the [[fallopian tube]]s. This normally degrades within 5 to 9 days. A corpus luteum that is more than 3&amp;nbsp;cm is defined as cystic.&lt;ref name=HELM2013 /&gt;
*[[Theca lutein cyst]]s occur within the [[Ovarian follicle#Thecal|thecal layer]] of cells surrounding developing oocytes. Under the influence of excessive [[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], thecal cells may proliferate and become cystic. This is usually on both ovaries.&lt;ref name=HELM2013 /&gt;

===Non-functional===
[[File:Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, probably originating from a [[corpus luteum cyst]]. The coagulating blood gives the content a cobweb-like appearance.]]
[[File:Endometrioma.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] showing a 67 x 40 mm [[endometrioma]], with a somewhat grainy content.]]
Non-functional cysts may include the following:
* An ovary with many cysts, which may be found in normal women, or within the setting of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]
* Cysts caused by [[endometriosis]], known as [[chocolate cyst of ovary|chocolate cysts]]
* Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst
* [[Dermoid cyst]]
* [[Ovarian serous cystadenoma]]
* Ovarian [[mucinous cystadenoma]]
* [[Paraovarian cyst]]
* Cystic adenofibroma
* Borderline tumoral cysts

===Associated medical conditions===
In juvenile [[hypothyroidism]] multicystic ovaries are present in about 75% of cases, while large ovarian cysts and elevated ovarian tumor marks are one of the symptoms of the [[Van Wyk and Grumbach syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Durbin_2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Durbin KL, Diaz-Montes T, Loveless MB | title = Van wyk and grumbach syndrome: An unusual case and review of the literature | journal = Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = e93–6 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21600802 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpag.2010.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CA-125 marker in children and adolescents can be frequently elevated even in absence of malignancy and conservative management should be considered.

[[Polycystic ovarian syndrome]] involves the development of multiple small cysts in both ovaries due to an elevated ratio of [[leutenizing hormone]] to [[follicle stimulating hormone]], typically more than 25 cysts in each ovary, or an ovarian volume of greater than 10&amp;nbsp;mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewailly|first1=D|last2=Lujan|first2=ME|last3=Carmina|first3=E|last4=Cedars|first4=MI|last5=Laven|first5=J|last6=Norman|first6=RJ|last7=Escobar-Morreale|first7=HF|title=Definition and significance of polycystic ovarian morphology: a task force report from the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society.|journal=Human Reproduction Update|date=May 2014|volume=20|issue=3|pages=334–52|pmid=24345633|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmt061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger bilateral cysts can develop as a result of [[Assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatment]] due to elevated levels of [[human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]], as can be seen with the use of [[clomifene]] for follicular induction, in extreme cases resulting in a condition known as [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altinkaya|first1=SO|last2=Talas|first2=BB|last3=Gungor|first3=T|last4=Gulerman|first4=C|title=Treatment of clomiphene citrate-related ovarian cysts in a prospective randomized study.

Ovarian hyperstimulation occurs more often with invasive moles and choriocarcinoma than complete molar pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suzuki|first1=H|last2=Matsubara|first2=S|last3=Uchida|first3=S|last4=Ohkuchi|first4=A|title=Ovary hyperstimulation syndrome accompanying molar pregnancy: case report and review of the literature.|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|date=October 2014|volume=290|issue=4|pages=803–6|pmid=24966119|doi=10.1007/s00404-014-3319-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk of cancer===
A widely recognised method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer based on initial workup is the ''risk of malignancy index'' (RMI).&lt;ref name="NICE2011"&gt;[http://publications.nice.org.uk/ovarian-cancer-cg122/appendix-d-risk-of-malignancy-index-rmi-i NICE clinical guidelines Issued: April 2011. Guideline CG122. Ovarian cancer: The recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922075958/http://publications.nice.org.uk/ovarian-cancer-cg122/appendix-d-risk-of-malignancy-index-rmi-i |date=2013-09-22 }}, Appendix D: Risk of malignancy index (RMI I).&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that women with an RMI score over 200 should be referred to a centre with experience in ovarian cancer surgery.&lt;ref name="sign2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Network|first1=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines|title=Epithelial ovarian cancer : a national clinical guideline.|date=2003|publisher=SIGN|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1899893935|chapter-url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/75/section3.html|chapter=EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER SECTION 3: DIAGNOSIS|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922074417/http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/75/section3.html|archivedate=2013-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RMI is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="sign2003"/&gt;
:RMI = ultrasound score x menopausal score x CA-125 level in U/ml.

There are two methods to determine the ultrasound score and menopausal score, with the resultant RMI being called RMI&amp;nbsp;1 and RMI&amp;nbsp;2, respectively, depending on what method is used:&lt;ref name="sign2003"/&gt;

An RMI 2 of over 200 has been estimated to have a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of 74 to 80%, a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of 89 to 92% and a [[positive predictive value]] of around 80% of ovarian cancer.&lt;ref name="sign2003"/&gt; RMI&amp;nbsp;2 is regarded as more sensitive than RMI&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="sign2003"/&gt;

==Treatment==
Cysts associated with [[hypothyroidism]] or other [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] problems are managed by treating the underlying condition.

About 95% of ovarian cysts are [[benign]], not cancerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Ovarian-cyst/Pages/Symptoms.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512043024/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Ovarian-cyst/Pages/Symptoms.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= |date=2017-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional cysts and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts usually resolve spontaneously.&lt;ref name="V.T.2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=V.T.|title=Understanding Ovarian Cyst|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CmRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|date=14 May 2014|publisher=V.T.|pages=25–|id=GGKEY:JTX84XQARW9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316121625/http://books.google.com/books?id=6CmRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bigger an ovarian cyst is, the less likely it is to disappear on its own.&lt;ref name="Bluth2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward I. Bluth|title=Ultrasound: A Practical Approach to Clinical Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qms5Ei7XEC8C&amp;pg=PA190|year=2000|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-0-86577-861-0|pages=190|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312140433/https://books.google.com/books?id=Qms5Ei7XEC8C&amp;pg=PA190|archivedate=2017-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment may be required if cysts persist over several months, grow, or cause increasing pain.&lt;ref name="Orshan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan A. Orshan|title=Maternity, Newborn, and Women's Health Nursing: Comprehensive Care Across the Lifespan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91dAzl2J_LgC&amp;pg=PA161|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-4254-2|pages=161|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312140214/https://books.google.com/books?id=91dAzl2J_LgC&amp;pg=PA161|archivedate=2017-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cysts that persist beyond two or three [[menstrual cycle]]s, or occur in post-[[menopausal]] women, may indicate more serious disease and should be investigated through [[ultrasonography]] and [[laparoscopy]], especially in cases where family members have had [[ovarian cancer]]. Such cysts may require surgical [[biopsy]]. Additionally, a [[blood test]] may be taken before surgery to check for elevated [[CA-125]], a [[tumour marker]], which is often found in increased levels in ovarian cancer, although it can also be elevated by other conditions resulting in a large number of false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007217|CA-125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===
Pain associated with ovarian cysts may be treated in several ways:
*[[Pain reliever]]s such as [[acetaminophen]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]],&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; or [[opioids]].
*While [[hormonal birth control]] prevents the development of new cysts in those who frequently get them,&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; it is not useful for the treatment of current cysts.&lt;ref name=Grime2014/&gt;

===Surgery===
Although most cases of ovarian cysts involve monitoring, some cases require surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Marcia|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8036-2505-1|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve removing the cyst, or [[oopherectomy|one or both ovaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcs.tamu.edu/health/health_education_rural_outreach/Health_Hints/2003/jan-feb/gynecologic_health.php |title=HealthHints: Gynecologic Health (January/February, 2003) |format= |work=Texas AgriLife Extension Service: HealthHints |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217195247/http://fcs.tamu.edu/health/Health_Education_Rural_Outreach/Health_Hints/2003/jan-feb/gynecologic_health.php |archivedate=2007-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technique is typically [[laparoscopic]], unless the cyst is particularly large, or if pre-operative imaging suggests malignancy or complex anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Surgit|first1=O|last2=Inegol Gumus|first2=I|title=Single-port Laparoscopic Total Hysterectomy and Bilateral Salpingo-oopherectomy Combined with Burch Colposuspension.|journal=Acta Chirurgica Belgica|date=2014|volume=114|issue=4|pages=0|pmid=26021429}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain situations, the cyst is entirely [[Resection (surgery)|removed]], while with cysts with low recurrence risk, younger patients, or which are in anatomically eloquent areas of the pelvis, they can be drained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=MJ|last2=Kim|first2=DY|last3=Kim|first3=SC|title=Ovarian Cyst Aspiration in the Neonate: Minimally Invasive Surgery.|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|date=October 2015|volume=28|issue=5|pages=348–53|pmid=26148782|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2014.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nohuz|first1=E|title=[How I do...the aspiration of an adnexal cyst without iterative needle punctures neither irrigation-aspiration device during a laparoscopy].|journal=Gynecologie, Obstetrique &amp; Fertilite|date=11 December 2015|pmid=26701109|doi=10.1016/j.gyobfe.2015.11.001|volume=44|issue=1|pages=63–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features that may indicate the need for surgery include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001504.htm Ovarian cysts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002121813/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001504.htm |date=2013-10-02 }} from [[MedlinePlus]].

==Frequency==
Most women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month, and large cysts that cause problems occur in about 8% of women before [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt; Ovarian cysts are present in about 16% of women after menopause and if present are more likely to be cancer.&lt;ref name=Women2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Benign ovarian cysts are common in asymptomatic premenarchal girls and found in approximately 68% of ovaries of girls 2–12 years old and in 84% of ovaries of girls 0–2 years old. Most of them are smaller than 9&amp;nbsp;mm while about 10-20% are larger [[macrocyst]]s. While the smaller cysts mostly disappear within 6 months the larger ones appear to be more persistent.&lt;ref name=Cohen_1992&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen HL, Eisenberg P, Mandel F, Haller JO | title = Ovarian cysts are common in premenarchal girls: A sonographic study of 101 children 2-12 years old | journal = AJR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">The '''overall nutritional quality index''' is a [[Nutritional rating systems|nutritional rating system]] developed at the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. It assigns foods a score between 1 and 100 to reflect the overall [[nutrition]] provided relative to the calories consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/22/foodanddrink-healthandwellbeing|title=Think you know what's good for you to eat? asks Emine Saner|first=Emine|last=Saner|date=21 October 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been marketed commercially as NuVal, and some consumer foods in the [[United States]] are marked with ONQI values as "NuVal".

==Description==
The ONQI for a food is the ratio of a "numerator" value representing beneficial nutrients such as [[iron]], [[dietary fibre]] and [[vitamins]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuval.com/Science#Numerator_Nutrients ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "denominator" value representing detrimental nutrients such as [[cholesterol]] and [[saturated fat]].

The following foods have the maximum ONQI of 100:&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3241667/Health-food-Yale-Universitys-Overall-Nutritional-Quality-Index.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; broccoli, blueberries, [[okra]], oranges and green beans. Some of the lowest ONQIs are for white bread (9), hot dog (5), apple pie (2) and [[Ice pop]] (1).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3208">'''PGY''', short for '''postgraduate year''', refers to a [[North America]]n numerical scheme denoting the progress of postgraduate dental, medicine, podiatry or pharmacy residents in their [[residency (medicine)|residency]] programs. It is used to stratify responsibility in most training programs and to determine [[salary]].  The grade of the resident is denoted with a numeral after the PGY designation, such as PGY-3 for a third-year resident.

The length of residency depends mostly on the field a graduate chooses to take. Medical specialties such as [[family medicine]] and [[internal medicine]] often requires three years, whereas [[surgery]] usually requires a minimum of five, and neurological surgery is the longest at seven years. Subspecialization (vascular or orthopedic spine surgery as a branch of surgery, for example) in any field will add time to postgraduate training.

For more information on specific medical residency programs, see the [[American Medical Association| American Medical Association's]] [[FREIDA Online| Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database]].

Dental residencies for [[general Practice Residency|general practice]], known as GPRs, are generally one year, with a possibility of a second year at some facilities. Dental specialties, such as [[orthodontics]], require 2–4 years, while [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] requires 4–6 years. Some specialty programs require that applicants have completed at least a one-year GPR residency, while other programs require applicants to have some private practice experience as a general dentist. Regardless of requirements, completing a GPR residency will make an applicant more competitive for any specialty program. 

[[Medical physics]] residencies range between two and four years, with at least two years fulfilling the necessary clinical experience. Completion of a CAMPEP-accredited residency allows one to sit for board examinations administered through the [[American Board of Radiology]]. PGY-3, and/or if also available -4, generally consist of scholarly research years, akin to a postdoctoral research position. Residencies options are either radiation oncology physics or medical imaging.

Pharmacy residencies are usually one year, but a PGY-2 can be completed, often as an option, for pharmacy specialties such as critical care, cardiology, oncology, etc.

In some teaching institutions, trainees are required to indicate level of training on all signatures (John Doe, M.D., PGY-1 or R-1; or John Doe, D.O., PGY-1 or R-1).

Residencies are also offered for those in the [[physician assistant]] profession in a variety of specialties such as surgery and emergency medicine.

Internships and residencies are also offered for those who have completed graduate education in psychology, known as interns and post-doc fellows.

'''Peter James Knight''' (born  1 January 1954) is an [[Australia]]n [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] activist who shot dead a security guard in a [[Melbourne]] [[abortion]] clinic. Following his arrest and a criminal trial, Knight is serving a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] with a minimum [[parole|non-parole]] period of 23 years.

==Early years and background==
Knight was one of six children born into a [[Roman Catholicism in Australia|Roman Catholic]] family in {{NSWcity|Bathurst}}, [[New South Wales]]. He led a hermit's life in the years leading up to the incident&lt;ref name=sentence&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=R v Knight|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/2002/498.html|link= |court=VSC|num=498|year=2002|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=19 November 2002|courtname=auto|juris=|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a bush camp in the Killanbutta State Forest near {{NSWcity|Molong}}, 'off the grid' without a telephone or electricity. He did, however, frequently attend anti-abortion rallies in [[Sydney]] and Melbourne. Knight was also opposed to smoking, smokers, tobacco companies and the taking of oaths.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

==Murder and legal proceedings==
On 16 July 2001 he walked into the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic, a private abortion provider, carrying a rifle and other weapons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abortion clinic guard killer jailed for life|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s730342.htm|work=[[The World Today (Australian radio program)|The World Today]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|format=transcript|date=19 November 2002|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including {{convert|16|l}} of [[kerosene]], three lighters, torches, 30 gags, and a handwritten note that read "We regret to advise that as a result of a fatal accident involving some members of staff, we have been forced to cancel all appointments today".

Knight later stated that he intended to massacre everyone in the clinic, and attack all Melbourne abortion clinics. He developed home made mouth gags and door jambs to restrain all patients and staff inside a clinic while he doused them with the kerosene.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/deluded-prolife-crusader-peter-james-knight-kills-guard-but-wanted-more-dead-after-he-brought-his-gun-and-hatred-to-an-abortion-clinic-in-melbourne/news-story/c5a432d3036f9d745640a3c02810dab9|title=Deluded pro-life crusader Peter James Knight kills guard, but wanted more dead after he brought his gun and hatred to an abortion clinic in Melbourne|author=Anderson, Paul|work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=11 March 2014|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shot 44-year-old Stephen Gordon Rogers, a security guard, in the chest, killing him. Staff and clients overpowered him soon after. He intended to massacre the 15 staff and 26 patients at the clinic by burning them alive.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

For many weeks after his arrest Knight refused to answer questions or cooperate with police investigations. Due to his hermitic life, [[Victorian Police]] were unable to confirm his identity&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt; until three months after his arrest, even though his photographs were published in major newspapers. According to psychiatrist Don Sendipathy, Knight interpreted the [[Bible]] in his own unique way and believed in his own brand of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/19/1037697662403.html|title='Remorseless' recluse gets life|author1=Berry, Jamie|author2=Munro, Ian|work=[[The Age]]|date=19 November 2002|access-date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After choosing to not obtain legal representation,&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Knight was found guilty by a [[trial by jury|jury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/story/752703/peter-knight-guilty-of-abortion-clinic-murder/|title=Peter Knight guilty of abortion clinic murder|work=[[Central Western Daily]]|date=23 April 2002|access-date=5 May 2018|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 19 November 2002, he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum non-parole period of 23 years.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Knight will be aged in his 70s before being eligible for parole. On 14 May 2003 Knight lodged an [[appeal]] against his conviction; however his appeal was dismissed as it was not lodged within fourteen days of his sentence, as required under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=R v Knight|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2004/48.html|link=|court=VSCA|num=48|year=2004|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=25 March 2004|courtname=auto|juris=|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/security-guard-killer-peter-james-knight-loses-appeal-bid-over-death-of-steven-rogers/news-story/f7fc8c79d996e0ef1eae7888b59bd79f|title=Security guard killer Peter James Knight loses appeal bid over death of Steven Rogers|work=news.com.au|author=Iaria, Melissa|agency=[[Australian Associated Press]]|date=20 May 2011|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving time in [[HM Prison Barwon]], near [[Geelong]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">'''Project SCUM''' was a plan proposed in 1995 by [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] (RJR) to sell cigarettes to members of the "[[alternative lifestyle]]" areas of San Francisco, in particular the large number of [[gay]] people in the [[The Castro|Castro]] and homeless people in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]]. The acronym "SCUM" stood for "subculture urban marketing." Perhaps recognizing the offensive nature of its label, the marketing plan was later renamed '''Project Sourdough'''.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Landman,  [https://web.archive.org/web/20030525040449/http://tobaccodocuments.org/landman/518021121.html Project Scum], original Project Scum document images with analysis, Tobacco Documents Online&lt;/ref&gt;

An anti-smoking campaign called [[TheTruth.com|Truth]] targeted R. J. Reynolds for Project SCUM, arguing that it not only showed the usual exploitative tobacco marketing techniques but added to them an explicit contempt or even hatred for the people it was trying to market its products to. ''[[SF Weekly]]'' reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This is a hate crime, plain and simple," says Kathleen DeBold, who directs the Washington, D.C.-based [[Mautner Project]] for Lesbians With Cancer. "What else do you call it when a group thinks of gays and lesbians as 'scum,' and then targets us with something that kills?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly, who represents the Tenderloin District, is equally upset. "It's racist, it's classist, it's oppressive. And it is really disheartening to hear. But I can't say that I am surprised. Low-income communities and people of color have always been derided and taken advantage of. Obviously, the tobacco companies feel like they can make money off other people's misery."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-05-02/news/smoking-gun/ San Francisco - News - Smoking Gun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Project SCUM documents came to light after a court order forced R. J. Reynolds to hand them over during the State of California's litigation against tobacco companies. R. J. Reynolds's marketing in the 1990s of its Camel and Winston cigarette brands drew the attention of attorneys representing California cities and counties. Project SCUM highlighted how tobacco companies in the 1990s were targeting young adults to be lifetime smokers.&lt;ref name="attorney"&gt;[http://www.lieffcabraser.com/Case-Center/Multi-State-Tobacco-Suits-and-Master-Settlement.shtml Multi-State Tobacco Litigation - www.lieffcabraser.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108150133/http://www.lieffcabraser.com/Case-Center/Multi-State-Tobacco-Suits-and-Master-Settlement.shtml |date=2016-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations about Project SCUM were among the mountains of evidence ensuring that anti-tobacco litigation would continue. In 1998, a resolution of the litigation came about in the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|Master Settlement Agreement]] between more than 40 state attorneys general and the tobacco industry.

A '''pulpotomy''' is the removal of a portion of the pulp, including the diseased aspect, with the intent of maintaining the vitality of the remaining pulpal tissue by means of a therapeutic dressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = pulpotomy | url = http://www.ada.org/glossaryforprofessionals.aspx#p | work = American Dental Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; A healthy tooth has a space inside it called the "pulp space" which is filled with soft tissues - nerves, blood vessels, and pink connective tissue. When a carious process develops in a tooth, the bacteria associated with it can cause pulpal inflammation, which is often what causes toothache.

[[File:Tooth-01.png|thumb|Diagram of general tooth anatomy.]]

Damage to the pulp of permanent teeth usually requires a root canal treatment or [[endodontic therapy]]. The pulp of primary or deciduous teeth, which only have to survive until an adult teeth come in, and because they have a better blood supply, can sometimes be saved.

==Indications==

===Primary teeth===
Primary/deciduous (baby) teeth in children have relatively large pulp spaces. Caries do not have to develop significantly before they reach the pulp chamber.

[[File:Tooth-02.png|thumb|Visual of tooth decay.]]

When the soft tissue in the pulp chamber is ''infected'' (has bacteria in it) or ''affected'' (is inflamed), it can be removed by a dentist or dental therapist under local anaesthetic. If the soft tissue in the canals is still healthy enough, a special medicated filling can be put into the chamber in an attempt to keep the remaining pulp (in the canals) alive. The process of removing the pulp from the chamber is the actual "pulpotomy", though the word is often used for the entire process including placement of the medication. There are many medicaments that can be used to fill the pulp chamber including zinc-oxide eugenol as well as mineral trioxide aggregate. 

There are two types of pulpotomy techniques depending the extent of caries in a tooth and the symptoms it presents. A vital pulpotomy or a non-vital pulpotomy can be carried out. However, recent research shows that non-vital pulpotomies are rarely indicated due to their low success rates and it is therefore sometimes better to extract the tooth. 

[[File:Tooth-03.png|thumb|Diagram of pulpotomy.]]

Afterwards the tooth is restored with a regular filling, either composite or amalgam, or a stainless steel crown. Due to the process of a pulpotomy causing the tooth to become slightly brittle, a stainless steel crown is normally indicated as the preferred choice of definitive restoration.

A pulpotomy can be done to both permanent and primary teeth.

== Types ==

=== Partial Pulpotomy for Carious Exposures ===
In some cases, radicular pulp (pulp within the root of a tooth) may remain healthy despite carious exposure of the pulp chamber. In cases where root formation is incomplete (as during adolescent years), a partial pulpotomy may keep radicular pulp vital long enough to allow the roots to develop fully.&lt;ref name="pmid27931467"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Guideline on Pulp Therapy for Primary and Immature Permanent Teeth | journal = Pediatric Dentistry | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 280–288 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27931467 | doi = | url =  http://www.aapd.org/media/policies_guidelines/g_pulp.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partial Pulpotomy for Traumatic Exposures ===
A partial pulpotomy for traumatic exposures is also called a Cvek Pulpotomy.  When a baby tooth or young permanent tooth is traumatised - say, hitting your teeth on the handlebars of a bike - it can be broken in such a way that the pulp is exposed. Again, a partial pulpotomy may help it to finish developing and be saved.

=== Adult Pulpotomy ===
Adult pulpotomies are not as popular with dentists today as they were 100 years ago. Historically, traditional endodontia has been reported to be a more reliable treatment than pulpotomy techniques, based on the rate of saved teeth and the longevity of their preservation.However, new research is changing this view. The pulpotomy, as a therapeutic dental treatment, has a long history. It has been used for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Glidewell Laboratories | title = Is It Time to Do Routine Adult Pulpotomies? | url = http://glidewelldental.com/education/chairside-dental-magazine/volume-7-issue-1/clinical-techniques-is-it-time-to-do-routine-adult-pulpotomies/ |  journal = Chairside Magazine | volume = 7 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicaments ==
In primary teeth medicaments such as formocresol, [[mineral trioxide aggregate]], zinc oxide eugenol and [[calcium hydroxide]] can be used in pulpotomy. Formocresol use has been questioned due to toxicity concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Godhi B, Sood PB, Sharma A | title = Effects of mineral trioxide aggregate and formocresol on vital pulp after pulpotomy of primary molars: An in vivo study | journal = Contemporary Clinical Dentistry | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 296–301 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22346156 | pmc = 3276856 | doi = 10.4103/0976-237X.91792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferric sulphate]], [[sodium hypochlorite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shabzendedar M, Mazhari F, Alami M, Talebi M | title = Sodium hypochlorite vs formocresol as pulpotomy medicaments in primary molars: 1-year follow-up | journal = Pediatric Dentistry | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–32 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23930631 | url = http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=0164-1263&amp;volume=35&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=329&amp;aulast=Shabzendedar }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Mutairi MA, Bawazir OA | title = Sodium hypochlorite versus Formocresol in primary molars pulpotomies: a randomized clinical trial | journal = European Journal of Paediatric Dentistry | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–6 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23597217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a local anaesthetic solution containing a vasoconstrictor agent can be used to arrest any bleeding from the pulp prior to the placement of medicament.

Calcium enriched mixtures have been used in permanent molar teeth with irreversible pulpitis showing positive outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yazdani S, Jadidfard MP, Tahani B, Kazemian A, Dianat O, Alim Marvasti L | title = Health Technology Assessment of CEM Pulpotomy in Permanent Molars with Irreversible Pulpitis | journal = Iranian Endodontic Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–9 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24396372 | pmc = 3881298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative pulpotomy techniques==

=== Electro-surgery pulpotomy ===
Also known as non-chemical devitalization. Its mechanism of action is the [[cauterization]] of the pulp tissue. It carburizes heat-denaturated pulp and bacterial contamination.

=== Laser pulpotomy ===
This technique overcomes [[Histology|histological]] effects of electro-surgery. It creates a superficial zone of coagulation or [[necrosis]] that remains compatible with the underlying tissue and isolates the pulp from vigorous effects of the sub-base.

== Objectives ==
# Maintenance of radicular portion vitality.
# Post-op clinical and [[radiographic]] evaluation should show no complications such as pain, swelling, sinus presence [[internal resorption]] or abnormal canal calcification. Additionally, the formation of a radiolucency [[wikt:subjacent|subjacent]] to the furcation in primary teeth can indicate failure.
# Neither breakdown of the supporting tissue, nor [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to [[succedaneous tooth|succedaneous teeth]] should be detected.

'''Sizergh Castle and Garden''' is a [[stately home]] and [[garden]] at [[Helsington]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Cumbria]], about {{convert|4|mi|km}} south of [[Kendal]]. The [[castle]], a grade I [[listed building]],&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1318962 |desc=Sizergh Castle |access-date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] along with its garden and estate. It is the home of the Hornyold-Strickland family. 

In 2016 the Sizergh estate was included in the newly extended [[Lake District National Park]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34614556 | title=Yorkshire Dales and Lake District national parks to be extended | date=October 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
[[File:Sizergh Castle against a blue sky, July 2016.jpg|thumb|The tower at Sizergh Castle, as viewed from the South]]
The earliest part of the building is a tower of fourteenth or fifteenth century date.&lt;ref name="EH" /&gt;

=== Woodwork ===
There are [[oak]]-panelled interiors, including the Inlaid Chamber, where the panelling is inlaid with floral and geometric patterns in pale
poplar and dark [[Bog oak|bog-oak]]. The contents of the Inlaid Chamber were sold to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in the 1890s and it was displayed as a reconstructed period room.
The return of the panelling to its original location at Sizergh was advocated by among others [[Mark Girouard]]. The panelling returned in 1999 under a long-term loan.&lt;ref name="VandA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/l/loans-and-exhibitions/ | title=Inlaid Room at Sizergh Castle | publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum | accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017 it was reported that transfer of ownership to the National Trust had been made formal.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/02/va-returns-tudor-bedroom-to-original-sizergh-castle-setting |title=V&amp;A returns Tudor bedroom... |last=Kennedy |year=2017 |website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bargeboard]]s probably date from the seventeenth century.

=== Paintings ===
The Castle contains a variety of paintings, including the following:

* a collection of portraits of the [[Jacobite succession|Catholic Royal Stuart family]] reflects the Strickland family's links to the Jacobite court in exile at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. There are portraits by [[Alexis Simon Belle]], [[painter in ordinary]] to [[James II of England|James VII &amp; II]] and the [[Old Pretender]], of [[Mary of Modena|Queen Mary of Modena]] and her daughter [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Princess Louisa Maria]].&lt;ref&gt;Corp, Edward, ''Belle, Alexis-Simon (1674–1734)'' in [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==History==
The [[Deincourt family]] owned this land from the 1170s. On the marriage of Elizabeth Deincourt to Sir William de Stirkeland in 1239, the estate passed into the hands of what became the [[Strickland (surname)|Strickland]] family, who owned it until it was gifted to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1950 by [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland]]'s grandson Lt. Cdr. Thomas Hornyold-Strickland, 7th Count della Catena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Henry Hornyold-Strickland, Sizergh|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1355807867628/|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20140205180528/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1355807867628/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-02-05|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catherine Parr]], the [[Wives of Henry VIII|sixth wife]] of [[Henry VIII]] and a relative of the Stricklands, is thought to have lived here after her first husband died in 1533. Catherine's second husband, [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Latymer|Lord Latymer]], was kin to the [[dowager]] Lady Strickland.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. James. ''Catherine Parr: Henry VIII's Last Love''. The History Press, 2008, 2009. pg 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Porter (historian)|Linda Porter]], ''Katherine the Queen''. Macmillan, 2010. pg 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was extended in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times. Sir [[Thomas Strickland (cavalier)|Thomas Strickland]] went into exile with James II.

Around 1770, the great hall was again expanded in the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] style.

==Media interest==
The Castle was featured in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] documentary ''Inside the National Trust''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: 'Inside the National Trust': preview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelvideo/10372939/Inside-the-National-Trust-preview.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garden==
[[File:Sizergh Castle garden.jpg|thumb|Sizergh Castle and part of the garden]]
The garden has a lake and a kitchen garden as well as an award-winning [[rock garden]]. The rock garden, which was constructed in the 1920s, is the largest [[limestone]] rock garden belonging to the National Trust. It includes part of the [[NCCPG National Plant Collection|National Collection]] of hardy [[fern]]s.

==Estate==
In 1336 a grant from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] allowed Sir Walter Strickland to enclose the land around Sizergh as his exclusive park.

The estate covers {{convert|647|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/item273909/ |title=Sizergh - Visitor information |publisher=National Trust |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111084944/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/item273909/ |archivedate=2012-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiversity===

There are various types of habitat on the estate. For example, in 2014 it was reported that 35 [[Hectare|ha]] of wetland habitat was being created in the [[Lyth Valley]] on the western edge of the estate. The project received funding from [[Natural England]] as part of a [[Environmental stewardship (England)|higher level stewardship scheme]]. It is hoped to attract [[Eurasian bittern|bittern]] and other wildlife.&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/farm_and_country/11541212.Park_End_Moss_aims_to_bring_wildlife_flooding_in/ | title=Park End Moss aims to bring wildlife flooding in | work=[[Westmorland Gazette]] | accessdate=21 November 2014 | author=Dickinson, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sizergh has received support from the Morecambe Bay [[Nature Improvement Area]] which received three years of government grant funding (2012–15). Projects continue under the auspices of the Morecambe Bay Partnership, a registered charity.&lt;ref name="LNP"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birds====
The Sizergh estate is a good place to see birds. For example, [[hawfinch]]es are attracted to the area because of its [[hornbeam]] trees, and these birds sometimes come close to the main car park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sizergh/wildlife/ Our elusive hawfinch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LNP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.morecambebaynature.org.uk/hawfinch-recovery-project | title=Hawfinch recovery project | publisher=Morecambe Bay Local Nature Partnership | accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Butterflies====
[[Argynnis|Fritillary butterflies]] live on the estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countryfile.com/tips-techniques/best-places-photograph-wildlife-uk The Best Places to Photograph Wildlife in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No smoking UK full.svg|thumb|A no smoking sign asserting that a smoker would be breaking the law]]
A '''smoking ban in England''', making it illegal to [[tobacco smoking|smoke]] in all enclosed work places in [[England]], came into force on 1 July 2007 as a consequence of the [[Health Act 2006]]. Similar bans had already been introduced by the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]: in [[Scotland]] on 26 March 2006, [[Wales]] on 2 April 2007 and [[Northern Ireland]] on 30 April 2007.

==Before the smoking ban==
[[File:Smoke-by-a-window-in-a-pub.jpg|thumb|upright|Before the ban, smoking was commonplace in pubs]]
Before the ban many businesses voluntarily introduced bans on smoking mainly as a result of public feedback. The pub chain [[Wetherspoons]] was the first major chain to introduce a complete ban on indoor smoking, doing so in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wetherspoon pubs ban smoking|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4201053.stm|accessdate=19 March 2015|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC Online|date=24 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tobacco advertising#United Kingdom|Tobacco advertising]] had been banned in England gradually starting with a ban on [[Television Advertising]] of cigarettes in 1965 to a complete ban on all Tobacco Advertising in 2005.

==Passage of the law==
On 16 November 2004 a Public Health [[white paper]] proposed a smoking ban in almost all public places in [[England and Wales]]. Smoking restrictions would be phased in, with a ban on smoking in [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] and government buildings by 2006, in enclosed public places by 2007, and pubs, bars and restaurants (except pubs not serving food) by the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4014597.stm |title=Smoking ban proposed for England |publisher=BBC News |date=16 November 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2005, after external challenge and debates within the Cabinet, the government announced that it would continue with its plans. All workplaces, including restaurants and pubs selling food, would have to comply by summer 2007&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4375478.stm |title=Smoke ban bill details released |publisher=BBC News |date=27 October 2005 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was widespread criticism from all sides of the argument on this, with a number of MPs threatening to try to overturn the bill. Many representatives of the licensed trade told the Government that only a total ban would work, and over 90 MPs signed a motion demanding this, with over 100 signing a petition for a free vote on the issue. It was reported on 24 November that Chief Medical Officer [[Liam Donaldson]] nearly quit over the partial ban, but decided to stay to champion a total ban.&lt;ref name=DonaldsonQuit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4466176.stm |title=Chief medic considered quitting |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2005 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the government released the results of the public consultation, after [[Cancer Research UK]] demanded them under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]], which revealed that nearly 9 out of 10 respondents wanted a total ban.&lt;ref name=DonaldsonQuit/&gt;

On 11 January 2006, the government further announced that it would give MPs a [[conscience vote|free vote]] on an amendment to the Health Bill, submitted by the Health [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]], to instigate a comprehensive smoke-free workplace regulations. [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] [[Patricia Hewitt]] voted in favour of the amendment and, in so doing, voted against her own Department's then publicly stated policy (i.e. the proposed partial regulations). All other parties had offered free votes on the issue which was debated on 14 February, with three options: the present compromise, a total ban, or an exemption for members' clubs only.

On 14 February 2006, the House of Commons first voted on the amendment to the original compromise plan, to extend the ban to all enclosed public places except private members' clubs. The amendment was carried with a large majority. MPs then voted on a further amendment to ban smoking in all enclosed public places including private members' clubs. Again this amendment gained significant support and was carried with a large majority. This therefore replaced the earlier successful amendment which would have allowed smoking only in private members' clubs. The legislation was passed by the House of Lords, allowing a total smoking ban in enclosed public places to come into force in England.

Political opposition did not entirely disappear at this point, the [[House of Lords]] Economic Affairs Committee accused the Government of overreacting to the threat posed by [[passive smoking]] and said that the smoking ban was symptomatic of MPs' failure to understand risk&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5tkNlefMT?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article672477.ece&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 June 2006.

The ban came into force on 1 July 2007, as announced on 30 November 2006 by former [[Secretary of State for Health]] [[Patricia Hewitt]], who called it "a huge step forward for public health".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Following the passing of the law==

[[File:Smoking shelter, Encon, Deighton Close, Wetherby (25th October 2015).JPG|thumb|right|A smoking shelter outside an office building in England.  Since 2007 such shelters have become commonplace at workplaces.]]
On 30 June 2010, the recently formed Coalition Government announced that it would not be reviewing the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10478753 |title=BBC News - 'No plans' for smoking ban review |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt in October 2010 by Conservative MP David Nuttall to amend the law to exempt private members' clubs and pubs from the smoking ban was defeated in the House of Commons on its first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23887598-smoking-ban-exemptions-bid-defeated.do |title=Smoking ban exemptions bid defeated &amp;#124; News |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225143157/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23887598-smoking-ban-exemptions-bid-defeated.do |archivedate=25 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exemptions from the law==

While the ban affects almost all indoor workplaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20063368.htm |title=The Smoke-free (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2006 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; some exemptions were provided:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/20070765.htm |title=The Smoke-free (Exemptions and Vehicles) Regulations 2007 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* designated rooms in offshore [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s
* designated rooms in mental health units ''(until 1 July 2008)''

An exemption was also theoretically possible within the
[[Palace of Westminster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Parliamentary Privilege First Report |work= |publisher=The Stationery Office |date=4 September 2007 |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/jt199899/jtselect/jtpriv/43/4309.htm |doi= |accessdate=4 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032749/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/jt199899/jtselect/jtpriv/43/4309.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as for other Royal Palaces, although members of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]] agreed to observe the spirit of the ban and restrict any smoking within the grounds of Parliament to four designated outside areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6273830.stm |title=MPs 'smoking in Commons toilets' |publisher=BBC News |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking is permitted in a private residence, although not in areas used as a shared work-space. In flats with communal entrances or shared corridors, these must be smoke-free.

University [[halls of residence]] presented some dilemmas in practice as regards defining what is public and private. Several universities have imposed a blanket ban on smoking including halls of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/safety/health_and_safety/policy/2/b/13/1 |title=Part 3B Section 13.1 |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public transport==
As part of the implementation of the smoking ban, [[Transport for London]] announced that smoking would be no longer permitted on taxis, private hire vehicles and all [[London Buses]] premises, including all [[bus shelter|bus stop shelters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking ban: impact on London's transport network|date=6 June 2007|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2007/june/smoking-ban-impact-on-londons-transport-network|website=tfl.gov.uk |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |access-date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association of Train Operating Companies]] and [[Network Rail]] introduced an extended ban on smoking covering all railway property including all [[National Rail]] station platforms whether enclosed or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoke Free Law and Vehicles|url=http://www.smokefreeengland.co.uk/faq/vehicles/|website=Smoke Free England|publisher=Smoke Free England|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban has since been extended to cover the use of [[Electronic cigarette]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Rail companies ban e-cigarettes from trains and stations|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rail-companies-ban-ecigarettes-from-trains-and-stations-8757883.html|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=Independent|date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking on board trains was banned in 2005 when both [[Great North Eastern Railway|GNER]] and [[Caledonian Sleeper|First Caledonian Sleeper]] withdrew smoking accommodation from their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End of the line for train smoking|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4192862.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC News (London)|date=29 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First ScotRail withdraws smoking on Caledonian Sleeper service ahead of £1million refurbishment|url=http://www.scotrail.co.uk/content/first-scotrail-withdraws-smoking-caledonian-sleeper-service-ahead-%C3%82%C2%A31million-refurbishment|accessdate=14 March 2015|agency=First Group|publisher=First Scotrail|date=28 August 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150315130116/http://www.scotrail.co.uk/content/first-scotrail-withdraws-smoking-caledonian-sleeper-service-ahead-%C3%82%C2%A31million-refurbishment|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] was the first public transport system to ban in its entirety which has been enforced since the system first opened in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Metro was built|url=http://www.nexus.org.uk/history/how-metro-was-built|website=Tyne and Wear Metro|publisher=Nexus|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policing of the ban==

The ban is enforced by Environmental Health Officers in England, who issue warnings and offer advice before resorting to punitive measures and have had to issue a low frequency of fines since the law came into force. However, there were some objectors who generated higher-profile legal cases, for instance {{anchor|Hugh_Howitt}}Hugh Howitt, also known as Hamish Howitt, the landlord of the Happy Scots Bar in Blackpool who was the first landlord to be prosecuted for permitting smoking in a smoke-free place under his control. On 2 August 2007, Howitt appeared before Blackpool Magistrates' Court and pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of failing to stop people smoking in his pub. On 2 December 2008, Howitt effectively had his premises licence revoked, after an appeal by Blackpool Council was upheld; he was not allowed to appeal, and Howitt had to close the Delboys Bar following the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Wilmore | title = Blackpool smoke ban rebel loses licence | url = http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Legal/Licensing-law/Blackpool-smoke-ban-rebel-loses-licence | publisher = [[The Publican]] | date = 2 December 2008 | accessdate = 5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Fielding | title = Bar shuts as smoking rebel loses court fight | url = http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/blackpoolnews/Bar-shuts-as-smoking-rebel.4754860.jp | publisher = [[Blackpool Gazette]] | date = 5 December 2008 | accessdate = 5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some incidents of violence perpetrated by people refusing to obey the ban, in one of which a former heavyweight boxer, [[James Oyebola]], was shot in the head after he asked a customer at a nightclub to stop smoking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6912900.stm |title=Boxer shot over club smoking row |publisher=BBC News |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later died of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6919403.stm |title=Boxer shot in smoking row dies |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the view of enforcement authorities is that the smoke-free workplace regulations are simple to understand, popular, and as a result largely 'self-policing'. For a short while, bars in the UK that offered [[Mu‘assel|shisha]] (the smoking of flavoured [[tobacco]] through a pipe) were still allowed to provide their services inside the establishment, however the ban covered this area in late 2007 leading to a rapid decline in [[shisha bar]]s.

A legal blunder by [[Stoke-on-Trent]] City Council meant that, while the smoking ban still applied in the city, the council were unable to issue fines to people caught flouting the law until 16 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Council error stubs out smoke ban|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6290462.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blunder caused the city to briefly be dubbed Smoke-on-Trent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Kathryn|title=Smoke-on-Trent reignites debate|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6293016.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|agency=BBC Stoke|publisher=BBC|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the ban==

A group calling themselves "Freedom To Choose", launched a campaign for a [[judicial review]] of the smoke-free workplace regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedom2choose.info/ |title=Freedom To Choose |publisher=Freedom2choose.info |date=12 October 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming a breach of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], as it does not respect the right to privacy of people who wish to smoke in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swindon Advertiser|date=19 June 2007|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/search/display.var.1482703.0.nonsmoking_landlord_braced_for_high_court_ban_battle.php|title= Non-smoking landlord braced for High Court ban battle|accessdate=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the regulations put forward counter-arguments positing that the rights of smokers to indulge in their habit cease as soon as it negatively affects other people in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Melville|date=1 July 2007|url=http://www.eurosong.net/smokingban|title= Smoking ban: why did we have to wait for so long?|publisher=eurosong.net|accessdate=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 pub landlord Nick Hogan was jailed for an offence related to the smoking ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Daily Mail|date=27 February 2010 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1254126/Pub-landlord-Nick-Hogan-given-smoking-ban-jail-sentence.html|title= Pub landlord is first person in Britain to be jailed over smoking ban |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012 it was reported that "Five years after the introduction of the smoking ban in England, almost seven out of 10 licensees want the legislation amended to allow for separate smoking rooms in pubs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Publican's Morning Advertiser|date=3 July 2012 |url=http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/General-News/Smoking-ban-Majority-of-licensees-want-smoking-legislation-amended-for-pubs|title= Smoking ban: Majority of licensees want smoking legislation amended for pubs |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 YouGov survey indicated growing support for the smoking ban, up to 83% from the 2007 figure of 78%. This was attributed to more smokers supporting the legislation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Action on Smoking and Health|date= 1 July 2017 |url=http://ash.org.uk/media-and-news/press-releases-media-and-news/england-a-decade-after-the-smoking-ban-heading-for-a-smokefree-future|title= England a decade after the smoking ban – heading for a smokefree future

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">In [[health economics]], '''Time-Trade-Off''' (TTO) is a technique used to measure the [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] that a person or group is experiencing. An individual will be presented with a set of directions such as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine that you are told that you have 10 years left to live. In connection with this you are also told that you can choose to live these 10 years in your current health state or that you can choose to give up some life years to live for a shorter period in full health. Indicate with a cross on the line the number of years in full health that you think is of equal value to 10 years in your current health state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Burstrom |title=A comparison of individual and social time-trade-off values for health states in the general population |journal=Health Policy |volume=76 |year=2006 |pages=359–370 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.06.011 |pmid=16214258 |last2=Johannesson |first2=M |last3=Diderichsen |first3=F|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The answer given by the individual shows how many years in the current health state they would be willing to 'trade off', in order to regain full health. This answer can be used to calculate the individual's quality of life in that health state. 

For example, an individual with severe [[asthma]] could be offered 10 years in their current condition, or a shorter length of time in full health. If this individual is willing to trade off two of the ten offered years in order to regain full health, this suggests that eight years in full health has the same value as ten years with severe asthma. In this case, the individual would have valued living with severe asthma at 0.8, relative to full health (defined as 1.0).

TTO scores can be influenced by socio-demographic characteristics and attitudinal variables of respondents, such as age, gender, marital status, having children, health status, education level, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Nooten |first1=Floortje |last2=Busschbach |first2=Jan |last3=van Agthoven |first3=Michel |last4=van Exel |first4=Job |last5=Brouwer |first5=Werner |title=What should we know about the person behind a TTO? |journal=The European Journal of Health Economics |date=18 April 2018 |doi=10.1007/s10198-018-0975-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they can be influenced by the effects of ill health on consumptive activities and non-health-related utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adarkwah |first1=Charles Christian |last2=Sadoghi |first2=Amirhossein |last3=Gandjour |first3=Afschin |title=Should Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Include the Cost of Consumption Activities? AN Empirical Investigation |journal=Health Economics |date=February 2016 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=249–256 |doi=10.1002/hec.3162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time-trade-off results are often used to calculate [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs), allowing healthcare decisionmakers to combine [[Death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] into a single interval scale. 

Other tools that are used to determine quality of life are the [[visual analogue scale]] (VAS), the standard gamble method, the [[EQ-5D]], the [[Health Utilities Index]] (HUI), etc.
