      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6616">In [[algebraic geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''adequate equivalence relation''' is an [[equivalence relation]] on [[algebraic cycles]] of smooth [[projective varieties]] used to obtain a well-working theory of such cycles, and in particular, well-defined [[intersection theory|intersection products]]. [[Pierre Samuel]] formalized the concept of an adequate equivalence relation in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Samuel | first=Pierre | title=Relations d'équivalence en géométrie algébrique | journal=Proc. ICM | year=1958 | publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press | pages=470–487 | url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1958/Main/icm1958.0470.0487.ocr.pdf | author-link=Pierre Samuel | access-date=2015-07-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722145343/http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1958/Main/icm1958.0470.0487.ocr.pdf | archive-date=2017-07-22 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has become central to theory of motives. For every adequate equivalence relation, one may define the category of [[motive (algebraic geometry)|pure motives]] with respect to that relation.

Possible (and useful) adequate equivalence relations include ''rational'', ''algebraic'', ''homological'' and ''numerical equivalence''. They are called "adequate" because dividing out by the equivalence relation is functorial, i.e. push-forward (with change of co-dimension) and pull-back of cycles is well-defined. Codimension one cycles modulo rational equivalence form the classical group of [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]]s. All cycles modulo rational equivalence form the [[Chow ring]].

== Definition ==
Let ''Z&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(X)'' := '''Z'''[''X''] be the free abelian group on the algebraic cycles of ''X''. Then an adequate equivalence relation is a family of [[equivalence relation]]s, ''∼&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' on ''Z&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(X)'', one for each smooth projective variety ''X'', satisfying the following three conditions:
# (Linearity) The equivalence relation is compatible with addition of cycles.
# ([[Chow's moving lemma|Moving lemma]]) If &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in Z^{*}(X)&lt;/math&gt; are cycles on ''X'', then there exists a cycle &lt;math&gt;\alpha' \in Z^{*}(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ''~&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; intersects &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; properly.
# (Push-forwards) Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in Z^{*}(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \in Z^{*}(X \times Y)&lt;/math&gt; be cycles such that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; intersects &lt;math&gt;\alpha \times Y&lt;/math&gt; properly. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ''~&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; 0'', then &lt;math&gt;(\pi_Y)_{*}(\beta \cdot (\alpha \times Y))&lt;/math&gt; ''~&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; 0'', where &lt;math&gt;\pi_Y : X \times Y \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is the projection.

The push-forward cycle in the last axiom is often denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(\alpha) := (\pi_Y)_{*}(\beta \cdot (\alpha \times Y))&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the graph of a function, then this reduces to the push-forward of the function. The generalizations of functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' to cycles on ''X × Y'' are known as [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondences]]. The last axiom allows us to push forward cycles by a correspondence.

In [[Boolean algebra]], the '''algebraic normal form''' ('''ANF'''), '''ring sum normal form''' ('''RSNF''' or '''RNF'''), ''[[Zhegalkin normal form]]'', or ''[[Reed–Muller expansion]]'' is a way of writing logical formulas in one of three subforms:

* The entire formula is purely true or false:
*: 1
*: 0
* One or more variables are [[logical conjunction|AND]]ed together into a term, then one or more terms are [[exclusive or|XOR]]ed together into ANF. No [[negation|NOT]]s are permitted:
*: a ⊕ b ⊕ ab ⊕ abc
:or in standard propositional logic symbols:
::&lt;math&gt; a \veebar b \veebar \left(a \wedge b\right) \veebar \left(a \wedge b \wedge c\right) &lt;/math&gt;
* The previous subform with a purely true term:
*: 1 ⊕ a ⊕ b ⊕ ab ⊕ abc

{{anchor|PPRM}}Formulas written in ANF are also known as [[Zhegalkin polynomial]]s ({{lang-ru|полиномы Жегалкина}}) and Positive Polarity (or Parity) [[Reed–Muller code|Reed–Muller expressions]] (PPRM).&lt;ref name="Steinbach_2009"/&gt;

== Common uses ==
ANF is a [[canonical form (Boolean algebra)|normal form]], which means that two equivalent formulas will convert to the same ANF, easily showing whether two formulas are equivalent for [[automated theorem proving]]. Unlike other normal forms, it can be represented as a simple list of lists of variable names. [[Conjunctive normal form|Conjunctive]] and [[disjunctive normal form|disjunctive]] normal forms also require recording whether each variable is negated or not. [[Negation normal form]] is unsuitable for that purpose, since it doesn't use equality as its equivalence relation: a &amp;or; ¬a isn't reduced to the same thing as 1, even though they're equal.

Putting a formula into ANF also makes it easy to identify [[linearity|linear]] functions (used, for example, in [[linear feedback shift register]]s): a linear function is one that is a sum of single literals.  Properties of nonlinear feedback [[shift register]]s can also be deduced from certain properties of the feedback function in ANF.

== Performing operations within algebraic normal form ==
There are straightforward ways to perform the standard boolean operations on ANF inputs in order to get ANF results.

XOR (logical exclusive disjunction) is performed directly:
: ({{fontcolor|red|1 ⊕ x}}) ⊕ ({{fontcolor|green|1 ⊕ x ⊕ y}})
: {{fontcolor|red|1 ⊕ x}} ⊕ {{fontcolor|green|1 ⊕ x ⊕ y}}
: 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ x ⊕ x ⊕ y
: y

NOT (logical negation) is XORing 1:&lt;ref name="not-equiv"&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=simplify+1+xor+a WolframAlpha NOT-equivalence demonstration: ¬a = 1 ⊕ a]&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{fontcolor|red|¬}}{{fontcolor|green|(1 ⊕ x ⊕ y)}}
: {{fontcolor|red|1 ⊕ }}{{fontcolor|green|(1 ⊕ x ⊕ y)}}
: 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ x ⊕ y
: x ⊕ y

AND (logical conjunction) is [[distributive property|distributed algebraically]]&lt;ref name="and-equiv"&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28a+xor+b%29+and+%28c+xor+d%29+in+anf WolframAlpha AND-equivalence demonstration: (a ⊕ b)(c ⊕ d) = ac ⊕ ad ⊕ bc ⊕ bd]&lt;/ref&gt;
: ({{fontcolor|red|1}} ⊕ {{fontcolor|red|x}}){{fontcolor|green|(1 ⊕ x ⊕ y)}}
: {{fontcolor|red|1}}{{fontcolor|green|(1 ⊕ x ⊕ y)}} ⊕ {{fontcolor|red|x}}{{fontcolor|green|(1 ⊕ x ⊕ y)}}
: (1 ⊕ x ⊕ y) ⊕ (x ⊕ x ⊕ xy)
: 1 ⊕ x ⊕ x ⊕ x ⊕ y ⊕ xy
: 1 ⊕ x ⊕ y ⊕ xy

OR (logical disjunction) uses either 1 ⊕ (1 ⊕ a)(1 ⊕ b)&lt;ref name="or-demorgans"&gt;From [[De Morgan's laws]]&lt;/ref&gt; (easier when both operands have purely true terms) or a ⊕ b ⊕ ab&lt;ref name="or-equiv"&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=simplify+a+xor+b+xor+%28a+and+b%29 WolframAlpha OR-equivalence demonstration: a + b = a ⊕ b ⊕ ab]&lt;/ref&gt; (easier otherwise):
: ({{fontcolor|red|1 ⊕ x}}) + ({{fontcolor|green|1 ⊕ x ⊕ y}})
: 1 ⊕ (1 ⊕ {{fontcolor|red|1 ⊕ x}})(1 ⊕ {{fontcolor|green|1 ⊕ x ⊕ y}})
: 1 ⊕ x(x ⊕ y)
: 1 ⊕ x ⊕ xy

== Converting to algebraic normal form ==
Each variable in a formula is already in pure ANF, so you only need to perform the formula's boolean operations as shown above to get the entire formula into ANF. For example:
: x + (y &amp;middot; ¬z)
: x + (y(1 ⊕ z))
: x + (y ⊕ yz)
: x ⊕ (y ⊕ yz) ⊕ x(y ⊕ yz)
: x ⊕ y ⊕ xy ⊕ yz ⊕ xyz

== Formal representation ==
ANF is sometimes described in an equivalent way:
:{| cellpadding="4"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a_0 \oplus \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;a_1x_1 \oplus a_2x_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus a_nx_n \oplus \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;a_{1,2}x_1x_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus a_{n-1,n}x_{n-1}x_n \oplus \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\cdots \oplus \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;a_{1,2,\ldots,n}x_1x_2\ldots x_n \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:where &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{1,2,\ldots,n} \in \{0,1\}^*&lt;/math&gt; fully describes &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Recursively deriving multiargument Boolean functions ===
There are only four functions with one argument:
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1 \oplus x&lt;/math&gt;

To represent a function with multiple arguments one can use the following equality:
: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = g(x_2,\ldots,x_n) \oplus x_1 h(x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where
:* &lt;math&gt;g(x_2,\ldots,x_n) = f(0,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;h(x_2,\ldots,x_n) = f(0,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \oplus f(1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed,
* if &lt;math&gt;x_1=0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x_1 h = 0&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f(0,\ldots) = f(0,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;
* if &lt;math&gt;x_1=1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x_1 h = h&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f(1,\ldots) = f(0,\ldots) \oplus f(0,\ldots) \oplus f(1,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;

Since both &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; have fewer arguments than &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it follows that using this process recursively we will finish with functions with one variable. For example, let us construct ANF of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)= x \lor y&lt;/math&gt; (logical or):
* &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = f(0,y) \oplus x(f(0,y) \oplus f(1,y))&lt;/math&gt;
* since &lt;math&gt;f(0,y)=0 \lor y = y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(1,y)=1 \lor y = 1&lt;/math&gt;
* it follows that &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = y \oplus x (y \oplus 1)&lt;/math&gt;
* by distribution, we get the final ANF: &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = y \oplus x y \oplus x = x \oplus y \oplus x y&lt;/math&gt;

In [[signal processing]], specifically [[control theory]], '''bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stability''' is a form of [[Control theory#Stability|stability]] for [[linear system|linear]] [[Signal (information theory)|signal]]s and systems that take inputs. If a system is BIBO stable, then the output will be [[Bounded function|bounded]] for every input to the system that is bounded.

A signal is bounded if there is a finite value &lt;math&gt;B &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the signal magnitude never exceeds &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, that is
:&lt;math&gt;\ |y[n]| \leq B \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for discrete-time signals, or
:&lt;math&gt;\ |y(t)| \leq B \quad \forall t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; for continuous-time signals.

== Time-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems==
===Continuous-time necessary and sufficient condition:===
For a [[continuous function|continuous time]] [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant (LTI)]] system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the [[impulse response]] be [[P-integrable function|absolutely integrable]], i.e., its [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm]] exists.

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|h(t)\right|\,\mathord{\operatorname{d}}t = \| h \|_1 &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

===Discrete-time necessary and sufficient condition:===
For a [[discrete time]] LTI system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the [[impulse response]] be [[P-integrable function|absolutely summable]], i.e., its &lt;math&gt;\ell^1&lt;/math&gt; [[Lp space|norm]] exists.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty |h[n]| = \| h \|_1 &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof of sufficiency:====
Given a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] time LTI system with [[impulse response]] &lt;math&gt;\ h[n]&lt;/math&gt; the relationship between the input &lt;math&gt;\ x[n]&lt;/math&gt; and the output &lt;math&gt;\ y[n]&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = h[n] * x[n]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[convolution]]. Then it follows by the definition of convolution

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty h[k] x[n-k]&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\| x \|_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\ |x[n]|&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the [[Supremum norm|&lt;math&gt;L_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;-norm]].

:&lt;math&gt;\left|y[n]\right| = \left|\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty h[n-k] x[k]\right|&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\le \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left|h[n-k]\right| \left|x[k]\right|&lt;/math&gt; (by the [[triangle inequality]])

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \le \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left|h[n-k]\right| \| x \|_\infty \\
&amp; = \| x \|_{\infty} \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left|h[n-k]\right| \\
&amp; = \| x \|_{\infty} \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left|h[k]\right|
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely summable, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{\left|h[k]\right|} = \| h \|_1  &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\| x \|_\infty \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left|h[k]\right| = \| x \|_\infty \| h \|_1&lt;/math&gt;

So if &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely summable and &lt;math&gt;\left|x[n]\right|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, then &lt;math&gt;\left|y[n]\right|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded as well because &lt;math&gt;\| x \|_{\infty} \| h \|_1 &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof for continuous-time follows the same arguments.

== Frequency-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems==
=== Continuous-time signals ===

For a [[rational function|rational]] and [[continuous function|continuous-time system]], the condition for stability is that the [[region of convergence]] (ROC) of the [[Laplace transform]] includes the [[complex plane|imaginary axis]]. When the system is [[Causal system|causal]], the ROC is the [[open region]] to the right of a vertical line whose [[abscissa]] is the [[real part]] of the "largest pole", or the [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] that has the greatest real part of any pole in the system. The real part of the largest pole defining the ROC is called the [[abscissa of convergence]]. Therefore, all poles of the system must be in the strict left half of the [[s-plane]] for BIBO stability.

This stability condition can be derived from the above time-domain condition as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|h(t)\right| \, dt
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|h(t)\right| \left| e^{-j \omega t }\right| \, dt \\
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|h(t) (1 \cdot e)^{-j \omega t} \right| \, dt \\
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|h(t) (e^{\sigma + j \omega})^{- t} \right| \, dt \\
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left|h(t) e^{-s t} \right| \, dt
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + j \omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(s) = \sigma = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[region of convergence]] must therefore include the [[complex plane|imaginary axis]].

=== Discrete-time signals ===

For a [[rational function|rational]] and [[discrete signal|discrete time system]], the condition for stability is that the [[Laplace transform#Region of convergence|region of convergence]] (ROC) of the [[z-transform]] includes the [[unit circle]]. When the system is [[Causal system|causal]], the ROC is the [[open region]] outside a circle whose radius is the magnitude of the [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] with largest magnitude. Therefore, all poles of the system must be inside the [[unit circle]] in the [[Z-transform|z-plane]] for BIBO stability.

This stability condition can be derived in a similar fashion to the continuous-time derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty \left|h[n]\right|
&amp; = \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty \left|h[n]\right| \left| e^{-j \omega n} \right| \\
&amp; = \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty \left|h[n] (1 \cdot e)^{-j \omega n} \right| \\
&amp; =\sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty \left|h[n] (r e^{j \omega})^{-n} \right| \\
&amp; = \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty \left|h[n] z^{- n} \right|
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z = r e^{j \omega}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r = |z| = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Laplace transform#Region of convergence|region of convergence]] must therefore include the [[unit circle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3362">In [[mathematics]], '''Borel's lemma''', named after [[Émile Borel]], is an important result used in the theory of [[asymptotic expansion]]s and [[partial differential equation]]s.

==Statement==
Suppose ''U'' is an [[open set]] in the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and suppose that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... is a [[sequence]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] on ''U''.

If ''I'' is an any open interval in '''R''' containing 0 (possibly ''I'' = '''R'''), then there exists a smooth function ''F''(''t'', ''x'') defined on ''I''×''U'', such that
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\left(\frac{\partial^k}{\partial t^k}F\right)(0,x) = f_k(x),}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' ≥ 0 and ''x'' in ''U''.

==Proof==
Proofs of Borel's lemma can be found in many text books on analysis, including {{harvtxt|Golubitsky|Guillemin|1974}} and {{harvtxt|Hörmander|1990}}, from which the proof below is taken.

Note that it suffices to prove the result for a small interval ''I'' = (−ε,ε), since if ψ(''t'') is a smooth [[bump function]] with compact support in (−ε,ε) equal identically to 1 near 0, then ψ(''t'') ⋅ ''F''(''t'', ''x'') gives a solution on '''R''' × ''U''. Similarly using a smooth [[partition of unity]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; subordinate to a covering by open balls with centres at δ⋅'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, it can be assumed that all the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; have compact support in some fixed closed ball ''C''. For each ''m'', let

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F_m(t,x)={t^m\over m!} \cdot \psi\left({t\over \varepsilon_m}\right)\cdot f_m(x),}&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen sufficiently small that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\partial^\alpha F_m \|_\infty \le 2^{-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

for |α| &lt; ''m''. These estimates imply that each sum

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sum_{m\ge 0}  \partial^\alpha F_m}&lt;/math&gt;

is uniformly convergent and hence that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F=\sum_{m\ge 0} F_m}&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth function with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\partial^\alpha F=\sum_{m\ge 0} \partial^\alpha F_m.}&lt;/math&gt;

By construction

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\partial_t^m F(t,x)|_{t=0}=f_m(x).}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' Exactly the same construction can be applied, without the auxiliary space ''U'', to produce a smooth function on the interval ''I'' for which the derivatives at 0 form an arbitrary sequence.

In [[mathematics]], a function of '''bounded deformation''' is a function whose [[distributional derivative]]s are not quite [[well-behaved]]-enough to qualify as functions of [[bounded variation]], although the symmetric part of the derivative matrix does meet that condition. Thought of as deformations of [[elasticity (physics)|elasto]]-[[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] bodies, functions of bounded deformation play a major role in the mathematical study of [[materials science|materials]], e.g. the Francfort-Marigo model of [[fracture|brittle crack evolution]].

More precisely, given an [[open set|open subset]] &amp;Omega; of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, a function ''u''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is said to be of '''bounded deformation''' if the [[symmetrized gradient]] ''&amp;epsilon;''(''u'') of ''u'',

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(u) = \frac{\nabla u + \nabla u^{\top}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[bounded function|bounded]], [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix-valued [[Radon measure]]. The collection of all functions of bounded deformation is denoted BD(&amp;Omega;;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), or simply BD, introduced essentially by P.-M. Suquet in 1978. BD is a strictly larger space than the space BV of functions of [[bounded variation]].

One can show that if ''u'' is of bounded deformation then the measure ''&amp;epsilon;''(''u'') can be decomposed into three parts: one [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]], denoted ''e''(''u'')&amp;nbsp;d''x''; a jump part, [[support (measure theory)|supported]] on a rectifiable (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional set ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; of points where ''u'' has two different approximate limits ''u''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;, together with a [[normal vector]] ''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;; and a "[[Cantor set|Cantor part]]", which vanishes on Borel sets of finite ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;-measure (where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes ''k''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]]).

A function ''u'' is said to be of '''special bounded deformation''' if the Cantor part of ''&amp;epsilon;''(''u'') vanishes, so that the measure can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(u) = e(u) \, \mathrm{d} x + \big( u_{+}(x) - u_{-}(x) \big) \odot \nu_{u} (x) H^{n - 1} | J_{u},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''J''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; on the jump set ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the symmetrized [[dyadic product]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a \odot b = \frac{a \otimes b + b \otimes a}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The collection of all functions of special bounded deformation is denoted SBD(&amp;Omega;;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), or simply SBD.

Given an [[integrable function]] {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C'''}}, where {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes [[Euclidean space]] and {{math|'''C'''}} denotes the [[complex numbers]], the [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] gives a precise way of [[partition of a set|partitioning]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}} into two [[set (mathematics)|set]]s: one where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is essentially small; the other a [[countable set|countable]] collection of cubes where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is essentially large, but where some control of the function is retained.

This leads to the associated '''Calderón–Zygmund decomposition''' of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}, wherein {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is written as the sum of "good" and "bad" functions, using the above sets.

==Covering lemma==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C'''}} be integrable and {{mvar|α}} be a positive constant. Then there exists an open set {{math|Ω}} such that:

:(1) {{math|Ω}} is a disjoint union of open cubes, {{math|Ω {{=}} ∪&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, such that for each {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}},

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha\le  \frac{1}{m(Q_k)} \int_{Q_k} |f(x)| \, dx \leq 2^d \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

:(2) {{math|{{!}}&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''x''){{!}} ≤ ''α''}} almost everywhere in the complement {{mvar|F}} of {{math|Ω}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Calderón–Zygmund decomposition==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} as above, we may write {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} as the sum of a "good" function {{mvar|g}} and a "bad" function {{mvar|b}}, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; {{=}} ''g'' + ''b''}}. To do this, we define

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) =  \begin{cases}f(x), &amp; x \in F, \\ \frac{1}{m(Q_j)}\int_{Q_j}f(t)\,dt, &amp; x \in Q_j,\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and let {{math|''b'' {{=}} &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; − ''g''}}. Consequently we have that

:&lt;math&gt;b(x) = 0,\ x\in F&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m(Q_j)}\int_{Q_j} b(x)\, dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;
 
for each cube {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The function {{mvar|b}} is thus supported on a collection of cubes where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is allowed to be "large", but has the beneficial property that its average value is zero on each of these cubes. Meanwhile, {{math|{{!}}''g''(''x''){{!}} ≤ ''α''}} for almost every {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|F}}, and on each cube in {{math|Ω}}, {{mvar|g}} is equal to the average value of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} over that cube, which by the covering chosen is not more than {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;''α''}}.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''circular shift''' is the operation of rearranging the entries in a [[tuple]], either by moving the final entry to the first position, while shifting all other entries to the next position, or by performing the inverse operation. A circular shift is a special kind of [[cyclic permutation]], which in turn is a special kind of [[permutation]]. Formally, a circular shift is a [[permutation]] σ of the ''n'' entries in the tuple such that either 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)\equiv (i+1)&lt;/math&gt; [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', for all entries ''i = 1, ..., n''
or
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)\equiv (i-1)&lt;/math&gt; [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', for all entries ''i = 1, ..., n''.

The result of repeatedly applying circular shifts to a given tuple are also called the '''circular shifts''' of the tuple.

For example, repeatedly applying circular shifts to the four-tuple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') successively gives
* (''d'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c''),
* (''c'', ''d'', ''a'', ''b''),
* (''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''a''),
* (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') (the original four-tuple),
and then the sequence repeats; this four-tuple therefore has four distinct circular shifts. However, not all ''n''-tuples have ''n'' distinct circular shifts. For instance, the 4-tuple (''a'', ''b'', ''a'', ''b'') only has 2 distinct circular shifts. In general the number of circular shifts of an ''n''-tuple could be any divisor of ''n'', depending on the entries of the tuple.

In [[computer programming]], a '''circular shift''' (or '''bitwise rotation''') is a [[shift operator]] that shifts all bits of its operand. Unlike an [[arithmetic shift]], a circular shift does not preserve a number's sign bit or distinguish a number's [[exponent]] from its [[significand]] (sometimes referred to as the [[Logarithm|mantissa]]). Unlike a [[logical shift]], the vacant bit positions are not filled in with zeros but are filled in with the bits that are shifted out of the sequence.

== Implementing circular shifts ==
Circular shifts are used often in [[cryptography]] in order to permute bit sequences. Unfortunately, many programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], do not have operators or standard functions for circular shifting, even though virtually all [[processors]] have [[bitwise operation]] instructions for it (e.g. [[Intel x86]] has ROL and ROR).
However, some compilers may provide access to the processor instructions by means of [[intrinsic function]]s. In addition, it is possible to write standard ANSI C code that compiles down to the "rotate" assembly language instruction (on CPUs that have such an instruction). Most C compilers recognize the following idiom, and compile it to a single 32-bit rotate instruction.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-11/msg01112.html GCC: "Optimize common rotate constructs"]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.mail-archive.com/llvm-commits@cs.uiuc.edu/msg17216.html "Cleanups in ROTL/ROTR DAG combiner code"] mentions that this code supports the "rotate" instruction in the CellSPU
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
/*
 * Shift operations in C are only defined for shift values which are
 * not negative and smaller than sizeof(value) * CHAR_BIT.
 * The mask, used with bitwise-and (&amp;), prevents undefined behaviour
 * when the shift count is 0 or &gt;= the width of unsigned int.
 */

#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;  // for uint32_t, to get 32bit-wide rotates, regardless of the size of int.
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;  // for CHAR_BIT

uint32_t rotl32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) {
    const unsigned int mask = CHAR_BIT*sizeof(value) - 1;
    count &amp;= mask;
    return (value &lt;&lt; count) | (value &gt;&gt; (-count &amp; mask));
}

uint32_t rotr32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) {
    const unsigned int mask = CHAR_BIT*sizeof(value) - 1;
    count &amp;= mask;
    return (value &gt;&gt; count) | (value &lt;&lt; (-count &amp; mask));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This safe and compiler-friendly implementation was developed by [[John Regehr]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1063 Safe, Efficient, and Portable Rotate in C/C++]&lt;/ref&gt; and further polished by Peter Cordes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/776523/224132 Stackoverflow: Best practices for rotates in C/C++]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/31488147/224132 Near constant time rotate that does not violate the standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simpler version is often seen when the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is limited to the range of 1 to 31 bits:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
uint32_t rotl32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) {
    return value&lt;&lt;count | value&gt;&gt;(32-count);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This version is dangerous because if the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is 0 or 32, it asks for a 32-bit shift, which is [[undefined behaviour]] in the C language standard.  However, it tends to work anyway, because most microprocessors implement &lt;code&gt;value&gt;&gt;32&lt;/code&gt; as either a 32-bit shift (producing 0) or a 0-bit shift (producing the original &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;), and either one produces the correct result in this application.

For C++, the use of templates can expand the support to all integer types:&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; // https://stackoverflow.com/a/776550/3770260
template &lt;typename INT&gt;
#if __cplusplus &gt; 201100L // Apply constexpr to C++ 11 to ease optimization
constexpr
#endif // See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/7269693/3770260
INT rol(INT val, size_t len) {
#if __cplusplus &gt; 201100L &amp;&amp; _wp_force_unsigned_rotate // Apply unsigned check C++ 11 to make sense
    static_assert(std::is_unsigned&lt;INT&gt;::value,
                  "Rotate Left only makes sense for unsigned types");
#endif
    return (val &lt;&lt; len) | ((unsigned) val &gt;&gt; (-len &amp; (sizeof(INT) * CHAR_BIT - 1)));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example==
If the bit sequence 0001 0111 were subjected to a circular shift of one bit position... (see images below)
{|
|
* to the left would yield: 0010 1110
[[Image:Rotate left.svg|thumb|left|300px|Left circular shift.]]
|
* to the right would yield: 1000 1011.
[[Image:Rotate right.svg|thumb|left|300px|Right circular shift.]]
|}
If the bit sequence 1001 0110 were subjected to the following operations:
* left circular shift by 2 positions: 0101 1010
* left circular shift by 3 positions: 1011 0100
* right circular shift by 5 positions: 1010 0101
* right circular shift by 1 position: 1101 0010
* left circular shift by 3 positions: 1001 0110

== Applications ==

[[Cyclic code]]s are a kind of [[block code]] with the property that the circular shift of a codeword will always yield another codeword. This motivates the following general definition: For a [[string (computer science)|string]] ''s'' over an alphabet ''Σ'', let ''shift(s)'' denote the set of circular shifts of ''s'',
and for a set ''L'' of strings, let ''shift''(''L'') denote the set of all circular shifts of strings in ''L''. If ''L'' is a cyclic code, then ''shift''(''L'') ⊆ ''L''; this is a necessary condition for ''L'' being a [[cyclic language]]. The operation ''shift''(''L'') has been studied in [[formal language theory]]. For instance, if ''L'' is a [[context-free language]], then ''shift''(''L'') is again context-free.&lt;ref&gt;T. Oshiba, "Closure property of the family of context-free languages under the cyclic shift operation", Transactions of IECE, '''55D''':119–122, 1972.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Maslov, "Cyclic shift operation for languages", Problems of Information Transmission '''9''':333–338, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if ''L'' is described by a [[regular expression]] of length ''n'', there is a regular expression of length [[Big O notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) describing ''shift''(''L'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=1176.68105 | last1=Gruber | first1=Hermann | last2=Holzer | first2=Markus | title=Language operations with regular expressions of polynomial size | url=http://www.hermann-gruber.com/data/derivatives-journal.pdf | journal=Theoretical Computer Science | volume=410 | number=35 | pages=3281–3289 | year=2009 | doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2009.04.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clairaut's relation''', named after [[Alexis Claude de Clairaut]], is a formula in classical [[differential geometry]].  The formula relates the distance ''r''(''t'') from a point on a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]] to the ''z''-axis, and the angle ''θ''(''t'') between the tangent vector and the latitudinal circle:

:&lt;math&gt; r(t) \cos \theta(t) = \text{constant}.\, &lt;/math&gt;

The relation remains valid for a [[geodesic]] on an arbitrary [[surface of revolution]].

A formal mathematical statement of Clairaut's relation is:&lt;ref name=Pressley&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew Pressley |title=Elementary Differential Geometry |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXPyquQaO6EC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U214J0zkWQcRXLTohVjdHUD3Fuk2A#PPA183,M1 
|isbn=1-85233-152-6 |publisher=Springer |year=2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Let γ be a [[geodesic]] on a [[surface of revolution]] ''S'', let ρ be the distance of a point of ''S'' from the [[axis of rotation]], and let ψ be the angle between γ and the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] of ''S''. Then ρ sin ψ is constant along γ. Conversely, if  ρ sin ψ  is constant along some curve γ in the surface, and if no part of γ is part of some parallel of ''S'', then γ is a geodesic.|Andrew Pressley: ''Elementary Differential Geometry'', p. 183}}
Pressley (p.&amp;nbsp;185) explains this theorem as an expression of [[conservation of angular momentum]] about the [[axis of revolution]] when a particle slides along a geodesic under no forces other than those that keep it on the surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8671">In [[recursion theory|computability theory]], '''productive sets''' and '''creative sets''' are types of sets of [[natural number]]s that have important applications in [[mathematical logic]].  They are a standard topic in mathematical logic textbooks such as {{harvtxt|Soare|1987}} and {{harvtxt|Rogers|1987}}.

==Definition and example==

For the remainder of this article, assume that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; is an acceptable numbering of the [[computable function]]s and ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the corresponding numbering of the [[recursively enumerable]] sets.

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is called '''productive''' if there exists a [[total function|total]] recursive (computable) function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; so that for all &lt;math&gt;i \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;W_i \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(i) \in A \setminus W_i.&lt;/math&gt; The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''productive function''' for &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt;

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is called '''creative''' if ''A'' is recursively enumerable and its complement &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}\setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is productive. Not every productive set has a recursively enumerable complement, however, as illustrated below.

The archetypal creative set is &lt;math&gt;K = \{ i \mid i \in W_i \}&lt;/math&gt;, the set representing the [[halting problem]]. Its complement &lt;math&gt;\bar{K} = \{ i \mid i \not \in W_i \}&lt;/math&gt; is productive with productive function ''f''(''i'') = ''i'' (the identity function).

To see this, we apply the definition of productivity function and show separately that &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i \not \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;: suppose &lt;math&gt;i \in K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;i \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;, now given that &lt;math&gt;W_i \subseteq \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;, this leads to a contradiction. So &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;i \not \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;: in fact if &lt;math&gt;i \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;, then it would be true that &lt;math&gt;i \in K&lt;/math&gt;, but we have demonstrated the contrary in the previous point. So &lt;math&gt;i \not \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

No productive set ''A'' can be recursively enumerable, because whenever ''A'' contains every number in an r.e. set ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; it contains other numbers, and moreover there is an effective procedure to produce an example of such a number from the index ''i''.  Similarly, no creative set can be [[decidable set|decidable]], because this would imply that its complement, a productive set, is recursively enumerable.

Any productive set has a productive function that is [[injective function|injective]] and [[total function|total]].

The following theorems, due to Myhill (1955), show that in a sense all creative sets are like &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and all productive sets are like &lt;math&gt;\bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soare|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Rogers|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem.''' Let ''P'' be a set of natural numbers. The following are equivalent:
*''P'' is productive.
*&lt;math&gt;\bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Many-one reduction|1-reducible]] to ''P''.
*&lt;math&gt;\bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Many-one reduction|m-reducible]] to ''P''.

'''Theorem.'''  Let ''C'' be a set of natural numbers. The following are equivalent:
*''C'' is creative.
*''C'' is [[Many-one reduction|1-complete]]
*''C'' is [[Computable isomorphism|recursively isomorphic]] to ''K'', that is, there is a total computable [[bijective function|bijection]] ''f'' on the natural numbers such that ''f''(''C'') = ''K''.

== Applications in mathematical logic ==

The set of all provable sentences in an effective [[axiomatic system]] is always a [[recursively enumerable set]]. If the system is suitably complex, like [[first-order arithmetic]], then the set ''T'' of [[Gödel number]]s of '''true''' sentences in the system will be a productive set, which means that whenever ''W'' is a recursively enumerable set of true sentences, there is at least one true sentence that is not in ''W''.  This can be used to give a rigorous proof of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], because no recursively enumerable set is productive.   The complement of the set ''T'' will not be recursively enumerable, and thus ''T'' is an example of a productive set whose complement is not creative.

== History ==
The seminal paper of {{harvtxt|Post|1944}} defined the concept he called a Creative set. Reiterating, the set &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; referenced above and defined  as the domain of the function &lt;math&gt;d(x)=[[x]](x)+1&lt;/math&gt; that takes the diagonal of all enumerated 1-place  computable partial functions and adds 1 to them is an example of a creative set.&lt;ref name ="test"&gt;{{harvtxt|Enderton|2010}}, pp. 79, 80, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Post gave a version of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem using his creative sets, where originally Gödel had in some sense constructed a sentence that could be freely translated as saying "I am unprovable in this axiomatic theory." However, Gödel's proof did not work from the concept of true sentences, and rather used the concept of a consistent theory, which led to the [[Second incompleteness theorem]]. After Post completed his version of incompleteness he then added the following:

"The conclusion  is unescapable that even for such a fixed, well defined body of mathematical propositions, mathematical thinking is, and must remain, essentially creative."&lt;ref name = "test" /&gt;

The usual creative set &lt;math&gt;K &lt;/math&gt; defined using the diagonal function &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt; has its own historical development. Alan Turing in a 1936  article on the [[Turing machine]] showed the existence of a universal computer that computes the &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; function. The function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined such that
&lt;math&gt; \Phi(w,x) =&lt;/math&gt; (''the result of applying the instructions coded by'' &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; ''to the input'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ), and is universal in the sense that any calculable partial function &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt; f(x)= \Phi(e,x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; codes the instructions for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Using the above notation  &lt;math&gt; \Phi(e,x)= [[e]](x) &lt;/math&gt;, and the diagonal function arises quite naturally as &lt;math&gt; d(x) = [[x]](x)+1&lt;/math&gt;. Ultimately, these ideas are connected to [[Church's thesis]] that says the mathematical notion of computable partial functions is the ''correct'' formalization of an effectively calculable partial function, which can neither be proved or disproved. Church used [[Lambda calculus]], Turing an idealized computer, and later Emil Post  in his approach, all of which are equivalent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2208">The '''Cryptographic Message Syntax''' ('''CMS''') is the [[IETF]]'s standard for [[Cryptography|cryptographically]] protected messages. It can be used to [[Digital signature|digitally sign]], [[Cryptographic hash function|digest]], [[Message authentication code|authenticate]] or [[encryption|encrypt]] any form of digital data.

CMS is based on the syntax of [[PKCS]] #7, which in turn is based on the [[Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail|Privacy-Enhanced Mail]] standard. The newest version of CMS ({{As of|2009|lc=on}}){{Update after|2015|7|21}} is specified in {{IETF RFC|5652}} (but see also {{IETF RFC|5911}} for updated ASN.1 modules conforming to ASN.1 2002).

The architecture of CMS is built around [[X.509|certificate-based]] key management, such as the profile defined by the [[PKIX]] [[working group]].

CMS is used as the key cryptographic component of many other cryptographic standards, such as [[S/MIME]], [[PKCS 12|PKCS #12]] and the {{IETF RFC|3161}} [[Digital timestamping]] protocol.

[[OpenSSL]] is [[Open-source software|open source]] software that can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify, compress and uncompress CMS documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24361">[[File:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|286x286px|The [[Platonic solid]]s, seen here in an illustration from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596), are an early example of exceptional objects. The symmetries of three-dimensional space can be classified into two infinite families—the [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] and [[Dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetries of ''n''-sided polygons—and five exceptional types of symmetry, namely the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids.]]
Many branches of mathematics study objects of a given type and prove a [[classification theorem]]. A common theme is that the classification results in a number of series of objects and a finite number of exceptions that do not fit into any series. These are known as '''exceptional objects'''. Frequently these exceptional objects play a further and important role in the subject. Furthermore, the exceptional objects in one branch of mathematics are often related to the exceptional objects in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stillwell|first=John|date=1998|title=Exceptional Objects|jstor=2589218|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=105|issue=9|pages=850–858|doi=10.2307/2589218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1505.06742|first=Yang-Hui|last=He|first2=John|last2=McKay|author-link2=John McKay (mathematician)|title=Sporadic and Exceptional|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue33/features/baez/index|title=Ubiquitous octonions|last=Joyce|first=Helen|date=1 January 2005|website=Plus Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related phenomenon is [[exceptional isomorphism]], when two series are in general different, but agree for some small values.

== Regular polytopes ==
{{Main|Regular polytope}}
The prototypical examples of exceptional objects arise in the classification of [[regular polytope]]s. In two dimensions there is a series of [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gons]] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3. In every dimension above 2 we find analogues of the cube, tetrahedron and octahedron. In three dimensions we find two more regular polyhedra — the [[dodecahedron]] (12-hedron) and the [[icosahedron]] (20-hedron) — making five [[Platonic solids]]. In four dimensions we have a total of six [[Convex regular 4-polytope|regular polytopes]] including the [[120-cell]], the [[600-cell]] and the [[24-cell]]. There are no other regular polytopes; in higher dimensions the only regular polytopes are of the [[hypercube]], [[simplex]], [[orthoplex]] series.  In all dimensions combined, there are therefore three series and five exceptional polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/platonic.html|title=Platonic Solids in All Dimensions|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=12 November 2006|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern is similar if non-convex polytopes are included.  In two dimensions there is a [[regular star polygon]] for every [[rational number]] ''p''/''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.  In three dimensions there are four [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]], and in four dimensions ten [[Schläfli–Hess polychoron|Schläfli–Hess polychora]]; in higher dimensions there are no non-convex regular figures.

These can be generalized to [[tessellation]]s of other spaces, especially [[Uniform tiling|uniform tessellations]], notably tilings of Euclidean space ([[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]), which have exceptional objects, and tilings of hyperbolic space. There are various exceptional objects in dimension below 6, but in dimension 6 and above the only regular polyhedra/tilings/hyperbolic tilings are the simplex, hypercube, cross-polytope, and hypercube lattice.

=== Schwarz triangles ===

Related to tilings and the regular polyhedra, there are exceptional [[Schwarz triangle]]s (triangles that tile the sphere, or more generally Euclidean plane or hyperbolic plane via their [[triangle group]] of reflections in their edges), particularly the [[Möbius triangle]]s. In the sphere there are 3 Möbius triangles (and 1 1-parameter family), corresponding to the 3 exceptional Platonic solid groups, while in the Euclidean plane there are 3 Möbius triangles, corresponding to the 3 special triangles: 60-60-60 ([[equilateral triangle|equilateral]]), [[45-45-90]] (isosceles right), and [[30-60-90]]. There are additional exceptional Schwarz triangles in the sphere and Euclidean plane. By contrast, in the hyperbolic plane there is a 3-parameter family of Möbius triangles, and none exceptional.

== Finite simple groups ==
{{Main|Sporadic group}}
[[File:SporadicGroups.svg|thumb|The relations between the sporadic groups, most being related to the monster.]]

The finite simple groups have been [[Classification of finite simple groups|classified]] into a number of series as well as 26 [[sporadic groups]]. Of these, 20 are subgroups or subquotients of the [[monster group]], referred to as the "Happy Family", while 6 are not, and are referred to as "[[Pariah group|pariahs]]".

Several of the sporadic groups are related to the [[Leech lattice]], most notably the Conway group Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, quotiented out by its center.

== Division algebras ==

There are only three finite-dimensional associative [[division algebras]] over the reals — the [[real numbers]], the [[complex numbers]] and the [[quaternions]]. The only non-associative division algebra is the algebra of [[octonions]]. The octonions are connected to a wide variety of exceptional objects. For example, the exceptional formally real [[Jordan algebra]] is the [[Albert algebra]] of 3 by 3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions.

== Simple Lie groups ==

The [[simple Lie group]]s form a number of series ([[classical Lie group]]s) labelled A, B, C and D. In addition there are the exceptional groups [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (the automorphism group of the octonions), [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. These last four groups can be viewed as the symmetry groups of projective planes over '''O''', '''C'''⊗'''O''', '''H'''⊗'''O''' and '''O'''⊗'''O''' respectively, where '''O''' is the octonions and the tensor products are over the reals.

The classification of Lie groups corresponds to the classification of [[root systems]] and thus the exceptional Lie groups correspond to exceptional root systems and exceptional [[Dynkin diagram]]s.

== Supersymmetric algebras ==
There are a few exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. The classification of [[superalgebra]]s by [[Victor Kac|Kac]] and Tierry-Mieg indicates that the [[Lie superalgebra]]s '''G(3)''' in 31 dimensions and '''F(4)''' in 40 dimensions, and the Jordan superalgebras '''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''K&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''', are examples of exceptional objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V. G.|date=1977-01-01|title=Classification of simple z-graded lie superalgebras and simple jordan superalgebras|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00927877708822224|journal=Communications in Algebra|volume=5|issue=13|pages=1375–1400|doi=10.1080/00927877708822224|issn=0092-7872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0016126|title=Group Theoretical Methods in Physics|last=Thierry-Mieg|first=Jean|date=1984|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=94–98|language=en|doi=10.1007/bfb0016126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unimodular lattices ==

Up to isometry there is only one even [[unimodular lattice]] in 15 dimensions or less &amp;mdash; the [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]]. Up to dimension [[24 (number)|24]] there is only one even unimodular lattice without [[root system|roots]], the [[Leech lattice]]. Three of the sporadic simple groups were discovered by Conway while investigating the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. For example, [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group itself modulo ±1. The groups [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], as well as a number of other sporadic groups, arise as stabilisers of various subsets of the Leech lattice.

== Codes ==

Some [[Error-correcting code|codes]] also stand out as exceptional objects, in particular the perfect binary Golay code which is closely related to the Leech lattice. The [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;, one of the sporadic simple groups, is the group of automorphisms of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]], and four more of the sporadic simple groups arise as various types of stabilizer subgroup of &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Block designs ==

An exceptional [[block design]] is the [[Steiner system]] S(5,8,24) whose automorphism group is the sporadic simple [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

The codewords of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]] have a length of 24 bits and have weights 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. This code can correct up to three errors. So every 24-bit word with weight 5 can be corrected to a codeword with weight 8. The bits of a 24-bit word can be thought of as specifying the possible subsets of a 24 element set. So the extended binary Golay code gives a unique 8 element subset for each 5 element subset. In fact, it defines S(5,8,24).

== Outer automorphisms ==
Certain families of groups generically have a certain [[outer automorphism group]], but in particular cases they have other, exceptional outer automorphisms.

Among families of finite simple groups, the only example is in the [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]]: for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3, n \neq 6&lt;/math&gt; the [[alternating group]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; has one outer automorphism (corresponding to conjugation by an odd element of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has no outer automorphisms. However, for &lt;math&gt;n=6,&lt;/math&gt; there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;S_6&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2), and correspondingly, the outer automorphism group of &lt;math&gt;A_6&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; (the group of order 2) but rather &lt;math&gt;C_2 \times C_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Klein four-group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/08/a_wrinkle_in_the_mathematical.html|title=A Wrinkle in the Mathematical Universe|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=17 August 2015|website=[[nLab|The n-Category Café]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/alt/A6/|title=ATLAS: Alternating group A6, Linear group L2(9), Symplectic group S4(2)', Mathieu group M10'|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Atlas of Finite Groups|Atlas of Finite Group Representations]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYMAg_Sj7hUC|title=The Finite Simple Groups|last=Wilson|first=Robert|date=2009-12-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781848009875|location=|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one instead considers A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as the (isomorphic) [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,9), then the outer automorphism is not exceptional; thus the exceptionalness can be seen as due to the [[exceptional isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;A_6 \cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,9).&lt;/math&gt; This exceptional outer automorphism is realized inside of the Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and similarly, M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; acts on a set of 12 elements in 2 different ways.

Among [[Lie groups]], the [[spin group]] Spin(8) has an exceptionally large outer automorphism group (namely &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;), which corresponds to the exceptional symmetries of the [[Dynkin diagram]] D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[triality]].''

The exceptional symmetry of the D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; diagram also gives rise to the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg groups]].

{{Main|Kervaire invariant}}
The [[Kervaire invariant]] is an invariant of a (4''k''+2)-dimensional manifold that measures whether the manifold could be [[Surgery theory|surgically]] converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. More specifically, the Kervaire invariant applies to a [[framed manifold]], that is, to a manifold equipped with an [[embedding]] into [[Euclidean space]] and a trivialization of the [[normal bundle]]. The Kervaire invariant problem is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For differentiable manifolds, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-and-physical-science/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/|title=Mathematicians Solve 45-Year-Old Kervaire Invariant Puzzle|last=Klarreich|first=Erica|date=20 July 2009|website=[[Simons Foundation]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1104.4523|first=Haynes|last=Miller|title=Kervaire Invariant One [after M.

The first three cases are related to the complex numbers, quaternions and octonions respectively: a manifold of Kervaire invariant 1 can be constructed as the product of two spheres, with its exotic framing determined by the normed division algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranicki|first=Andrew|date=2011|title=Commentary on "On the parallelizability of the spheres" by R.

Due to similarities of dimensions, it is conjectured that the remaining cases (dimensions 30, 62 and 126) are related to the [[Rosenfeld projective plane]]s, which are defined over algebras constructed from the octonions. Specifically, it has been conjectured that there is a construction that takes these projective planes and produces a manifold with nonzero Kervaire invariant in two dimensions lower, but this remains unconfirmed.

== Symmetric quantum measurements ==

In [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]], there exist structures known as [[SIC-POVM]]s or SICs, which correspond to maximal sets of complex [[equiangular lines]]. Some of the known SICs&amp;mdash;those in vector spaces of 2 and 3 dimensions, as well as certain solutions in 8 dimensions&amp;mdash;are considered exceptional objects and called "sporadic SICs". They differ from the other known SICs in ways that involve their symmetry groups, the [[Galois theory]] of the numerical values of their vector components, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appleby|first=Marcus|last2=Flammia|first2=Steven|last3=McConnell|first3=Gary|last4=Yard|first4=Jon|date=2017-08-01|title=SICs and Algebraic Number Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1042–1059|arxiv=1701.05200|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1042A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporadic SICs in dimension 8 are related to the integral octonions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Blake C.|date=2017-08-01|title=Sporadic SICs and the Normed Division Algebras|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1060–1064|arxiv=1605.01426|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1060S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections ==
Numerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects. Most common are objects related to [[8 (number)|8]] and [[24 (number)|24]] dimensions, noting that 24&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3.  By contrast, the [[pariah group]]s stand apart, as the name suggests.

=== 8 and 24 dimensions ===
Exceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.
* The octonions are 8-dimensional.
* The [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]] can be realized as the integral octonions (up to a scale factor).
* The exceptional Lie groups can be seen as symmetries of the octonions and structures derived from the octonions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week106.html|title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics: Week106|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=23 July 1997|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; further, the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; algebra is related to the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice, as the notation implies (the lattice is generated by the root system of the algebra).
* Triality occurs for Spin(8), which also connects to 8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3 &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;24.
Likewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include the following.
* The Leech lattice is 24-dimensional.
* Most sporadic simple groups can be related to the Leech lattice, or more broadly the Monster.
* The exceptional [[Jordan algebra]] has a representation in terms of 24&amp;times;24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.

These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves "exceptional". For example, in [[algebraic topology]], 8-fold real [[Bott periodicity]] can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [[modular forms]], the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [[Dedekind eta function]] and the [[modular discriminant]], which connection is deepened by [[Monstrous moonshine]], a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcherds|first=Richard E.|author-link=Richard Borcherds|date=1998|title=What is Moonshine?|url=http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/DMJDMV/xvol-icm/Fields/Borcherds.MAN.html|journal=Documenta Mathematica|volume=ICM 1|pages=607&amp;ndash;615|arxiv=math/9809110|via=|bibcode=1998math......9110B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In [[string theory]] and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena. For example, [[bosonic string theory]] requires a spacetime of dimension 26 which is directly related to the presence of 24 in the [[Dedekind eta function]]. Similarly, the possible dimensions of [[supergravity]] are related to the dimensions of the [[division algebras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baez|first=John C.|last2=Huerta|first2=John|date=October 2011|title=Division algebras and supersymmetry II|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.atmp/1349879112|journal=Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|language=EN|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1373–1410|arxiv=1003.3436|issn=1095-0761|via=|doi=10.4310/atmp.2011.v15.n5.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monstrous moonshine ===

Many of the exceptional objects in mathematics and physics have been found to be connected to each other. Developments such as the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures show how, for example, the [[Monster group]] is connected to [[string theory]]. The theory of [[modular forms]] shows how the algebra E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is connected to the Monster group. (In fact, well before the proof of the Monstrous moonshine conjecture, the [[J-invariant|elliptic ''j''-function]] was discovered to encode the representations of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V.G|title=An elucidation of "Infinite-Dimensional Algebras … and the very strange formula."

Below is a [[mind map]] showing how some of the exceptional objects in mathematics and mathematical physics are related.

[[File:Exceptionalmindmap2.png|600px]]

The connections can partly be explained by thinking of the algebras as a tower of lattice [[vertex operator algebra]]s. It just so happens that the vertex algebras at the bottom are so simple that they are isomorphic to familiar non-vertex algebras. Thus the connections can be seen simply as the consequence of some lattices being sub-lattices of others.

=== Supersymmetries ===
The [[Jordan superalgebra]]s are a parallel set of exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. These are the [[Lie superalgebra]]s which are related to Lorentzian lattices. This subject is less explored, and the connections between the objects are less well established. There are new conjectures parallel to the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures for these super-objects, involving different sporadic groups.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Unexceptional objects ==

=== Pathologies ===
{{See also|Pathological (mathematics)}}
"Exceptional" object is reserved for objects that are unusual, meaning rare, the exception, not for ''unexpected'' or ''non-standard'' objects. These unexpected-but-typical (or common) phenomena are generally referred to as [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], such as [[nowhere differentiable function]]s, or "exotic", as in [[exotic sphere]]s — there are exotic spheres in arbitrarily high dimension (not only a finite set of exceptions), and in many dimensions most (differential structures on) spheres are exotic.

=== Extremal objects ===
Exceptional objects must be distinguished from ''extremal'' objects: those that fall in a family and are the most extreme example by some measure are of interest, but not unusual in the way exceptional objects are. For example, the [[golden ratio]] ''φ'' has the simplest [[continued fraction]] approximation, and accordingly is most difficult to [[Diophantine approximation|approximate by rationals]]; however, it is but one of infinitely many such quadratic numbers (continued fractions).

Similarly, the (2,3,7) [[Schwarz triangle]] is the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, and the associated [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] is of particular interest, being the universal [[Hurwitz group]], and thus being associated with the [[Hurwitz curve]]s, the maximally symmetric algebraic curves. However, it falls in a family of such triangles ((2,4,7), (2,3,8), (3,3,7), etc.), and while the smallest, is not exceptional or unlike the others.

In [[mathematics]] or [[logic]], a '''finitary operation ''' is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] of [[finite cardinality|finite]] [[arity]], that is an operation that takes a finite number of input values. By contrast, an operation that may take an [[infinite set|infinite number]] of input values is said to be '''infinitary'''. In standard mathematics, an operation is, by definition, finitary. Therefore these terms are used only in the context of [[infinitary logic]].

==Finitary argument==
A '''finitary argument''' is one which can be translated into a [[finite set]] of symbolic propositions starting from a finite&lt;ref&gt;The number of axioms ''referenced'' in the argument will necessarily be finite since the proof is finite, but the number of axioms from which these are ''chosen'' is infinite when the system has [[axiom scheme]]s, as for example the axiom schemes of [[propositional calculus]].&lt;/ref&gt; set of [[axiom]]s. In other words, it is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] (including all assumptions) that can be written on a large enough sheet of paper.

By contrast, '''[[infinitary logic]]''' studies logics that allow infinitely long [[statement (logic)|statements]] and [[Mathematical proof|proofs]]. In such a logic, one can regard the [[existential quantifier]], for instance, as derived from an infinitary [[disjunction]].

==History==
The emphasis on finitary methods has historical roots.

In the early 20th century, [[logic]]ians aimed to solve the [[foundations of mathematics|problem of foundations]]; that is, answer the question: "What is the true base of mathematics?" The program was to be able to rewrite all mathematics using an entirely syntactical language ''without semantics''. In the words of [[David Hilbert]] (referring to [[geometry]]), "it does not matter if we call the things ''chairs'', ''tables'' and ''beer mugs'' or ''points'', ''lines'' and ''planes''."

The stress on finiteness came from the idea that human ''mathematical'' thought is based on a finite number of principles {{proveit|date=April 2013}} and all the reasonings follow essentially one rule: the ''[[modus ponens]]''. The project was to fix a finite number of symbols (essentially the [[Numerical digit|numerals]] 1, 2, 3, ... the letters of alphabet and some special symbols like "+", "-&gt;", "(", ")", etc.), give a finite number of propositions expressed in those symbols, which were to be taken as "foundations" (the axioms), and some [[rule of inference|rules of inference]] which would model the way humans make conclusions. From these, ''regardless of the semantic interpretation of the symbols'' the remaining theorems should follow ''formally'' using only the stated rules (which make mathematics look like a ''game with symbols'' more than a ''science'') without the need to rely on ingenuity. The hope was to prove that from these axioms and rules ''all'' the theorems of mathematics could be deduced. That aim is known as [[logicism]].

[[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]] is sometimes alleged to undermine logicism because it shows that no particular [[axiomatization]] of mathematics can decide all statements, although such theorem itself is based in logic.

A frontal solver builds a [[LU decomposition|LU]] or [[Cholesky decomposition]] of a sparse matrix given as the assembly of element matrices by assembling the matrix and eliminating equations only on a subset of elements at a time.

The whole sparse matrix is never created explicitly. Only parts of the matrix are assembled as they enter the front. Processing the front involves [[dense matrix]] operations, which use the CPU efficiently. In a typical implementation, only the front is in [[computer memory|memory]], while the factors in the decomposition are written into [[computer file|files]].

The fronts can be worked on by different [[CPU|processors]], which enables [[parallel computing]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''general linear group''' of degree ''n'' is the set of {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]], together with the operation of ordinary [[matrix multiplication]]. This forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], because the product of two invertible matrices is again invertible, and the inverse of an invertible matrix is invertible. The group is so named because the columns of an invertible matrix are [[linearly independent]], hence the vectors/points they define are in [[general linear position]], and matrices in the general linear group take points in general linear position to points in general linear position.

To be more precise, it is necessary to specify what kind of objects may appear in the entries of the matrix. For example, the general linear group over '''R''' (the set of [[real numbers]]) is the group of {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} invertible matrices of real numbers, and is denoted by GL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') or {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}}.

More generally, the general linear group of degree ''n'' over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' (such as the [[complex number]]s), or a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' (such as the ring of [[integer]]s), is the set of {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} invertible matrices with entries from ''F'' (or ''R''), again with matrix multiplication as the group operation.&lt;ref name="ring"&gt;Here rings are assumed to be [[Ring (mathematics)#Notes on the definition|associative and unital]].&lt;/ref&gt; Typical notation is GL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') or {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}}, or simply GL(''n'') if the field is understood.

More generally still, the [[#General linear group of a vector space|general linear group of a vector space]] GL(''V'') is the abstract [[automorphism group]], not necessarily written as matrices.

The '''[[#Special linear group|special linear group]]''', written {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} or SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''), is the [[subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} consisting of matrices with a [[determinant]] of 1.

The group {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} and its [[subgroup]]s are often called '''linear groups''' or '''matrix groups''' (the abstract group GL(''V'') is a linear group but not a matrix group). These groups are important in the theory of [[group representation]]s, and also arise in the study of spatial [[symmetry|symmetries]] and symmetries of [[vector space]]s in general, as well as the study of [[polynomials]]. The [[modular group]] may be realised as a quotient of the special linear group {{nowrap|SL(2, '''Z''')}}.

If {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, then the group {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} is not [[abelian group|abelian]].

== General linear group of a vector space ==

If ''V'' is a [[vector space]] over the field ''F'', the general linear group of ''V'', written GL(''V'') or Aut(''V''), is the group of all [[automorphism]]s of ''V'', i.e. the set of all [[bijective]] [[linear transformation]]s {{nowrap|''V'' → ''V''}}, together with functional composition as group operation. If ''V'' has finite [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] ''n'', then GL(''V'') and {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]]. The isomorphism is not canonical; it depends on a choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in ''V''. Given a basis {{nowrap|(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of ''V'' and an automorphism ''T'' in GL(''V''), we have then for every basis vector ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; that
: &lt;math&gt;Te_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} e_j&lt;/math&gt;
for some constants ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''F''; the matrix corresponding to ''T'' is then just the matrix with entries given by the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In a similar way, for a commutative ring ''R'' the group {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''R'')}} may be interpreted as the group of automorphisms of a ''[[free module|free]]'' ''R''-module ''M'' of rank ''n''. One can also define GL(''M'') for any ''R''-module, but in general this is not isomorphic to {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''R'')}} (for any ''n'').

== In terms of determinants ==

Over a field ''F'', a matrix is [[invertible]] if and only if its [[determinant]] is nonzero. Therefore, an alternative definition of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} is as the group of matrices with nonzero determinant.

Over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', more care is needed: a matrix over ''R'' is invertible if and only if its determinant is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in ''R'', that is, if its determinant is invertible in ''R''. Therefore, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''R'')}} may be defined as the group of matrices whose determinants are units.

Over a non-commutative ring ''R'', determinants are not at all well behaved. In this case, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''R'')}} may be defined as the [[unit group]] of the [[matrix ring]] {{nowrap|M(''n'', ''R'')}}.

== As a Lie group ==

=== Real case ===

The general linear group {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} over the field of [[real number]]s is a real [[Lie group]] of dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. To see this, note that the set of all {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} real matrices, M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), forms a [[real vector space]] of dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The subset {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} consists of those matrices whose [[determinant]] is non-zero. The determinant is a [[polynomial]] map, and hence {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} is an [[algebraic variety|open affine subvariety]] of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') (a [[non-empty]] [[open subset]] of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') in the [[Zariski topology]]), and therefore&lt;ref&gt;
Since the Zariski topology is [[coarsest topology|coarser]] than the metric topology; equivalently, polynomial maps are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].&lt;/ref&gt;
a [[smooth manifold]] of the same dimension.

The [[Lie algebra]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}}, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} real matrices with the [[commutator]] serving as the Lie bracket.

As a manifold, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} is not [[connected space|connected]] but rather has two [[connected space|connected components]]: the matrices with positive determinant and the ones with negative determinant. The [[identity component]], denoted by {{nowrap|GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', '''R''')}}, consists of the real {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} matrices with positive determinant. This is also a Lie group of dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; it has the same Lie algebra as {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}}.

The group {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} is also [[compact space|noncompact]]. "The"&lt;ref&gt;A maximal compact subgroup is not unique, but is [[essentially unique]], hence one often refers to "the" maximal compact subgroup.&lt;/ref&gt; [[maximal compact subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} is the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n''), while "the" maximal compact subgroup of {{nowrap|GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', '''R''')}} is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n''). As for SO(''n''), the group {{nowrap|GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', '''R''')}} is not [[simply connected]] (except when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1)}}, but rather has a [[fundamental group]] isomorphic to '''Z''' for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 2}}.

=== Complex case ===

The general linear group over the field of [[complex number]]s, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}}, is a ''complex'' [[Lie group]] of complex dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As a real Lie group (through realification) it has dimension 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The set of all real matrices forms a real Lie subgroup. These correspond to the inclusions
:GL(''n'', '''R''') &lt; GL(''n'', '''C''') &lt;  GL(''2n'', '''R'''),
which have real dimensions ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and {{nowrap|1=4''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (2''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Complex ''n''-dimensional matrices can be characterized as real 2''n''-dimensional matrices that preserve a [[linear complex structure]] &amp;mdash; concretely, that commute with a matrix ''J'' such that {{nowrap|1=''J''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −''I''}}, where ''J'' corresponds to multiplying by the imaginary unit ''i''.

The [[Lie algebra]] corresponding to {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}} consists of all {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} complex matrices with the [[commutator]] serving as the Lie bracket.

Unlike the real case, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}} is [[connected space|connected]]. This follows, in part, since the multiplicative group of complex numbers '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is connected. The group manifold {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}} is not compact; rather its [[maximal compact subgroup]] is the [[unitary group]] U(''n''). As for U(''n''), the group manifold {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''C''')}} is not [[simply connected]] but has a [[fundamental group]] isomorphic to '''Z'''.

== Over finite fields ==
[[File:Symmetric group 3; Cayley table; GL(2,2).svg|thumb|[[Cayley table]] of {{nowrap|GL(2, 2)}}, which is isomorphic to [[Dihedral group of order 6|S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].]]
If ''F'' is a [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements, then we sometimes write {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''q'')}} instead of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}}. When ''p'' is prime, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''p'')}} is the [[outer automorphism group]]  of the group '''Z'''{{sub|''p''}}{{sup|''n''}}, and also the [[automorphism]] group, because '''Z'''{{sub|''p''}}{{sup|''n''}} is abelian, so the [[inner automorphism group]] is trivial.

The order of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''q'')}} is: 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(q^n-q^k)=(q^n - 1)(q^n - q)(q^n - q^2)\ \cdots\ (q^n - q^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be shown by counting the possible columns of the matrix: the first column can be anything but the zero vector; the second column can be anything but the multiples of the first column; and in general, the ''k''th column can be any vector not in the [[linear span]] of the first {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}} columns. In [[q-analog|''q''-analog]] notation, this is &lt;math&gt;[n]_q!(q-1)^n q^{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, {{nowrap|GL(3, 2)}} has order {{nowrap|1=(8 − 1)(8 − 2)(8 − 4) = 168}}. It is the automorphism group of the [[Fano plane]] and of the group '''Z'''{{sub|2}}{{sup|3}}, and is also known as {{nowrap|[[PSL(2,7)|PSL(2, 7)]]}}.

More generally, one can count points of [[Grassmannian]] over ''F'': in other words the number of subspaces of a given dimension ''k''. This requires only finding the order of the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] subgroup of one such subspace and dividing into the formula just given, by the [[orbit-stabilizer theorem]].

These formulas are connected to the [[Schubert decomposition]] of the Grassmannian, and are [[q-analog|''q''-analogs]] of the [[Betti number]]s of complex Grassmannians. This was one of the clues leading to the [[Weil conjectures]].

Note that in the limit {{nowrap|''q'' ↦ 1}} the order of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''q'')}} goes to 0! &amp;ndash; but under the correct procedure (dividing by {{nowrap|(''q'' &amp;minus; 1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}) we see that it is the order of the symmetric group (See Lorscheid's article) &amp;ndash; in the philosophy of the [[field with one element]], one thus interprets the [[symmetric group]] as the general linear group over the field with one element: {{nowrap|''S''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ GL(''n'', 1)}}.

=== History ===
The general linear group over a prime field, {{nowrap|GL(''ν'', ''p'')}}, was constructed and its order computed by [[Évariste Galois]] in 1832, in his last letter (to Chevalier) and second (of three) attached manuscripts, which he used in the context of studying the [[Galois group]] of the general equation of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="chevalier-letter"&gt;{{cite journal

== Special linear group ==
{{main article|Special linear group}}

The special linear group, {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}}, is the group of all matrices with [[determinant]] 1. They are special in that they lie on a [[Algebraic variety|subvariety]] &amp;ndash; they satisfy a polynomial equation (as the determinant is a polynomial in the entries). Matrices of this type form a group as the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of the determinants of each matrix. {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} is a [[normal subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}}.

If we write ''F''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; for the [[multiplicative group]] of ''F'' (excluding 0), then the determinant is a [[group homomorphism]]
:det: GL(''n'', ''F'') → ''F''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;.
that is surjective and its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the special linear group. Therefore, by the [[first isomorphism theorem]], {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')/SL(''n'', ''F'')}} is [[isomorphic]] to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact, {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} can be written as a [[semidirect product]]:
:GL(''n'', ''F'') = SL(''n'', ''F'') ⋊ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;

The special linear group is also the [[derived group]] (also known as commutator subgroup) of the GL(''n'', ''F'') (for a field or a [[division ring]] ''F'') provided that &lt;math&gt;n \ne 2&lt;/math&gt; or ''k'' is not the [[finite field|field with two elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Suprunenko|first=D.A.|title=Matrix groups|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1976|series=Translations of Mathematical Monographs}}, Theorem II.9.4&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''F'' is '''R''' or '''C''', {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} is a [[Lie subgroup]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} of dimension {{nowrap|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. The [[Lie algebra]] of {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} consists of all {{nowrap|''n''×''n''}} matrices over ''F'' with vanishing [[trace (matrix)|trace]]. The Lie bracket is given by the [[commutator]].

The special linear group {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} can be characterized as the group of ''[[volume]] and [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] preserving'' linear transformations of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The group {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''C''')}} is simply connected, while {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} is not. {{nowrap|SL(''n'', '''R''')}} has the same fundamental group as {{nowrap|GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'', '''R''')}}, that is, '''Z''' for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} and '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 2}}.

== Other subgroups ==

=== Diagonal subgroups ===

The set of all invertible [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]] forms a subgroup of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} isomorphic to (''F''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In fields like '''R''' and '''C''', these correspond to rescaling the space; the so-called dilations and contractions.

A '''scalar matrix''' is a diagonal matrix which is a constant times the [[identity matrix]]. The set of all nonzero scalar matrices forms a subgroup of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} isomorphic to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; . This group is the [[center of a group|center]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}}. In particular, it is a normal, abelian subgroup.

The center of {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} is simply the set of all scalar matrices with unit determinant, and is isomorphic to the group of ''n''th [[roots of unity]] in the field ''F''.

=== Classical groups ===

The so-called [[classical group]]s are subgroups of GL(''V'') which preserve some sort of [[bilinear form]] on a vector space ''V''. These include the
* '''[[orthogonal group]]''', O(''V''), which preserves a [[non-degenerate]] [[quadratic form]] on ''V'',
* '''[[symplectic group]]''', Sp(''V''), which preserves a [[Symplectic vector space|symplectic form]] on ''V'' (a non-degenerate [[alternating form]]),
* '''[[unitary group]]''', U(''V''), which, when {{nowrap|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}, preserves a non-degenerate [[hermitian form]] on ''V''.
These groups provide important examples of Lie groups.

== Related groups and monoids ==

=== Projective linear group ===
{{main article|Projective linear group}}
The [[projective linear group]] {{nowrap|PGL(''n'', ''F'')}} and the [[projective special linear group]] {{nowrap|PSL(''n'', ''F'')}} are the [[quotient group|quotients]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} and {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'')}} by their [[Group center|centers]] (which consist of the multiples of the identity matrix therein); they are the induced [[group action|action]] on the associated [[projective space]].

=== Affine group ===
{{main article|Affine group}}

The [[affine group]] {{nowrap|Aff(''n'', ''F'')}} is an [[group extension|extension]] of {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} by the group of translations in ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be written as a [[semidirect product]]:
:Aff(''n'', ''F'') = GL(''n'', ''F'') ⋉ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
where {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} acts on ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in the natural manner. The affine group can be viewed as the group of all [[affine transformation]]s of the [[affine space]] underlying the vector space ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

One has analogous constructions for other subgroups of the general linear group: for instance, the [[special affine group]] is the subgroup defined by the semidirect product, {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''F'') ⋉ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the [[Poincaré group]] is the affine group associated to the [[Lorentz group]], {{nowrap|O(1, 3, ''F'') ⋉ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

=== General semilinear group ===
{{main article|General semilinear group}}
The [[general semilinear group]] {{nowrap|ΓL(''n'', ''F'')}} is the group of all invertible [[semilinear transformation]]s, and contains GL. A semilinear transformation is a transformation which is linear "up to a twist", meaning "up to a [[field automorphism]] under scalar multiplication". It can be written as a semidirect product:
:ΓL(''n'', ''F'') = Gal(''F'') ⋉ GL(''n'', ''F'')
where Gal(''F'') is the [[Galois group]] of ''F'' (over its [[prime field]]), which acts on {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'')}} by the Galois action on the entries.

The main interest of {{nowrap|ΓL(''n'', ''F'')}} is that the associated [[projective semilinear group]] {{nowrap|PΓL(''n'', ''F'')}} (which contains {{nowrap|PGL(''n'', ''F''))}} is the [[collineation group]] of [[projective space]], for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 2}}, and thus semilinear maps are of interest in [[projective geometry]].

=== Full linear monoid ===
{{expand section|basic properties|date=April 2015}}
If one removes the restriction of the determinant being non-zero, the resulting algebraic structure is a [[monoid]], usually called the '''full linear monoid''',&lt;ref name="Okniński1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Okniński|title=Semigroups of Matrices|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-3445-4|at=Chapter 2: Full linear monoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meakin"&gt;{{cite book|editor=C. M. Campbell|title=Groups St Andrews 2005|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-69470-4|page=471|chapter=Groups and Semigroups: Connections and contrast|author=Meakin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RhodesSteinberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Rhodes|author2=Benjamin Steinberg|title=The q-theory of Finite Semigroups|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-09781-7|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; but occasionally also ''full linear semigroup'',&lt;ref name="JespersOkniski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Jespers|author2=Jan Okniski|title=Noetherian Semigroup Algebras|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-5810-3|at=2.3: Full linear semigroup}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''general linear monoid''&lt;ref name="Geck2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meinolf Geck|title=An Introduction to Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Groups|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967616-3|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CanLi2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahir Bilen Can|author2=Zhenheng Li|author3=Benjamin Steinberg|author4=Qiang Wang|title=Algebraic Monoids, Group Embeddings, and Algebraic Combinatorics|year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4939-0938-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. It is actually a [[regular semigroup]].&lt;ref name="Meakin"/&gt;

== Infinite general linear group ==
The '''infinite general linear group''' or '''[[direct limit of groups|stable]] general linear group''' is the [[direct limit]] of the inclusions {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''F'') → GL(''n'' + 1, ''F'')}} as the upper left [[block matrix]]. It is denoted by either GL(''F'') or {{nowrap|GL(∞, ''F'')}}, and can also be interpreted as invertible infinite matrices which differ from the identity matrix in only finitely many places.&lt;ref name=Mil25&gt;{{cite book | last1=Milnor | first1=John Willard | author1-link= John Milnor | title=Introduction to algebraic K-theory | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | location=Princeton, NJ | mr=0349811 | year=1971 | zbl=0237.18005 | series=Annals of Mathematics Studies | volume=72 | page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used in [[algebraic K-theory]] to define [[Algebraic K-theory#K1|K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], and over the reals has a well-understood topology, thanks to [[Bott periodicity]].

It should not be confused with the space of (bounded) invertible operators on a [[Hilbert space]], which is a larger group, and topologically much simpler, namely contractible &amp;ndash; see [[Kuiper's theorem]].

Born at the lodge of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], of which his father [[Edmund Law]] was Master, Law was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], where he was second [[wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]].&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt;  His main claim to fame was the way in which he introduced a systematic and rigorous training system for parish priests.

He founded a theological college at [[St Bees]] in [[Cumbria]].  There had been once been a monastery at St Bees, but since the dissolution in 1539 many of the monastic buildings had disappeared and chancel stood roofless when Bishop Law visited [[Whitehaven]] in 1816.  He was short of good clergy for the diocese, which included [[Lancashire]], and was at that time the powerhouse of the industrial revolution.  The consequent growth in population increased the demand for clergymen.  Up until Bishop Law's college, training for clergy was haphazard.  Most were ordained on the strength of a degree from [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]], whilst some were ordained after individual instruction from a member of the clergy.   Resulting clergy were variable and did not meet a reliable standard.  Law was determined to improve the supply situation so when Law visited Whitehaven and met the influential [[Lowther family]] and they agreed to pay for restoration of the chancel for a new theogical college he accepted the offer.  The agreement allowed Law to appoint the new vicar  for St Bees and Principal of the College, contrary to the practice of patronage at the time, and so the [[St Bees Theological College]] was born.  It was the first theological training institution of the Anglican Church outside Oxford or Cambridge.

The Lowthers did not act out of pure generosity.  They were keen to improve their public image having been accused of acquiring the mineral rights to [[Whitehaven]] for a pittance from St Bees School, and were also suspected of having tried to keep the matter quiet by arranging the sacking the headmaster.

He was the younger brother of [[John Law (bishop)|Bishop John Law]] (1745–1810) and of [[Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough]] (1750–1818).

'''George Pólya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|l|j|ə}}; {{lang-hu|Pólya György}} {{IPA-hu|ˈpoːjɒ ˈɟørɟ|}}; December 13, 1887 – September 7, 1985) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]]. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at [[ETH Zürich]] and from 1940 to 1953 at [[Stanford University]]. He made fundamental contributions to [[combinatorics]], [[number theory]], [[numerical analysis]] and [[probability theory]]. He is also noted for his work in [[heuristics]] and [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexanderson, Gerald L.|authorlink=Gerald L. Alexanderson|title=The random walks of George Pólya|year=2000|location=Washington, DC|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Random_Walks_of_George_Polya.html?id=OuHrR_6WEKsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[György Marx]] he was one of [[The Martians (scientists)|The Martians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fizikaiszemle.hu/archivum/fsz9703/marsl.html A marslakók legendája – [[György Marx]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and works ==
Pólya was born in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]] to Anna Deutsch and Jakab Pólya, [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] who had converted to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Polya.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although his parents were religious and he was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, George Pólya grew up to be an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=George Pólya: master of discovery 1887–1985|year=1993|publisher=Dale Seymour Publications|isbn=978-0-86651-611-2|author=Harold D. Taylor, Loretta Taylor|page=50|quote=Plancherel was a military man, a colonel in the Swiss army, and a devout Catholic; Pólya did not like military ceremonies or activities, and he was an agnostic who objected to hierarchical religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at [[ETH Zürich]] in Switzerland and from 1940 to 1953 at [[Stanford University]]. He remained Stanford Professor Emeritus for the rest of his life and career. He worked on a range of mathematical topics, including [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[number theory]], [[mathematical analysis]], [[geometry]], [[algebra]], [[combinatorics]], and [[probability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Roberts|first= A. Wayne|year= 1995| title = Faces of Mathematics, Third Edition|publisher = HarperCollins College Publishers| location=New York, NY USA|isbn = 0-06-501069-8|pages=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1928 at Bologna,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pólya, G.|chapter=Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Gaussschen Fehlergesetzes|title=''In:'' Atti del Congresso Internazionale dei Matematici: Bologna del 3 al 10 de settembre di 1928|volume=vol. 6|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1936 at Oslo, and in 1950 at Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He died in [[Palo Alto]], California, [[United States]].

== Heuristics ==
Early in his career, Pólya wrote with [[Gábor Szegő]] two influential problem books ''Problems and Theorems in Analysis'' (''I: Series, Integral Calculus, Theory of Functions'' and ''II: Theory of Functions. Zeros. Polynomials. Determinants. Number Theory. Geometry''). Later in his career, he spent considerable effort to identify systematic methods of problem-solving to further discovery and invention in mathematics for students, teachers, and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.2307/2690409|last = Schoenfeld|first =Alan H.|title = Pólya, Problem Solving, and Education|journal = Mathematics Magazine|volume = 60|issue = 5|date=December 1987|pages = 283–291|publisher = Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 60, No. 5|jstor = 2690409}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote five books on the subject: ''[[How to Solve It]]'', ''[[Mathematics and plausible reasoning|Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning]]'' (''Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics'', and ''Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference''), and ''Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning, and Teaching Problem Solving'' (volumes 1 and 2).

In ''[[How to Solve It]]'', Pólya provides general [[heuristics]] for solving a gamut of problems, including both mathematical and non-mathematical problems. The book includes advice for teaching students of mathematics and a mini-encyclopedia of heuristic terms. It was translated into several languages and has sold over a million copies. Russian [[physicist]] [[Zhores Ivanovich Alferov|Zhores I. Alfyorov]] ([[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate]] in 2000) praised it, noting that he was a fan. The American mathematician [[Terence Tao]] used the book to prepare for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. The book is still used in [[mathematical education]]. [[Douglas Lenat]]'s [[Automated Mathematician]] and [[Eurisko]] artificial intelligence programs were inspired by Pólya's work.

In addition to his works directly addressing problem solving, Pólya wrote another short book called ''Mathematical Methods in Science'', based on a 1963 work supported by the National Science Foundation, edited by Leon Bowden, and published by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in 1977. As Pólya notes in the preface, Professor Bowden carefully followed a tape recording of a course Pólya gave several times at Stanford in order to put the book together. Pólya notes in the preface "that the following pages will be useful, yet they should not be regarded as a finished expression."

== Legacy ==
There are three prizes named after Pólya, causing occasional confusion of one for another. In 1969 the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) established the [[Pólya Prize (SIAM)|George Pólya Prize]], given alternately in two categories for "a notable application of combinatorial theory" and for "a notable contribution in another area of interest to George Pólya."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/prizes/sponsored/polya.php Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics George Pólya Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA) established the [[George Pólya Award]] "for articles of expository excellence" published in the ''[[College Mathematics Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/Awards/polya.html Mathematical Association of America George Pólya Award]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the [[London Mathematical Society]] (LMS) established the [[Pólya Prize (LMS)|Pólya Prize]] for "outstanding creativity in, imaginative exposition of, or distinguished contribution to, mathematics within the United Kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/index.html London Mathematical Society Polya Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

A mathematics center has been named in Pólya's honor at the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho]]. The mathematics center focuses mainly on tutoring students in the subjects of algebra and calculus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/polya/ University of Idaho Polya Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[theory of probability]], the '''Glivenko–Cantelli theorem''', named after [[Valery Ivanovich Glivenko]] and [[Francesco Paolo Cantelli]],  determines the asymptotic behaviour of the [[empirical distribution function]] as the number of [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]] observations grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Howard G.Tucker| year = 1959 | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2237422?uid=3738256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102589085583 | title = A Generalization of the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem | journal = The Annals of Mathematical Statistics | volume = 30| doi = 10.1214/aoms/1177706212 | pages=828–830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform convergence of  more general [[empirical measure]]s becomes an important property of the '''Glivenko–Cantelli classes''' of functions or sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van der Vaart |first=A. W. |year=1998 |title=Asymptotic Statistics |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78450-6 |page=279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Glivenko–Cantelli classes arise in [[Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory]], with applications to [[machine learning]]. Applications can be found in [[econometrics]] making use of [[M-estimator]]s.

Assume that  &lt;math&gt;X_1,X_2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent and identically-distributed random variables]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with common [[cumulative distribution function]] &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The ''[[empirical distribution function]]'' for &lt;math&gt;X_1,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F_n(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I_{[X_i, \infty)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of the set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. For every (fixed) &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of random variables which converge to &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; [[Convergence of random variables#Almost sure convergence|almost surely]] by the strong [[law of large numbers]], that is, &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; [[pointwise convergence|pointwise]].

'''Remarks'''
*If &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; is a stationary [[ergodic process]], then &lt;math&gt;F_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges almost surely to &lt;math&gt;F(x)=E(1_{X_1\le x})&lt;/math&gt;. The Glivenko–Cantelli theorem gives a stronger mode of convergence than this in the [[iid]] case.
*An even stronger uniform convergence result for the empirical distribution function is available in the form of an extended type of [[law of the iterated logarithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van der Vaart |first=A. W. |year=1998 |title=Asymptotic Statistics |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78450-6 |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Empirical distribution function#Asymptotic properties|asymptotic properties of the empirical distribution function]] for this and related results.

== Proof ==
For simplicity, consider a case of continuous random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Fix &lt;math&gt;-\infty =x_0&lt;x_1&lt;\cdots &lt;x_{m-1}&lt;x_m=\infty&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F(x_j)-F(x_{j-1})=\frac{1}{m}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots,m&lt;/math&gt;. Now for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;j \in \{1,\dots,m\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in [x_{j-1},x_j]&lt;/math&gt;. Note that

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_n(x)-F(x) &amp;\leq F_n(x_j)-F(x_{j-1}) = F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)+1/m,\\
F_n(x)-F(x) &amp;\geq F_n(x_{j-1})-F(x_{j}) = F_n(x_{j-1})-F(x_{j-1})-1/m.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, almost surely

&lt;math&gt;||F_n-F||_{\infty} = \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|F_n(x)-F(x)| \leq \max_{j\in\{1,\dots,m\}} |F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)| + 1/m.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\max_{j\in\{1,\dots,m\}} |F_n(x_j)-F(x_j)| \to 0 \text{ a.s.}&lt;/math&gt; by strong law of large numbers, we can guarantee that for any integer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; we can find &lt;math display="inline"&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;||F_n-F||_\infty \leq 1/m \text{ a.s.}&lt;/math&gt;,

which is the definition of almost sure convergence.

==Empirical measures==
One can generalize the ''empirical distribution function'' by replacing the set &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,x]&lt;/math&gt; by an arbitrary set ''C'' from a class of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain an [[empirical measure]] indexed by sets &lt;math&gt;C \in \mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_n(C)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I_C(X_i),   C\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;I_C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of each set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

Further generalization is the map induced by &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; on measurable real-valued functions ''f'', which is given by

:&lt;math&gt;f\mapsto P_nf=\int_Sf \, dP_n = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i), f\in\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then it becomes an important property of these classes that the strong [[law of large numbers]] holds uniformly on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Glivenko–Cantelli class==
Consider a set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; with a sigma algebra of [[Borel set|Borel subsets]] ''A'' and a [[probability measure]] ''P''. For a class of subsets,

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}\subset\{C:  C \mbox{ is measurable subset of }\mathcal{S}\}&lt;/math&gt;

and a class of functions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\subset\{f:\mathcal{S}\to \mathbb{R}, f \mbox{ is measurable}\,\}&lt;/math&gt;

define random variables

:&lt;math&gt;\|P_n-P\|_{\mathcal C}=\sup_{C\in {\mathcal C}} |P_n(C)-P(C)|&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\|P_n-P\|_{\mathcal F}=\sup_{f\in {\mathcal F}} |P_nf- Pf|&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_n(C)&lt;/math&gt; is the empirical measure, &lt;math&gt;P_n f&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding map, and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}f=\int_\mathcal{S} f \, dP = P f &lt;/math&gt;, assuming that it exists.

'''Definitions'''
* A class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''' ''Glivenko–Cantelli class'' ''' (or ''GC class'') with respect to a probability measure ''P'' if any of the following equivalent statements is true.
::1. &lt;math&gt;\|P_n-P\|_\mathcal{C}\to 0&lt;/math&gt; almost surely as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
::2. &lt;math&gt;\|P_n-P\|_\mathcal{C}\to 0&lt;/math&gt; in probability as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
::3. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\|P_n-P\|_\mathcal{C}\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; (convergence in mean).
:The Glivenko–Cantelli classes of functions are defined similarly.
*A class is called a ''universal Glivenko–Cantelli class'' if it is a GC class with respect to any probability measure ''P'' on (''S'',''A'').
*A class is called ''uniformly Glivenko–Cantelli'' if the convergence occurs uniformly over all probability measures ''P'' on (''S'',''A''):
::&lt;math&gt;\sup_{P\in \mathcal{P}(S,A)} \mathbb E \|P_n-P\|_\mathcal{C}\to 0;&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sup_{P\in \mathcal{P}(S,A)} \mathbb E \|P_n-P\|_\mathcal{F}\to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ([[Vapnik]] and [[Chervonenkis]], 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vapnik |first=V. N. |last2=Chervonenkis |first2=A. Ya |year=1971 |title=On uniform convergence of the frequencies of events to their probabilities |journal=Theor. Prob. Appl. |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=264–280 |doi=10.1137/1116025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''A class of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly GC if and only if it is a [[Shattering (machine learning)#Vapnik–Chervonenkis class|Vapnik–Chervonenkis class]]. ''

==Examples==
* Let &lt;math&gt;S=\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}=\{(-\infty,t]:t\in {\mathbb R}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The classical Glivenko–Cantelli theorem implies that this class is a universal GC class. Furthermore, by [[Kolmogorov-Smirnov test|Kolmogorov's theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{P\in \mathcal{P}(S,A)}\|P_n-P\|_{\mathcal C} \sim n^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly Glivenko–Cantelli class.

* Let ''P'' be a [[atom (measure theory)|nonatomic]] probability measure on ''S'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of all finite subsets in ''S''. Because &lt;math&gt;A_n=\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}\in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(A_n)=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_n(A_n)=1&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\|P_n-P\|_{\mathcal C}=1&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' a GC class with respect to ''P''.

'''Henri Léon Lebesgue''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]]}}&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi leɔ̃ ləbɛɡ|lang}}; June 28, 1875 – July 26, 1941) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] most famous for his [[Lebesgue integration|theory of integration]], which was a generalization of the 17th century concept of integration—summing the area between an axis and the curve of a function defined for that axis. His theory was published originally in his dissertation ''Intégrale, longueur, aire'' ("Integral, length, area") at the [[University of Nancy]] during 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=86693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Lebesgue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Henri Lebesgue was born on 28 June 1875 in [[Beauvais]], [[Oise]]. Lebesgue's father was a [[typesetting|typesetter]] and his mother was a school [[teacher]]. His parents assembled at home a library that the young Henri was able to use. His father died of [[tuberculosis]] when Lebesgue was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself. As he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school, one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education at the [[Collège de Beauvais]] and then at [[Lycée Saint-Louis]] and [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hawking |first1=Stephen W. |authorlink1=Stephen Hawking |title= God created the integers: the mathematical breakthroughs that changed history |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2005 |publisher=Running Press|location= |language= |isbn=978-0-7624-1922-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=1041–87 |at= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 Lebesgue was accepted at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], where he continued to focus his energy on the study of mathematics, graduating in 1897. After graduation he remained at the École Normale Supérieure for two years, working in the library, where he became aware of the research on [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] done at that time by [[René-Louis Baire]], a recent graduate of the school. At the same time he started his graduate studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he learned about [[Émile Borel]]'s work on the incipient [[measure theory]] and [[Camille Jordan]]'s work on the [[Jordan measure]]. In 1899 he moved to a teaching position at the Lycée Central in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], while continuing work on his doctorate. In 1902 he earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the Sorbonne with the seminal thesis on "Integral, Length, Area", submitted with Borel, four years older, as advisor.&lt;ref name=McElroy&gt;{{cite book |last1=McElroy |first1=Tucker |title= A to Z of mathematicians |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2005 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-8160-5338-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=164 |at= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebesgue married the sister of one of his fellow students, and he and his wife had two children, Suzanne and Jacques.

After publishing his thesis, Lebesgue was offered in 1902 a position at the [[University of Rennes]], lecturing there until 1906, when he moved to the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Poitiers]]. In 1910 Lebesgue moved to the Sorbonne as a [[maître de conférences]], being promoted to professor starting with 1919. In 1921 he left the Sorbonne to become professor of mathematics at the [[Collège de France]], where he lectured and did research for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name='Perrin'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perrin |first1=Louis |editor1-first=François |editor1-last=Le Lionnais |title= Great Currents of Mathematical Thought |trans-title=|url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition=2nd |series= |volume=1 |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-486-49578-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= Henri Lebesgue: Renewer of Modern Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 he was elected a member of the [[Académie des Sciences]]. Henri Lebesgue died on 26 July 1941 in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt;

==Mathematical career==
[[File:Lebesgue - Leçons sur l'integration et la recherche des fonctions primitives, 1904 - 3900788.tif|thumb|''Leçons sur l'integration et la recherche des fonctions primitives'', 1904]]
Lebesgue's first paper was published in 1898 and was titled "Sur l'approximation des fonctions". It dealt with [[Weierstrass]]' theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials. Between March 1899 and April 1901 Lebesgue published six notes in ''[[Comptes Rendus]].'' The first of these, unrelated to his development of Lebesgue integration, dealt with the extension of [[Baire's theorem]] to functions of two variables. The next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane, the area of skew [[polygons]], [[surface integral]]s of minimum area with a given bound, and the final note gave the definition of Lebesgue integration for some function f(x). Lebesgue's great thesis, ''Intégrale, longueur, aire'', with the full account of this work, appeared in the Annali di Matematica in 1902. The first chapter develops the theory of measure (see [[Borel measure]]). In the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically. The next chapters expand the ''Comptes Rendus'' notes dealing with length, area and applicable surfaces. The final chapter deals mainly with [[Plateau's problem]]. This dissertation is considered to be one of the finest ever written by a mathematician.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

His lectures from 1902 to 1903 were collected into a "[[Émile Borel|Borel]] tract" ''Leçons sur l'intégration et la recherche des fonctions primitives''. The problem of integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book. Lebesgue presents the problem of integration in its historical context, addressing [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Lebesgue presents six conditions which it is desirable that the integral should satisfy, the last of which is "If the sequence f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(x) increases to the limit f(x), the integral of f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(x) tends to the integral of f(x)." Lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the [[measure theory|theory of measure]] and [[measurable function]]s and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral.

He turned next to [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] functions with his 1903 paper "Sur les séries trigonométriques". He presented three major theorems in this work: that a trigonometrical series
representing a bounded function is a Fourier series, that the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fourier coefficient tends to zero (the [[Riemann–Lebesgue lemma]]), and that a [[Fourier series]] is integrable term by term. In 1904-1905 Lebesgue lectured once again at the [[Collège de France]], this time on trigonometrical series and he went on to publish his lectures in another of the "Borel tracts". In this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context. He expounds on Fourier series, Cantor-Riemann theory, the [[Poisson integral]] and the [[Dirichlet problem]].

In a 1910 paper, "Représentation trigonométrique approchée des fonctions satisfaisant a une condition de Lipschitz" deals with the Fourier series of functions satisfying a [[Lipschitz condition]], with an evaluation of the order of magnitude of the remainder term. He also proves that the [[Riemann–Lebesgue lemma]] is a best possible result for continuous functions, and gives some treatment to [[Lebesgue constant (approximation)|Lebesgue constants]].

Lebesgue once wrote, "Réduites à des théories générales, les mathématiques seraient une belle forme sans contenu." ("Reduced to general theories, mathematics would be a beautiful form without content.")

In measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics, the [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]] generalizes Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue integration, preserving the many advantages of the latter in a more general measure-theoretic framework.

During the course of his career, Lebesgue also made forays into the realms of [[complex analysis]] and [[topology]]. He also had a disagreement with [[Émile Borel]] about whose integral was more general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pesin|first=Ivan N.| title=Classical and Modern Integration Theories| year=2014| page=94|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|editor1-last=Birnbaum|editor1-first=Z.

These have important practical implications for fundamental physics of which Lebesgue would have been completely unaware, as noted below.

==Lebesgue's theory of integration==
[[File:Riemann.gif|thumb|Approximation of the Riemann integral by rectangular areas.]]
[[File:Integral of positive function.svg|thumb|Method of Lebesgue's integration.]]
: This is a non-technical treatment from a historical point of view; see the article ''[[Lebesgue integration]]'' for a technical treatment from a mathematical point of view.

[[integral|Integration]] is a mathematical operation that corresponds to the informal idea of finding the [[area]] under the [[graph (function)|graph]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The first theory of integration was developed by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC with his method of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadratures]], but this could be applied only in limited circumstances with a high degree of geometric symmetry. In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] discovered the idea that integration was intrinsically linked to [[derivative|differentiation]], the latter being a way of measuring how quickly a function changed at any given point on the graph. This surprising relationship between two major geometric operations in calculus, differentiation and integration, is now known as the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]. It has allowed mathematicians to calculate a broad class of integrals for the first time. However, unlike Archimedes' method, which was based on [[Euclidean geometry]], mathematicians felt that Newton's and Leibniz's [[integral calculus]] did not have a rigorous foundation.

In the 19th century, [[Augustin Cauchy]] developed epsilon-delta [[limit of a function|limits]], and [[Bernhard Riemann]] followed up on this by formalizing what is now called the [[Riemann integral]]. To define this integral, one fills the area under the graph with smaller and smaller [[rectangle]]s and takes the limit of the [[summation|sums]] of the areas of the rectangles at each stage. For some functions, however, the total area of these rectangles does not approach a single number. As such, they have no Riemann integral.

Lebesgue invented a new method of integration to solve this problem.
Instead of using the areas of rectangles, which put the focus on the [[domain (function)|domain]] of the function, Lebesgue looked at the [[codomain]] of the function for his fundamental unit of area.
Lebesgue's idea was to first define measure, for both sets and functions on those sets. He then proceeded to build the integral for what he called [[simple function]]s; measurable functions that take only [[finite set|finitely]] many values.
Then he defined it for more complicated functions as the [[supremum|least upper bound]] of all the integrals of simple functions smaller than the function in question.

Lebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over a bounded interval with a Riemann integral also has a Lebesgue integral, and for those functions the two integrals agree. Furthermore, every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a Lebesgue integral and there are many functions with a Lebesgue integral that have no Riemann integral.

As part of the development of Lebesgue integration, Lebesgue invented the concept of [[Lebesgue measure|measure]], which extends the idea of [[length]] from intervals to a very large class of sets, called measurable sets (so, more precisely, [[simple function]]s are functions that take a finite number of values, and each value is taken on a measurable set).
Lebesgue's technique for turning a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] into an integral generalises easily to many other situations, leading to the modern field of [[measure theory]].

The Lebesgue integral is deficient in one respect.
The Riemann integral generalises to the [[improper Riemann integral]] to measure functions whose domain of definition is not a [[closed interval]].
The Lebesgue integral integrates many of these functions (always reproducing the same answer when it did), but not all of them.
For functions on the real line, the [[Henstock integral]] is an even more general notion of integral (based on Riemann's theory rather than Lebesgue's) that subsumes both Lebesgue integration and improper Riemann integration.
However, the Henstock integral depends on specific ordering features of the [[real line]] and so does not generalise to allow integration in more
general spaces (say, [[manifolds]]), while the Lebesgue integral extends to such spaces quite naturally.

In [[mathematics]], '''Higman's lemma''' states that the set of finite sequences over a finite alphabet, as partially ordered by the [[subsequence]] relation, is [[well-quasi-ordering|well-quasi-ordered]]. That is, if &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite sequence of words over some fixed finite alphabet, then there exist indices &lt;math&gt;i &lt; j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt; by deleting some (possibly none) symbols. More generally this remains true when the alphabet is not necessarily finite, but is itself well-quasi-ordered, and the subsequence relation allows the replacement of symbols by earlier symbols in the well-quasi-ordering of labels. This is a special case of the later [[Kruskal's tree theorem]]. It is named after [[Graham Higman]], who published it in 1952.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Lamb was born in [[Stockport]], [[Cheshire]], the son of John Lamb and his wife Elizabeth, ''née'' Rangeley,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; the latter a foreman in a cotton mill, who had gained some distinction by an invention for the improvement of spinning machines. John Lamb died while his son was a child.  Lamb's mother married again, and shortly afterwards Horace went to live with his strict but maternal aunt, Mrs. Holland. He studied at [[Stockport Grammar School]], where he made the acquaintance of a wise and kindly headmaster in the Rev. Charles Hamilton, and a graduate of classics, [[Frederic Slaney Poole]], who in his final year became a good friend. It was from these two tutors that Lamb acquired his taste for mathematics and, to a somewhat lesser extent, classical literature.&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;Brian Launder. (2012). [http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/67/2/139 'Horace Lamb and the circumstances of his appointment at Owens College'], ''Notes Rec. R. Soc.'' '''67''': 139–158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, he gained a classical scholarship at Queens' College, Cambridge. Since Lamb's inclination, however, was to pursue a career in engineering, he chose to decline the offer, and instead worked for a year at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]] in nearby [[Manchester]], as a means of developing his mathematical proficiency further.&lt;ref name="BL" /&gt;

At that time, the Chair of Pure Mathematics at Owens College was held by [[Thomas Barker (mathematician)|Thomas Barker]], an eminent Scottish mathematician, who graduated as [[Senior Wrangler]] and first [[Smith's prize]]man from the Cambridge [[Mathematical Tripos]] in 1862. An acknowledged lecturer of high quality, Lamb prospered under the guidance of Barker, and was elected to a minor scholarship at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="BL" /&gt;

At Trinity, he was [[Second Wrangler]] in the [[Mathematical Tripos]], 2nd [[Smith's prize]]man and elected fellow in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=LM867H|name=Lamb, Horace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his professors were [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and  [[George Gabriel Stokes]]. He was soon elected both a Fellow and a tutor in the college.

===University of Cambridge, 1872–75===
By 1874, Lamb had become thoroughly invested in his work at Trinity, preparing there an innovative and original series of lectures on the subject of hydrodynamics for third-year students. [[Richard Glazebrook]], a final-year student at the time, wrote of them that they were 'a revelation', and praised Lamb for his lucid presentation of the properties of liquids in rotational motion.&lt;ref name="BL" /&gt; However, Lamb soon became romantically involved with Elizabeth Foot, sister-in-law to his former headmaster, and, since the conditions of his position at Trinity stipulated that he should hold it only so long as he was unmarried, he was compelled, in 1875, to resign and continue his work elsewhere.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt;

===University of Adelaide, 1876–85===
Lamb's acquaintance from Stockport, Frederic Slaney Poole, had by now for some years lived in South Australia; hearing of his engagement, Poole suggested in a letter that he should apply for the chair at the recently founded [[University of Adelaide]].  In 1875, he was appointed the first (Sir Thomas) [[Elder Professor of Mathematics]] there, and took up the chair in March, 1876. Lamb was instrumental in the establishment of the academic and administrative structure of the university, and lectured in pure and applied mathematics, also giving practical demonstrations in physics.&lt;ref name=ADB /&gt; For the next ten years the average number of students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts course at Adelaide was fewer than twelve; though Lamb also gave some public lectures in the evenings, his workload was relatively light. His deftly rendered and original ''A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of the Motions of Fluids'' (which would later be reprinted as ''Hydrodynamics'' in 1895) was first published in 1878.

In 1883, Lamb published a paper in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the [[Royal Society]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1883.0013 | title = On Electrical Motions in a Spherical Conductor | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 174 | pages = 519–526 | year = 1883 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; applying [[Maxwell's equations]] to the problem of oscillatory current flow in spherical conductors, an early examination of what was later to be known as the [[skin effect]]. Lamb was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1884.

===University of Manchester, 1885–1920===

Lamb was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at [[Owens College, Manchester]], in 1885 and which became the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics|Beyer Chair]] in 1888, a position Lamb held until retirement in 1920 (Owens College was merged with the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904). His ''Hydrodynamics'' appeared in 1895 (6th ed. 1933), and other works included ''An Elementary Course of Infinitesimal Calculus'' (1897, 3rd ed. 1919), ''Propagation of Tremors over the Surface of an Elastic Solid'' (1904), ''The Dynamical Theory of Sound'' (1910, 2nd ed. 1925), ''Statics'' (1912, 3rd ed. 1928), ''Dynamics'' (1914), ''Higher Mechanics'' (1920) and ''The Evolution of Mathematical Physics'' (1924).

===Later years, 1920–34===

In 1932 Lamb, in an address to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], wittily expressed on the difficulty of explaining and studying [[turbulence]] in fluids.
He reportedly said, "I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is [[quantum electrodynamics]], and the other is the turbulent motion of [[fluid]]s. And about the former I am rather optimistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Sydney|title=Fluid Mechanics in the First Half of This Century|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|date=1969|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.1146/annurev.fl.01.010169.000245|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.fl.01.010169.000245|bibcode = 1969AnRFM...1....1G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tackling Turbulence with Supercomputers | url = http://turb.seas.ucla.edu/~jkim/sciam/turbulence.html | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513183805/http://turb.seas.ucla.edu/~jkim/sciam/turbulence.html | archivedate = 13 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamb is also known for description of special waves in thin solid layers. These are now known as [[Lamb wave]]s.

Lamb was survived by three sons and four daughters. The sons (who included the painter [[Henry Lamb]]) were born at [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], and all became distinguished. He is buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge, with his wife.

==Honours and awards==
Lamb was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1884, was twice vice-president, received its [[Royal Medal]] in 1902 and, its highest honour, the [[Copley Medal]] in 1924. He was president of the London Mathematical Society 1902–1904, president of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]], and president&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/reportofbritisha26adva#page/n35/mode/2up Presidential Address to the British Association Meeting, held in Southampton in 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; of the British Association in 1925. He was knighted in 1931. A room in the [[Alan Turing Building]] at the [[University of Manchester]] is named in his honour and in 2013 the [[Sir Horace Lamb Chair]] was created at Manchester. A building at the University of Adelaide also bears his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11677">In [[linear algebra]], a '''Householder transformation''' (also known as a '''Householder reflection''' or '''elementary reflector''') is a [[linear transformation]] that describes a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] about a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] or [[hyperplane]] containing the origin. The Householder transformation was introduced in 1958 by [[Alston Scott Householder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first=A. S. |last=Householder |authorlink=Alston Scott Householder
 |title=Unitary Triangularization of a Nonsymmetric Matrix
 |journal=[[Journal of the ACM]]
 |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1958 |pages=339&amp;ndash;342
 |doi=10.1145/320941.320947 |mr=0111128
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its analogue over general [[inner product spaces]] is the [[Householder operator]].

==Definition==

===Transformation===

The reflection hyperplane can be defined by a [[unit vector]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; (a vector with length &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;) which is [[orthogonal]] to the hyperplane. The reflection of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; about this hyperplane is the [[linear transformation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;x - 2\langle x, v\rangle v = x - 2v\left(v^\textsf{H} x\right), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is given as a column unit vector with [[Hermitian transpose]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v^\textsf{H}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Householder matrix===

The matrix constructed from this transformation can be expressed in terms of an [[outer product]] as:

: &lt;math&gt;P = I - 2(v \otimes v) = I - 2vv^\textsf{H}&lt;/math&gt;

is known as the '''Householder matrix''', where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]]

====Properties====

The Householder matrix has the following properties:
* it is [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]]: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P = P^\textsf{H}&lt;/math&gt;,
* it is [[unitary matrix|unitary]]: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P^{-1} = P^\textsf{H}&lt;/math&gt;,
* hence it is [[involutory matrix|involutory]]: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P^2 = I &lt;/math&gt;.
* A Householder matrix has eigenvalues &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.  To see this, notice that if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to the vector &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; which was used to create the reflector, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Pu = u&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue of multiplicity &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, since there are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt; independent vectors orthogonal to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  Also, notice &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Pv = -v&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math display="inline"&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvalue with multiplicity &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[determinant]] of a Householder reflector is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, since the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues, in this case one of which is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; with the remainder being &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (as in the previous point).

==Applications==

===Geometric optics===

In geometric optics, [[specular reflection]] can be expressed in terms of the Householder matrix ([[specular reflection#Vector formulation]]).

===Numerical linear algebra===

Householder transformations are widely used in [[numerical linear algebra]], to perform [[QR decomposition]]s and is the first step of the [[QR algorithm]]. They are also widely used for [[tridiagonal]]ization of symmetric matrices and for transforming non-symmetric matrices to a [[Hessenberg matrix|Hessenberg]] form.

====QR decomposition====

Householder reflections can be used to calculate [[QR decomposition]]s by reflecting first one column of a matrix onto a multiple of a standard basis vector, calculating the transformation matrix, multiplying it with the original matrix and then recursing down the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(i, i)&lt;/math&gt; [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]]s of that product.

==== Tridiagonalization ====
{{main|Tridiagonal matrix}}
This procedure is taken from the book: Numerical Analysis, Burden and Faires, 8th Edition.
In the first step, to form the Householder matrix in each step we need to determine &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, which are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \alpha &amp;= -\operatorname{sgn}\left(a_{21}\right)\sqrt{\sum_{j=2}^n a_{j1}^2}; \\
       r &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2 - a_{21}\alpha\right)};
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, construct vector &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;v^{(1)} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v_2 = \frac{a_{21} - \alpha}{2r}&lt;/math&gt;, and 
:&lt;math&gt;v_k = \frac{a_{k1}}{2r}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;k = 3, 4 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;

Then compute:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      P^1 &amp;= I - 2v^{(1)} \left(v^{(1)}\right)^\textsf{T} \\
  A^{(2)} &amp;= P^1 AP^1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Having found &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P^1&lt;/math&gt; and computed &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; the process is repeated for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k = 2, 3, \ldots, n - 2&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     \alpha &amp;= -\operatorname{sgn}\left(a^k_{k+1,k}\right)\sqrt{\sum_{j=k+1}^n \left(a^k_{jk}\right)^2} \\
          r &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2 - a^k_{k+1,k}\alpha\right)} \\
      v^k_1 &amp;= v^k_2 = \cdots = v^k_k = 0 \\
  v^k_{k+1} &amp;= \frac{a^k_{k+1,k} - \alpha}{2r} \\
      v^k_j &amp;= \frac{a^k_{jk}}{2r} \text{ for } j = k + 2,\ k + 3,\ \ldots,\ n \\
        P^k &amp;= I - 2v^{(k)} \left(v^{(k)}\right)^\textsf{T} \\
  A^{(k+1)} &amp;= P^k A^{(k)}P^k
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing in this manner, the tridiagonal and symmetric matrix is formed.

====Examples====

This example is taken from the book "Numerical Analysis" by Richard L. Burden (Author), J. Douglas Faires.  In this example, the given matrix is transformed to the similar tridiagonal matrix A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by using the Householder method.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
   4 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp;  2 \\
   1 &amp; 2 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 \\
  -2 &amp; 0 &amp;  3 &amp; -2 \\
   2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

Following those steps in the Householder method, we have:

The first Householder matrix:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Q_1 &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
      1 &amp;  0   &amp; 0   &amp;  0   \\
      0 &amp; -1/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp; -2/3 \\
      0 &amp;  2/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp;  1/3 \\
      0 &amp; -2/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp;  2/3
    \end{bmatrix}, \\
  A_2 = Q_1 A Q_1 &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
       4 &amp; -3   &amp;  0   &amp;  0 \\
      -3 &amp; 10/3 &amp;  1   &amp;  4/3 \\
       0 &amp;  1   &amp;  5/3 &amp; -4/3 \\
       0 &amp;  4/3 &amp; -4/3 &amp; -1
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Used &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; to form
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Q_2 &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0   &amp;  0   \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp;  0   &amp;  0   \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -3/5 &amp; -4/5 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -4/5 &amp;  3/5
  \end{bmatrix}, \\
  A_3 = Q_2 A_2 Q_2 &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
     4 &amp; -3   &amp;   0    &amp;   0    \\
    -3 &amp; 10/3 &amp;  -5/3  &amp;   0    \\
     0 &amp; -5/3 &amp; -33/25 &amp;  68/75 \\
     0 &amp;  0   &amp;  68/75 &amp; 149/75
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As we can see, the final result is a tridiagonal symmetric matrix which is similar to the original one. The process is finished after two steps.

== Computational and theoretical relationship to other unitary transformations ==
{{see also|Rotation (mathematics)}}
The Householder transformation is a reflection about a hyperplane with unit normal vector &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, as stated earlier. An &lt;math display="inline"&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math display="inline"&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; [[unitary transformation]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math display="inline"&gt;UU^\textsf{H} = I&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the determinant (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-th power of the geometric mean) and trace (proportional to arithmetic mean) of a unitary matrix  reveals that its eigenvalues &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; have unit modulus. This can be seen directly and swiftly:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\operatorname{Trace}\left(UU^\textsf{H}\right)}{N} =
  \frac{\sum_{j=2}^N\left|\lambda_j\right|^2}{N} = 1,\quad
  \operatorname{det}\left(UU^\textsf{H}\right) =
  \prod_{j=1}^N \left|\lambda_j\right|^2 = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since arithmetic and geometric means are equal if the variables are constant (see [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]]), we establish the claim of unit modulus.

For the case of real valued unitary matrices we obtain [[orthogonal matrices]], &lt;math display="inline"&gt;UU^\textsf{T} = I&lt;/math&gt;. It follows rather readily (see [[orthogonal matrix]]) that any orthogonal matrix can be [[QR decomposition#Using Givens rotations|decomposed]] into a product of 2 by 2 rotations, called [[Givens rotation|Givens Rotations]], and Householder reflections. This is appealing intuitively since multiplication of a vector by an orthogonal matrix preserves the length of that vector, and rotations and reflections exhaust the set of (real valued) geometric operations that render invariant a vector's length.

The Householder transformation was shown to have a one-to-one relationship with the canonical coset decomposition of unitary matrices defined in group theory, which can be used to parametrize unitary operators in a very efficient manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Renan Cabrera |author2=Traci Strohecker |author3=Herschel Rabitz |title= The canonical coset decomposition of unitary matrices through Householder transformations

 |doi=10.1063/1.3466798 
 |arxiv=1008.2477|bibcode=2010JMP....51h2101C
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally we note that a single Householder transform, unlike a solitary Givens transform, can act on all columns of a matrix, and as such exhibits the lowest computational cost for QR decomposition and tridiagonalization. The penalty for this "computational optimality" is, of course, that Householder operations cannot be as deeply or efficiently parallelized. As such Householder is preferred for dense matrices on sequential machines, whilst Givens is preferred on sparse matrices, and/or parallel machines.

In [[mathematics]], an '''IP set''' is a set of [[natural number]]s which contains all '''finite sums''' of some [[infinite set]].

The finite sums of a set ''D'' of natural numbers are all those numbers that can be obtained by adding up the elements of some finite [[non-empty set|nonempty]] subset of ''D''.
The set of all finite sums over ''D'' is often denoted as FS(''D''). Slightly more generally, for a sequence of natural numbers (''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), one can consider the set of finite sums FS((''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)), consisting of the sums of all finite length subsequences of (''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;).

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is an IP set if there exists an infinite set ''D'' such that FS(''D'') is a subset of ''A''. Equivalently, one may require that ''A'' contains all finite sums FS((''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)) of a sequence (''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;).

Some authors give a slightly different definition of IP sets: They require that FS(''D'') equal ''A'' instead of just being a subset.

The term IP set was coined by Furstenberg and Weiss&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889248822|title=Recurrence in ergodic theory and combinatorial number theory|last=Harry,|first=Furstenberg,|isbn=9780691615363|location=Princeton, New Jersey|oclc=889248822}}&lt;/ref&gt; to abbreviate "'''i'''nfinite-dimensional [[Parallelepiped|'''p'''arallelepiped]]". Serendipitously, the abbreviation IP can also be expanded to  "'''i'''dem'''p'''otent"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergelson|first=V.|last2=Leibman|first2=A.|date=2016|title=Sets of large values of correlation functions for polynomial cubic configurations|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ergodic-theory-and-dynamical-systems/article/sets-of-large-values-of-correlation-functions-for-polynomial-cubic-configurations/65D3C9FC85AFFBECE602FC7BC41A5414|journal=Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems|pages=1–24|doi=10.1017/etds.2016.49|issn=0143-3857}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a set is IP if and only if it is a member of an idempotent [[ultrafilter]]).

== Hindman's theorem ==
If &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is an IP set and &lt;math&gt;S = C_1 \cup C_2 \cup ... \cup C_n&lt;/math&gt;, then at least one &lt;math&gt;C_i\,&lt;/math&gt; contains an IP set.
This is known as ''Hindman's theorem'' or the ''finite sums theorem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hindman|first=Neil|title=Finite sums from sequences within cells of a partition of N|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-3165(74)90023-5|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(74)90023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baumgartner|first=James E|title=A short proof of Hindman's theorem|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-3165(74)90103-4|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A|volume=17|issue=3|pages=384–386|doi=10.1016/0097-3165(74)90103-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different terms, Hindman's theorem states that the class of IP sets is [[partition regular]].

Since the set of natural numbers itself is an IP set and partitions can also be seen as colorings, one can reformulate a special case of Hindman's theorem in more familiar terms: Suppose the natural numbers are "colored" with ''n'' different colors; each natural number gets one and only one of the ''n'' colors. Then there exists a color ''c'' and an infinite set ''D'' of natural numbers, all colored with ''c'', such that every finite sum over ''D'' also has color ''c''.

The [[Milliken–Taylor theorem]] is a common generalisation of Hindman's theorem and [[Ramsey's theorem]].

== Semigroups ==
The definition of being IP has been extended from subsets of the special [[semigroup]] of natural numbers with addition to subsets of semigroups and partial semigroups in general. A variant of Hindman's theorem is true for arbitrary semigroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golan|first=Gili|last2=Tsaban|first2=Boaz|title=Hindmanʼs coloring theorem in arbitrary semigroups|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021869313004419|journal=Journal of Algebra|volume=395|pages=111–120|doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2013.08.007|arxiv=1303.3600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39368501|title=Algebra in the Stone-Čech compactification : theory and applications|last=Hindman|first=Neil|last2=Strauss|first2=Dona|date=1998|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|others=|year=|isbn=311015420X|location=New York|pages=|oclc=39368501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information quality''' ('''InfoQ''') is the potential of a [[data set]] to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given [[Empirical research|empirical analysis method]].

== Definition ==
Formally, the definition is InfoQ = U(X,f|g) where X is the data, f the analysis method, g the goal and U the utility function. InfoQ is different from [[data quality]] and [[Efficiency (statistics)|analysis quality]], but is dependent on these components and on the relationship between them. 
   	
InfoQ has been applied in a wide range of domains like healthcare, customer surveys, data science programs, advanced manufacturing and Bayesian network applications.

Kenett and Shmueli (2014) proposed eight dimensions to help assess InfoQ and various methods for increasing InfoQ: Data resolution, [[Data structure]], Data integration, Temporal relevance, Chronology of data and goal, [[Generalization]], [[Operationalization]], Communication.

'''James Earl Baumgartner''' (March 23, 1943 – December 28, 2011) was an American [[mathematician]] who worked in [[set theory]], [[mathematical logic]] and foundations, and [[topology]].&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rand-wilson.com/obituaries/obit_view.php?id=26 |title=James E. Baumgartner Obituary |publisher=Rand-wilson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumgartner was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], began his undergraduate study at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1960, then transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from which he received his PhD in 1970 from  for a dissertation entitled ''Results and Independence Proofs in Combinatorial Set Theory''. His advisor was [[Robert Vaught]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=22587}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1969, and spent there his entire career.

One of Baumgartner's results is the consistency of the statement that any two &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-dense sets of reals are order isomorphic (a set of reals is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-dense if it has exactly &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; points in every open interval). With [[András Hajnal]] he proved the  [[Baumgartner–Hajnal theorem]], which states that the [[partition relation]] &lt;math&gt;\omega_1\to(\alpha)^2_n&lt;/math&gt; holds for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. He died in 2011 of a heart attack at his home in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127050235/http://www.vnews.com/obits/obit%2012242011.htm|title= Valley News obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical context in which Baumgartner worked spans [[Suslin's problem]], [[Ramsey theory]], uncountable order types, disjoint refinements, almost disjoint families, cardinal arithmetics, filters, ideals, and partition relations, iterated forcing and Axiom A, proper forcing and the proper forcing axiom, [[Graph coloring|chromatic number of graphs]], a thin very-tall superatomic Boolean algebra, closed unbounded sets, and partition relations&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02219.pdf Jean A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2428">In [[set theory]],  '''Jensen's covering theorem''' states  that if [[zero sharp|0&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;]] does not exist then every uncountable set of ordinals is contained in a constructible set of the same cardinality. Informally this conclusion says that the [[constructible universe]] is close to the  universe of all sets. The first proof  appeared in {{harv|Devlin|Jensen|1975}}. [[Jack Silver|Silver]] later gave a fine structure free proof using his [[Silver machine|machines]] and finally  {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Menachem Magidor|last=Magidor|year=1990}} gave an even simpler proof.

The converse of Jensen's covering theorem is also true: if 0&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; exists then the countable set of all cardinals less than ℵ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be covered by a constructible set of cardinality less than ℵ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;.

In his book ''Proper Forcing'', [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] proved a strong form of Jensen's covering lemma.

In [[mathematics]], a '''proof''' is an inferential argument for a [[Proposition|mathematical statement]]. In the [[Argument-deduction-proof distinctions|argument]], other previously established statements, such as [[theorems]], can be used. In principle, a proof can be traced back to self-evident or assumed statements, known as [[axiom]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clapham, C.  |author2=Nicholson, JN.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Mathematics, Fourth edition |quote = A statement whose truth is either to be taken as self-evident or to be assumed. Certain areas of mathematics involve choosing a set of axioms and discovering what results can be derived from them, providing proofs for the theorems that are obtained.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nutsandbolts"&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. ''The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs''. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, Eric. ''Discrete Mathematics with Proof''. John Wiley and Sons, 2009. Definition 3.1 page 86. {{isbn|0-470-45793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with accepted rules of [[inference]].  Axioms may be treated as conditions that must be met before the statement applies.  Proofs are examples of exhaustive [[deductive reasoning]] or [[inductive reasoning]] and are distinguished from [[empirical evidence|empirical]] arguments or non-exhaustive [[inductive reasoning]] (or "reasonable expectation").  A proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true (occasionally by listing ''all'' possible cases and showing that it holds in each), rather than enumerate many confirmatory cases. An unproved proposition that is believed to be true is known as a [[conjecture]].

Proofs employ [[logic]] but usually include some amount of [[natural language]] which usually admits some ambiguity. In fact, the vast majority of proofs in written mathematics can be considered as applications of rigorous [[informal logic]]. Purely [[formal proof]]s, written in symbolic language instead of natural language, are considered in [[proof theory]]. The distinction between [[Proof theory#Formal and informal proof|formal and informal proofs]] has led to much examination of current and historical [[mathematical practice]], [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]], and so-called [[Mathematical folklore|folk mathematics]] (in both senses of that term). The [[philosophy of mathematics]] is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs, and [[mathematics as a language]].

==History and etymology==
{{See also|History of logic}}

The word "proof" comes from the Latin ''probare'' meaning "to test". Related modern words are the English "probe", "probation", and "probability", the Spanish ''probar'' (to smell or taste, or (lesser use) touch or test),&lt;ref&gt;"proof" New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 1993, OUP, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian ''provare'' (to try), and the German ''probieren'' (to try).  The early use of "probity" was in the presentation of legal evidence.  A person of authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, whereby the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference|first = Ian|last =  Hacking|publisher = Cambridge University Press |date = 1984|isbn=0521318033|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2g0F1V5DywC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plausibility arguments using heuristic devices such as pictures and analogies preceded strict mathematical proof.&lt;ref name="Krantz"/&gt; It is likely that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with [[geometry]], which originally meant the same as "land measurement".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale, William]] and Martha, 1962. ''The development of logic''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-824773-7}}. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of mathematical proof is primarily the product of [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematics]], and one of the greatest achievements thereof. [[Thales]] (624–546 BCE) and [[Hippocrates of Chios]] (c470-410 BCE) proved some theorems in geometry. [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (408–355 BCE) and [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (417–369 BCE) formulated theorems but did not prove them. [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) said definitions should describe the concept being defined in terms of other concepts already known.  Mathematical proofs were revolutionized by [[Euclid]] (300 BCE), who introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still in use today, starting with [[undefined term]]s and [[axioms]] (propositions regarding the undefined terms assumed to be self-evidently true from the Greek "axios" meaning "something worthy"),  and used these to prove theorems using [[deductive logic]].  His book, the [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']], was read by anyone who was considered educated in the West until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{isbn|0-03-029558-0}} p. 141: "No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used...."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to theorems of geometry, such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the ''Elements'' also covers number theory, including a proof that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Further advances took place in [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic mathematics]]. While earlier Greek proofs were largely geometric demonstrations, the development of [[arithmetic]] and [[algebra]] by Islamic mathematicians allowed more general proofs that no longer depended on geometry. In the 10th century CE, the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] mathematician [[Al-Hashimi]] provided general proofs for numbers (rather than geometric demonstrations) as he considered multiplication, division, etc. for "lines." He used this method to provide a proof of the existence of [[irrational number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Matvievskaya|first=Galina|year=1987|title=The Theory of Quadratic Irrationals in Medieval Oriental Mathematics|journal=[[New York Academy of Sciences|Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]]|volume=500|pages=253–277 [260]|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Mathematical induction|inductive proof]] for [[Arithmetic progression|arithmetic sequences]] was introduced in the ''Al-Fakhri'' (1000) by [[Al-Karaji]], who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]] and properties of [[Pascal's triangle]]. Alhazen also developed the method of [[proof by contradiction]], as the first attempt at proving the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[parallel postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Eder |first=Michelle |year=2000 |title=Views of Euclid's Parallel Postulate in Ancient Greece and in Medieval Islam |url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers2000/eder.html |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |accessdate=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[proof theory]] treats proofs as inductively defined [[Data structure|data structures.]] There is no longer an assumption that axioms are "true" in any sense; this allows for parallel mathematical theories built on alternate sets of axioms (see [[Axiomatic set theory]] and [[Non-Euclidean geometry]] for examples).

==Nature and purpose==

As practiced, a proof is expressed in natural language and is a rigorous argument intended to convince the audience of the truth of a statement. The standard of rigor is not absolute and has varied throughout history. A proof can be presented differently depending on the intended audience. In order to gain acceptance, a proof has to meet communal statements of rigor; an [[argument]] considered vague or incomplete may be rejected.

The concept of a proof is formalized in the field of mathematical logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Handbook of Proof Theory|volume=137|series=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics|editor-first=Samuel R.|editor-last=Buss|editor-link=Samuel Buss|publisher=Elsevier|year=1998|isbn=9780080533186|contribution=An introduction to proof theory|pages=1–78|first=Samuel R.|last=Buss|authorlink=Samuel Buss}}. See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=MfTMDeCq7ukC&amp;pg=PA3 p.&amp;nbsp;3]: "The study of Proof Theory is traditionally motivated by the problem of formalizing mathematical proofs; the original formulation of first-order logic by Frege [1879] was the first successful step in this direction."&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal proof]] is written in a [[formal language]] instead of a natural language. A formal proof is defined as sequence of formulas in a formal language, in which each formula is a logical consequence of preceding formulas. Having a definition of formal proof makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of [[proof theory]] studies formal proofs and their properties, for example, the property that a statement has a formal proof. An application of proof theory is to show that certain [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable statement]]s are not provable.

The definition of a formal proof is intended to capture the concept of proofs as written in the practice of mathematics. The soundness of this definition amounts to the belief that a published proof can, in principle, be converted into a formal proof. However, outside the field of automated proof assistants, this is rarely done in practice. A classic question in philosophy asks whether mathematical proofs are [[analytic proposition|analytic]] or [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who introduced the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]], believed mathematical proofs are synthetic. &lt;!-- [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] argued that mathematical proofs are analytic expressions, relying on no empirical observations or facts.&lt;ref&gt; Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Proofs may be viewed as aesthetic objects, admired for their [[mathematical beauty]]. The mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] was known for describing proofs he found particularly elegant as coming from "The Book", a hypothetical tome containing the most beautiful method(s) of proving each theorem. The book ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]'', published in 2003, is devoted to presenting 32 proofs its editors find particularly pleasing.

=={{Anchor|Types of proof}}Methods==

===Direct proof===
{{Main|Direct proof}}

In direct proof, the conclusion is established by logically combining the axioms, definitions, and earlier theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, direct proof can be used to establish that the sum of two [[Even and odd numbers|even]] [[integer]]s is always even:

:Consider two even integers ''x'' and ''y''. Since they are even, they can be written as ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''a'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''b'', respectively, for integers ''a'' and ''b''. Then the sum ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;= 2''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''b''&amp;nbsp;= 2(''a''+''b''). Therefore ''x''+''y'' has 2 as a factor and, by definition, is even. Hence the sum of any two even integers is even.

This proof uses the definition of even integers, the integer properties of [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] under addition and multiplication, and [[distributivity]].

===Proof by mathematical induction===
{{Main|Mathematical induction}}
Despite its name, mathematical induction is a method of [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], not a form of [[inductive reasoning]]. In proof by mathematical induction, a single "base case" is proved, and an "induction rule" is proved that establishes that any arbitrary case [[Material conditional|implies]] the next case. Since in principle the induction rule can be applied repeatedly starting from the proved base case, we see that all (usually [[Infinite set|infinitely]] many) cases are provable.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids having to prove each case individually. A variant of mathematical induction is [[proof by infinite descent]], which can be used, for example, to prove the [[Square root of 2#Proofs of irrationality|irrationality of the square root of two]].

A common application of proof by mathematical induction is to prove that a property known to hold for one number holds for all natural numbers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~larryc/proofs/proofs.mathinduction.html Examples of simple proofs by mathematical induction for all natural numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;
Let {{math|1='''N''' = {1,2,3,4,...}}} be the set of natural numbers, and {{math|''P''(''n'')}} be a mathematical statement involving the natural number {{math|''n''}} belonging to {{math|'''N'''}} such that
* '''(i)''' {{math|''P''(1)}} is true, i.e., {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}.
* '''(ii)''' {{math|''P''(''n''+1)}} is true whenever {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true, i.e., {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true implies that {{math|''P''(''n''+1)}} is true.
* '''Then {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is true for all natural numbers {{math|''n''}}.'''

For example, we can prove by induction that all positive integers of the form {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} are odd.  Let {{math|''P''(''n'')}} represent "{{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd":
:'''(i)''' For {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, {{math|1=2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2(1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}}, and {{math|1}} is odd, since it leaves a remainder of {{math|1}} when divided by {{math|2}}. Thus {{math|''P''(1)}} is true.
:'''(ii)''' For any {{math|''n''}}, if {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd ({{math|''P''(''n'')}}), then {{math|(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2}} must also be odd, because adding {{math|2}} to an odd number results in an odd number.  But {{math|1=(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2(''n''+1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, so {{math|1=2(''n''+1)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd ({{math|''P''(''n''+1)}}).  So {{math|''P''(''n'')}} implies {{math|''P''(''n''+1)}}.
:'''Thus''' {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} is odd, for all positive integers {{math|''n''}}.

The shorter phrase "proof by induction" is often used instead of "proof by mathematical induction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/AEAhelp/glossary/glossaryParser.php?glossaryFile=Proof%20by%20induction.htm Proof by induction], University of Warwick Glossary of Mathematical Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof by contraposition===
{{Main|Contraposition}}
[[Proof by contrapositive|Proof by contraposition]] [[Rule of inference|infers]] the conclusion "if ''p'' then ''q''" from the premise "if ''not q'' then ''not p''". The statement "if ''not q'' then ''not p''" is called the [[contrapositive]] of the statement "if ''p'' then ''q''". For example, contraposition can be used to establish that, given an integer &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is even, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is even:

: Suppose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not even. Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence &lt;math&gt; x^2  = x\cdot x &lt;/math&gt; is odd. Thus &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is not even. Thus, if &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; ''is'' even, the supposition must be false, so &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; has to be even.

===Proof by contradiction===
{{Main|Proof by contradiction}}
In proof by contradiction (also known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', Latin for "by reduction to the absurd"), it is shown that if some statement were true, a logical contradiction occurs, hence the statement must be false.  A famous example of proof by contradiction shows that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[irrational number]]:

:Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; were a rational number, so by definition &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = {a\over b}&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are non-zero integers with [[coprime|no common factor]]. (If there is a common factor, divide both numerator and denominator by that factor to remove it, and repeat until no common factor remains.  By the method of infinite descent, this process must terminate.) Thus, &lt;math&gt;b\sqrt{2} = a&lt;/math&gt;. Squaring both sides yields 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since 2 divides the left hand side, 2 must also divide the right hand side (otherwise an even number would equal an odd number). So ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even, which implies that ''a'' must also be even. So we can write ''a'' = 2''c'', where ''c'' is also an integer. Substitution into the original equation yields 2''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (2''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Dividing both sides by 2 yields ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But then, by the same argument as before, 2 divides ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so ''b'' must be even. However, if ''a'' and ''b'' are both even, they have a common factor, namely 2. This contradicts our initial supposition, so we are forced to conclude that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is an irrational number.

===Proof by construction===
{{Main|Proof by construction}}
Proof by construction, or proof by example, is the construction of a concrete example with a property to show that something having that property exists. [[Joseph Liouville]], for instance, proved the existence of [[transcendental number]]s by constructing an [[Liouville number|explicit example]].  It can also be used to construct a [[counterexample]] to disprove a proposition that all elements have a certain property.

===Proof by exhaustion===
{{Main|Proof by exhaustion}}
In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into a finite number of cases and proving each one separately. The number of cases sometimes can become very large. For example, the first proof of the [[four color theorem]] was a proof by exhaustion with 1,936 cases. This proof was controversial because the majority of the cases were checked by a computer program, not by hand. The shortest known proof of the four color theorem {{As of|2011|lc=on}} still has over 600 cases.

===Probabilistic proof===
{{Main|Probabilistic method}}
A probabilistic proof is one in which an example is shown to exist, with certainty, by using methods of [[probability theory]]. Probabilistic proof, like proof by construction, is one of many ways to show [[existence theorem]]s.

This is not to be confused with an argument that a theorem is 'probably' true, a 'plausibility argument'. The work on the [[Collatz conjecture]] shows how far plausibility is from genuine proof.

While most mathematicians do not think that probabilistic evidence ever counts as a genuine mathematical proof, a few mathematicians and philosophers have argued that at least some types of probabilistic evidence (such as Rabin's [[probabilistic algorithm]] for testing primality) are as good as genuine mathematical proofs.  &lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip J. (1972), "Fidelity in Mathematical Discourse: Is One and One Really Two?" ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 79:252-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fallis, Don (1997), "The Epistemic Status of Probabilistic Proof." ''Journal of Philosophy'' 94:165-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorial proof===
{{Main|Combinatorial proof}}
A combinatorial proof establishes the equivalence of different expressions by showing that they count the same object in different ways. Often a [[Bijective proof|bijection]] between two sets is used to show that the expressions for their two sizes are equal. Alternatively, a [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting argument]] provides two different expressions for the size of a single set, again showing that the two expressions are equal.

===Nonconstructive proof===
{{Main|Nonconstructive proof}}
A nonconstructive proof establishes that a [[mathematical object]] with a certain property exists without explaining how such an object can be found. Often, this takes the form of a proof by contradiction in which the nonexistence of the object is proved to be impossible. In contrast, a constructive proof establishes that a particular object exists by providing a method of finding it. A famous example of a
nonconstructive proof shows that there exist two [[irrational number]]s ''a'' and ''b'' such that &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rational number]]:
:Either &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational number and we are done (take &lt;math&gt;a=b=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;), or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational so we can write &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This then gives &lt;math&gt;\left (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right )^{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}^{2}=2&lt;/math&gt;, which is thus a rational of the form &lt;math&gt;a^b.&lt;/math&gt;

===Statistical proofs in pure mathematics===
{{Main| Statistical proof}}
The expression "statistical proof" may be used technically or colloquially in areas of [[pure mathematics]], such as involving [[cryptography]], [[chaotic series]], and probabilistic or analytic [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"in number theory and commutative algebra... in particular the statistical proof of the lemma." [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2686395]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whether constant π (i.e., pi) is normal is a confusing problem without any strict theoretical demonstration except for some '''statistical''' proof"" (Derogatory use.)[http://www.springerlink.com/content/nj34v59p71m11125/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"these observations suggest a statistical proof of Goldbach's conjecture with very quickly vanishing probability of failure for large E" [http://people.web.psi.ch/gassmann/eneseminare/abstracts/Goldbach1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is less commonly used to refer to a mathematical proof in the branch of mathematics known as [[mathematical statistics]].  See also "[[#Colloquial use, Statistical proof using data|Statistical proof using data]]" section below.

===Computer-assisted proofs===
{{Main|Computer-assisted proof }}
Until the twentieth century it was assumed that any proof could, in principle, be checked by a competent mathematician to confirm its validity.&lt;ref name="Krantz"&gt;[http://www.math.wustl.edu/~sk/eolss.pdf The History and Concept of Mathematical Proof], Steven G. Krantz. 1. February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, computers are now used both to prove theorems and to carry out calculations that are too long for any human or team of humans to check; the first proof of the [[four color theorem]] is an example of a computer-assisted proof. Some mathematicians are concerned that the possibility of an error in a computer program or a run-time error in its calculations calls the validity of such computer-assisted proofs into question. In practice, the chances of an error invalidating a computer-assisted proof can be reduced by incorporating redundancy and self-checks into calculations, and by developing multiple independent approaches and programs. Errors can never be completely ruled out in case of verification of a proof by humans either, especially if the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical insight.

==Undecidable statements==
A statement that is neither provable nor disprovable from a set of axioms is called undecidable (from those axioms). One example is the [[parallel postulate]], which is neither provable nor refutable from the remaining axioms of [[Euclidean geometry]].

Mathematicians have shown there are many statements that are neither provable nor disprovable in [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] with the axiom of choice (ZFC), the standard system of set theory in mathematics (assuming that ZFC is consistent); see [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC]].

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's (first) incompleteness theorem]] shows that many axiom systems of mathematical interest will have undecidable statements.

==Heuristic mathematics and experimental mathematics==
{{Main|Experimental mathematics}}
While early mathematicians such as [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] did not use proofs, from [[Euclid]] to the [[foundational mathematics]] developments of the late 19th and 20th centuries, proofs were an essential part of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;"''What to do with the pictures? Two thoughts surfaced: the first was that they were unpublishable in the standard way, there were no theorems only very suggestive pictures. They furnished convincing evidence for many conjectures and lures to further exploration, but theorems were coins of the realm and the conventions of that day dictated that journals only published theorems''", [[David Mumford]], Caroline Series and David Wright, [[Indra's Pearls (book)|Indra's Pearls]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in computing power in the 1960s, significant work began to be done investigating [[mathematical objects]] outside of the proof-theorem framework,&lt;ref&gt;"''Mandelbrot, working at the IBM Research Laboratory, did some computer simulations for these sets on the reasonable assumption that, if you wanted to prove something, it might be helpful to know the answer ahead of time.''"[http://home.att.net/~fractalia/history.htm A Note on the History of Fractals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215114618/http://home.att.net/~fractalia/history.htm |date=2009-02-15 }},&lt;/ref&gt; in [[experimental mathematics]]. Early pioneers of these methods intended the work ultimately to be embedded in a classical proof-theorem framework, e.g. the early development of [[fractal geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;"''... brought home again to Benoit [Mandelbrot] that there was a 'mathematics of the eye', that visualization of a problem was as valid a method as any for finding a solution. Amazingly, he found himself alone with this conjecture. The teaching of mathematics in France was dominated by a handful of dogmatic mathematicians hiding behind the pseudonym 'Bourbaki'... ''", Introducing Fractal Geometry, Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon&lt;/ref&gt; which was ultimately so embedded.

==Related concepts==

===Visual proof===
Although not a formal proof, a visual demonstration of a mathematical theorem is sometimes called a "[[proof without words]]". The left-hand picture below is an example of a historic visual proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] in the case of the (3,4,5) triangle.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|Visual proof for the (3, 4, 5) triangle as in the [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] 500–200&amp;nbsp;BC.
File:Pythagoras-2a.gif|Animated visual proof for the Pythagorean theorem by rearrangement.
File:Pythag anim.gif|A second animated proof of the Pythagorean theorem.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some illusory visual proofs, such as the [[missing square puzzle]], can be constructed in a way which appear to prove a supposed mathematical fact but only do so under the presence of tiny errors (for example, supposedly straight lines which actually bend slightly) which are unnoticeable until the entire picture is closely examined, with lengths and angles precisely measured or calculated.

===Elementary proof===
{{Main|Elementary proof}}
An elementary proof is a proof which only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in [[number theory]] to refer to proofs that make no use of [[complex analysis]]. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the [[prime number theorem]], could only be proved using "higher" mathematics. However, over time, many of these results have been reproved using only elementary techniques.

===Two-column proof===
[[File:twocolumnproof.png|thumb|right|A two-column proof published in 1913]]

A particular way of organising a proof using two parallel columns is often used in elementary geometry classes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Patricio G. Herbst, Establishing a Custom of Proving in American School Geometry: Evolution of the Two-Column Proof in the Early Twentieth Century, Educational Studies in Mathematics, Vol. 49, No. 3 (2002), pp. 283-312,&lt;/ref&gt; The proof is written as a series of lines in two columns. In each line, the left-hand column contains a proposition, while the right-hand column contains a brief explanation of how the corresponding proposition in the left-hand column is either an axiom, a hypothesis, or can be logically derived from previous propositions. The left-hand column is typically headed "Statements" and the right-hand column is typically headed "Reasons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/Math/Geometry_obj/two_column_proof.htm Introduction to the Two-Column Proof], Carol Fisher&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colloquial use of "mathematical proof"===
The expression "mathematical proof" is used by lay people to refer to using mathematical methods or arguing with [[mathematical objects]], such as numbers, to demonstrate something about everyday life, or when data used in an argument is numerical. It is sometimes also used to mean a "statistical proof" (below), especially when used to argue from [[data]].

===Statistical proof using data===
{{Main|Statistical proof}}
"Statistical proof" from data refers to the application of [[statistics]], [[data analysis]], or [[Bayesian analysis]] to infer propositions regarding the [[probability]] of [[data]]. While ''using'' mathematical proof to establish theorems in statistics, it is usually not a mathematical proof in that the ''assumptions'' from which probability statements are derived require empirical evidence from outside mathematics to verify. In [[physics]], in addition to statistical methods, "statistical proof" can refer to the specialized ''[[mathematical methods of physics]]'' applied to analyze data in a [[particle physics]] [[experiment]] or [[observational study]] in [[physical cosmology]]. "Statistical proof" may also refer to raw data or a convincing diagram involving data, such as [[scatter plot]]s, when the data or diagram is adequately convincing without further analysis.

===Inductive logic proofs and Bayesian analysis===
{{Main|Inductive logic|Bayesian analysis}}
Proofs using [[inductive logic]], while considered mathematical in nature, seek to establish propositions with a degree of certainty, which acts in a similar manner to [[probability]], and may be less than full [[certainty]]. Inductive logic should not be confused with [[mathematical induction]].

Bayesian analysis uses [[Bayes' theorem]] to update a person's [[Bayesian probability|assessment of likelihoods]] of hypotheses when new [[evidence]] or [[information]] is acquired.

===Proofs as mental objects===
{{Main|Psychologism|Language of thought}}
Psychologism views mathematical proofs as psychological or mental objects.  Mathematician [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Frege]], and [[Carnap]] have variously criticized this view and attempted to develop a semantics for what they considered to be the [[language of thought]], whereby standards of mathematical proof might be applied to [[empirical science]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Influence of mathematical proof methods outside mathematics===
Philosopher-mathematicians such as [[Spinoza]] have attempted to formulate philosophical arguments in an axiomatic manner, whereby mathematical proof standards could be applied to argumentation in general philosophy. Other mathematician-philosophers have tried to use standards of mathematical proof and reason, without empiricism, to arrive at statements outside of mathematics, but having the [[certainty]] of propositions deduced in a mathematical proof, such as [[Descartes]]' [[cogito ergo sum|''cogito'']] argument.

==Ending a proof==
{{Main|Q.E.D.}}
Sometimes, the abbreviation ''"Q.E.D."'' is written to indicate the end of a proof. This abbreviation stands for ''"Quod Erat Demonstrandum"'', which is [[Latin]] for ''"that which was to be demonstrated"''. A more common{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} alternative is to use a square or a rectangle, such as □ or ∎, known as a "[[tombstone (typography)|tombstone]]" or "halmos" after its [[eponym]] [[Paul Halmos]]. Often, "which was to be shown" is verbally stated when writing "QED", "□", or "∎" during an oral presentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">'''Mireille Bousquet-Mélou''' (born May 12, 1967) is a French mathematician who specializes in [[enumerative combinatorics]] and who works as a senior researcher for the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS) at the computer science department (LaBRI) of the [[University of Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{citation|title=Curriculum vitae: Mireille Bousquet-Mélou|url=http://www.labri.fr/Perso/~bousquet/cv-en.pdf|accessdate=2015-11-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Bousquet-Mélou was born in [[Albi]], the second daughter of two high school teachers, and grew up in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] where her family moved when she was three.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{citation|title=The Art of Counting – Interview with Mireille Bousquet-Mélou|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2017-12-106.pdf|pages=17–20|first=Juanjo|last=Rué|journal=Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society|volume=106|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris from 1986 to 1990,&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; as the only woman in her entering class of mathematicians,&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; and earned an [[agrégation]] in mathematics in 1989,&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; with Xavier Gérard Viennot as her mentor in combinatorics.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Bordeaux in 1991, with a dissertation on the enumeration of [[Orthogonal convex hull|orthogonally convex]] [[polyomino]]s supervised by Viennot.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=177799}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined CNRS as a junior researcher in 1990, and completed a [[habilitation]] at Bordeaux in 1996.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Bousquet-Mélou won the bronze medal of the CNRS in 1993, and the silver medal in 2014. [[Linköping University]] gave her an honorary doctorate in 2005, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] gave her their Charles-Louis de Saulces de Freycinet Prize in 2009.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; In 2006, she was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in the section on combinatorics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByLastname.php|title=ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers since 1897|publisher=[[International Mathematical Union]]|accessdate=2015-11-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Her presentation at the congress concerned connections between enumerative combinatorics, [[formal language]] theory, and the algebraic structure of [[generating function]]s, according to which enumeration problems whose generating functions are [[rational function]]s are often isomorphic to [[regular language]]s, and problems whose generating functions are algebraic are often isomorphic to unambiguous [[context-free language]]s.

{{Functions}}
[[File:Multivalued function.svg|frame|right|This diagram does not represent a "true" [[function (mathematics)|function]], because the element 3 in ''X'' is associated with two elements, ''b'' and ''c'', in ''Y''.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''multivalued function'''{{efn|Short form: '''multifunction'''; other names: '''many-valued function''', '''set-valued function''', '''set-valued map''', '''point-to-set map''', '''multi-valued map''', '''multimap''', '''correspondence''', '''carrier'''}} from a [[domain of a function|domain]] {{mvar|X}} to a [[codomain]] {{mvar|Y}} is a [[heterogeneous relation]]. However, in some contexts such as the [[complex plane]] (''X'' = ''Y'' = ℂ), authors prefer to mimic function theory as they extend concepts of the ordinary (single-valued) functions.

In this context, an ordinary [[function (mathematics)|function]] is often called a '''single-valued function''' to avoid confusion.

The term ''multivalued function'' originated in [[complex analysis]], from [[analytic continuation]]. It often occurs that one knows the value of a complex [[analytic function]] &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; in some [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] of a point &lt;math&gt;z=a&lt;/math&gt;. This is the case for functions defined by the [[implicit function theorem]] or by a [[Taylor series]] around &lt;math&gt;z=a&lt;/math&gt;. In such a situation, one may extend the domain of the single-valued function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; along curves in the complex plane starting at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. In doing so, one finds that the value of the extended function at a point &lt;math&gt;z=b&lt;/math&gt; depends on the chosen curve from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;; since none of the new values is more natural than the others, all of them are incorporated into a multivalued function. For example, let &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sqrt{z}\,&lt;/math&gt; be the usual [[square root]] function  on positive real numbers. One may extend its domain to a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;z=1&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane, and then further along curves starting at &lt;math&gt;z=1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the values along a given curve vary continuously from &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Extending  to negative real numbers, one gets two opposite values of the square root such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=\pm i&lt;/math&gt;, depending on whether the domain has been extended through the upper or the lower half of the complex plane. This phenomenon is very frequent, occurring for [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]], [[logarithm]]s and [[inverse trigonometric function]]s.

To define a single-valued function from a complex multivalued function, one may distinguish one of the multiple values as the [[principal value]], producing a single-valued function on the whole plane which is discontinuous along certain boundary curves. Alternatively, dealing with the multivalued function allows having something that is everywhere continuous, at the cost of possible value changes when one follows a closed path ([[monodromy]]). These problems are resolved in the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s: to consider a multivalued function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; as an ordinary function without discarding any values, one multiplies the domain into a many-layered [[Branched covering|covering space]], a [[manifold]] which is the Riemann surface associated to &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
*Every [[real number|real]] number greater than zero has two real [[square root]]s, so that square root may be considered a multivalued function. For example, we may write &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4}=\pm 2=\{2,-2\}&lt;/math&gt;; although zero has only one square root, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{0}=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Each nonzero [[complex number]] has two square roots, three [[cube root]]s, and in general ''n'' [[nth root|''n''th roots]]. The only ''n''th root of 0 is 0.
*The [[complex logarithm]] function is multiple-valued. The values assumed by &lt;math&gt;\log(a+bi)&lt;/math&gt; for real numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\log{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} + i\arg (a+bi) + 2 \pi n i&lt;/math&gt; for all [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Inverse trigonometric function]]s are multiple-valued because trigonometric functions are periodic. We have
::&lt;math&gt;
\tan\left({\textstyle\frac{\pi}{4}}\right) = \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{5\pi}{4}}\right)
= \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{-3\pi}{4}}\right) = \tan\left({\textstyle\frac{(2n+1)\pi}{4}}\right) = \cdots = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;
:As a consequence, arctan(1) is intuitively related to several values: {{pi}}/4, 5{{pi}}/4, &amp;minus;3{{pi}}/4, and so on. We can treat arctan as a single-valued function by restricting the domain of tan ''x'' to {{nowrap|&amp;minus;{{pi}}/2 &lt; ''x'' &lt; {{pi}}/2}} – a domain over which tan ''x'' is monotonically increasing. Thus, the range of arctan(''x'') becomes {{nowrap|&amp;minus;{{pi}}/2 &lt; ''y'' &lt; {{pi}}/2}}. These values from a restricted domain are called ''[[principal value]]s''.
* The [[indefinite integral]] can be considered as a multivalued function. The indefinite integral of a function is the set of functions whose derivative is that function. The [[constant of integration]] follows from the fact that the derivative of a constant function is 0.
* The [[argmax]] is multivalued, for example &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{argmax}_{x\in \mathbb{R}}  \cos(x) = \{2 \pi k\; |\; k \in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt;

These are all examples of multivalued functions that come about from non-[[injective]] functions. Since the original functions do not preserve all the information of their inputs, they are not reversible. Often, the restriction of a multivalued function is a [[partial inverse]] of the original function.

Multivalued functions of a complex variable have [[branch point]]s. For example, for the ''n''th root and logarithm functions, 0 is a branch point; for the arctangent function, the imaginary units ''i'' and &amp;minus;''i'' are branch points. Using the branch points, these functions may be redefined to be single-valued functions, by restricting the range. A suitable interval may be found through use of a [[branch cut]], a kind of curve that connects pairs of branch points, thus reducing the multilayered [[Riemann surface]] of the function to a single layer. As in the case with real functions, the restricted range may be called the ''principal branch'' of the function.

==Set-valued analysis==

'''Set-valued analysis''' is the study of sets in the spirit of [[mathematical analysis]] and [[general topology]].

Instead of considering collections of only points, set-valued analysis considers collections of sets. If a collection of sets is endowed with a topology, or inherits an appropriate topology from an underlying topological space, then the convergence of sets can be studied.

Much of set-valued analysis arose through the study of [[mathematical economics]] and [[optimal control]], partly as a generalization of [[convex analysis]]; the term "[[variational analysis]]" is used by authors such as [[R. T. Rockafellar]] and [[Roger Wets]], [[Jon Borwein]] and [[Adrian Lewis]],  and [[Boris Mordukhovich]]. In optimization theory, the convergence of approximating [[subdifferential]]s to a subdifferential is important in understanding necessary or sufficient conditions for any minimizing point.

There exist set-valued extensions of the following concepts from point-valued analysis:  [[continuous (mathematics)|continuity]], [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]], [[integral|integration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Aumann |authorlink=Robert Aumann |title=Integrals of Set-Valued Functions |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=1965 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1016/0022-247X(65)90049-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[implicit function theorem]], [[contraction mapping]]s, [[measure theory]], [[fixed-point theorem]]s,&lt;ref name="kakutani"&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Kakutani |first=Shizuo |authorlink=Shizuo Kakutani |title=A generalization of Brouwer’s fixed point theorem |journal=[[Duke Mathematical Journal]] |volume=8 |pages=457–459 |issue=3 |year=1941 |doi=10.1215/S0012-7094-41-00838-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and [[topological degree theory]].

[[Equation]]s are  generalized to [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusions]].

==Types of multivalued functions==

One can differentiate many continuity concepts, primarily closed graph property and [[Hemicontinuity|upper and lower hemicontinuity]]. (One should be warned that often the terms upper and lower semicontinuous are used instead of upper and lower hemicontinuous reserved for the case of weak topology in domain; yet we arrive at the collision with the reserved names for [[Semicontinuity|upper and lower semicontinuous]] real-valued function). There exist also various definitions for measurability of multifunction.

==History==

The practice of allowing ''function'' in mathematics to mean also ''multivalued function'' dropped out of usage at some point in the first half of the twentieth century. Some evolution can be seen in different editions of ''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics]]'' by [[G. H. Hardy]], for example. It probably persisted longest in the theory of [[special function]]s, for its occasional convenience.

The theory of multivalued functions was fairly systematically developed for the first time 
in [[Claude Berge]]'s ''Topological spaces'' (1963).

==Applications==

Multifunctions arise in [[Optimal control|optimal control theory]], especially [[differential inclusion]]s and related subjects as [[game theory]], where the [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]] for multifunctions has been applied to prove existence of [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] (note: in the context of game theory, a multivalued function is usually referred to as a [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]].) This among many other properties loosely associated with approximability of upper hemicontinuous multifunctions via continuous functions explains why upper hemicontinuity is more preferred than lower hemicontinuity.

Nevertheless, lower semicontinuous multifunctions usually possess continuous selections as stated in the [[Michael selection theorem]], which provides another characterisation of [[paracompact]] spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ernest Michael | authorlink=Ernest Michael | title=Continuous Selections. I | journal=Annals of Mathematics |series=Second Series | volume=63 | number=2 | pages=361&amp;mdash;382 | url=http://www.renyi.hu/~descript/papers/Michael_1.pdf | date=Mar 1956 | doi=10.2307/1969615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Dušan Repovš |author1link=Dušan Repovš|author2= P.V.

In physics, multivalued functions play an increasingly  important role. They form the mathematical basis for [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]'s [[magnetic monopole]]s, for the theory  of [[Crystallographic defect|defect]]s in crystals and the resulting [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of materials, for [[vortex|vortices]] in [[superfluid]]s and [[superconductor]]s, and for [[phase transition]]s in these systems, for instance [[melting]] and [[quark confinement]]. They are the origin of [[gauge field]] structures in many branches of physics.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the paragraph|date=July 2013}}

'''[[Music theory]]''' has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern [[mathematics]], yet the basis of musical [[sound]] can be described mathematically (in [[acoustics]]) and exhibits "a remarkable array of number properties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Smith Brindle]], ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, pp 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elements of music]] such as its [[Musical form|form]], [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (music)|metre]], the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of its [[Musical note|notes]] and the [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of its [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] can be related to the [[Chronometry|measurement of time]] and [[frequency]], offering ready [[Analogical models|analogies]] in [[geometry]].   

The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, Chapter 6 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric - Math and Music: Harmonious Connections |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED388615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, p 42&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]])&lt;ref name="purwins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Profiles of Pitch Classes Circularity of Relative Pitch and Key-Experiments, Models, Computational Music Analysis, and Perspectives|pages=22-24|year=2005|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~purwins/purwinsPhD.pdf|last1=Purwins | first1=Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Plato (trans. Desmond Lee) ''The Republic'', Harmondsworth Penguin 1974, page 340, note.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that "all nature consists of [[harmony]] arising out of numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Plato]], harmony was considered a fundamental branch of [[physics]], now known as [[musical acoustics]]. Early [[Indian music scale|Indian]] and [[Chinese musicology|Chinese]] theorists show similar approaches: all sought to show that the mathematical laws of [[harmonic]]s and [[rhythm]]s were fundamental not only to our understanding of the world but to human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou, ''Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales'', Mushiram Manoharlal 1999, Chapter 1 ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]], like Pythagoras, regarded the small numbers 1,2,3,4 as the source of all perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time, rhythm and meter==

Without the boundaries of rhythmic structure – a fundamental equal and regular arrangement of [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] [[Repetition (music)|repetition]], [[Beat (music)|accent]], [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] and duration – music would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Whittall, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP, 2002, Article: ''Rhythm''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern musical use of terms like [[Meter (music)|meter]] and [[bar (music)|measure]] also reflects the historical importance of music, along with astronomy, in the development of counting, arithmetic and the exact measurement of time and [[Frequency|periodicity]] that is fundamental to physics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The elements of musical form often build strict proportions or hypermetric structures (powers of the numbers 2 and 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Виноград, Многообразие проявлений музыкального метра (LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2013)|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/%D0%9C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0/isbn/978-3-659-48005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical form==
{{Main|Musical form}}
Musical form is the plan by which a short piece of music is extended. The term "plan" is also used in architecture, to which musical form is often compared. Like the architect, the composer must take into account the function for which the work is intended and the means available, practicing economy and making use of repetition and order.&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Holst, ''The ABC of Music'', Oxford 1963, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The common types of form known as [[Binary form|binary]] and [[Ternary form|ternary]] ("twofold" and "threefold") once again demonstrate the importance of small integral values to the intelligibility and appeal of music.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Frequency and harmony==
[[Image:Chladini.Diagrams.for.Quadratic.Plates.svg|thumb|220px|Chladni figures produced by sound vibrations in fine powder on a square plate. ([[Ernst Chladni]], ''Acoustics'', 1802)]]
A [[musical scale]] is a discrete set of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es used in making or describing music. The most important scale in the Western tradition is the [[diatonic scale]] but many others have been used and proposed in various historical eras and parts of the world. Each pitch corresponds to a particular frequency, expressed in hertz (Hz), sometimes referred to as cycles per second (c.p.s.). A scale has an interval of repetition, normally the [[octave]]. The [[octave]] of any pitch refers to a frequency exactly twice that of the given pitch.

Succeeding superoctaves are pitches found at frequencies four, eight, sixteen times, and so on, of the fundamental frequency. Pitches at frequencies of half, a quarter, an eighth and so on of the fundamental are called suboctaves. There is no case in musical harmony where, if a given pitch be considered accordant, that its octaves are considered otherwise. Therefore, any note and its octaves will generally be found similarly named in musical systems (e.g. all will be called '''doh''' or '''A''' or '''Sa''', as the case may be).

When expressed as a frequency bandwidth an octave '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' spans from 110&amp;nbsp;Hz to 220&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=110&amp;nbsp;Hz). The next octave will span from 220&amp;nbsp;Hz to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=220&amp;nbsp;Hz). The third octave spans from 440&amp;nbsp;Hz to 880&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=440&amp;nbsp;Hz) and so on. Each successive octave spans twice the frequency range of the previous octave.

[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.svg|thumb|500px|center|The exponential nature of octaves when measured on a linear frequency scale.]]
[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.Ears.svg|thumb|500px|center|This diagram presents octaves as they appear in the sense of musical intervals, equally spaced.]]

Because we are often interested in the relations or [[ratio]]s between the pitches (known as [[Interval (music)|intervals]]) rather than the precise pitches themselves in describing a scale, it is usual to refer to all the scale pitches in terms of their ratio from a particular pitch, which is given the value of one (often written '''1/1'''), generally a note which functions as the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the scale. For interval size comparison, [[cent (music)|cent]]s are often used.

==Tuning systems==
{{Main|Musical tuning|Musical temperament}}

There are two main families of tuning systems: [[equal temperament]] and [[just tuning]]. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], which results in perfectly evenly divided scales, but with ratios of frequencies which are [[irrational number]]s. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by [[rational number]]s, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.

One major difference between equal temperament tunings and just tunings is differences in [[Beat (acoustics)|acoustical beat]] when two notes are sounded together, which affects the subjective experience of [[consonance and dissonance]]. Both of these systems, and the vast majority of music in general, have scales that repeat on the interval of every [[octave]], which is defined as frequency ratio of 2:1. In other words, every time the frequency is doubled, the given scale repeats.

Below are [[Ogg Vorbis]] files demonstrating the difference between just intonation and equal temperament. You may need to play the samples several times before you can pick the difference.
*[[Media:Comparison 550Hz - 554Hz.ogg|Two sine waves played consecutively]] – this sample has half-step at 550&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale), followed by a half-step at 554.37&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the equal temperament scale).
*[[Media:Major third comparison.ogg|Same two notes, set against an A440 pedal]] – this sample consists of a "[[Dyad (music)|dyad]]". The lower note is a constant A (440&amp;nbsp;Hz in either scale), the upper note is a C{{music|#}} in the equal-tempered scale for the first 1", and a C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale for the last 1". [[Beat (acoustics)|Phase]] differences make it easier to pick the transition than in the previous sample.

===Just tunings===
[[5-limit tuning]], the most common form of [[just intonation]], is a system of tuning using tones that are [[regular number]] [[harmonic]]s of a single [[fundamental frequency]]. This was one of the scales [[Johannes Kepler]] presented in his [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619) in connection with planetary motion. The same scale was given in transposed form by Scottish mathematician and musical theorist, Alexander Malcolm, in 1721 in his 'Treatise of Musick: Speculative, Practical and Historical',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseofmusick00malc|title=A treatise of musick, speculative, practical and historical|first1=Alexander|last1=Malcolm|first2=Mr (Joseph)|last2=Mitchell|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed for the author|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by theorist [[Jose Wuerschmidt]] in the 20th century. A form of it is used in the music of northern India.

American composer [[Terry Riley]] also made use of the inverted form of it in his "Harp of New Albion". Just intonation gives superior results when there is little or no [[chord progression]]: voices and other instruments gravitate to just intonation whenever possible. However, it gives two different whole tone intervals (9:8 and 10:9) because a fixed tuned instrument, such as a piano, cannot change key.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Montagu, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 2002, Article: ''just intonation''.&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate the frequency of a note in a scale given in terms of ratios, the frequency ratio is multiplied by the tonic frequency. For instance, with a tonic of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (A natural above middle C), the frequency is 440&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], and a justly tuned fifth above it (E5) is simply 440×(3:2) = 660&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Pythagorean tuning]] is tuning based only on the perfect consonances, the (perfect) octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. Thus the major third is considered not a third but a ditone, literally "two tones", and is (9:8)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 81:64, rather than the independent and harmonic just 5:4 = 80:64 directly below. A whole tone is a secondary interval, being derived from two perfect fifths, (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9:8.

The just major third, 5:4 and minor third, 6:5, are a [[syntonic comma]], 81:80, apart from their Pythagorean equivalents 81:64 and 32:27 respectively. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus|Carl]] {{harvtxt|Dahlhaus|1990|p=187}}, "the dependent third conforms to the Pythagorean, the independent third to the harmonic tuning of intervals."

Western [[common practice period|common practice music]] usually cannot be played in just intonation but requires a systematically tempered scale. The tempering can involve either the irregularities of [[well temperament]] or be constructed as a [[regular tuning and temperament|regular temperament]], either some form of [[equal temperament]] or some other regular meantone, but in all cases will involve the fundamental features of [[meantone temperament]]. For example, the root of chord '''ii''', if tuned to a fifth above the dominant, would be a major whole tone (9:8) above the tonic. If tuned a just minor third (6:5) below a just subdominant degree of 4:3, however, the interval from the tonic would equal a minor whole tone (10:9). Meantone temperament reduces the difference between 9:8 and 10:9. Their ratio, (9:8)/(10:9) = 81:80, is treated as a unison. The interval 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]] or comma of Didymus, is the key comma of meantone temperament.

===Equal temperament tunings===
In [[equal temperament]], the octave is divided into equal parts on the logarithmic scale. While it is possible to construct equal temperament scale with any number of notes (for example, the 24-tone [[Arab tone system]]), the most common number is 12, which makes up the equal-temperament [[chromatic scale]]. In western music, a division into twelve intervals is commonly assumed unless it is specified otherwise.

For the chromatic scale, the octave is divided into twelve equal parts, each semitone (half-step) is an interval of the [[twelfth root of two]] so that twelve of these equal half steps add up to exactly an octave. With fretted instruments it is very useful to use equal temperament so that the frets align evenly across the strings. In the European music tradition, equal temperament was used for lute and guitar music far earlier than for other instruments, such as [[musical keyboard]]s. Because of this historical force, twelve-tone equal temperament is now the dominant intonation system in the Western, and much of the non-Western, world.

Equally tempered scales have been used and instruments built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The [[19 equal temperament]], first proposed and used by [[Guillaume Costeley]] in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament at the cost of a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. [[Quarter tone|Twenty-four equal temperament]], with twenty-four equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and [[Arabic maqam#Notation|notation]] of [[Arabic music]]. However, in theory and practice, the intonation of Arabic music conforms to [[Rational number|rational ratios]], as opposed to the [[Irrational number|irrational ratios]] of equally tempered systems.&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Touma|first=Habib Hassan|title=The Music of the Arabs|year=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-931340-88-8|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While any analog to the equally tempered [[quarter tone]] is entirely absent from Arabic intonation systems, analogs to a three-quarter tone, or [[neutral second]], frequently occur. These neutral seconds, however, vary slightly in their ratios dependent on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]], as well as geography. Indeed, Arabic music historian [[Habib Hassan Touma]] has written that "the breadth of deviation of this musical step is a crucial ingredient in the peculiar flavor of Arabian music. To temper the scale by dividing the octave into twenty-four quarter-tones of equal size would be to surrender one of the most characteristic elements of this musical culture."&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"/&gt;

==Connections to mathematics==
===Set theory===
{{Main|Set theory (music)}}
Musical set theory uses the language of mathematical [[set theory]] in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set.

===Abstract algebra===
{{Main|Abstract algebra}}
Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Algebra of Tonal Functions. |url=http://sonantometry.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonic Limit|url=https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Harmonic+Limit||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transformational theory]] is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]]. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.

Theorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a [[Grassmannian]].

The [[chromatic scale]] has a free and transitive action of the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, with the action being defined via [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a [[torsor]] for the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Real and complex analysis===
Real and complex analysis have also been made use of, for instance by applying the theory of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to the study of equal divisions of the octave.[https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Riemann+Zeta+Function+and+Tuning]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9884">The '''Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem''' is an important result in [[mechanism design]] and the economics of [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]], due to [[Roger Myerson]] and [[Mark Satterthwaite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Myerson |first=Roger B. |authorlink=Roger B. Myerson |author2=Mark A. Satterthwaite |year=1983 |title=Efficient Mechanisms for Bilateral Trading |journal=Journal of Economic Theory |volume=29 |issue= 2|pages=265–281 |id= |url= |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, the result says that there is no efficient way for two parties to trade a good when they each have secret and probabilistically varying valuations for it, without the risk of forcing one party to trade at a loss.

The Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem is among the most remarkable and universally applicable negative results in economics—a kind of negative mirror to the [[fundamental theorems of welfare economics]].  It is, however, much less famous than those results or [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's earlier result on the impossibility of satisfactory electoral systems]].

== Notation ==
There are two agents: Sally (the seller) and Bob (the buyer). Sally holds an item that is valuable for both her and Bob. Each agent values the item differently: Bob values it as &lt;math&gt;v_B&lt;/math&gt; and Sally as &lt;math&gt;v_S&lt;/math&gt;. Each agent knows his/her own valuation with certainty, but knows the valuation of the other agent only probabilistically:
* For Sally, the value of Bob is represented by a [[probability density]] function &lt;math&gt;f_B&lt;/math&gt; which is positive in the range &lt;math&gt;[\underline{B},\overline{B}]&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding cumulative density function is &lt;math&gt;F_B&lt;/math&gt;.
* For Bob, the value of Sally is represented by a probability density function &lt;math&gt;f_S&lt;/math&gt; which is positive in the range &lt;math&gt;[\underline{S},\overline{S}]&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding cumulative density function is &lt;math&gt;F_S&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''direct bargaining mechanism'' is a mechanism which asks each agent to report his/her valuation of the item, then decides whether the item will be traded and at what price. Formally, it is represented by two functions:
* The ''trade-probability'' function, &lt;math&gt;t(v'_B,v'_S)&lt;/math&gt;, determines the probability that the item will be transferred from the seller to the buyer (in a deterministic mechanism, this probability is either 0 or 1, but the formalism also allows random mechanisms).
* The ''price'' function, &lt;math&gt;p(v'_B,v'_S)&lt;/math&gt;, determines the price that Bob should pay to Sally. Note that the reported values are marked by &lt;math&gt;v'&lt;/math&gt; since they do not equal the real values.
Note that, thanks to the [[revelation principle]], the assumption that the mechanism is direct does not lose generality.

Every agent knows his value and knows the mechanism. Hence, every agent can calculate his expected gain from the trade. Since we are interested in mechanisms which are truthful in equilibrium, we assume that each agent assumes that the other agent is truthful. Hence:
* For Sally, the expected gain is the expected payment minus the expected loss from giving the object: &lt;math&gt;U_S(v_S,v'_S) = \int_{u_B=\underline{B}}^{\overline{B}}{p(v'_S,u_B)f_B(u_B)du_B} - v_S \int_{u_B=\underline{B}}^{\overline{B}}{t(v'_S,u_B)f_B(u_B)du_B}&lt;/math&gt;
* For Bob, the expected gain is the expected gain from getting the object minus the expected payment: &lt;math&gt;U_B(v_B,v'_B) = v_B \int_{u_S=\underline{S}}^{\overline{S}}{t(u_S,v'_B)f_S(u_S)du_S} - \int_{u_S=\underline{S}}^{\overline{S}}{p(u_S,v'_B)f_S(u_S)du_S}&lt;/math&gt;

== Requirements ==
Myerson and Satterthwaite study the following requirements that an ideal mechanism should satisfy (see also [[Double auction#requirements]]):

1. '''ex-ante [[Individual Rationality]]''' (IR): The expected value of both Bob and Sally should be non-negative (so that they have an initial incentive to participate). Formally: &lt;math&gt;U_S(v_S,v_S)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_B(v_B,v_B)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

2. '''Weak Balanced Budget''' (WBB): The auctioneer should not have to bring money from home in order to subsidize the trade.

3. '''[[Nash equilibrium]] [[Incentive compatibility]]''' (NEIC): for every agent, if the other agent reports the true value, then the best response is to report the true value too. Formally: &lt;math&gt;\forall v'_s: U_S(v_S,v_S)\geq U_S(v_S,v'_S)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall v'_B: U_B(v_B,v_B)\geq U_B(v_B,v'_B)&lt;/math&gt;.

4. '''ex-post [[Pareto efficiency]]''' (PE): the item should be finally given to the agent who values it the most. Formally: &lt;math&gt;t(v_B,v_S)=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;v_B&gt;v_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t(v_B,v_S)=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;v_B&lt;v_S&lt;/math&gt;.

== Statement ==
If the following two assumptions are true:
* The intervals &lt;math&gt;[\underline{B},\overline{B}]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[\underline{S},\overline{S}]&lt;/math&gt; have a non-empty intersection.
* The [[probability density function|probability densities]] for the valuations are strictly positive on those intervals.

then, there is no mechanism which satisfies the four properties mentioned above (IR, WBB, NEIC and PE).

== Extensions ==
Various variants of the Myerson–Satterthwaite setting have been studied.

1. Myerson and Satterthwaite considered a single buyer and a single seller. When there are many buyers and sellers, the inefficiency asymptotically disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Convergence to Efficiency in a Simple Market with Incomplete Information|jstor = 2951506|journal = Econometrica|volume = 62|issue = 5|doi = 10.2307/2951506|first = Aldo|last = Rustichini|first2 = Mark A.|last2 = Satterthwaite|first3 = Steven R.|last3 = Williams|date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this is only true in the case of private goods; in the case of public goods the inefficiency is aggravated when the number of agents becomes large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pollution claim settlements under private information |journal = Journal of Economic Theory|date = 1989|pages = 307–333|volume = 47|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|first = Rafael|last = Rob |authorlink=Rafael Robb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Asymmetric Information Bargaining Problems with Many Agents|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/351|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1990|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 351–367|volume = 57|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/2298018|first = George J.|last = Mailath|first2 = Andrew|last2 = Postlewaite}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

2. Myerson and Satterthwaite considered an asymmetric initial situation, in the sense that at the outset one party has 100% of the good and the other party has 0% of the good. It has been shown that ex post efficiency can be attained if initially both parties own 50% of the good to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dissolving a Partnership Efficiently|jstor = 1913602|journal = Econometrica|volume = 55|issue = 3|doi = 10.2307/1913602|first = Peter|last = Cramton|first2 = Robert|last2 = Gibbons|first3 = Paul|last3 = Klemperer|date = 1987|citeseerx = 10.1.1.456.4564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A simple status quo that ensures participation (with application to efficient bargaining)|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/TE591/abstract|journal = Theoretical Economics|date = 2011|issn = 1555-7561|pages = 109–125|volume = 6|issue = 1|doi = 10.3982/TE591|first = Ilya|last = Segal|first2 = Michael D.|last2 = Whinston}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

3. The latter result has been extended to settings in which the parties can make unobservable ex ante investments in order to increase their own valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Simple contracts, renegotiation under asymmetric information, and the hold-up problem|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292101000885|journal = European Economic Review|date = 2002|pages = 169–188|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00088-5|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Contractual Solutions to the Hold-Up Problem|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/4/777|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1992|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 777–793|volume = 59|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2297997|first = William P.|last = Rogerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, ex post efficiency cannot be achieved if the seller's unobservable investment increases the buyer's valuation, even if only the buyer has private information about his or her valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Interplay of Hidden Action and Hidden Information in Simple Bilateral Trading Problems|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053101927905|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|date = 2002|pages = 444–460|volume = 103|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/jeth.2001.2790|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Subgame-Perfect Implementation Under Information Perturbations*|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/127/4/1843|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 2012|issn = 0033-5533|pages = |volume = 127|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/qje/qjs026|first = Philippe|last = Aghion|first2 = Drew|last2 = Fudenberg|first3 = Richard|last3 = Holden|first4 = Takashi|last4 = Kunimoto|first5 = Olivier|last5 = Tercieux|at = Section V}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

4. Another impossibility result where only one party has private information about its valuation can be shown to hold when the outside option payoffs are not exogenously given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decentralization, Externalities, and Efficiency|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/2/223|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1995|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 223–247|volume = 62|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/2297803|first = Peter|last = Klibanoff|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Morduch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3873">'''Numa Edward Hartog''' (May 20, 1846 &amp;ndash; June 19, 1871) was a [[Jewish]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] who attracted attention in 1869 for graduating from [[Cambridge University]] as [[Senior Wrangler]] and [[Smith's Prize|Smith's Prizeman]] but as a Jew had not been admitted to a fellowship. Hartog's case led to the passage of the [[Universities Tests Act 1871|Universities Tests Act]] of 1871, which removed religious barriers to holding fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge.

==Biography==

Hartog was born in London on 20 May 1846 to Alfonse Hartog and Marion Moss. He was the elder brother of [[Héléna Arsène Darmesteter|Héléna]], [[Marcus Hartog|Marcus]], and [[Philip Hartog]], and the cousin of [[Henri Bergson]].

In his earlier academic career, he attended [[University College School]] in [[London]], and then [[University College London]].  At Cambridge, he attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. He was a trailblazing figure in overcoming religious obstacles to academic achievement in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].  For example, when his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] was awarded, the words ''In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti'' were omitted.

Within weeks, [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|John Coleridge]] of the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] government introduced legislation to rectify the situation.

In [[mathematics]] -- and in particular the study of games on the unit square -- '''Parthasarathy's theorem''' is a generalization of [[Minimax theorem|Von Neumann's minimax theorem]].  It states that a particular class of games has a mixed value, provided that at least one of the players has a [[strategy]] that is restricted to absolutely continuous distributions with respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]] (in other words, one of the players is forbidden to use a [[pure strategy]]).

The theorem is attributed to the [[Indian mathematician]] [[Thiruvenkatachari Parthasarathy]].

==Theorem==
Let  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; stand for the [[unit interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M_X&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of [[probability distribution]]s on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M_Y&lt;/math&gt; defined similarly); and &lt;math&gt;A_X&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of [[absolutely continuous]] distributions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;A_Y&lt;/math&gt; defined similarly).

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;k(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on the unit square &lt;math&gt;X \times Y = \{(x,y)  :  0\leq x,y\leq 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;k(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function|continuous]] except possibly on a [[Wikt:finite|finite]] number of curves of the form &lt;math&gt;y=\phi_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;) where the &lt;math&gt;\phi_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions. For &lt;math&gt; \mu \in M_X, \lambda \in M_Y&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;
k(\mu,\lambda)=\int_{y=0}^1\int_{x=0}^1 k(x,y)\,d\mu(x)\,d\lambda(y)=
\int_{x=0}^1\int_{y=0}^1 k(x,y)\,d\lambda(y)\,d\mu(x).
&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{\mu\in{\mathcal M}_X}\,\inf_{\lambda\in A_Y}k(\mu,\lambda)=
\inf_{\lambda\in A_Y}\,\max_{\mu\in{\mathcal M}_X} k(\mu,\lambda).
&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the statement that the game induced by &lt;math&gt;k(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; has a value.  Note that one player ([[without loss of generality|WLOG]] &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) is forbidden from using a pure strategy.

Parthasarathy goes on to exhibit a game in which

:&lt;math&gt;
\max_{\mu\in{\mathcal M}_X}\,\inf_{\lambda\in{\mathcal M}_Y}k(\mu,\lambda)\neq
\inf_{\lambda\in{\mathcal M}_Y}\,\max_{\mu\in{\mathcal M}_X} k(\mu,\lambda)
&lt;/math&gt;

which thus has no value.  There is no contradiction because in this case neither player is restricted to absolutely continuous distributions (and the demonstration that the game has no value requires both players to use pure strategies).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10958">In [[complex analysis]], the '''Phragmén–Lindelöf principle''' (or '''method'''), first formulated by [[Lars Edvard Phragmén]] (1863–1937) and [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]] (1870-1946) in 1908, is a technique which employs an auxiliary, parameterized function to prove the boundedness of a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (i.e, &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;M\ \ (z\in \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;) on an unbounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; when an additional (usually mild) condition constraining the growth of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is given.  It is a generalization of the [[maximum modulus principle]], which is only applicable to bounded domains.

==Background==

In the theory of complex functions, it is known that the [[Absolute value|modulus]] (absolute value) of a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] (complex differentiable) function in the interior of a ''[[Bounded set|'''bounded''']]'' region is bounded by its modulus on the boundary of the region.  More precisely, if a non-constant function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in a bounded region&lt;ref&gt;The term ''region'' is not uniformly employed in the literature; here, a ''region'' is taken to mean a nonempty connected open subset of the complex plane.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and [[continuous function|continuous]] on its closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}=\Omega\cup\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|f(z_0)|&lt;\sup_{z\in \partial \Omega} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z_0\in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as the ''maximum modulus principle.'' (In fact, since &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is compact and &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, there actually exists some &lt;math&gt;w_0\in\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|f(w_0)|=\sup_{z\in \partial \Omega} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.)  The maximum modulus principle is generally used to conclude that a holomorphic function is bounded in a region after showing that it is bounded on its boundary.

However, the maximum modulus principle cannot be applied to an unbounded region of the complex plane.  As a concrete example, let us examine the behavior of the holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \exp(\exp(z))&lt;/math&gt; in the unbounded strip

:&lt;math&gt;S = \Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Although &lt;math&gt;|f(x\pm \pi i/2)|=1&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; grows rapidly without bound when &lt;math&gt;|z|\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; along the positive real axis.  The difficulty here stems from the extremely fast growth of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; along the positive real axis.  If the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to not be "too fast," as specified by an appropriate growth condition, the ''Phragmén–Lindelöf principle'' can be applied to show that boundedness of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the region's boundary implies that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in fact bounded in the whole region, effectively extending the maximum modulus principle to unbounded regions.

''The technique:'' Suppose we are given a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and an unbounded region &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  In a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument, we introduce a certain multiplicative factor &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} h_\epsilon= 1&lt;/math&gt; to "subdue" the growth of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|&lt;M&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary of a bounded subregion &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}\subset S&lt;/math&gt;. This allows us to apply the maximum modulus principle to &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and conclude that it is bounded on &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then argue that the subregion could be expanded so as to encompass all points in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, establishing the boundedness of &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, we let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon\to f&lt;/math&gt; in order to conclude that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must also be bounded on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

In the literature of complex analysis, there are many examples of the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle applied to unbounded regions of differing types, and also a version of this principle may be applied in a similar fashion to [[subharmonic function|subharmonic]] and superharmonic functions.

== Example of application ==
To continue the example above, we can impose a growth condition on a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that prevents it from "blowing up" and allows the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle to be applied.   To this end, we now include the condition that 

:&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;\exp\big(A\exp(c\cdot|\Re(z)|)\big)&lt;/math&gt;

for some real constants &lt;math&gt;c&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  It can then be shown that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; in fact holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, we have the following proposition:

'''Proposition.''' ''Let'' 

:'''''&lt;math&gt;S=\Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\Big\},\quad \overline{S}=\Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big]\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;'''''.

''Let'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''be holomorphic on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose there exist real constants  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;1,\ A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;'' ''such that''
:'''''&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;\exp\big(A\exp(c\cdot|\Re(z)|)\big)&lt;/math&gt;'''''

''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\overline{S}\setminus S=\partial S&lt;/math&gt;.  Then'' ''&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;'' ''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;''.

Note that this conclusion fails when &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;, precisely as the motivating counterexample in the previous section demonstrates.  The proof of this statement employs a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/RudinW.RealAndComplexAnalysis3e1987|title=Real and Complex Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1987|isbn=0070542341|location=New York|pages=257–259|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sketch of Proof:'' We fix &lt;math&gt;b\in(c,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the auxiliary function &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h_\epsilon(z)=e^{-\epsilon(e^{b z}+e^{-b z})}&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the function &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  The growth properties of &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; allow us to find an &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq1&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;z\in\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\Re(z)|\geq x_0&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the open rectangle in the complex plane defined by the vertices &lt;math&gt;\{x_0\pm i\pi/2,-x_0\pm i\pi/2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Because &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;is a bounded region, the maximum modulus principle implies that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  But since &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily large, this result extends to all of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, since &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon\to 1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;|f|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Tombstone (typography)|&lt;big&gt;□&lt;/big&gt;]]

== Phragmén–Lindelöf principle for a sector in the complex plane ==
A particularly useful statement proved using the Phragmén–Lindelöf  principle bounds holomorphic functions on a sector of the complex plane if it is bounded on its boundary.  This statement can be used to give a complex analytic proof of the [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy's]] [[Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]], which states that a function and its Fourier transform cannot both decay faster than exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/hardys-uncertainty-principle/#more-1716|title=Hardy's Uncertainty Principle|last=Tao|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Tao|date=2009-02-18|website=Updates on my research and expository papers, discussion of open problems, and other maths-related topics. By Terence Tao|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Proposition.'''  ''Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a function that is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in a [[Circular sector|sector]]''

:''&lt;math&gt; S = \left\{ z \, \big| \, \alpha &lt; \arg z &lt; \beta \right\} &lt;/math&gt;''

''of central angle &lt;math&gt;\beta-\alpha=\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and continuous on its boundary. If''

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|F(z)| \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

''for &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S&lt;/math&gt;, and''

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|F(z)| \leq e^{C |z|^\rho}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
 
''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho\in[0,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds also for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.''

===Remarks===
* The condition ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be relaxed to

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{r \to \infty} \sup_{\alpha &lt; \theta &lt; \beta} \frac{\log|F(re^{i\theta})|}{r^\rho} = 0 \quad \text{for some} \quad 0 \leq \rho &lt; \lambda~,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

with the same conclusion.

== Special cases ==
In practice the point 0 is often transformed into the point ∞ of the [[Riemann sphere]]. This gives a version of the principle that applies to strips, for example bounded by two lines of constant [[real part]] in the complex plane. This special case is sometimes known as [[Lindelöf's theorem]].

[[Carlson's theorem]] is an application of the principle to functions bounded on the imaginary axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18903">In [[mathematical logic]], '''predicate functor logic''' ('''PFL''') is one of several ways to express [[first-order logic]] (also known as [[predicate logic]]) by purely algebraic means, i.e., without [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variable]]s. PFL employs a small number of algebraic devices called predicate functors (or predicate modifiers) that operate on terms to yield terms. PFL is mostly the invention of the [[logic]]ian and [[philosopher]] [[Willard Quine]].

==Motivation==
The source for this section, as well as for much of this entry, is Quine (1976). Quine proposed PFL as a way of algebraizing [[first-order logic]] in a manner analogous to how [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] algebraizes [[propositional logic]]. He designed PFL to have exactly the expressive power of [[first-order logic]] with [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]. Hence the [[metamathematics]] of PFL are exactly those of first-order logic with no interpreted predicate letters: both logics are [[consistency proof|sound]], [[Completeness (logic)|complete]], and [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]. Most work Quine published on logic and mathematics in the last 30 years of his life touched on PFL in some way.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

Quine took "functor" from the writings of his friend [[Rudolf Carnap]], the first to employ it in [[philosophy]] and [[mathematical logic]], and defined it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The word ''functor'', grammatical in import but logical in habitat... is a sign that attaches to one or more expressions of given grammatical kind(s) to produce an expression of a given grammatical kind." (Quine 1982: 129)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ways other than PFL to algebraize [[first-order logic]] include:
*[[Cylindric algebra]] by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his American students. The simplified cylindric algebra proposed in Bernays (1959) led Quine to write the paper containing the first use of the phrase "predicate functor";
*The [[polyadic algebra]] of [[Paul Halmos]]. By virtue of its economical primitives and axioms, this algebra most resembles PFL;
*[[Relation algebra]] algebraizes the fragment of [[first-order logic]] consisting of formulas having no atomic formula lying in the scope of more than three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s. That fragment suffices, however, for [[Peano arithmetic]] and the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]]; hence relation algebra, unlike PFL, is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. Most work on relation algebra since about 1920 has been by Tarski and his American students. The power of relation algebra did not become manifest until the monograph Tarski and Givant (1987), published after the three important papers bearing on PFL, namely Bacon (1985), Kuhn (1983), and Quine (1976);
*[[Combinatory logic]] builds on [[combinator]]s, [[higher order function]]s whose [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] is another combinator or function, and whose [[range (mathematics)|range]] is yet another combinator. Hence [[combinatory logic]] goes beyond first-order logic by having the expressive power of [[set theory]], which makes combinatory logic vulnerable to [[paradox]]es. A predicate functor, on the other hand, simply maps predicates (also called [[Term (mathematics)|terms]]) into predicates.
PFL is arguably the simplest of these formalisms, yet also the one about which the least has been written.

Quine had a lifelong fascination with [[combinatory logic]], attested to by his (1976) and his introduction to the translation in Van Heijenoort (1967) of the paper by the Russian logician [[Moses Schönfinkel]] founding combinatory logic. When Quine began working on PFL in earnest, in 1959, combinatory logic was commonly deemed a failure for the following reasons:
* Until [[Dana Scott]] began writing on the [[model theory]] of combinatory logic in the late 1960s, almost only [[Haskell Curry]], his students, and [[Robert Feys]] in Belgium worked on that logic;
*Satisfactory axiomatic formulations of combinatory logic were slow in coming. In the 1930s, some formulations of combinatory logic were found to be [[consistency proof|inconsistent]]. Curry also discovered the [[Curry paradox]], peculiar to combinatory logic;
*The [[lambda calculus]], with the same expressive power as [[combinatory logic]], was seen as a superior formalism.

==Kuhn's formalization==
The PFL [[syntax]], primitives, and axioms described in this section are largely Kuhn's (1983). The [[semantics]] of the functors are Quine's (1982). The rest of this entry incorporates some terminology from Bacon (1985).

===Syntax===
An ''atomic term'' is an upper case Latin letter, ''I'' and ''S'' excepted, followed by a numerical [[superscript]] called its ''degree'', or by concatenated lower case variables, collectively known as an ''argument list''. The degree of a term conveys the same information as the number of variables following a predicate letter. An atomic term of degree 0 denotes a [[Boolean variable]] or a [[truth value]]. The degree of ''I'' is invariably 2 and so is not indicated.

The "combinatory" (the word is Quine's) predicate functors, all monadic and peculiar to PFL, are '''Inv''', '''inv''', '''∃''', '''+''', and '''p'''. A term is either an atomic term, or constructed by the following recursive rule. If τ is a term, then '''Inv'''τ, '''inv'''τ, '''∃'''τ, '''+'''τ, and '''p'''τ are terms. A functor with a superscript ''n'', ''n'' a [[natural number]] &gt; 1, denotes ''n'' consecutive applications (iterations) of that functor.

A formula is either a term or defined by the recursive rule: if α and β are formulas, then αβ and ~(α) are likewise formulas. Hence "~" is another monadic functor, and concatenation is the sole dyadic predicate functor. Quine called these functors "alethic." The natural interpretation of "~" is [[negation]]; that of concatenation is any [[Logical connective|connective]] that, when combined with negation, forms a [[functional completeness|functionally complete]] set of connectives. Quine's preferred functionally complete set was [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[negation]]. Thus concatenated terms are taken as conjoined. The notation '''+''' is Bacon's (1985); all other notation is Quine's (1976; 1982). The alethic part of PFL is identical to the ''Boolean term schemata'' of Quine (1982).

As is well known, the two alethic functors could be replaced by a single dyadic functor with the following [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]: if α and β are formulas, then (αβ) is a formula whose semantics are "not (&amp;alpha; and/or &amp;beta;)" (see [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] and [[Logical NOR|NOR]]).

===Axioms and semantics===
Quine set out neither axiomatization nor proof procedure for PFL. The following axiomatization of PFL, one of two proposed in Kuhn (1983), is concise and easy to describe, but makes extensive use of [[free variable]]s and so does not do full justice to the spirit of PFL. Kuhn gives another axiomatization dispensing with free variables, but that is harder to describe and that makes extensive use of defined functors. Kuhn proved both of his PFL axiomatizations [[consistency proof|sound]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].

This section is built around the primitive predicate functors and a few defined ones. The alethic functors can be axiomatized by any set of axioms for [[sentential logic]] whose primitives are negation and one of ∧ or ∨. Equivalently, all [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of sentential logic can be taken as axioms.

Quine's (1982) semantics for each predicate functor are stated below in terms of [[abstraction]] (set builder notation), followed by either the relevant axiom from Kuhn (1983), or a definition from Quine (1976). The notation &lt;math&gt;\{x_1...x_n : Fx_1...x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of [[n-tuple]]s satisfying the atomic formula &lt;math&gt;Fx_1...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

*''Identity'', ''I'', is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; IFx_1x_2...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_1x_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_2x_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
Identity is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (''Ixx''), [[symmetric]] (''Ixy''→''Iyx''), [[transitive relation|transitive]] ( (''Ixy''∧''Iyz'') → ''Ixz''), and obeys the substitution property:
:&lt;math&gt;(Fx_1...x_n \land Ix_1y) \rightarrow Fyx_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Padding'', '''+''', adds a variable to the left of any argument list.
:&lt;math&gt;\ +F^n =_{def} \{x_0x_1...x_n : F^n x_1...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;+Fx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Cropping'', '''∃''', erases the leftmost variable in any argument list.
:&lt;math&gt; \exist F^n =_{def} \{x_2...x_n : \exist x_1 F^n x_1...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Fx_1...x_n \rightarrow \exist Fx_2...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;

''Cropping'' enables two useful defined functors:
* ''Reflection'', '''S''':
:&lt;math&gt;\ SF^n =_{def} \{x_2...x_n : F^n x_2x_2...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;SF^n \leftrightarrow \exist IF^n.&lt;/math&gt;
'''S''' generalizes the notion of reflexivity to all terms of any finite degree greater than 2. N.B: '''S''' should not be confused with the [[combinatory logic|primitive combinator]] '''S''' of combinatory logic.
*''[[Cartesian product]]'', &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;;
:&lt;math&gt;F^m \times G^n \leftrightarrow F^m \exist^m G^n.&lt;/math&gt; 
Here only, Quine adopted an infix notation, because this infix notation for Cartesian product is very well established in mathematics. Cartesian product allows restating conjunction as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;F^mx_1...x_mG^nx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow (F^m \times G^n)x_1...x_mx_1...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
Reorder the concatenated argument list so as to shift a pair of duplicate variables to the far left, then invoke '''S''' to eliminate the duplication. Repeating this as many times as required results in an argument list of length max(''m'',''n'').

The next three functors enable reordering argument lists at will.  
*''Major inversion'', '''Inv''', rotates the variables in an argument list to the right, so that the last variable becomes the first.
:&lt;math&gt;\ InvF^n =_{def} \{x_1...x_n : F^nx_nx_1...x_{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Inv Fx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_nx_1...x_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Minor inversion'', '''inv''', swaps the first two variables in an argument list.
:&lt;math&gt;\ invF^n =_{def} \{x_1...x_n : F^n x_2x_1...x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; invFx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Fx_2x_1...x_n.&lt;/math&gt;
*''Permutation'', '''p''', rotates the second through last variables in an argument list to the left, so that the second variable becomes the last.
:&lt;math&gt;\ pF^n =_{def} \{x_1...x_n : F^n x_1x_3...x_nx_2\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; pFx_1...x_n \leftrightarrow Inv  inv Fx_1x_3...x_nx_2.&lt;/math&gt;
Given an argument list consisting of ''n'' variables, '''p''' implicitly treats the last ''n''-1 variables like a bicycle chain, with each variable constituting a link in the chain. One application of '''p''' advances the chain by one link. ''k'' consecutive applications of '''p''' to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; moves the ''k''+1 variable to the second argument position in ''F''.

When ''n''=2, '''Inv''' and '''inv''' merely interchange ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''n''=1, they have no effect. Hence '''p''' has no effect when ''n''&lt;3.

Kuhn (1983) takes ''Major inversion'' and ''Minor inversion'' as primitive. The notation '''p''' in Kuhn corresponds to '''inv'''; he has no analog to ''Permutation'' and hence has no axioms for it. If, following Quine (1976), '''p''' is taken as primitive, '''Inv''' and '''inv''' can be defined as nontrivial combinations of '''+''', '''∃''', and iterated '''p'''.

The following table summarizes how the functors affect the degrees of their arguments.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|c}
\textbf{Expression} &amp;
\textbf{Degree} \\
\hline
p;\ Inv;\ inv;\ \lnot;\ I &amp;
\text{no change}
\\

n
\\
\alpha^m\beta^n;\ F^m \times G^n &amp;
\ \max(m,n)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Rules===
All instances of a predicate letter may be replaced by another predicate letter of the same degree, without affecting validity. The [[first-order logic|rules]] are:
* [[Modus ponens]];
* Let α and β be PFL formulas in which &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; does not appear. Then if &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \land Fx_1...x_n) \rightarrow \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a PFL theorem, then &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \land \exist Fx_2...x_n) \rightarrow \beta &lt;/math&gt; is likewise a PFL theorem.

===Some useful results===
Instead of axiomatizing PFL, Quine (1976) proposed the following conjectures as candidate axioms.

*&lt;math&gt;\exist I&lt;/math&gt;
''n''-1 consecutive iterations of '''p''' restores the ''status quo ante'':
*&lt;math&gt;F^n \leftrightarrow p^{n-1}F^n&lt;/math&gt;
'''+''' and '''∃''' annihilate each other:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;F^n \rightarrow +\exist F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;F^n \leftrightarrow \exist +F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-end}}
Negation distributes over '''+''', '''∃''', and '''p''':
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;+\lnot F^n \leftrightarrow \lnot +F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;\lnot\exist F^n \rightarrow \exist \lnot F^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;p\lnot F^n \leftrightarrow \lnot pF^n&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-end}}
'''+''' and '''p''' distributes over conjunction:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;+(F^nG^m) \leftrightarrow (+F^n+G^m)&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-break}}
*&lt;math&gt;p(F^nG^m) \leftrightarrow (pF^npG^m)&lt;/math&gt;
{{col-end}}
Identity has the interesting implication:
*&lt;math&gt;IF^n \rightarrow p^{n-2} \exist p+F^n&lt;/math&gt;

Quine also conjectured the rule: If &lt;math&gt;\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a PFL theorem, then so are &lt;math&gt;\ p\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ +\alpha,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exist \lnot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==Bacon's work==
Bacon (1985) takes the [[Material conditional|conditional]], [[negation]], ''Identity'', ''Padding'', and ''Major'' and ''Minor inversion'' as primitive, and ''Cropping'' as defined. Employing terminology and notation differing somewhat from the above, Bacon (1985) sets out two formulations of PFL:
* A [[natural deduction]] formulation in the style of [[Frederick Fitch]]. Bacon proves this formulation [[consistency proof|sound]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] in full detail.
*An axiomatic formulation which Bacon asserts, but does not prove, equivalent to the preceding one. Some of these axioms are simply Quine conjectures restated in Bacon's notation.

Bacon also:
*Discusses the relation of PFL to the [[term logic]] of Sommers (1982), and argues that recasting PFL using a syntax proposed in Lockwood's appendix to Sommers, should make PFL easier to "read, use, and teach";
*Touches on the [[group theory|group theoretic]] structure of '''Inv''' and '''inv''';
*Mentions that [[sentential logic]], [[monadic predicate logic]], the [[modal logic]] [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]], and the Boolean logic of (un)permuted [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, are all fragments of PFL.

==From first-order logic to PFL==
The following [[algorithm]] is adapted from Quine (1976: 300-2). Given a [[sentence (mathematical logic)|closed formula]] of [[first-order logic]], first do the following:
* Attach a numerical subscript to every predicate letter, stating its degree;
* Translate all [[universal quantifier]]s into [[existential quantifier]]s and negation;
* Restate all [[atomic formula]]s of the form ''x''=''y'' as ''Ixy''.

Now apply the following algorithm to the preceding result:

'''1.''' Translate the matrices of the most deeply nested quantifiers into [[disjunctive normal form]], consisting of [[logical OR|disjuncts]] of [[logical AND|conjuncts]] of terms, negating atomic terms as required. The resulting subformula contains only negation, conjunction, disjunction, and existential quantification.

'''2.''' Distribute the existential quantifiers over the disjuncts in the matrix using the [[rules of passage (logic)|rule of passage]] (Quine 1982: 119):
:&lt;math&gt;\exist x[\alpha (x) \lor \gamma (x)] \leftrightarrow (\exist x \alpha (x) \lor \exist x \gamma (x)).&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.''' Replace conjunction by [[Cartesian product]], by invoking the fact:
:&lt;math&gt;(F^m \land G^n) \leftrightarrow (F^m \times G^n) \leftrightarrow (F^m \exist^m G^n); m&lt;n.&lt;/math&gt;

'''4.''' Concatenate the argument lists of all atomic terms, and move the concatenated list to the far right of the subformula.

'''5.''' Use '''Inv''' and '''inv''' to move all instances of the quantified variable (call it ''y'') to the left of the argument list.

'''6.''' Invoke '''S''' as many times as required to eliminate all but the last instance of ''y''. Eliminate ''y'' by prefixing the subformula with one instance of '''∃'''.

'''7.''' Repeat (1)-(6) until all quantified variables have been eliminated. Eliminate any disjunctions falling within the scope of a quantifier by invoking the equivalence:
:&lt;math&gt; (\alpha \lor \beta \lor ...) \leftrightarrow \lnot(\lnot\alpha \land \lnot\beta \land ...).&lt;/math&gt;

The reverse translation, from PFL to first-order logic, is discussed in Quine (1976: 302-4).

The canonical [[foundation of mathematics]] is [[axiomatic set theory]], with a background logic consisting of [[first-order logic]] with [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], with a [[universe of discourse]] consisting entirely of sets. There is a single [[first-order logic|predicate letter]] of degree 2, interpreted as set membership. The PFL translation of the canonical [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] is not difficult, as no [[ZFC]] axiom requires more than 6 quantified variables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html#staxioms Metamath axioms.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''risk aversion''' is the behavior of [[human]]s (especially [[consumer]]s and [[investor]]s), who, when exposed to [[uncertainty]], attempt to lower that uncertainty. It is the hesitation of a person to agree to a situation with an unknown payoff rather than another situation with a more predictable payoff but possibly lower [[expected value|expected payoff]]. For example, a risk-averse investor might choose to put their money into a [[bank]] account with a low but guaranteed interest rate, rather than into a [[stock]] that may have high expected returns, but also involves a chance of losing value.

A person is given the choice between two scenarios, one with a guaranteed payoff and one without. In the guaranteed scenario, the person receives $50. In the uncertain scenario, a coin is flipped to decide whether the person receives $100 or nothing. The expected payoff for both scenarios is $50, meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble. However, individuals may have different '''risk attitudes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mr Lev Virine|author2=Mr Michael Trumper|title=ProjectThink: Why Good Managers Make Poor Project Choices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NCjAgAAQBAJ|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-0403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hillson|author2=Ruth Murray-Webster|title=Understanding and Managing Risk Attitude|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeMdki1LYEUC|year=2007|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-566-08798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Adhikari|first= Binay K|last2= Agrawal|first2= Anup |title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?|journal=[[Journal of Corporate Finance]] |volume=38|year=2016|pages=272–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person is said to be:

* '''risk averse''' (or '''risk avoiding''') - if they would accept a certain payment ([[certainty equivalent]]) of less than $50 (for example, $40), rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing.
* '''[[risk neutral]]''' - if they are indifferent between the bet and a certain $50 payment.
* '''[[risk loving]]''' (or '''risk seeking''') - if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than $50 (for example, $60).

The average payoff of the gamble, known as its [[expected value]], is $50. The smallest dollar amount that the individual would accept instead of the bet is called the [[certainty equivalent]], and the difference between the expected value and the certainty equivalent is called the [[risk premium]]. For risk-averse individuals, it is positive, for risk-neutral persons it is zero, and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative.

==Utility of money==
In [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] theory, an agent has a utility function ''u''(''c'') where ''c'' represents the value that he might receive in money or goods (in the above example ''c'' could be $0 or $40 or $100).

The utility function ''u''(''c'') is defined only [[up to]] positive [[affine transformation]] – in other words, a constant could be added to the value of ''u''(''c'') for all ''c'', and/or ''u''(''c'') could be multiplied by a positive constant factor, without affecting the conclusions.

An agent possesses risk aversion if and only if the utility function is [[concave function|concave]].  For instance ''u''(0) could be 0, ''u''(100) might be 10, ''u''(40) might be 5, and for comparison ''u''(50) might be 6.

The expected utility of the above bet (with a 50% chance of receiving 100 and a 50% chance of receiving 0) is

:&lt;math&gt;E(u)=(u(0)+u(100))/2&lt;/math&gt;,

and if the person has the utility function with ''u''(0)=0, ''u''(40)=5, and ''u''(100)=10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5, which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40.  Hence the certainty equivalent is 40.

The risk premium is ($50 minus $40)=$10, or in proportional terms

:&lt;math&gt;(\$50-\$40)/\$40&lt;/math&gt;

or 25% (where $50 is the expected value of the risky bet: (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} 0 + \tfrac{1}{2} 100&lt;/math&gt;).  This risk premium means that the person would be willing to sacrifice as much as $10 in expected value in order to achieve perfect certainty about how much money will be received.  In other words, the person would be indifferent between the bet and a guarantee of $40, and would prefer anything over $40 to the bet.

In the case of a wealthier individual, the risk of losing $100 would be less significant, and for such small amounts his utility function would be likely to be almost linear, for instance if u(0) = 0 and u(100) = 10, then u(40) might be 4.0001 and u(50) might be 5.0001.

The utility function for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope implies that the person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is [[stochastic dominance#First-order stochastic dominance|first-order stochastically dominant]] over an alternative bet (that is, if the probability mass of the second bet is pushed to the right to form the first bet, then the first bet is preferred).  (ii) The concavity of the utility function implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky bet having the same expected value; moreover, for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is a [[mean-preserving spread|mean-preserving contraction]] of an alternative bet (that is, if some of the probability mass of the first bet is spread out without altering the mean to form the second bet, then the first bet is preferred).

==&lt;span id="Measures of risk aversion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Measures of risk aversion under expected utility theory==
There are multiple measures of the risk aversion expressed by a given utility function. Several functional forms often used for utility functions are expressed in terms of these measures.

===Absolute risk aversion===
The higher the curvature of &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt;, the higher the risk aversion. However, since expected utility functions are not uniquely defined (are defined only up to [[affine transformations]]), a measure that stays constant with respect to these transformations is needed. One such measure is the '''Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion''' (ARA), after the economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[John W. Pratt]],&lt;ref name="Arrow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arrow |first=K.

:&lt;math&gt;A(c)=-\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u'(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u''(c)&lt;/math&gt; denote the first and second derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;u(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

The following expressions relate to this term:
* [[Exponential utility]] of the form &lt;math&gt;u(c)=1-e^{-\alpha c}&lt;/math&gt; is unique in exhibiting ''constant absolute risk aversion'' (CARA): &lt;math&gt;A(c)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is constant with respect to ''c''.
* [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion]] (HARA) is the most general class of utility functions that are usually used in practice (specifically, CRRA (constant relative risk aversion, see below), CARA (constant absolute risk aversion), and quadratic utility all exhibit HARA and are often used because of their mathematical tractability). A utility function exhibits HARA if its absolute risk aversion is a [[hyperbolic function]], namely

:&lt;math&gt; A(c) = -\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}=\frac{1}{ac+b}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this differential equation (omitting additive and multiplicative constant terms, which do not affect the behavior implied by the utility function) is:

:&lt;math&gt; u(c) = \frac{(c-c_s)^{1-R}}{1-R}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; R=1/a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c_s = -b/a &lt;/math&gt;.
Note that when &lt;math&gt; a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, this is CARA, as &lt;math&gt; A(c) = 1/b = const &lt;/math&gt;, and when &lt;math&gt; b=0 &lt;/math&gt;, this is CRRA (see below), as &lt;math&gt; c A(c) = 1/a = const &lt;/math&gt;.
See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/zender/Fin7330/1-RiskAversion.doc |title=Zender's lecture notes |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Decreasing/increasing absolute risk aversion'' (DARA/IARA) is present if &lt;math&gt;A(c)&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing/increasing. Using the above definition of ARA, the following inequality holds for DARA:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial A(c)}{\partial c} = -\frac{u'(c)u'''(c) - [u''(c)]^2}{[u'(c)]^2} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

and this can hold only if &lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, DARA implies that the utility function is positively skewed; that is, &lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Haim |last=Levy |year=2006 |title=Stochastic Dominance: Investment Decision Making under Uncertainty |location=New York |publisher=Springer |edition=Second |isbn=0-387-29302-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, IARA can be derived with the opposite directions of inequalities, which permits but does not require a negatively skewed utility function (&lt;math&gt;u'''(c)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;). An example of a DARA utility function is &lt;math&gt;u(c)=\log(c)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; A(c)=1/c&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;u(c)=c-\alpha c^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;A(c)=2 \alpha/(1-2 \alpha c)&lt;/math&gt; would represent a quadratic utility function exhibiting IARA.
*Experimental and empirical evidence is mostly consistent with decreasing absolute risk aversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friend |first=Irwin |last2=Blume |first2=Marshall |year=1975 |title=The Demand for Risky Assets |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=900–922 |jstor=1806628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contrary to what several empirical studies have assumed, wealth is not a good proxy for risk aversion when studying risk sharing in a principal-agent setting. Although &lt;math&gt;A(c)=-\frac{u''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt; is monotonic in wealth under either DARA or IARA and constant in wealth under CARA, tests of contractual risk sharing relying on wealth as a proxy for absolute risk aversion are usually not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellemare |first=Marc F. |first2=Zachary S. |last2=Brown |title=On the (Mis)Use of Wealth as a Proxy for Risk Aversion |journal=[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]] |year=2010 |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=273–282 |doi=10.1093/ajae/aap006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative risk aversion===
The '''Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion''' (RRA) or '''coefficient of relative risk aversion''' is defined as&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon, Carl and Lawrence Blume|title=Mathematics for Economists|publisher=Viva Norton|isbn=978-81-309-1600-2|pages=363|edition=Student}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R(c) = cA(c)=\frac{-cu''(c)}{u'(c)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Like for absolute risk aversion, the corresponding terms ''constant relative risk aversion'' (CRRA) and ''decreasing/increasing relative risk aversion'' (DRRA/IRRA) are used. This measure has the advantage that it is still a valid measure of risk aversion, even if the utility function changes from risk averse to risk loving as ''c'' varies, i.e. utility is not strictly convex/concave over all ''c''.  A constant RRA implies a decreasing ARA, but the reverse is not always true.  As a specific example of constant relative risk aversion, the utility function &lt;math&gt;u(c) = \log(c)&lt;/math&gt; implies RRA = 1.

In [[intertemporal choice]] problems, the [[elasticity of intertemporal substitution]] often cannot be disentangled from the coefficient of relative risk aversion.  The [[isoelastic utility]] function
:&lt;math&gt;u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\rho}-1}{1-\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
exhibits constant relative risk aversion with &lt;math&gt;R(c) = \rho &lt;/math&gt; and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{u(c)} = 1/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\rho = 1,&lt;/math&gt; using [[l'Hôpital's rule]] shows that this simplifies to the case of ''log utility,'' ''u''(''c'') = log ''c'', and the [[income effect]] and [[substitution effect]] on saving exactly offset.

A time-varying relative risk aversion can be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benchimol |first=J. |year=2014 |title=Risk aversion in the Eurozone |journal=[[Research in Economics]] |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=39–56 |doi=10.1016/j.rie.2013.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications of increasing/decreasing absolute and relative risk aversion===

The most straightforward implications of increasing or decreasing absolute or relative risk aversion, and the ones that motivate a focus on these concepts, occur in the context of forming a portfolio with one risky asset and one risk-free asset.&lt;ref name="Arrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;  If the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the ''number of dollars'' of the risky asset held in the portfolio if ''absolute'' risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing).  Thus economists avoid using utility functions such as the quadratic, which exhibit increasing absolute risk aversion, because they have an unrealistic behavioral implication.

Similarly, if the person experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to increase (or keep unchanged, or decrease) the ''fraction'' of the portfolio held in the risky asset if ''relative'' risk aversion is decreasing (or constant, or increasing).

In one [[economic model|model]] in [[monetary economics]], an increase in relative risk aversion increases the impact of  households' money holdings on the overall economy. In other words, the more the relative risk aversion increases, the more money demand shocks will impact the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Benchimol, J., Fourçans, A. (2012), [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jmacro/v34y2012i1p95-111.html Money and risk in a DSGE framework : A Bayesian application to the Eurozone], [[Journal of Macroeconomics]], vol. 34, pp. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portfolio theory===

In [[modern portfolio theory]], risk aversion is measured as the additional expected reward an investor requires to accept additional risk. Here risk is measured as the [[standard deviation]] of the return on investment, i.e. the [[square root]] of its [[variance]]. In advanced portfolio theory, different kinds of risk are taken into consideration. They are measured as the [[n-th root]] of the n-th [[central moment]]. The symbol used for risk aversion is A or A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{dE(c)}{d\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \frac{dE(c)}{d\sqrt[n]{\mu_n}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion==
The notion of using expected utility theory to analyze risk aversion has come under criticism from [[behavioral economics]]. [[Matthew Rabin]] has showed that a risk-averse, expected-utility-maximizing individual who,

''from any initial wealth level [...] turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, each with 50% probability [...] will turn down 50-50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of money.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rabin |first=Matthew |year=2000 |title=Risk Aversion and Expected-Utility Theory: A Calibration Theorem |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1281–1292 |doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibility. One solution to the problem observed by Rabin is that proposed by [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]], where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), rather than to consider only the final wealth.

Another limitation is the reflection effect which demonstrates the reversing of risk aversion. This effect was first presented by [[Kahneman]] and [[Tversky]] as a part of the [[prospect theory]], in the [[behavioral economics]] domain.
The reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative prospects as opposed to positive prospects. According to this effect, people tend to avoid risks under the gain domain, and to seek risks under the loss domain. Meaning, no risk aversion is expected under the loss domain.&lt;ref name="j1914185"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk|journal=Econometrica|date=1979|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|jstor=1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the gain domain, most people prefer a certain gain of 3000, than a gain of 4000 with a risk of 80 percent. When posing the same problem under the loss domain - with negative values, most people prefer a loss of 4000 with 80 percent chance, over a certain loss of 3000.

The reflection effect (as well as the [[certainty effect]]) is inconsistent with the expected utility hypothesis. It is assumed that the psychological principle which stands behind this kind of behavior is the overweighting of certainty. Meaning, options which are perceived as certain, are over-weighted relative to uncertain options. This pattern is an indication of a risk seeking behavior in negative prospects and eliminates other explanations for the certainty effect such as aversion for uncertainty or variability.&lt;ref name="j1914185"/&gt;

The initial findings regarding the reflection effect faced criticism regarding its validity, as it was claimed that there are insufficient evidence to support the effect on the individual level. Subsequently, an extensive investigation revealed its possible limitations, suggesting that the effect is most prevalent when either small or large amounts and extreme probabilities are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hershey|first1=J.

==In the brain==
{{Main|Risk aversion (psychology)}}

Attitudes towards risk have attracted the interest of the field of [[neuroeconomics]] and [[behavioral economics]].  A 2009 study by Christopoulos et al. suggested that the activity of a specific brain area (right inferior frontal gyrus) correlates with risk aversion, with more risk averse participants (i.e. those having higher risk premia) also having higher responses to safer options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Neurosci  |year=2009 |volume=26 |issue= 24 |pages=6469–6472 |title= Neural Correlates of Value, Risk, and Risk Aversion Contributing to Decision Making under Risk. |vauthors=Christopoulos GI, Tobler PN, Bossaerts P, Dolan RJ, Schultz W |pmid= 16775134 |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0804-06.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result coincides with other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0804-06.2006 |journal= J Neurosci  |year=2006 |volume=26 |issue= 24 |pages=6469–6472

==Public understanding and risk in social activities==
In the real world, many government agencies, e.g. [[Health and Safety Executive]], are fundamentally risk-averse in their mandate. This often means that they demand (with the power of legal enforcement) that risks be minimized, even at the cost of losing the utility of the risky activity.
It is important to consider the [[opportunity cost]] when mitigating a risk; the cost of not taking the risky action. Writing laws focused on the risk without the  balance of the utility may misrepresent society's goals. The public understanding of risk, which influences political decisions, is an area which has recently been recognised as deserving focus. In 2007 [[Cambridge University]] initiated the [[Winton Professorship of the Public Understanding of Risk]], a role described as outreach rather than traditional academic research by the holder, [[David Spiegelhalter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=CAM - the Cambridge Alumni Magazine |publisher=The University of Cambridge Development Office |volume=58 | date=2009|url=http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAM58/CAM58.pdf |page=3 |title=Don's Diary |first=David |last=Spiegelhalter |deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309004415/http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAM58/CAM58.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's services such as [[school]]s and [[playground]]s have become the focus of much risk-averse planning, meaning that children are often prevented from benefiting from activities that they would otherwise have had. Many playgrounds have been fitted with impact-absorbing matting surfaces. However, these are only designed to save children from death in the case of direct falls on their heads and do not achieve their main goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No fear: Growing up in a Risk Averse society|first=Tim|last=Gill|year=2007|publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|page=81|isbn=9781903080085|url=http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/media/item/1266/223/No-fear-19.12.07.pdf#page=28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306114126/http://gulbenkian.org.uk/media/item/1266/223/No-fear-19.12.07.pdf#page=28|archivedate=2009-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are expensive, meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways (such as building a playground closer to the child's home, reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it), and—some argue—children may attempt more dangerous acts, with confidence in the artificial surface. Shiela Sage, an early years school advisor, observes "Children who are only ever kept in very safe places, are not the ones who are able to solve problems for themselves. Children need to have a certain amount of risk taking ... so they'll know how to get out of situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Early Years - The Outdoor Environment |publisher=Teachers TV |date=10 January 2006 |url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/214 |people=Sue Durant, Sheila Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[MMR vaccine|vaccine]] to protect children against the three common diseases measles, mumps and rubella was developed and recommended for all children in several countries including the UK. However, a [[MMR vaccine controversy|controversy]] arose around fraudulent allegations that it caused autism. This alleged causal link was thoroughly disproved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2002 |volume=347 |issue=19 |pages=1477–82 |title= A population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and autism |vauthors=Madsen KM, Hviid A, Vestergaard M |pmid=12421889 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa021134 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the doctor who made the claims was expelled from the [[General Medical Council]]. Even years after the claims were disproved, some parents wanted to avert the risk of causing autism in their own children. They chose to spend significant amounts of their own money on alternatives from private doctors. These alternatives carried their own risks which were not balanced fairly, most often that the children were not properly immunized against the more common diseases of measles, mumps and rubella.

[[Mobile phone]]s may carry some small&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/features/qa/30/en|title= What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?|accessdate=2008-01-19|date= 2005-12-05|work= Online Q&amp;A|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile telephones and their base stations|accessdate=2008-01-19|date=June 2000|work= Fact sheet N°193|publisher= World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health risk]]. While most people would accept that unproven risk to gain the benefit of improved communication, others remain so risk averse that they do not. (The [[COSMOS cohort study]] continues to study the actual risks of mobile phones.)

One experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the TV show [[Deal or No Deal]] finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory. In the laboratory treatments, subjects made decisions in a standard, computerized laboratory setting as typically employed in behavioral experiments. In the limelight treatments, subjects made their choices in a simulated game show environment, which included a live audience, a game show host, and video cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baltussen |first=Guido |last2=van den Assem |first2=Martijn | last3=van Dolder |first3=Dennie |title=Risky Choice in the Limelight |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |ssrn=2057134}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, studies on investor behavior find that investors trade more and more speculatively after switching from phone-based to online trading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Barber|first= Brad |last2= Odean |first2= Terrance |title=The Internet and the Investor |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2001|pages=41–54 |doi=10.1257/jep.15.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Barber|first= Brad |last2= Odean |first2= Terrance |title=Online Investors: Do the Slow Die First? |journal=[[Review of Financial Studies]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |year=2002|pages=455–488 |doi=10.1093/rfs/15.2.455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that investors tend to keep their core investments with traditional brokers and use a small fraction of their wealth to speculate online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Konana|first= Prabhudev |last2= Balasubramanian |first2= Sridhar |title=The Social–Economic–Psychological model of technology adoption and usage: an application to online investing |journal=[[Decision Support Systems]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |year=2005|pages=505–524 |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2003.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Set (mathematics)|Sets]] are fundamental objects in [[mathematics]]. Intuitively, a set is merely a collection of [[element (mathematics)|elements]] or ''members''. There are various conventions for textually denoting sets. In any particular situation, an author typically chooses from among these conventions depending on which properties of the set are most relevant to the immediate context or on which perspective is most useful.

== Denoting a set as an object ==
Where it is desirable to refer to a set as an indivisible entity, one typically denotes it by a single capital letter. In referring to an arbitrary, generic set, a typical notational choice is {{math|''S''}}. When several sets are being discussed simultaneously, they are often denoted by the first few capitals: {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}}, and so forth. By convention, particular symbols are reserved for the most important sets of numbers:

:{{math|'''∅'''}} – [[empty set]] (also &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; or {{math|&amp;#123;&amp;#125;}} are common)
:{{math|'''N'''}} – [[natural number]]s
:{{math|'''Z'''}} – [[integer]]s (from ''Zahl'', German for ''[[number]]'').
:{{math|'''Q'''}} – [[rational number]]s (from ''[[quotient]]'')
:{{math|'''R'''}} – [[real number]]s
:{{math|'''C'''}} – [[complex number]]s

Some authors use the [[blackboard bold]] font for these particular sets (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). This usage is widely accepted in handwriting, but many mathematicians, and such experts on mathematical typography as [[Donald Knuth]], advise against its use in print.&lt;ref&gt;Krantz, S., ''Handbook of Typography for the Mathematical Sciences'', Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, Florida, 2001, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focusing on the membership of a set ==
In many contexts one is interested more in the elements that constitute the set than in the single entity comprising those elements, for instance where stating an [[extensional definition]] of the set. Here the elements, whether expressed discretely or in some aggregate manner, are enclosed in braces.

The simplest notational approach of this type, which is feasible only for fairly small sets, is to enumerate the elements exhaustively. Thus the set of suits in a standard deck of playing cards is denoted by {♠,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;♥&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;♣} and the set of even [[prime numbers]] is denoted by {{math|&amp;#123;2&amp;#125;}}. This approach also provides the notation {{math|&amp;#123;&amp;#125;}} for the empty set.

The [[semantics]] of the term ''set'' imposes certain [[syntactic]] constraints on these notations. The only information that is fundamental for a set is which particular objects are, or are not, elements. As a result, the order in which elements appear in an enumeration is irrelevant: {{math|&amp;#123;''π'', 6, 1/2&amp;#125;}} and {{math|&amp;#123;1/2, ''π'', 6&amp;#125;}} are two enumerations of the same set. Likewise, repeated mention of an element is also irrelevant, so {{math|&amp;#123;1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3&amp;#125; {{=}} &amp;#123;1, 2, 3&amp;#125;}}. To deal with collections for which members' multiplicity ''is'' significant, there is a generalization of sets called ''[[multiset]]s''.

A variant of this explicitly exhaustive enumeration uses ranges of elements and features the [[ellipsis]]. Thus the set of the first ten natural numbers is {{math|&amp;#123;1, 2, 3, ..., 10&amp;#125;}}. Here, of course, the ellipsis means "and so forth." Note that wherever an ellipsis is used to denote a range, it is punctuated as though it were an element of the set. If either extreme of a range is indeterminate, it may be denoted by a [[mathematical expression]] giving a formula to compute it. As an example, if {{math|''n''}} is known from context to be a positive integer, then the set of the first {{math|''n''}} [[square number|perfect squares]] may be denoted by {{math|&amp;#123;1, 4, ..., ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#125;}}.

Some [[infinite set]]s, too, can be represented in this way. An example is denoting the set of natural numbers (for which one notation described above is {{math|'''N'''}}) by {{math|&amp;#123;1, 2, 3, ...&amp;#125;}}. In cases where the infinitely repeating pattern is not obvious, one can insert an expression to represent a generic element of the set, as with {{math|&amp;#123;0, 1, 3, ..., ''k''(''k''-1)/2, ...&amp;#125;}}.

A more powerful mechanism for denoting a set in terms of its elements is [[set-builder notation]]. Here the general pattern is {{math|&amp;#123;''x'' : ''P''(''x'')&amp;#125;}}, which denotes the set of all elements {{math|''x''}} (from some [[universal set]]) for which the assertion {{math|''P''(''x'')}} about {{math|''x''}} is true. For example, when understood as a set of points, the circle with radius {{math|''r''}} and center {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, may be denoted as {{math|&amp;#123;(''u'', ''v'') : (''u''−''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''v''-''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#125;}}.

A notable exception to the braces notation is used to express [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] on the [[real line]]. It makes use of the fact that any such interval is completely determined by its left and right endpoints: the [[unit interval]], for instance, is the set of reals between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The convention for denoting intervals uses brackets and parentheses, depending as the corresponding endpoint is included in or excluded from the set, respectively. Thus the set of reals with [[absolute value]] less than one is denoted by {{math|(−1, 1)}} — note that this is very different from the [[ordered pair]] with first entry −1 and second entry 1. As other examples, the set of reals {{math|''x''}} that satisfy {{math|2 &lt; ''x'' ≤ 5}} is denoted by {{math|(2, 5]}}, and the set of nonnegative reals is denoted by {{math|[0, ∞)}}.

== Metaphor in denoting sets ==
Since so much of mathematics consists in discovering and exploiting patterns, it is perhaps not surprising that there should have arisen various set-denotational conventions that strike practitioners as obvious or natural—if sometimes only once the pattern has been pointed out.

One class comprises those notations deriving the symbol for a set from the algebraic form of a representative element of the set. As an example, consider the set of even numbers. Since a number {{math|''b''}} is even precisely if there exists some integer {{math|''a''}} such that {{math|''b'' {{=}} 2''a''}}, the following [[Set-builder_notation#Terms_more_complicated_than_a_single_variable|variation on set-builder notation]] could be used to denote this set: {{math|&amp;#123;2''a'' : ''a''∈'''Z'''&amp;#125;}} (compare this with the formal set-builder notation: {{math|&amp;#123;''b''∈'''Z''' : ∃ ''a''∈'''Z''': ''b'' {{=}} 2''a''&amp;#125;}}). Alternatively, a single symbol for the set of even numbers is {{math|2'''Z'''}}. Likewise, since any odd number must have the form {{math|2''a'' + 1}} for some integer {{math|''a''}}, the set of odd numbers may be denoted {{math|2'''Z'''+1}}.

A second class is based on a strong logical relationship between a set and a particular integer. One example is the bracket notation, in which the set {{math|&amp;#123;1, ..., ''n''&amp;#125;}} of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers is denoted by {{math|[''n'']}} (as a related point, when endowed with the standard less-than-or-equal [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] {{math|≤}}, the set {{math|[''n'']}} yields the [[poset]] denoted by {{math|'''''n'''''}}.) Another example arises from [[modular arithmetic]], where [[equivalence classes]] are denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}_n&lt;/math&gt;, which may be understood to represent the set of integers that leave remainder {{math|''a''}} on division by {{math|''n''}}. Thus yet another notation for the set of even numbers is &lt;math&gt;\bar{0}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Another set-denotational convention that relies on metaphor comes from [[enumerative combinatorics]]. It derives a symbol for a set {{math|''S''}} from an expression for the set's [[cardinality]], or size, {{math|&amp;#124;''S''&amp;#124;}}. Perhaps the simplest and best known example is the [[Cartesian product]] of sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, which is the set {{math|&amp;#123;(''a'', ''b'') : ''a''∈''A'', ''b''∈''B''&amp;#125;}}. Since, in this set, every element of {{math|''A''}} gets paired exactly once with every element of {{math|''B''}}, its cardinality is {{math|&amp;#124;''A''&amp;#124; × &amp;#124;''B''&amp;#124;}}. For this reason, the set is denoted by {{math|''A''×''B''}}. In fact, that same fact about its cardinality is why this set is called a ''product''.

There are many other examples of this convention. One is the set of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from set {{math|''A''}} to set {{math|''B''}}. When {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are [[Finite set|finite]], specifying any such function amounts to choosing for each element of {{math|''A''}} which element of {{math|''B''}} should be its [[image (mathematics)|image]]. So, the number of these functions is {{math|&amp;#124;''B''&amp;#124;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#124;''A''&amp;#124;&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus, one denotes the set of all functions from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}} as {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Another example is the [[power set]] of a set {{math|''S''}}, which, having cardinality {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#124;''S''&amp;#124;&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is denoted by {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Note, though, that since any [[subset]] of {{math|''S''}} may be seen as a function assigning to each element of {{math|''S''}} one or the other element of {include,&amp;nbsp;exclude}, the notation {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may be seen as a special case of {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The cardinality metaphor has also been used to derive from the standard notation for [[binomial coefficients]] the notation &lt;math&gt;\tbinom X k&lt;/math&gt; for the set of all {{math|''k''}}-element subsets of a set {{math|''X''}}. An alternative notation to denote the all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; [X]^k &lt;/math&gt; 

An example where this cardinality-based convention appears not to have been used yet is {{math|''X''!}} to denote the set of all [[permutations]] of a set {{math|''X''}}. Since it is usually seen as the underlying set of a [[symmetric group]], this set is typically denoted by a symbol for the group itself, either {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|Sym(''X'')}}.

== Other conventions ==
Further conventions are also sometimes seen, including one based on relations. For a relation {{math|''R''}} on a set {{math|''S''}}, one may denote the set of objects related by ''R'' to some element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''S''}} by {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(x)}}. So from the notation | for the ''divides'' relation of [[number theory]], one may denote the set of factors of an integer {{math|''n''}} by {{math|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt; &amp;#124; &lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}}. Similarly, a subset of {{math|''X''}} is a ''principal'' [[lower set]] of a poset {{math|(''X'', ≤)}} precisely if it can be denoted by {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;≤&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} for some {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}}. And since {{math|~}} is the symbol for the [[adjacency relation]], the subset of a collection {{math|''W''}} of vertices of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that includes exactly those adjacent to a vertex {{math|''v''}} (namely, the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of {{math|''W''}} with the [[neighbourhood (graph theory)|open neighborhood]] of {{math|''v'')}} may be denoted by {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;~&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'')}}.

A '''spin glass''' is a disordered [[magnet]], where the magnetic spins of the component atoms (the orientation of the north and south magnetic poles  in three-dimensional space) are not aligned in a regular pattern.  The term "glass" comes from an analogy between the ''magnetic'' disorder in a spin glass and the ''positional'' disorder of a conventional, chemical [[glass]], e.g., a window glass.  In window glass or any [[amorphous]] solid the atomic bond structure is highly irregular; in contrast, a [[crystal]] has a uniform pattern of atomic bonds.  In [[ferromagnetic]] solid, magnetic spins all align in the same direction; this would be analogous to a crystal.

The individual atomic bonds in a spin glass are a mixture of roughly equal numbers of ferromagnetic bonds (where neighbors have the same orientation) and [[antiferromagnet]]ic bonds (where neighbors have exactly the opposite orientation: north and south poles are flipped 180 degrees).  These patterns of aligned and misaligned atomic magnets create what are known as [[Geometrical frustration|frustrated interactions]] - distortions in the geometry of atomic bonds compared to what would be seen in a regular, fully aligned solid.  They may also create situations where more than one geometric arrangement of atoms is stable.

Spin glasses and the complex internal structures that arise within them are termed "[[metastable]]" because they are "stuck" in stable configurations other than the lowest-energy configuration (which would be aligned and ferromagnetic).  The mathematical complexity of these structures is difficult but fruitful to study experimentally or in [[simulation]]s, with applications to [[artificial neural networks]] in computer science, in addition to physics, chemistry, and materials science.

==Magnetic behavior==
It is the time dependence which distinguishes spin glasses from other magnetic systems.

Above the spin glass [[phase transition|transition temperature]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is identical with the so-called "freezing temperature" &lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the spin glass exhibits typical magnetic behaviour (such as [[paramagnetism]]).

If a magnetic field is applied as the sample is cooled to the transition temperature, magnetization of the sample increases as described by the [[Curie law]]. Upon reaching ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;, the sample becomes a spin glass and further cooling results in little change in magnetization. This is referred to as the ''field-cooled'' magnetization.

When the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization of the spin glass falls rapidly to a lower value known as the ''remanent'' magnetization.

Magnetization then decays slowly as it approaches zero (or some small fraction of the original value—this remains unknown). This [[exponential decay|decay is non-exponential]] and no simple function can fit the curve of magnetization versus time adequately.&lt;ref name="JPhys"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joy|first1=P A|last2=Kumar|first2=P S Anil|last3=Date|first3=S K|title=The relationship between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled susceptibilities of some ordered magnetic systems|journal=J. Phys.: Condens. Matter|date=7 October 1998|volume=10|issue=48|pages=11049–11054|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/10/48/024|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/10/48/024|bibcode = 1998JPCM...1011049J }}&lt;/ref&gt; This slow decay is particular to spin glasses. Experimental measurements on the order of days have shown continual changes above the noise level of instrumentation.&lt;ref name="JPhys" /&gt;

Spin glasses differ from ferromagnetic materials by the fact that after the external magnetic field is removed from a ferromagnetic substance, the magnetization remains indefinitely at the remanent value. Paramagnetic materials differ from spin glasses by the fact that, after the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization rapidly falls to zero, with no remanent magnetization. The decay is rapid and exponential.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

If the sample is cooled below ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; in the absence of an external magnetic field and a magnetic field is applied after the transition to the spin glass phase, there is a rapid initial increase to a value called the ''zero-field-cooled'' magnetization. A slow upward drift then occurs toward the field-cooled magnetization.

Surprisingly, the sum of the two complicated functions of time (the zero-field-cooled and remanent magnetizations) is a constant, namely the field-cooled value, and thus both share identical functional forms with time,&lt;ref name="Nordblad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordblad|first1=P|last2=Lundgren|first2=L|last3=Sandlund|first3=L|title=A link between the relaxation of the zero field cooled and the thermoremanent magnetizations in spin glasses|journal=Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials|date=February 1986|volume=54-57|issue=1|pages=185–186|doi=10.1016/0304-8853(86)90543-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304885386905433|bibcode = 1986JMMM...54..185N }}&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the limit of very small external fields.

==Edwards–Anderson model==
In this model, we have spins arranged on a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions similar to the [[Ising model]]. This model can be solved exactly for the critical temperatures and a glassy phase is observed to exist at low temperatures.&lt;ref name=nishimori&gt;{{cite book|last=Nishimori|first=Hidetoshi|title=Statistical Physics of Spin Glasses and Information Processing: An Introduction|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198509400|pages=243|url=http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/science_and_technology/physics/Statistical_physics/Statistical%20physics%20of%20spin%20glasses%20and%20information%20processing%20an%20introduction%20-%20Nishimori%20H..pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413235314/http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/science_and_technology/physics/Statistical_physics/Statistical%20physics%20of%20spin%20glasses%20and%20information%20processing%20an%20introduction%20-%20Nishimori%20H..pdf|archivedate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] for this spin system is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;
H = -\sum_{\langle ij\rangle} J_{ij} S_i S_j,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the [[Pauli spin matrix]] for the spin-half particle at lattice point &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. A negative value of &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; denotes an antiferromagnetic type interaction between spins at points &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. The sum runs over all nearest neighbor positions on a lattice, of any dimension. 
The variables &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; representing the magnetic nature of the spin-spin interactions are called bond or link variables. In order to determine the partition function for this system, one needs to average the free energy &lt;math&gt;f[J_{ij}] = -\dfrac 1 \beta \ln \mathcal{Z}\left[J_{ij}\right]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}\left[J_{ij}\right] = \operatorname{Tr}_S e^{(-\beta H)}&lt;/math&gt;, over all possible values of &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. The distribution of values of &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be a gaussian with a mean &lt;math&gt;J_0&lt;/math&gt; and a variance &lt;math&gt;J^2&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(J_{ij}) = \sqrt{\frac{N}{2\pi J^2}} \exp\left\{-\frac N {2J^2} \left(J_{ij} - \frac{J_0} N \right)^2\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the free energy using the [[replica trick|replica method]], below a certain temperature, a new magnetic phase called the spin glass phase (or glassy phase) of the system is found to exist which is characterized by a vanishing magnetization &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt; along with a non-vanishing value of the two point correlation function between spins at the same lattice point but at two different replicas: &lt;math&gt;q = \sum_{i=1}^N S^\alpha_i S^\beta_i \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; are replica indices. The order parameter for the ferromagnetic to spin glass phase transition is therefore &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, and that for paramagnetic to spin glass is again &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the new set of order parameters describing the three magnetic phases consists of both &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.
Free energy of this system can be found, both under assumptions of replica symmetry as well as considering replica symmetry breaking. Under the assumption of replica symmetry, the free energy is given by the expression:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\beta f = &amp;- \frac{\beta^2 J^2}{4}(1-q)^2 + \dfrac{\beta J_0 r m^r}{2} \\
&amp;- \int \exp\left( -\frac{z^2} 2 \right) \log \left(2\cosh\left(\beta J z + \beta J_0 m\right)\right) \, \mathrm{d}z.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==The model of Sherrington and Kirkpatrick==
In addition to unusual experimental properties, spin glasses are the subject of extensive theoretical and computational investigations. A substantial part of early theoretical work on spin glasses dealt with a form of [[mean field theory]] based on a set of [[replica trick|replicas]] of the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system.

An important, exactly solvable model of a spin glass was introduced by D. Sherrington and S. Kirkpatrick in 1975. It is an [[Ising model]] with long range frustrated ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic couplings. It corresponds to a [[mean field theory|mean field approximation]] of spin glasses describing the slow dynamics of the magnetization and the complex non-ergodic equilibrium state.

Unlike the Edwards–Anderson (EA) model, in the system though only two-spin interactions are considered, the range of each interaction can be potentially infinite (of the order of the size of the lattice). Therefore, we see that any two spins can be linked with a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic bond and the distribution of these is given exactly as in the case of Edwards–Anderson model. The Hamiltonian for SK model is very similar to the EA model:

: &lt;math&gt;
H = -\sum_{i&lt;j} J_{ij} S_i S_j
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_{ij}, S_i, S_j&lt;/math&gt; have same meanings as in the EA model. The equilibrium solution of the model, after some initial attempts by Sherrington, Kirkpatrick and others, was found by [[Giorgio Parisi]] in 1979 with the replica method. The subsequent work of interpretation of the Parisi solution—by M. Mezard, G. Parisi, M.A. Virasoro and many others—revealed the complex nature of a glassy low temperature phase characterized by ergodicity breaking, ultrametricity and non-selfaverageness. Further developments led to the creation of the [[cavity method]], which allowed study of the low temperature phase without replicas. A rigorous proof of the Parisi solution has been provided in the work of [[Francesco Guerra]] and [[Michel Talagrand]].

The formalism of replica mean field theory has also been applied in the study of [[neural networks]], where it has enabled calculations of properties such as the storage capacity of simple neural network architectures without requiring a training algorithm (such as [[backpropagation]]) to be designed or implemented.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

More realistic spin glass models with short range frustrated interactions and disorder, like the [[Carl Gauss|Gaussian]] model where the couplings between neighboring spins follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], have been studied extensively as well, especially using [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s. These models display spin glass phases bordered by sharp [[phase transition]]s.

Besides its relevance in condensed matter physics, spin glass theory has acquired a strongly interdisciplinary character, with applications to [[neural network]] theory, computer 
science, theoretical biology, [[econophysics]] etc.

==Infinite-range model==
The infinite-range model is a generalization of the [[Spin glass#The model of Sherrington and Kirkpatrick|Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model]] where we not only consider two spin interactions but &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-spin interactions, where &lt;math&gt;r \leq N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of spins. Unlike the Edwards–Anderson model, similar to the SK model, the interaction range is still infinite. The Hamiltonian for this model is described by:

: &lt;math&gt;
H = -\sum_{i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_r} J_{i_1 \dots i_r} S_{i_1}\cdots S_{i_r}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_{i_1\dots i_r}, S_{i_1},\dots, S_{i_r}&lt;/math&gt; have similar meanings as in the EA model. The &lt;math&gt;r\to \infty&lt;/math&gt; limit of this model is known as the [[random energy model]]. In this limit, it can be seen that the probability of the spin glass existing in a particular state, depends only on the energy of that state and not on the individual spin configurations in it.
A gaussian distribution of magnetic bonds across the lattice is assumed usually to solve this model. Any other distribution is expected to give the same result, as a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]]. The gaussian distribution function, with mean &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{J_0} N &lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{J^2} N&lt;/math&gt;, is given as:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(J_{i_1\cdots i_r}) = \sqrt{\dfrac{N^{r-1}}{J^2 \pi r!}} \exp\left\{-\frac{N^{r-1}}{J^2 r!} \left(J_{i_1\cdots i_r} - \frac{J_0 r!}{2N^{r-1}}\right)\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The order parameters for this system are given by the magnetization &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and the two point spin correlation between spins at the same site &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, in two different replicas, which are the same as for the SK model. This infinite range model can be solved explicitly for the free energy&lt;ref name=nishimori/&gt;  in terms of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, under the assumption of replica symmetry as well as 1-Replica Symmetry Breaking.&lt;ref name=nishimori/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\beta f = {} &amp; \frac{\beta^2 J^2 q^r} 4 - \frac{r\beta^2 J^2 q^r} 2 - \frac{\beta^2 J^2} 4 + \frac{\beta J_0 r m^r} 2 + \frac{r\beta^2 J^2 q^{r-1}}{4\sqrt{2\pi}} \\
&amp; {} + \int \exp\left( -\frac{z^2}2 \right)\log \left(2\cosh\left(\beta Jz \sqrt{\frac{rq^{r-1}}{2}} + \frac{\beta J_0 r m^{r-1}}{2}\right)\right) \, \mathrm{d}z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Non-ergodic behavior and applications==
A so-called [[ergodicity|non-ergodic]] behavior happens in spin glasses below the freezing temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{f}&lt;/math&gt;, since below that temperature the system cannot escape from the ultradeep minima of the hierarchically disordered energy landscape.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The hierarchical disorder of the energy landscape may be verbally characterized by a single sentence: in this landscape there are "(random) valleys within still deeper (random) valleys within still deeper (random) valleys, ..., etc."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the freezing temperature is typically as low as 30 [[kelvin]]s (−240 °C), so that the spin-glass magnetism appears to be practically without applications in daily life, there are applications in different contexts, e.g. in the already mentioned theory of [[neural networks]], i.e. in theoretical [[brain]] research, and in the mathematical-economical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''stable ∞-category''' is an [[∞-category]] such that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2012|loc=Definition 1.1.1.9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*(i) It has a [[zero object]].
*(ii) Every [[morphism]] in it admits a [[Glossary of infinity category|fiber]] and cofiber.
*(iii) A triangle in it is a [[fiber sequence]] if and only if it is a [[cofiber sequence]].

The [[homotopy category]] of a stable ∞-category is [[triangulated category|triangulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2012|loc=Theorem 1.1.2.14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stable ∞-category admits finite [[limit (category theory)|limit]]s and [[colimit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2012|loc=Proposition 1.1.3.4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples: the [[derived category]] of an [[abelian category]] and the ∞-category of [[spectrum (topology)|spectra]] are both stable.

A '''stabilization''' of an [[∞-category]] ''C'' having finite limits and base point is a functor from the stable ∞-category ''S'' to ''C''. It preserves limit. The objects in the image have the structure of infinite loop spaces; whence, the notion is a generalization of the corresponding notion ([[stabilization (topology)]]) in classical algebraic topology.

By definition, the [[t-structure]] of an stable ∞-category is the t-structure of its homotopy category. Let ''C'' be a stable ∞-category with a t-structure. Then every filtered object &lt;math&gt;X(i), i \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; in ''C'' gives rise to a [[spectral sequence]] &lt;math&gt;E^{p, q}_r&lt;/math&gt;, which, under some conditions, converges to &lt;math&gt;\pi_{p+q} \operatorname{colim} X(i).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2012|loc=Construction 1.2.2.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]], this generalizes the construction of the [[spectral sequence]] associated to a filtered [[chain complex]] of [[abelian group]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12601">[[File:Comparison of surface area vs volume of shapes.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of surface area, ''A'' against volume, ''V'' of the Platonic solids and a sphere, showing that the surface area decreases for rounder shapes, and the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases with increasing volume.]]
The '''surface-area-to-volume ratio''', also called the '''surface-to-volume ratio''' and variously denoted '''sa/vol''' or '''SA:V''', is the amount of [[surface area]] per unit volume of an object or collection of objects.
In [[chemical reaction]]s involving a solid material, the surface area to volume ratio is an important factor for the [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], that is, the rate at which the chemical reaction will proceed.

For a given volume, the object with the smallest surface area (and therefore with the smallest SA:V) is the [[sphere]], a consequence of the [[Isoperimetric_inequality#Isoperimetric_inequality_in_higher_dimensions|isoperimetric inequality in 3 dimensions]]. By contrast, objects with tiny spikes will have very large surface area for a given volume.

== Dimension ==
The surface-area-to-volume ratio has [[physical dimension]] L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (inverse length) and is therefore expressed in units of inverse distance.  As an example, a [[cube]] with sides of length 1&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|cm]] will have a surface area of 6&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a volume of 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The surface to volume ratio for this cube is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SA:V} = \frac{6~\mbox{cm}^2}{1~\mbox{cm}^3} = 6~\mbox{cm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a given shape, SA:V is inversely proportional to size.  A cube 2&amp;nbsp;cm on a side has a ratio of 3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, half that of a cube 1&amp;nbsp;cm on a side.  Conversely, preserving SA:V as size increases requires changing to a less [[compactness measure of a shape|compact]] shape.

==Physical chemistry==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
{{see also|Dust explosion}}
Materials with high [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio (e.g. very small diameter, very [[porosity|porous]], or otherwise not [[compactness measure of a shape|compact]]) react at much faster rates than monolithic materials, because more surface is available to react. Examples include grain dust; while grain isn't typically flammable, [[Washburn A Mill|grain dust is explosive]]. Finely ground salt dissolves much more quickly than coarse salt.

High surface area to volume ratio provides a strong "driving force" to speed up thermodynamic processes that minimize [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].

==Biology==
[[File:Human jejunum microvilli 2 - TEM.jpg|thumb|[[Cell (biology)|Cells]] lining the [[small intestine]] increase the surface area over which they can absorb nutrients with a carpet of tuftlike [[microvilli]].]]

The ratio between the surface area and volume of [[Cell (biology)|cells]]  and [[organism]]s has an enormous impact on their [[biology]], including their [[physiology]] and [[behavior]]. For example, many aquatic microorganisms have increased surface area to increase their drag in the water. This reduces their rate of sink and allows them to remain near the surface with less energy expenditure.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

An increased surface area to volume ratio also means increased exposure to the environment. The finely-branched appendages of [[filter feeder]]s such as [[krill]] provide a large surface area to sift the water for food.&lt;ref&gt;Kils, U.: ''[[s:Author:Uwe Kils/polar/part1|Swimming and feeding of Antarctic Krill, ''Euphausia superba'' - some outstanding energetics and dynamics - some unique morphological details]]''. In ''Berichte zur Polarforschung'', [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], Special Issue 4 (1983): "On the biology of Krill ''Euphausia superba''", Proceedings of the Seminar and Report of Krill Ecology Group, Editor S. B. Schnack, 130-155 and title page image.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual organs like the [[lung]] have numerous internal branchings that increase the surface area; in the case of the lung, the large surface supports gas exchange, bringing [[oxygen]] into the blood and releasing [[carbon dioxide]] from the blood.&lt;ref name=tortora1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos|first2=Nicholas P.| title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |pages=556–582|edition= Fifth |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|date= 1987 |isbn= 978-0-06-350729-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grays&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Peter L |last2=Warwick |first2=Roger |last3=Dyson|first3=Mary |last4=Bannister |first4=Lawrence H. |title=Gray's Anatomy| pages=1278–1282 |location=Edinburgh|publisher=Churchill Livingstone | edition=Thirty-seventh |date=1989|isbn= 0443 041776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[small intestine]] has a finely wrinkled internal surface, allowing the body to absorb nutrients efficiently.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 349–353|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells can achieve a high surface area to volume ratio with an elaborately convoluted surface, like the [[microvilli]] lining the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name="William2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krause J. William|title=Krause's Essential Human Histology for Medical Students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRayoldYrcUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=25 November 2010|date=July 2005|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-58112-468-2|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased surface area can also lead to biological problems. More contact with the environment through the surface of a cell or an organ (relative to its volume) increases loss of water and dissolved substances. High surface area to volume ratios also present problems of temperature control in unfavorable environments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The surface to volume ratios of organisms of different sizes also leads to some [[biological rule]]s such as [[Bergmann's rule]]&lt;ref name="Meiri2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00837.x | title=On the validity of Bergmann's rule | journal=Journal of Biogeography | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=331–351 | date=2003-03-20 | last1=Meiri | first1=S. | last2=Dayan | first2=T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashton2000"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.1086/303400 | title=Is Bergmann's Rule Valid for Mammals? | date=October 2000 | first1=Kyle G. | last1=Ashton | last2=Tracy | first2=Mark C. | last3=Queiroz | first3=Alan de | journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=156 | issue=4 | pages=390–415 | doi=10.1086/303400| pmid=29592141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millien2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ecotypic variation in the context of global climate change: Revisiting the rules | first1=Virginie | last1=Millien | last2=Lyons | first2=S.

==Fire spread==
In the context of [[wildfire]]s, the ratio of the surface area of a solid fuel to its volume is an important measurement. Fire spread behavior is frequently correlated to the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the fuel (e.g. leaves and branches). The higher its value, the faster a particle responds to changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature or moisture. Higher values are also correlated to shorter fuel ignition times, and hence faster fire spread rates.

==Planetary cooling==
A body of icy or rocky material in outer space may, if it can build and retain sufficient heat, develop a differentiated interior and alter its surface through volcanic or tectonic activity. The length of time through which a planetary body can maintain surface-altering activity depends on how well it retains heat, and this is governed by its surface area-to-volume ratio. For [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (r=263 km), the ratio is so high that astronomers were surprised to find that it ''did'' differentiate and have brief volcanic activity. The [[moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Mars]] have radii in the low thousands of kilometers; all three retained heat well enough to be thoroughly differentiated although after a billion years or so they became too cool to show anything more than very localized and infrequent volcanic activity, of which none is evident at present. [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] and [[Earth]] (r&gt;6,000 km) have sufficiently low surface area-to-volume ratios (roughly half that of Mars and much lower than all other known rocky bodies) so that their heat loss is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.uvic.ca/~venn/A201/maths.6.planetary_cooling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7432">The '''synthetic control method''' is a statistical method used to evaluate the effect of an intervention in [[comparative case study|comparative case studies]]. It involves the construction of a weighted combination of groups used as controls, to which the [[treatment group]] is compared. This comparison is used to estimate what would have happened to the treatment group if it had not received the treatment.
Unlike [[difference in differences]] approaches, this method can account for the effects of [[confounder]]s changing over time, by weighting the control group to better match the treatment group before the intervention.&lt;ref name=he&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreif|first1=Noémi|last2=Grieve|first2=Richard|last3=Hangartner|first3=Dominik|last4=Turner|first4=Alex James|last5=Nikolova|first5=Silviya|last6=Sutton|first6=Matt|title=Examination of the Synthetic Control Method for Evaluating Health Policies with Multiple Treated Units|journal=Health Economics|date=December 2016|volume=25|issue=12|pages=1514–1528|doi=10.1002/hec.3258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of the synthetic control method is that it allows researchers to systematically select comparison groups.&lt;ref name=ajps&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abadie|first1=Alberto|last2=Diamond|first2=Alexis|last3=Hainmueller|first3=Jens|title=Comparative Politics and the Synthetic Control Method|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=February 2015|volume=59|issue=2|pages=495–510|doi=10.1111/ajps.12116}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been applied to the fields of [[political science]],&lt;ref name=ajps/&gt; [[health policy]],&lt;ref name=he/&gt; [[criminology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Jessica|last2=Lundberg|first2=Russell|last3=Braga|first3=Anthony A.|last4=Ridgeway|first4=Greg|last5=Miles|first5=Jeremy|title=A Synthetic Control Approach to Evaluating Place-Based Crime Interventions|journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology|date=3 June 2014|volume=31|issue=3|pages=413–434|doi=10.1007/s10940-014-9226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Billmeier|first1=Andreas|last2=Nannicini|first2=Tommaso|title=Assessing Economic Liberalization Episodes: A Synthetic Control Approach|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|date=July 2013|volume=95|issue=3|pages=983–1001|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The synthetic control method combines elements from [[Matching (statistics)|matching]] and [[difference-in-differences]] techniques. Difference-in-differences methods are often-used policy evaluation tools that estimate the effect of an intervention at an aggregate level (e.g. state, country, age group etc.) by averaging over a set of unaffected units. Famous examples include studies of the employment effects of a raise in the [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]] in New Jersey fast food restaurants by comparing them to fast food restaurants just across the border in [[Philadelphia]] that were unaffected by a minimum wage raise,&lt;ref name="CardKrueger"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Card |first=D. |authorlink=David Card |first2=A. |last2=Krueger |authorlink2=Alan Krueger |year=1994 |title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=772–793 |jstor=2118030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies that look at [[crime rates]] in southern cities to evaluate the impact of the [[Mariel boat lift]] on crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Card |first=D. |year=1990 |title=The Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market |journal=[[Industrial and Labor Relations Review]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=245–257 |doi=10.1177/001979399004300205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The control group in this specific scenario can be interpreted as a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]], where some units effectively receive zero weight while others get an equal, non-zero weight.

The synthetic control method tries to offer a more systematic way to assign weights to the control group. It typically uses a relatively long time series of the outcome prior to the intervention and estimates weights in such a way that the control group mirrors the treatment group as closely as possible. In particular, assume we have ''J'' observations over ''T'' time periods where the relevant treatment occurs at time

&lt;math&gt;T_{0}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T_{0}&lt;T.&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{it}=Y_{it}-Y^N_{it},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y^N_{it}&lt;/math&gt; the outcome in absence of the treatment, be the treatment effect for unit '''''i''''' at time '''''t'''''. Without loss of generality, if unit 1 receives the relevant treatment, only &lt;math&gt;Y^N_{1t}&lt;/math&gt;is not observed for &lt;math&gt;t&gt;T_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and we aim to estimate (&lt;math&gt;(\alpha_{1T_{0+1}}......\alpha_{1T})&lt;/math&gt;. Imposing some structure

&lt;math&gt;Y^N_{it}=\delta_{t}+\theta_{t}Z_{i}+\lambda_{t}\mu_{i}+\varepsilon_{it}&lt;/math&gt;   and assuming there exist some optimal weights ''w'' such that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^J_{j=2} w_{j}Y_{jt}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t\leqslant T_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, to the synthetic controls approach suggests using these weights to estimate the counterfactual &lt;math&gt;Y^N_{1t}=\Sigma^J_{j=2}w_{j}Y_{jt}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&gt;T_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. So under some regularity conditions, such weights would provide estimators for the treatment effects of interest. In essence, the method uses the idea of matching and using the training data pre-intervention to set up the weights and hence a relevant control post-intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abadie |first=A. |authorlink=Alberto Abadie |first2=A. |last2=Diamond |first3= J. |last3=Hainmüller |year=2010 |title=Synthetic Control Methods for Comparative Case Studies: Estimating the Effect of California's Tobacco Control Program |journal=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |volume=105 |issue=490 |pages=493–505 |doi=10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thébault's theorem''' is the name given variously to one of the [[geometry]] problems proposed by the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Victor Thébault]], individually known as Thébault's problem I, II, and III.

==Thébault's problem I==

Given any [[parallelogram]], construct on its sides four [[Square (geometry)|square]]s external to the parallelogram.  The [[quadrilateral]] formed by joining the centers of those four squares is a square.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/Thebault1.shtml (retrieved 2016-01-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a special case of [[van Aubel's theorem]] and a square version of the [[Napoleon's theorem]].

[[File:Thebault problem I tiling pattern.png|thumb|Tiling pattern based on Thébault's problem I]]
==Thébault's problem II==

Given a square, construct [[equilateral triangle]]s on two adjacent edges, either both inside or both outside the square.  Then the triangle formed by joining the vertex of the square distant from both triangles and the vertices of the triangles distant from the square is equilateral.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/Thebault2.shtml (retrieved 2016-01-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thébault's problem III==

Given any [[triangle]] ABC, and any point M on BC, construct the [[incircle]] and [[circumcircle]] of the triangle.  Then construct two additional circles, each [[tangent]] to AM, BC, and to the circumcircle.  Then their centers and the center of the incircle are colinear.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/Thebault3.shtml (retrieved 2016-01-27) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Ostermann, Gerhard Wanner: ''Geometry by Its History''. Springer, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;226–230&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2003, academia thought this third problem of Thébault the most difficult to [[mathematical proof|prove]].  It was published in the [[American Mathematical Monthly]] in 1938, and proved by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mathematician H. Streefkerk in 1973.  However, in 2003, Jean-Louis Ayme discovered that Y. Sawayama, an instructor at The Central Military School of Tokyo, independently proposed and solved this problem in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

An "external" version of this theorem, where the incircle is replaced by an excircle and the two additional circles are external to the circumcircle, is found in Shay Gueron (2002). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gueron|first1=Shay|title=Two Applications of the Generalized Ptolemy Theorem|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=April 2002|volume=109|issue=4|pages=362–370|doi=10.2307/2695499|url=http://geometry.ru/articles/Two_Casey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proof based on [[Casey's theorem]] is in the paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">A mathematical or physical process is '''time-reversible''' if the dynamics of the process remain well-defined when the sequence of time-states is reversed.

A [[Deterministic system|deterministic process]] is time-reversible if the time-reversed process satisfies the same [[dynamic equation (disambiguation)|dynamic equation]]s as the original process; in other words, the equations are [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] or [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] under a change in the [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] of time. A [[stochastic process]] is reversible if the statistical properties of the process are the same as the statistical properties for time-reversed data from the same process.

== Mathematics ==
In [[mathematics]], a [[dynamical system]] is time-reversible if the forward evolution is [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]], so that for every state there exists a transformation (an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]) π which gives a one-to-one mapping between the time-reversed evolution of any one state and the forward-time evolution of another corresponding state, given by the operator equation:

:&lt;math&gt;U_{-t} = \pi \, U_{t}\, \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Any time-independent structures (e.g. [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] or [[attractor]]s) which the dynamics give rise to must therefore either be self-symmetrical or have symmetrical images under the involution π.

== Physics ==
In [[physics]], the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] of [[classical mechanics]] exhibit time reversibility, as long as the operator π reverses the [[conjugate momentum|conjugate momenta]] of all the particles of the system, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \rightarrow  \mathbf{-p} &lt;/math&gt; ([[T-symmetry]]).

In [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] systems, however, the [[weak nuclear force]] is not invariant under T-symmetry alone; if weak interactions are present reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator π also reverses the signs of all the [[charge (physics)|charges]] and the [[parity (physics)|parity]] of the spatial co-ordinates ([[C-symmetry]] and [[P-symmetry]]). This reversibility of several linked properties is known as [[CPT symmetry]].

[[Thermodynamic process]]es can be [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] or [[irreversible process|irreversible]], depending on the change in [[entropy]] during the process.

== Stochastic processes ==
A [[stochastic process]] is time-reversible if the joint probabilities of the forward and reverse state sequences are the same for all sets of time increments {&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, for ''s'' = 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''k'' for any ''k'':&lt;ref&gt;Tong (1990), Section 4.4&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;p(x_t, x_{t+\tau_1}, x_{t+\tau_2}, \ldots , x_{t+\tau_k}) = p(x_{t'}, x_{t'-\tau_1}, x_{t'-\tau_2} , \ldots , x_{t'-\tau_k})&lt;/math&gt;

A univariate stationary [[Gaussian process]] is time-reversible. [[Markov process]]es can only be reversible if their stationary distributions have the property of [[detailed balance]]:
:&lt;math&gt;p(x_t=i,x_{t+1}=j) = \,p(x_t=j,x_{t+1}=i)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Kolmogorov's criterion]] defines the condition for a [[Markov chain]] or [[continuous-time Markov chain]] to be time-reversible.

Time reversal of numerous classes of stochastic processes has been studied, including [[Lévy processes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacod | first1 = J. | last2 = Protter | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176991776 | title = Time Reversal on Levy Processes | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 620 | year = 1988 | jstor = 2243828| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stochastic network]]s ([[Kelly's lemma]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = F.

==Waves and optics==
Time reversal method works based on the linear reciprocity of the [[wave equation]], which states that the time reversed solution of a [[wave equation]] is also a solution to the [[wave equation]] since standard wave equations only contain even derivatives of the unknown variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parvasi|first1=Seyed Mohammad|last2=Ho|first2=Siu Chun Michael|last3=Kong|first3=Qingzhao|last4=Mousavi|first4=Reza|last5=Song|first5=Gangbing|title=Real time bolt preload monitoring using piezoceramic transducers and time reversal technique—a numerical study with experimental verification|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|date=19 July 2016|volume=25|issue=8|pages=085015|doi=10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085015|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085015/pdf|language=en|issn=0964-1726|bibcode=2016SMaS...25h5015P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[wave equation]] is symmetrical under time reversal, so the time reversal of any valid solution is also a solution. This means that a wave's path through space is valid when travelled in either direction.

[[Time reversal signal processing]] is a process in which this property is used to reverse a received signal; this signal is then re-emitted and a temporal compression occurs, resulting in a reverse of the initial excitation waveform being played at the initial source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5573">In [[formal language]] theory, the class of '''unrestricted grammars''' (also called '''semi-Thue''', '''type 0''', or '''phrase structure grammars''' by some authors) is the most general class of grammars in the [[Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy]]. On the productions of an unrestricted grammar, no other restrictions are made than each of their left-hand sides being non-empty.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|220}} This grammar class can generate arbitrary [[recursively enumerable language]]s.

== Formal definition ==

An '''unrestricted grammar''' is a [[formal grammar]] &lt;math&gt;G = (N, \Sigma, P, S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a set of nonterminal symbols, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[terminal symbol]]s, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Actually, this is not strictly necessary since unrestricted grammars make no real distinction between the two. The designation exists purely so that one knows when to stop generating [[formal grammar#sentential-form|sentential form]]s of the grammar; more precisely, the language &lt;math&gt;L(G)&lt;/math&gt; recognized by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to strings of nonterminal symbols&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[production (computer science)|production rules]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to \beta&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are strings of symbols in &lt;math&gt;N \cup \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is not the empty string, and &lt;math&gt;S \in N&lt;/math&gt; is a specially designated start symbol.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopcroft |first1=John |authorlink=John Hopcroft |last2=Ullman |first2=Jeffrey D. |authorlink2=Jeffrey Ullman |year=1979 |title=[[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]] |publisher=Addison-Wesley |edition=1st | isbn=0-201-44124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}}  As the name implies, there are no real restrictions on the types of production rules that unrestricted grammars can have.

== Equivalence to Turing machines ==

The unrestricted grammars characterize the recursively enumerable languages.  This is the same as saying that for every unrestricted grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists some [[Turing machine]] capable of recognizing &lt;math&gt;L(G)&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.  Given an unrestricted grammar, such a Turing machine is simple enough to construct, as a two-tape [[nondeterministic Turing machine]].&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|221}}  The first tape contains the input word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to be tested, and the second tape is used by the machine to generate sentential forms from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.  The Turing machine then does the following:

# Start at the left of the second tape and repeatedly choose to move right or select the current position on the tape.
# [[Nondeterministic algorithm|Nondeterministically]] choose a production &lt;math&gt;\beta \to \gamma&lt;/math&gt; from the productions in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; appears at some position on the second tape, replace &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; at that point, possibly shifting the symbols on the tape left or right depending on the relative lengths of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. if &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is longer than &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, shift the tape symbols left).
# Compare the resulting sentential form on tape 2 to the word on tape 1.  If they match, then the Turing machine accepts the word.  If they don't, the Turing machine will go back to step 1.

It is easy to see that this Turing machine will generate all and only the sentential forms of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on its second tape after the last step is executed an arbitrary number of times, thus the language &lt;math&gt;L(G)&lt;/math&gt; must be recursively enumerable.

The reverse construction is also possible.  Given some Turing machine, it is possible to create an equivalent unrestricted grammar&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|222}} which even uses only productions with one or more non-terminal symbols on their left-hand sides. Therefore, an arbitrary unrestricted grammar can always be equivalently converted to obey the latter form, by converting it to a Turing machine and back again. Some authors{{cn|date=February 2017}} use the latter form as definition of ''unrestricted grammar''.

== Computational properties ==

The [[decision problem]] of whether a given string &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; can be generated by a given unrestricted grammar is equivalent to the problem of whether it can be accepted by the Turing machine equivalent to the grammar. The latter problem is called the [[Halting problem]] and is undecidable.

Recursively enumerable languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under [[Kleene star]], [[Concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]], [[Union (set theory)|union]], and [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], but not under [[set difference]]; see [[Recursively enumerable language#Closure properties]].

The equivalence of unrestricted grammars to Turing machines implies the existence of a universal unrestricted grammar, a grammar capable of accepting any other unrestricted grammar's language given a description of the language. For this reason, it is theoretically possible to build a [[programming language]] based on unrestricted grammars (e.g. [[Thue (programming language)|Thue]]).
