==Early life ==

He attended [[Université Catholique de l'Ouest]] in France and the [[Université de Louvain La Neuve]] in Belgium, and received a BA from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame University]], and also an MBA from [[Cornell University]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; He has a multicultural background of [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Filipinos|Filipino]], American and European/French.

===Music===

In 2010, he landed the theme song for Rubi Telenovela in the Philippines and was signed by music label Viva Music shortly after. His first Album “100% Heart” rose to number two on the Filipino Pop charts behind the lead single “Wish”, the duet he recorded with [[Sarah Geronimo]] and which was the revival of the Donna Cruz and Jason Everly original hit.

A chance meeting in [[London]] put A3 on his current path into the EDM and dance world when he was introduced to the [[The Black Eyed Peas|Black Eyed Peas]] team at the “We Can Be Anything” campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2147117/Will-attends-bandmate-apl-aps-We-Can-Be-Anything-Charity-Gala-campaign.html|title=He remembers his friends! Will.i.am attends Black Eyed Peas bandmate Apl.de.ap's charity campaign|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Black Eyed Peas member [[Apl.de.ap|Apl.de.Ap]]. and connected with music producer DJ Poet Named Life. They began working together immediately after a 12-hour flight from Europe to LA and co-wrote and produced A3's breakout single “Feel the Light”, which went to number 8 on Music Week Charts and got UK Club and radio play.

===Business===
A3 is also known in the world of business as Antonio "Tony" Alvarez III. He is the managing director of [[Alvarez &amp; Marsal]], a firm his father, Antonio Alvarez II, co-founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alvarezandmarsal.co.uk/our-people/antonio-alvarez-iii-tony-iii|title=Antonio Alvarez III ("Tony III")|website=Alvarez &amp; Marsal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=7282496&amp;privcapId=5491790 |title=Antonio M. Alvarez III |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

'''Abū Dharr al-Ghifari al-Kinani''' ({{lang|ar| أبو ذر الغفاري الكناني}}), also '''Jundab ibn Junādah''' ({{lang|ar|جُنْدَب ابْنِ جُنَادَة}}), was the [[Timing of Sahaba becoming Muslims|fourth or fifth person converting to Islam]], and a [[Muhajirun]].&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/7.2.html The Mirror of all the Prophets as Shown by The Hadith of Similitude]&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to the [[Banu Ghifar]], the [[Banu Kinanah|Kinanah]] tribe. No date of birth is known. He died in 652 CE, at [[al-Rabadha]], in the desert east of [[Medina]].

Abu Dhar is remembered for his strict piety and also his opposition to [[Muawiyah I]] during the [[caliph]] [[Uthman ibn Affan]] era. He is venerated by [[Shia Muslim]]s as one of [[The Four Companions]], early [[Muslim]]s who were followers ([[Shi'a]]) of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]].

He was regarded by many, including [[Ali Shariati]], Muhammad Sharqawi and Sami Ayad Hanna, as a principal antecedent of [[Islamic socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-link=[[John Esposito]] |title=Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-506613-8 |oclc=	 94030758 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  the first Islamic socialist, or the first socialist altogether.
He protested against the accumulation of wealth by the ruling class during [[Uthman ibn Affan|‘Uthmān]]'s caliphate and urged the equitable [[redistribution of wealth]].

==Early life==
Little is known of his life before his conversion to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[Michael Molloy][Molloy], ''Experiencing the World's Religions: Traditions, Challenge, and Change, Sixth Edition'', 2009, p. 853&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Dhar is said to have been a serious young man, an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] and a [[Monotheism|monotheist]] even before he converted. He was born to the Ghifar clan, found to the western south of Medina.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt]], ''Muhammad at Medina'', 1956, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Dhar was apparently typical of the early converts to Islam, described by [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]] as "young men and weak people".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Watt, ''Muhammad at Mecca'', 1953, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; They were a branch of the [[Banu Kinanah]] tribe. The [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]] clan of [[Muhammad]] was also a branch of the [[Banu Kinanah]] tribe.

Popular accounts of Abu Dhar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=859 Islam Online]&lt;/ref&gt; say that his tribe lived by pillaging [[Camel train|caravans]], but that he preferred to live a poor but honest life as a shepherd. Having heard the contention that a new prophet had arisen in Mecca, Abu Dhar and his brother travelled to Mecca to find the [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]]. The young seeker converted instantly and rushed out to declare his new faith in front of the [[Kaaba]], which at that time was a [[Paganism|pagan]] temple. He was beaten for his religious belief. He did this three days in a row, after which the Prophet Muhammed told him to return to his clan, where he taught his people about Islam. He and his tribe then joined Muhammad after the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], or migration to Medina in 622 CE.

Muhammad once said that "the sky did not spread its canopy on any man who was more truthful than Abu Dharr."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Razwy|first1=Sayed Ali Asgher|title=A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This seems to be a simplified account of stories reported in these [[hadith]]s, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|31|6049}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|31|6048}} and {{Hadith-usc|muslim|31|6046}}.

According to the early Islamic historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], Abu Dhar claimed to have been the fourth or fifth convert to Islam. However, Saad bin Abi Waqqas made the same claim. While the exact order of conversion may never be established, no one doubts that he was a very early convert.

==Military campaigns during Muhammad's era==

He participated in the [[Battle of Badr]]. Muhammad's forces included [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Ali]], [[Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]], [[Mus`ab ibn `Umair]], [[Zubair ibn al-Awam|Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam]], [[Ammar ibn Yasir]], and [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]]. The Muslims also brought seventy camels and two horses, meaning that they either had to walk or fit three to four men per camel.&lt;ref&gt;Lings, pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; However, many early Muslim sources indicate that no serious fighting was expected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |title=Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=16 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816202325/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html| archivedate= 16 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the future Caliph [[Uthman]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayyah]], the daughter of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/053.sbt.html#004.053.359 |title=Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 4, Book 53, Number 359 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=16 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720142403/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/053.sbt.html |archivedate=20 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman the Persian]] also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s5.html |title=Witness-pioneer.org |publisher=Witness-pioneer.org |date=16 September 2002 |accessdate=19 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205021747/http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s5.html| archivedate= 5 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.286 |title=Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 286 |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=16 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816202325/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html| archivedate= 16 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Expedition of Ka’b ibn 'Umair al-Ghifari]]  his son Umair al-Ghifari was killed. In this expedition Muhammad ordered an attackon the  Banu Quda‘a tribe because Muhammad received intelligence that they had gathered a large number of men to attack the Muslim positions&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 244"&gt;{{citation|title=The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_80rJHIaOMC&amp;pg=PA244 | first=Saifur Rahman Al|last=Mubarakpuri|year=2005|publisher=Darussalam Publications|isbn=978-9960-899-55-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Muhammad's death==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

Abu Dhar had begun his agitation in Medina after Uthman had given 500,000 dirhams to [[Marwan I]], 300,000 to al-Harith b. al-Hakam, and 100,000 to the Medinan [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] from the ''[[khums]]'' of the booty seized in Ifriqiya in 27/647. He then quoted relevant [[Qur'an]]ic passages threatening the hoarders of riches with hell-fire. Marwan complained to Uthman, who sent his servant Natil to warn Abu Dhar, but to no avail. Uthman displayed patience for some time until, in the presence of the caliph, Abu Dhar launched an angry verbal attack on [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]], who had backed Uthman's free use of public money. Uthman now chided Abu Dhar and sent him to [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, ''Succession to Muhammad'', 1997, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tradition that Muhammad predicted this sad end, saying, "May [[Allah]] have mercy upon Abu Dharr! Lonely will he live, lonely will he die and lonely will he be resurrected{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}".

==Sunni view==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Many hadith, oral traditions, are traced to Abu Dhar. He is respected as an early and observant Muslim, and a man who was honest and direct to a fault. He was, according to the Sunni tradition, a rough, unlettered Bedouin who held no high office, but who served the Muslim community, the [[Ummah]], with everything he had to give.

During the caliphate of Uthman, he stayed in Damascus and witnessed Muslims deviating from Islam, going after worldly pleasures and desires.

He was saddened and repelled by this. So Uthman invited him to come to Madinah. where he was also hurt by people's pursuit of worldly goods and pleasures.

'''Al-Rabathah'''

Abu Dhar then asked Uthman to go to al-Rabathah, a small village eastern Madinah. Uthman approved his request. Abu Dhar stayed there away from people, holding on to the traditions ([[sunnah]]) of Muhammad and his companions.

A man visited him once and when he found his house almost bare, he asked Abu Dhar: "Where are your possessions?"

Abu Dhar said: "We have a house yonder (meaning the [[Afterlife#Islam|Hereafter]]), to which we send the best of our possessions."

The man understood what Abu Dhar meant and said: "But you must have some possessions so long as you are in this abode."

"The owner of this abode will not leave us in it," replied Abu Dharr.

Also, when the Prince (Amir) of Syria sent Abu Dhar three hundred dinars to meet his needs, he returned the money saying, "Does not the Amir find a servant more deserving of it than I?"

Abu Dhar continued in his simple life, and dedicated himself to Allah only until he died, in 32 A.H.

==Shi'a view==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Aba Dhar is considered one of the greatest and most loyal sahaba, along with [[Salman the Persian]], [[Miqdad ibn Aswad]], and [[Ammar ibn Yasir]].

Imam Ali advanced to see him off. He said:

:Abu Dhar, you've become very angry for Allah. The people are worried about their religion, and you are worried about your religion. So, leave what they are worried about in your hands and escape from them with what you're worried about. They're in need of what you've prevented them from. And you're in no need of what they've prevented you from. Tomorrow you'll know who will be the winner. Abu Dhar, nothing amuses you but the truth and nothing annoys you but the untruth.

Abu Dhar, his wife and his daughter went to al-Rabathah Desert. He was recalling our Master Muhammad's words:
Abu Dhar, may Allah have mercy upon you. You'll live alone, die alone, rise from the dead alone and enter Paradise alone.
Prophet Mohammad said about him "Aba Dhar is like Issa/Jesus of my nation in his "zohod" and "waraa"

There are two Shia shrines to Abu Dhar in Lebanon — in [[Sarepta]] and [[Meiss al-Jabal]].

==Hadiths mentioning his virtuous status==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
Muhammad is reported to have said, "Neither has the sky shaded one more truthful and honest than Abu Dhar nor has the earth had anyone walk over it like him.  (In these matters) he is like Isa bin Maryam." (From [[Tirmidhi]].)

Muhammad also said, "Abu Dhar walks on earth with the piety of Isa bin Maryam (Jesus son of Mary.)" (From Tirmidhi.)

During the [[Battle of Tabouk]], Abu Dhar was left behind because his camel was ill or too weak.  So he alighted from it and, placing the pack on his back, walked to the rest of the army.  Muhammad saw him and exclaimed, "May Allah have Mercy on Abu Dhar!."  He then said, "He spends his life all alone. Death will single him out and on the Day of Resurrection, he will stand up all alone!"

An '''animal bite''' is a [[wound]], usually a puncture or laceration, caused by the teeth. An animal bite usually results in a break in the skin but also includes contusions from the excessive pressure on body tissue from the bite. The contusions can occur without a break in the skin. Bites can be provoked or unprovoked. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. &lt;!--Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]. get a citation for this statement --&gt; Biting is a physical action not only describing an attack but it is a normal response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes [[ectoparasites]] from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and mortality. Animal bites not only include injuries from the teeth of reptiles, mammals, but fish, and amphibians. Arthropods can also bite and leave injuries.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms
*Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching
*Serious [[hemorrhage]] if major blood vessels are pierced
*[[Infection]] by [[bacterium|bacteria]] or other [[pathogen]]s, including rabies
*Introduction of [[Venom (poison)|venom]] into the wound by venomous animals such as some [[snakes]]
*Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing [[inflammation]] and [[itching]]

==Classification==

Bites are usually classified by the type of animal causing the wound.
Many different animals are known to bite humans.

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Jaw of the piranha.jpg|thumb|Jaw of the piranha with biting equipment displayed]]
*Companion animals, including [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[companion parrot|parrots]], may bite humans.
*[[Wildlife]] may sometimes bite humans. The bites of various mammals such as [[bat]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[gray wolf|wolves]], [[raccoon]]s, etc. may transmit [[rabies]], which is almost always fatal if left untreated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Involuntary [[biting]] injuries due to [[closed-fist injuries]] from fists striking teeth (referred to as [[Reverse bite injury|reverse bite injuries]]) are a common consequence of [[Hand to hand combat|fist fights]]. These have been termed "fight bites". Injuries in which the [[knuckle joint]]s or [[tendon]]s of the hand are bitten into tend to be the most serious.

Teething infants are known to bite objects to relieve pressure on their growing teeth, and may inadvertently bite people's hands or arms while doing so. Young children may also bite people out of anger or misbehaviour, although this is usually corrected early in the child's life.

===Reverse bite injury===
A reverse bite injury (also called a clenched fist injury, closed fist injury, or fight bite) results when, a person punches another person in the face, and the skin (and sometimes tendons) of their knuckles are cut against the teeth of the person they are punching.&lt;ref name="PerronMiller2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/ajem.2002.31146 |title=Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: Fight bite |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–117 |year=2002 |last1=Perron |first1=Andrew D. |last2=Miller |first2=Mark D. |last3=Brady |first3=William J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the wound is often located over the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] resulting in tendon injury.&lt;ref name="HenryPurcell2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/emj.2006.045054 |pmid=17582031 |pmc=2658386 |title=The human bite injury: A clinical audit and discussion regarding the management of this alcohol fuelled phenomenon |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=455–458 |year=2007 |last1=Henry |first1=F. P. |last2=Purcell |first2=E. M. |last3=Eadie |first3=P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical treatment of this injury is similar to those of a [[Human biting injuries|human bite]], but may also involve damage of the underlying tendons.&lt;ref name="ShewringTrickett2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1753193415576249 |pmid=25770897 |title=The management of clenched fist 'fight bite' injuries of the hand |journal=Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume) |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=819–824 |year=2015 |last1=Shewring |first1=D. J. |last2=Trickett |first2=R. W. |last3=Subramanian |first3=K. N. |last4=Hnyda |first4=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These injuries should be managed as other human bites: wound irrigation and [[antibiotics]] are essential as human saliva can contain a number of bacteria.&lt;ref name="TalanAbrahamian2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/379331 |pmid=14614671 |title=Clinical Presentation and Bacteriologic Analysis of Infected Human Bites in Patients Presenting to Emergency Departments |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1481–1489 |year=2003 |last1=Talan |first1=D. A. |last2=Abrahamian |first2=F. M. |last3=Moran |first3=G. J. |last4=Citron |first4=D. M. |last5=Tan |first5=J. O. |last6=Goldstein |first6=E. J. C. |author7=Emergency Medicine Human Bite Infection Study Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of these injuries is such that even if the injury is optimally managed, poor outcomes may still occur.&lt;ref name="PerronMiller2002"/&gt;

===Arthropods===
The bites of arthropods have some of the most serious health consequences known. Mosquito bites transmit serious disease and result in millions of deaths and illnesses in the world. Ticks also transmit many diseases such as [[Lyme disease]].

==Mechanism==

=== Trauma ===
One of the first consequences of a bite is the trauma inflicted upon tissue. Some animals involved in inflicting bites are also receiving them during the confrontation. Trauma includes scratching of the skin surface, tooth loss, puncture wounds, superficial and deep lacerations, amputations, and the ripping off of skin and hair. If major blood vessels are damaged, severe blood loss can occur.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

=== Infection ===
Pathogen organisms can be introduced into the bite. Some of the pathogens can originate from the mouth of the 'biter', the substrate onto which the injured person or animal can fall or from the naturally occurring microorganisms that are present on the skin or hair of the animal. The advent of antibiotics improved the outcome of bite wound infections.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

===Rabies===
Animal bites where skin has been penetrated, most commonly dogs and [[bat]]s, transmit rabies to humans.&lt;ref name=WHO2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabies Fact Sheet N°99|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabies from other animals is rare.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; If the animal is caught alive or dead with its head preserved, the head can be analyzed to detect the disease. Signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth, growling, self-mutilation, jerky behavior, red eyes, and [[Rabies#Hydrophobia|hydrophobia]].

If the animal cannot be captured, preventative rabies treatment is recommended in many places. Several countries are known not to have native rabies, see the Wikipedia page for [[Prevalence of rabies#Rabies-free jurisdictions|prevalence of rabies]].

==Treatment==
The first step in treatment includes washing the bite wound.&lt;ref name=WHO2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal bites Fact sheet N°373|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a low risk of infection the wound may be sutured.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Debridement and drainage bite wounds was practiced in the pre-antibiotic era, but still had a high infection rate.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics to prevent infection are recommended for dog and cat bites of the hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1021 |title=Antibiotics in cat bites |website=BestBets }}&lt;/ref&gt; and human bites if they are more than superficial.&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70110-0 |pmid=19555903 |title=Bite-related and septic syndromes caused by cats and dogs |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=439–447 |year=2009 |last1=Oehler |first1=Richard L. |last2=Velez |first2=Ana P. |last3=Mizrachi |first3=Michelle |last4=Lamarche |first4=Jorge |last5=Gompf |first5=Sandra |citeseerx=10.1.1.490.2232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also recommended in those who have [[immunodeficiency|poor immune function]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Evidence for antibiotics to prevent infection in bites in other areas is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001738 |pmid=11406003 |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD001738 |year=2001 |last1=Medeiros |first1=Iara Marques |last2=Saconato |first2=Humberto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first choice is [[amoxicillin with clavulanic acid]], and if the person is penicillin-allergic, [[doxycycline]] and [[metronidazole]].&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"/&gt; The antistaphylococcal penicillins (e.g., [[cloxacillin]], [[nafcillin]], [[flucloxacillin]]) and the [[macrolide]]s (e.g., [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]]) are not used for empirical therapy, because they do not cover ''[[Pasteurella]]'' species.&lt;ref name="Oehler2009"/&gt;

===Vaccinations===
Rabies prevention is generally available in [[North America]] and the [[Northern European]] states.

[[Tetanus toxoid]] treatment is recommended in those whose vaccinations are not up to date and have a bite that punctures the skin.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; [[Tetanus immune globulin]] is indicated in people with more than 10 years since prior vaccination. Tetanus boosters (Td) should be given every ten years.

===Mosquito bites===
{{main|Insect bites and stings}}

[[Antihistamines]] are effective treatment for the symptoms from bites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1074 |title=BestBets: Oral antihistamines for insect bites |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[Dengue fever|dengue]] are transmitted by [[mosquitoes]].

== Epidemiology ==
Human bites are the third most frequent type of bite after dog and cat bites.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Cherry | first = James | title = Feigin and Cherry's textbook of pediatric infectious diseases – Animal and Human Bites, Morven S. Edwards | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4557-1177-2 }}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dog bites]] are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html |title= Dog Bite Statistics |author = Kenneth M. Phillips |date= 2009-12-27 |accessdate= 2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 4.7 million [[dog bite]]s are reported annually in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ Questions and Answers about Dog Bites] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304025320/http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ |date=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US estimated annual count of animal bites is 250,000 human bites, 1 to 2 million dog bites, 400,000 cat bites, and 45,000 bites from snakes. Bites from skunks, horses, squirrels, rats, rabbits, pigs, and [[monkey bite|monkey]]s may be up to 1 percent of bite injuries. Pet ferrets attacks that were unprovoked have caused serious facial injuries. Non-domesticated animals though assumed to be more common especially as a cause of rabies infection, make up less than one percent of reported bite wounds. When a person is bitten, it is more likely to occur on the right arm, most likely due to defensive reactions when the person uses their dominant arm. Estimates are that three quarters of bites are located on the arms or legs of humans. Bites to the face of humans constitute only 10 percent of the total. Two thirds of bite injuries in humans are suffered by children aged ten and younger.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

Up to three fourths of dog bites happen to those younger than 20 years-old. In the United States, the costs associated with dog bites are estimated to be more than $1 billion annually. The age groups that suffer most from dog bites are children 5 to 9 years-old. Often, bites go unreported and no medical treatment given - these bites go unreported. As many as one percent of pediatric emergency room visits are for treatment for animal bites. This is more frequent during the summer months. Up to five percent of children receiving emergency care for dog bites are then admitted to the hospital. Bites typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening. Girls are bitten more frequently by cats than they are by dogs. Boys are bitten by dogs two times more often than girls are bitten by dogs.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

== History ==

The bites of humans are recorded during the biblical area. Reports of secondary infection occurring after a human bite in children have been noted in the United States since at least 1910. Morbidity and mortality rates improved with the use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014/&gt;

[[Image:Bcks logo med.gif|thumb|BCKS logo]]
The '''battle command knowledge system''' (BCKS) is the change agent for implementing [[knowledge management]] (KM) capabilities
into the training and military operations of the [[United States Army]]. BCKS is headquartered at the [[U.S. Army Combined Arms Center]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]]. 

==History==
Army Professional Forums were informally implemented by passionate volunteers who wanted to share their knowledge and experience with their peers in order to improve their profession. CompanyCommand.com and Platoon Leader were formally adopted by the U.S. Army in 2002. The Battle Command Knowledge System Professional Forums were formed in September 2004 to provide structure to this innovative knowledge sharing process. Later, the NCOTeam.org was also supported and adopted by BCKS.

By September 2004, there were four formal U.S. Army Professional Forums with approximately 20,000 members. Since that time, the U.S. Army has grown their Professional Forums into one of the premier collaboration instruments in the [[U.S. Government]] with 46 Professional Forums supporting active and [[reserve forces]] as well as the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. The Professional Forums support soldiers around the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These collaboration tools have been widely accepted across the entire enterprise structure, with membership ranging from [[General officer (United States)|General Officer]] to [[Private (rank)|Private]], all being able to share their unique knowledge and experience with others on the Professional Forum without regard to rank or position. Army Professional Forums currently have over 130,000 members and are growing at a rate of approximately 1,900 new members per month mainly by word of mouth through a [[grassroots]] effort.

==KM forums==
BCKS provides a social network of facilitated professional forums that provide a foundation for [[knowledge transfer]]. Army soldiers and civilians connect to share [[Explicit knowledge|explicit]] and [[tacit knowledge]] to solve problems, share best practices, and develop their professional skills. Leaders and staff members have access to others with similar duty positions and challenges. Functional specialists and those interested in a particular specialized domain gather virtually in focused forums.

==Statistics==
* More than 50 BCKS forums with approximately 162,000 accounts
* 4 West Point forums with 17,000 accounts
* BCKS Growth = 3,000 per month
* West Point Growth = 400 per month
* Total Growth = 3,400 per month
* 83,000 unique visitors per month
* 2,800 unique visitors per day

===NCO site history===
NCO Net origins began in the early 1990s with Command Sergeant Major [[Daniel K. Elder]] exploring his personal computer and modem with friends. They were dabbling with PCs and the new telecommunication capability – [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS's). With a dial up modem hosted in his house and a single phone line, NCOs could log onto  "The Old Soldiers BBS" with a local Ft. Knox KY number. In the earliest days, only one person at a time could connect to the BBS – an era before the internet, before Google, and before military documents were easily accessed. It was also a time where long distance costs were charged. But once dialed in, the NCO would find relevant files and time saver programs for soldiers, many of them provided by the [[Command and Control Microcomputer Users Group]] (C2MUG) at Ft Leavenworth, Kansas. Users could also log on daily to read and respond to postings in the threaded discussions. The NCO site was the manual [[Yahoo]] search engine for Army NCOs.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topsarge.com/history.html |title=Our History |publisher=Topsarge |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313204512/http://topsarge.com/history.html |archivedate=March 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1997 the BBS went away. CSM Elder continued to explore technology and began building the first NCO website on [[GeoCities]]. Here the focus began to expand with how the internet could help soldiers in their day to day productivity. His buddies gave feedback on what would be beneficial. The site began to host soldier related programs. NCOs would go to the site to share Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) or Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). But a percentage of them stayed and interactively participated in the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bliss.army.mil/usasma/Journal/publications/2003/2003_winter_point.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} | At squad-leader.com it's not just a Job, its a Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; These highly motivated and interested NCOs became the Peer Mentors who helped other NCOs. The Peer Mentors seldom met in person. The Peer Mentors became a family, they argued, laughed and most of all learned from each other. They would physically call other NCOs to help them solve their problems. The Peer Mentors were all volunteers who just wanted to make things better for the other NCOs. Later the site moved which required the purchase of an URL and software registrations. CSM Elder purchased this software out of his pocket. Anything that would help NCOs of today to stay relevant was provided by CSM Elder and his "merry band" of misfits.

CSM Elder emphasized that there was a gap in knowledge among the enlisted ranks. He created the NCO site to fill this void. The NCO site provided tools and discussions on how to use them, how to find what they needed, and how to digest it all. It was all about what to do and how to do your job. As friends told friends, the site became popular. At one point, the NCO site was used by many NCOs in the Army. Dedicated and passionate volunteers gave their personal time and resources to develop, grow, and make the NCO site relevant. Each NCO had a full-time day job. It was a team effort with many unsung heroes. On August 28, 2003, Cmd Sgt Maj. Dan Elder was awarded the first-ever AKM Pioneer Award by the US Army Chief Information Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=5193 |title=Chief Information officer presents awards based on knowledge |publisher=AR News |date=August 28, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040224162322/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=5193 |archivedate=February 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005 the NCO site migrated at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy into the Battle Command Knowledge System.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bliss.army.mil/usasma/publications/current/nco_net.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} | NCOs Share Ideas, Exeperiences&lt;/ref&gt; Today the NCO Net is a composite of all its very successful predecessors. NCO Net has evolved into a global system of professional forums, knowledge centers, and supporting toolkits for sharing information and experiences, problems solving, improving operational performance and support of the Non-Commissioned Officers Education System (NCOES). Most of the original Peer Mentors continue to volunteer and make NCO Net work.

In addition to platform and leadership changes, NCO Net has two professional forum facilitators who coordinated the transition of the NCO Team site into the NCO Net, brought the volunteer NCO Team Facilitators (formally known as the Peer Mentors) on board, integrated the NCO Net into the U.S. Army Sergeant Major Academy (USASMA) courses, and consistently espoused the benefits of NCO Net to the Senior NCO Leadership of the Army. Given the inheritance of the NCO team and the leadership, persistence and hard work, NCO Net continues to provide a collaborative capability allowing NCOs from across the Army to rapidly get answers to questions and provide peer to peer discussions of important issues to the Army and the NCO Corps.

==Results==
NCO Net posted a 3D animated video clip "Trouble at Checkpoint 4" showing a set of problems unfolding at a checkpoint in Iraq.  The online NCO facilitator led discussion with context specific thought questions on how the soldiers could handle the situation. Over 220 comments from junior to senior ranks were posted within first 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galvin |first=James J. |url=http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/2007/5/Documents/FC_Galvin_0507.pdf |title=Rapid Knowledge Transfer Through the Battle Command Knowledge System |journal=Army Magazine |date=May 2007 |pages=14–16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217193140/http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/2007/5/Documents/FC_Galvin_0507.pdf |archivedate=2011-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4264">'''Bertha of Cornouaille''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1125-55), also known as '''Bertha of Brittany''' ({{lang-br|Berthe Breizh}}), was hereditary Duchess of [[Brittany]] between 1148 until her death and Dowager Countess of Richmond. Bertha was the eldest daughter of [[Conan III, Duke of Brittany|Conan III of Brittany]] by [[Matilda FitzRoy, Duchess of Brittany|Maude]], the [[illegitimate]] daughter of King [[Henry I of England]].{{sfn|Bryan|2016|p=173}} She was the last member of the Breton House of [[Cornouaille]] to reign over Brittany.

==Life==
Bertha was the daughter of [[Conan III of Brittany|Duke Conan III of Brittany]]. She married the son of Stephen of Treguier, [[Alan de Bretagne, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan the Black]]{{sfn|Warren|1977|p=75}} and she lived in England with Alan until his death in 1146. Alan would eventually become Earl of Richmond. After Alan's death she returned to Brittany as Dowager Countess of Richmond and eventually married [[Odo, Viscount of Porhoet]]. When her father Duke Conan III died, on his deathbed Conan III renounced Bertha's brother [[Hoel, Count of Nantes|Hoèl]] as heir,{{sfn|Warren|1977|p=75}} and designated Bertha as his heiress. On Conan III's death she became hereditary Duchess of Brittany.{{sfn|Everard|2004|p=149}}

==Family==
In her first marriage, by 1138, Bertha was married to [[Alan de Bretagne, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan le Noir]] {{efn|Alan le Noir was [[Counts and dukes of Penthièvre|Count of Penthièvre]]. He was created 1st [[Earl of Richmond]] by [[Stephen of England]] for his support against the dispossessed [[Empress Matilda]] during the English Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, G. E., edited by H. A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, &amp; Lord Howard de Walden, ''The Complete Peerage'', London, 1945, vol. x, p. 788.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage between Bertha and Alan may have been intended to bring Brittany into the English Civil War on the side of Stephen.}} 

Bertha and Alan had three children:
*[[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany]], b. 1138, their son and heir, as [[Duchy of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] and [[Earl of Richmond]]{{sfn|Everard|2004|p=149}}
* [[Constance of Penthièvre|Constance]], who married Alan III, Viscount of [[House of Rohan|Rohan]]
* Enoguen, abbess of St. Sulpice

Bertha married her second husband, [[Odo, Viscount of Porhoet]] in about 1148.{{sfn|Warren|1977|p=75}}{{sfn|Everard|2004|p=32}} Bertha and Odo had three children:
* Geoffroy.
* Adelaide (died in 1220), Abbess of [[Abbaye de Fontevraud|Fontevrault]]
* Alix, mistress of [[Henry II, King of England]]

==Succession==
Bertha died between 1158 and 1164, and with her death the ducal throne passed to her son Conan. {{efn|War broke out between Bertha's son [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany]] and her second husband Odo. Odo may have made a compact with his brother-in-law, Hoel of Nantes to divide Brittany between them. However in late 1156 Conan IV was able to defeat Odo and secure his maternal inheritance.}}

'''''Bionic Commando''''', originally released as {{nihongo|'''''Hitler's Resurrection: Top Secret'''''|ヒットラーの復活 &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;TOP SECRET&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;トップシークレット&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;|Hittorā no Fukkatsu: Toppu Shīkuretto|}} in Japan, is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] released by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is based on the 1987 [[arcade game]] [[Bionic Commando (arcade game)|of the same title]].

As [[Nathan "Rad" Spencer|Ladd Spencer]], a member of the FF Battalion, the player has to explore each stage and obtain the necessary equipment to progress.&lt;ref name="topsecretmanualp4"&gt;[http://www.geocities.jp/frnyanko/setsumei/famicom/hitler/hitler.html ''Top Secret: Hitler no Fukkatsu'' Instruction Manual], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd is equipped with a mechanical arm featuring a [[grappling hook|grappling gun]], allowing him to pull himself forward or swing from the ceiling. As such, the series is one of few instances of a [[platform game]] in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, Ladd must use his bionic arm.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bionic Commando.png|thumb|Since Ladd cannot jump in the game, he uses his bionic arm to swing across gaps and obstacles.]]
''Bionic Commando'' is a [[Platform game|platforming video game]] in which the player controls Ladd Spencer, whose mission is to rescue Super Joe and to uncover the mystery behind the Albatros project.&lt;ref name="NP2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Bionic Commando'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |issue=2 |date=September–October 1988 |pages=6–17 |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players navigate through the game via an overworld map, which they can move from one numbered area to another in a [[nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear fashion]]. Starting at Area 0, players can move Ladd's helicopter to any connected area on the map. However, once Ladd's helicopter starts to move, the enemy ground vehicles will also move. Once the helicopter reaches its destination without crossing over the path of an enemy vehicle, the player can choose to "descend" and play that area or to "transfer" to a different area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#nesman|''Bionic Commando'' Instruction Manual]], pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the helicopter intercepts with an enemy vehicle, then Ladd must engage the enemy in an [[overhead perspective]]. In this perspective, players use the [[directional pad]] to navigate Ladd through the scene, and they can use the buttons to shoot down the enemy. One of the enemies will drop an Eagle-shaped mark when killed, which players can collect for an extra [[continue (video games)|continue]].&lt;ref name="NP2" /&gt;

When Ladd descends into an area, players are taken to a "Weapon Selection" screen, which they must choose one weapon, protective piece of equipment, special weapon, and communication device to use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#nesman|''Bionic Commando'' Instruction Manual]], pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; After selecting the equipment, Ladd is then dropped into the area, which the 2D platforming gameplay begins. Players use the control pad to move Ladd left and right, and the buttons to fire at enemies. In the platforming mode, Ladd is unable to jump, so players must use his bionic arm to navigate platforms and obstacles. Players can extend his bionic arm overhead, directly in front, and above at a 45-degree angle. The bionic arm is used to climb up to higher platforms, swing across chasms, and pick up some items. Planning out moves and timing is necessary to complete areas. There are two types of areas in the game - "combat areas" in which players must fight through and "neutral areas" in which additional information and items may be collected. If Ladd fires his weapon in any neutral area, an alarm sounds, and other combatants will start fighting.&lt;ref name="NP2" /&gt;

In the combat areas, Ladd must first find the communications room, which Ladd can use to communicate with comrades and to "wire-tap" and listen in on enemy conversations - gathering important information in the process. After using the communications room, a door to the remainder of the area will open. At this point, the player may need to access another communication room to gain further access, depending on the area. At the end of the area is a room that contains a mechanical core guarded by a [[boss (video games)|boss]]; the player must get past the boss in order to destroy the core, clearing the area. At the end of each area, Ladd obtains additional items or weapons as a bonus, some of which are necessary to access different areas.&lt;ref name="NP2" /&gt; Additional weapons include wider-range guns, 3-way guns, bazookas, and Super Joe's machine gun. Other items include the flare bomb to illuminate dark caves, medicine to restore energy, permits to access certain areas, protective gear that repels enemy bullets, extra communicators, bullets that help extend energy, and [[1-up]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#nesman|''Bionic Commando'' Instruction Manual]], pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Players may need certain items and equipment to access new areas, which may require going back to previous areas to get them.&lt;ref name="Bozon"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bozon |first=Mark |title=Top 100 NES Games – 9.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING. This plot section is strictly about the NES version and not the later games.

''Bionic Commando'' takes place sometime in 1980s and centers on two warring states: the Federation and the Empire. One day, Federation Forces discover top secret documents about "Albatros", an unfinished project developed by the Empire's predecessor, the "Badds"&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Introduction). '''Ladd Spencer''': "In 198X we've found the Badds' top secret material called Albatros which was never put into practice."&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the "Nazz"&lt;ref name=nesbcmanualp4&gt;[[#nesman|''Bionic Commando'' Instruction Manual]], p. 4. "In 198X we've found Nazz's top secret material called Alatros{{sic}}, a plan which was never put into practice."&lt;/ref&gt;). Imperial leader [[Generalissimo]] Killt decides to complete the project himself. Upon learning the Empire's plot, the Federation sends in their national hero, Super Joe (the main character from the 1985 Capcom title ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Commando'' (arcade flyer) |publisher=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&amp;db=videodb&amp;id=219&amp;image=2 |quote=A crack soldier called "Super Joe" who has undergone special training has received a highly secret mission and is about to enter this fierce war.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to infiltrate the Empire, but he is captured. The Federation then sends in a second operative named Ladd Spencer&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Ending). '''Ladd Spencer''': This is Ladd, our mission accomplished.&lt;/ref&gt; to rescue him and to uncover the secret behind the Albatros project.&lt;ref name="nesbcmanualp4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ninpowvol02&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Bionic Commando'' |magazine=[[Nintendo Power]] |issue=2 |date=September–October 1988 |pages=6–17 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |location=[[Redmond, WA]] |issn=1041-9551 |oclc=18893582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd is a member of the FF (Double Force) Battalion, a team of commandos specially trained to use wired guns to infiltrate enemy bases.&lt;ref name=topsecretmanualp4 /&gt;

Ladd starts in Area 1, in which he is told that the first several areas, already infiltrated by Federation troops, have communication devices and rooms that can be used to stay in contact with the Federation and for [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] to gain [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] from the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 1). '''MA-1''': "This is MA-1. I've been waiting for you. Many of our agents have already infiltrated the sectors you will be travelling. To contact them you must find a communication room. Your success depends on staying in touch. You should be able to wiretap and intercept important information."&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching Area 3, Ladd finds through enemy intelligence that Super Joe has been transported to the Imperial "disposal area",&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 3). '''Anonymous Imperial Commander''': You transported Joe? '''Anonymous Imperial Soldier''': Yeah, over to disposal area. Heroes always look good.&lt;/ref&gt; which a Federation spy later confirms.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 5). '''Federation Spy''': "Are you from the Federation? I'm a spy for the Federation. I just saw that Joe was taken away, they headed towards area 8."&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon reaching the disposal area, an Imperial commander tells Ladd that Super Joe has been transported elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 9). '''Imperial Commander''': "Your effort is wasted. We've just transferred Joe to another location."&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Ladd rescues Super Joe,&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 7). '''Ladd''': "Mr. Joe, I've come to rescue you." '''Super Joe''': Thank you. I'm sorry to cause so much trouble."&lt;/ref&gt; who gives Ladd information that the Empire is trying to do what the Badds could not accomplish - to build a powerful laser cannon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 7). '''Super Joe''': "Captain, something terrible is going to happen. Remember there was a plan in the Badds' secret documents' about building a huge laser cannon. The empire is trying to accomplish what the Badds' couldn't do."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the person with the most pertinent information about its completion, Master-D (Hitler), is dead, and Generalissimo Killt has been unsuccessfully trying to resurrect him. Super Joe tells Ladd that they must stop Killt before he succeeds, and he asks Ladd to accompany him to the Imperial base located in Area&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 7). '''Super Joe''': "However they cannot complete this project because the person with the key knowledge is dead. His name is Master-D. To finish the project, Killt is trying to resurrect him but has been unable to do so. Captain, we must stop him before this project gets too big. I'm going to Area&amp;nbsp;12 now. Can you fight with me?"&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ladd reaches the Imperial base, Super Joe tells him to break the power system in order to release two power barriers that are guarding the incomplete project.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Super Joe''': "This is Super Joe. This area is divided by 2 barriers. In order to break the barriers, you should break the power system. Find the power system."&lt;/ref&gt; After doing so, Super Joe tells Ladd to defeat Killt and escape while he goes to destroy the base's power source.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Super Joe''': "This is Joe. I'm going to destroy the power source of the base. Defeat the leader and get out!"&lt;/ref&gt; When Ladd reaches Killt's chamber, Killt tells him that he is too late and that he has completed the Albatros project without needing to resurrect Master-D, turning off the device that would have resurrected him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Generalissimo Killt''': "But you're too late. The Albatros has begun to move. Not necessary to wait for Master-D to revive. I've just cut off the switch for the revival device. Master-D will never rise again."&lt;/ref&gt; As Killt is about to attempt to kill Ladd, electric shocks begin to occur around the holding tank containing Master-D's body, reviving Master-D and instantly killing Killt. Master-D then exits the tank and approaches Ladd, saying that he will use the Federation's forces to take over the world.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Master-D''': You woke me from a long sleep. Now I have no more use for you. I'll take over your army and rule the world.&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd vows to fight against Master-D, who calls Ladd a "damn fool" and unveils the Albatros.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Master-D''': "What, you're going to fight against me? You damn fool. If that's what you want, I'll show you the horror of the Albatros!"&lt;/ref&gt; After destroying the Albatros, Ladd encounters a dying comrade named Hal, who gives Ladd a [[bazooka]] and tells him that Master-D is escaping and that he needs to shoot the bazooka into the cockpit of Master-D's escape chopper.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Hal''': "I'm Hal, Master-D is...leaving. I won't last long. I take this bazooka. Go get him! Th ... there is a chopper down here. Aim at the cockpit as you jump. You can do it!"&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd uses his bionic arm to swing himself towards Master-D's escape chopper and fires the bazooka into the cockpit; upon doing so, Ladd screams: "Your number's up! Monster!" Then, in a series of slow-motion frames, the game shows Master-D's head explode.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

The alarm inside the Imperial base then sounds off, saying: "This base will explod{{sic}} in 60&amp;nbsp;seconds."&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Area 12). '''Voice''': This base will explod in 60&amp;nbsp;seconds. Evacuate right away.&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd manages to escape the base when he realizes that Super Joe is still inside, and he runs back in to rescue him. The Federation's commander then orders the full evacuation of the base, but then, as the base explodes, a chopper appears with Ladd holding on to Super Joe while hooked on the chopper with his bionic arm.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Ending). '''Ladd''': "Is Joe still inside?" [runs back into the base] '''Commander''': "What happened to the Captain? We cannot wait any longer. We are going to escape now!" '''MA-1''': "Please wait just little longer... Hey, what's that?"&lt;/ref&gt; Ladd then informs the commander that he has Joe and that they are returning to the Federation base.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Ending). '''Ladd''': "This is Ladd. Our mission accomplished. Super Joe is safe. We are returning now."&lt;/ref&gt; The game's ending then shows Federation troops around Ladd and Super Joe as they celebrate their victory. Super Joe then says how the Federation has a new hero in Ladd Spencer while saying how different he feels from the praise given by his comrades.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Ending). '''Super Joe''': "Battle has ended and we have a new hero now. I was feeling different as I received the blessings from comrades."&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after showing the ending credits, the game forwards to August&amp;nbsp;2, 2010, which an old Super Joe recalls the entire story and hope that it will live on.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#videogame|Bionic Commando]]'' (Ending). '''Super Joe''': "Now, so much time has elapsed and I'm old now. I think it's time for me to tell you the whole story. I hope this story will be told for a long time. 2010.8.2 Joe."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Localization===
[[Image:Bionic-killt-comparison.PNG|thumb|left|The use of the Nazi Swastika in the Japanese Famicom version (above) was replaced with a new avian symbol for the English NES version (below)]]
For the release of the international version of the game, several changes were made. All references to [[Nazism]] in text and imagery were removed for the English localization. The Empire in the Japanese version was actually a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] nation and the Imperial Army's insignia was a Nazi Swastika with a thunderbolt behind it. In the English version, the Nazis were referred as the "Badds" (though the back-story in the American version's manual referred to them as the "Nazz").&lt;ref name=nesbcmanualp4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/17/bionic-commando-rearmed-preview|title=Bionic Commando Rearmed Preview|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=2008-01-17|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Army's Swastika insignia was changed into a new one resembling an eagle, and the leader of the villains, originally called Weizmann in the Japanese version,&lt;ref name=topsecretmanualp4 /&gt; was renamed Killt.

One of the most prominent differences involves the ultimate antagonist of the game, who is meant to be a revived [[Adolf Hitler in popular culture|Adolf Hitler]] in the Japanese version. For the English version, the character was renamed "Master-D".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a notably gory ending sequence in which Hitler's face explodes, which was kept intact in the English version.&lt;ref&gt;Sandvik, Per Arne (2002-11-15) [http://encyclopedia-obscura.com/gameshorror.html The Horror!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703075819/http://www.encyclopedia-obscura.com/gameshorror.html |date=2013-07-03 }} Encyclopedia Obscura. Retrieved on 2008-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the word "damn" was left in an end-game dialog sequence of the North American release, which was a rare amount of profanity for an American NES release.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

In addition to the graphical changes, the difficulty of the game was rebalanced and some of the areas were made less difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elite Coder|date=|url=http://www.elitecoder.com/bionic/famiver.html|title=Bionic Commando Famicom Version|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The music for the game was created by videogame music composer Junko Tamiya, who was credited under the pseudonym "Gondamin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Bionic Commando "The Soundtrack" |year=2009 |publisher=[[Sumthing Else Music Works]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two songs from the Arcade versions are used in some areas. The music for the original arcade game was developed by [[Harumi Fujita]]. Tamiya adapted two of the original arcade tracks (The "Bionic Commando Theme" and "The Powerplant") and expanded the soundtrack by adding several more new songs in the console versions for the Japanese Famicom and the NES ports of the game.&lt;ref name="Tamiya"/&gt;

According to Capcom employee [[Ben Judd]], the game did not sell well in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2456412/why-bionic-commando-is-finally-back-in-2008-and-how-the-psp-played-two-key-roles/|title=Why 'Bionic Commando' Is Finally Back In 2008 - And How The PSP Played Two Key Roles|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-bionic-commando-s-ben-judd-56732.phtml|title=Destructoid interview: Bionic Commando's Ben Judd|work=destructoid|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remakes and re-releases===
A [[Bionic Commando (Game Boy)|portable adaptation]] of ''Bionic Commando'' was released for the [[Game Boy]] in {{vgy|1992}}. The Game Boy version is based on the NES game, featuring the same gameplay and stages, as well as a similar plot, but changes the present day setting of the NES version into a futuristic one. A second remake, titled ''[[Bionic Commando Rearmed]]'', was developed by [[GRIN (company)|GRIN]] and released in {{vgy|2008}} as a downloadable title for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Personal Computer|PC]].

The original NES version of ''Bionic Commando'' is one of three NES games featured in the [[Game Boy Advance]] compilation ''Capcom Classics Mini-Mix'', the other two games being ''[[Strider (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Strider]]'' and ''[[Mighty Final Fight]]''.

==Novelization==
The game was [[novelized]] as ''Bionic Commando'' by J. B. Stamper as part of the [[Worlds of Power]] series of novels based on the NES version. The main character is identified as Jack Markson, who loses an arm when ninjas attack his hotel room and kidnap Super Joe. The Federation replaces his missing limb with a bionic arm that has a grappling hook and a number of other gadgets that are not featured in the game, like a flame thrower and a device that forces prisoners to tell the truth. Like most books in the series, violence was toned down to non-lethality in most cases (he usually shoots enemy soldiers with tranquilizers), although certain events, like the deaths of Hal and Killt, are kept. Much of the game's middle is skimmed over in order to fit it all into the book.

'''''British Tar''''' was launched at Shields in 1792 and made five voyages as a [[whaler]] and several as a [[West Indiaman]]. She then became a general trader. She was lost on 29 January 1818.

==Career==
''British Tar'' enters ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' in 1792 with J. Fitch, master, Mangles, owner, and trade London–South Seas fisheries.&lt;ref name=LR1792&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015004281252?urlappend=%3Bseq=56 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1792), Seq.№525.]&lt;/ref&gt;

For her first whale fishing voyage ''British Tar'' sailed to Peru under the command of Jedediah Fitch. On 8 February 1793 she was at [[Saint Helena|St Helena]], homeward bound, and she arrived in England with 219 tuns of [[sperm oil]].&lt;ref name=bswf&gt;[https://whalinghistory.org/bv/voyages/ British Southern Whale Fishery - Voyages: ''British Tar''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On her second voyage she sailed in 1793 for Peru under the command of Blythe (or Thomas Bligh). She returned on 29 July 1794.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt;
	
Her third voyage was again under the command of Bligh (or Blythe, or Blight),&lt;ref&gt;Clayton (2014), Addendum p.3&lt;/ref&gt; but this time he sailed her for the Pacific Ocean, where she was reported to be in August–September 1796. She returned to England on 8 May 1797.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt;
	
''British Tar'' then spent several years sailing to the West Indies. John and James Mangles still owned her and she sailed to San Domingo, but more often to Jamaica.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt;

On 8 January 1802 Captain Innis sailed ''British Tar'' to the [[Galápagos Islands]] for her fourth whaling voyage. At some Point Captain Rowe replaced Innis. Homeward bound, she left St Helena on 4 May 1804, and arrived in England on 17 July.
		
Captain Charles Harrax (or Harrass, or Harrat, or Haddock),&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;Clayton (2014), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; left England on 12 November 1804 and returned on 15 April 1807. This is the last whaling voyage for ''British Tar''{{'}}s that has any details.&lt;ref name=bswf/&gt; However, she may continued to whale into 1810.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

The ''Register of Shipping'' for 1810, in its supplemental pages, shows ''British Tar'' with Anthony, master, J. Pirie, owner, and trade London–Guadeloupe.&lt;ref name=RS1810&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214333?urlappend=%3Bseq=103 ''Register of Shipping'' (1810), "B" supplemental pages.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811 she underwent a large repair, and her trade became London–Newcastle.&lt;ref name=RS1812&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214317?urlappend=%3Bseq=106 ''Register of Shipping'' (1812), "B" supplemental pages.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
The ''Register of Shipping'' for 1818 shows ''British Tar'' with J. Pirie, owner and master, and trade London–Madeira. The entry has a line through it and the notation "Lost".&lt;ref name=RS1818&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214259?urlappend=%3Bseq=106 ''Register of Shipping'' (1818), Seq. №570.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''[[Lloyd's List]]'' reported on 3 February 1818 that a gale on 29 January 1818 had caused the total loss of ''British Tar'', John Pirie, master, between [[Lymington]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset]]. She was on her return voyage from Sierra Leone to London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735028?urlappend=%3Bseq=261 ''Lloyd's List'' Seq. №5251.]&lt;/ref&gt; All on board, at least 14 people, were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=(untitled) |day_of_week=Monday |date=9 February 1818 |page_number=2 |issue=10375 |column=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after ''British Tar'' was lost, the body of a four-foot long African lizard was found on the beach by Hordle Cliff, near Milford. Apparently this animal was the largest of the kind ever brought to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Magazine'' (1819), Vol. 53, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[knot theory]], the '''cinquefoil knot''', also known as '''Solomon's seal knot''' or the '''pentafoil knot''', is one of two knots with [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] five, the other being the [[three-twist knot]].  It is listed as the '''5&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knot''' in the [[Alexander-Briggs notation]], and can also be described as the (5,2)-[[torus knot]].  The cinquefoil is the closed version of the [[double overhand knot]].

The cinquefoil is a [[prime knot]].  Its [[writhe]] is 5, and it is [[invertible knot|invertible]] but not [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Solomon's Seal Knot|urlname=SolomonsSealKnot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Alexander polynomial]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;,
its [[Alexander polynomial#Alexander.E2.80.93Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = z^4 + 3z^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;,
and its [[Jones polynomial]] is
:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = q^{-2} + q^{-4} - q^{-5} + q^{-6} - q^{-7}.&lt;/math&gt;
These are the same as the Alexander, Conway, and Jones polynomials of the knot 10&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the [[Kauffman polynomial]] can be used to distinguish between these two knots.

The name &amp;ldquo;cinquefoil&amp;rdquo; comes from the five-petaled flowers of plants in the genus ''[[Potentilla]]''.

The '''Cologne Diocesan Feud''' ({{lang-de|Kölner Stiftsfehde}}, or ''Stiftsfehde zu Köln''), also called the '''Neuss War''' (''Neusser Krieg'') or '''Burgundian War''' (''Burgundischer Krieg''), was a conflict, which began in 1473, between the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Ruprecht of the Palatinate (Cologne)|Ruprecht of the Palatinate]] and the ''[[Landstände]]'' of his [[Archbishopric of Cologne|archbishopric]] that began in 1473. As a result of the involvement of [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and, eventually, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] the matter at times assumed a European dimension. It finally ended when Ruprecht died in 1480.

== Background ==
The background was that, after the death of {{Interlanguage link multi|Dietrich II of Moers|de|3=Dietrich II. von Moers}}, the estates in the secular dominion ("Archbishopric") of the Archbishop of Cologne banded together to form so-called "hereditary estate agreements" (''Erblandesvereinigungen''). The ''Erblandesvereinigung'' in the Diocese itself also joined the ecclesiastical territory of [[Vest Recklinghausen]]. In the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] the estates agreed their own ''Erblandesvereinigung''. These agreements had henceforth to be sworn by new archbishops in their role as territorial rulers. The ''Erblandesvereinigung'' envisaged that, in this case of important fiscal and public policy issues, the sovereign had to seek the permission of estates or ''[[Landstände]]''. Although Ruprecht came from the centre of the  [[cathedral chapter]], it was not long before he ignored the ''Erblandesvereinigung'' he had sworn. Instead he hired mercenaries from the Palatinate, with whom he intended to recapture the estates enfeoffed by previous archbishops. When he let a dispute occur over the raising of a poll and hearth tax on the town of [[Zons]], which was enfeoffed to the cathedral chapter, the conflict broke out openly. He also tried to take the town of [[Neuss]] by force. The ''Landstände'' saw the actions of the Archbishop as an infraction of ''Erblandesvereinigung'', relied on their right to opposition and deposed Ruprecht. In his place, in the spring of 1473, they elected [[Hermann of Hesse (1450-1508)|Hermann of Hesse]] as the administrator (''Stiftsverweser'') of the Diocese. The estates had strong support from the cities of Cologne and Neuss.

== Course ==
Ruprecht did not accept this and was also supported by the small and middle-ranking estates. In 1473, Hessian troops under [[Johann Schenk zu Schweinsberg]], sent to support the administrator, failed in their attempt to capture the town of [[Brilon]] in the Duchy of Westphalia, but then played an important role in the defence of Neuss. Ruprecht's situation improved as a result, because he was able to win the backing of Charles the Bold. The latter was even appointed as the "hereditary advocate" (''Erbvogt'') of the Diocese.

For his part, Charles the Bold saw a favourable opportunity to extend his power at the expense of the Diocese. The majority of the neighbouring territories were already in Burgundian hands. In addition, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] belonged to the allies. In 1473 after Charles the Bold also came into possession of the [[Duchy of Guelders]], the existence of the Diocese became threatened. The same year there was an attempt at the "Trier Meeting" (''Trierer Treffen'') to clarify the position of Charles the Bold and the Emperor and the prince-electors. This attempt at negotiation proved unsuccessful. In April and May 1474, [[Ahrweiler]] was besieged by troops sympathetic to Ruprecht. The town walls and guns fended the attacks off.

Charles the Bold marched out with an army that was one of the largest and best equipped of its time. In his support was [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick the Victorious]] of the Palatinate, brother of Archbishop Ruprecht, and the dukes of [[Duchy of Guelders|Guelders]] and [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]]. The allied troops jointly numbered about 13,000 to 20,000 men. Instead of marching on [[Cologne]] as Ruprecht had thought, the army advanced on Neuss, a town defended by Hermann of Hesse and his 4,000-man body of troops. Neuss was besieged in 1474/75 by the enemy forces (see the [[Siege of Neuss]]). The siege was ended by the delivery of an [[imperial ban]] by Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick III]]. This ended the Neuss War, but not the diocesan feud.

After the withdrawal of Burgundian troops, Ruprecht of the Palatinate still had available several supporters in the Upper Diocese (''Oberstift'') and in the Duchy of Westphalia. So he did not give up. However, his position was severely weakened by the death of Frederick the Victorious in 1476 and Charles the Bold a year later. In the territory of the Diocese itself he was now only able to control [[Kempen, Germany|Kempen]] and [[Altenahr]] whilst, outside, he still had several Westphalian estates. In 1478, he was taken prisoner by Hessian troops. However, initially the Hessians were unable to make gains in Westphalia. The Duke of Cleves, who fought on Ruprecht's side, was even able to occupy[[Arnsberg]] and [[Eversberg]] for a time.

After his capture, Ruprecht announced he was prepared to give up the office of archbishop. However, confirmation from the Pope in light of the difficult church legal situation - Ruprecht was not just the sovereign, but first and foremost a bishop - was taking a long time to arrive. Ruprecht's renunciation of the archbishop's office was also questionable, because he had come under external pressure. The death of Ruprecht on 26 July 1480 ended this tricky situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23671">'''Cryobiology''' is the branch of [[biology]] that studies the effects of low [[temperature]]s on living things within Earth's [[cryosphere]] or in science. The word cryobiology is derived from the Greek words κρῧος [kryos], "cold", βίος [bios], "life", and λόγος [logos], "word" (hence science). In practice, cryobiology is the study of biological material or systems at temperatures below normal. Materials or systems studied may include [[protein]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], or whole [[organism]]s. Temperatures may range from moderately [[Hypothermia|hypothermic]] conditions to [[cryogenic]] temperatures.

== Areas of study ==
At least six major areas of cryobiology can be identified: 1) study of cold-adaptation of [[microorganism]]s, plants ([[Hardening (botany)|cold hardiness]]), and animals, both [[invertebrates]] and [[vertebrates]] (including [[hibernation]]), 2) [[cryopreservation]] of cells, tissues, [[gamete]]s, and [[embryo]]s of animal and human origin for (medical) purposes of long-term storage by cooling to temperatures below the freezing point of water.  This usually requires the addition of substances which protect the cells during [[freezing]] and thawing ([[cryoprotectant]]s), 3) preservation of organs under hypothermic conditions for [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]], 4) lyophilization ([[Freeze drying|freeze-drying]]) of [[pharmaceutical]]s, 5) [[cryosurgery]], a (minimally) invasive approach for the destruction of unhealthy tissue using cryogenic gases/fluids, and 6) physics of [[supercooling]], [[ice]] [[nucleation]]/growth and mechanical engineering aspects of [[heat transfer]] during cooling and warming, as applied to biological systems. Cryobiology would include [[cryonics]], the low temperature preservation of humans and mammals with the intention of future revival, although this is not part of mainstream cryobiology, depending heavily on speculative technology yet to be invented. Several of these areas of study rely on [[cryogenics]], the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the production and use of very low [[temperature]]s

==Cryopreservation in nature==
Many living organisms are able to tolerate prolonged periods of time at temperatures below the freezing point of water.  Most living organisms accumulate [[cryoprotectant]]s such as [[Antifreeze protein|antinucleating proteins]], [[polyols]], and [[glucose]] to protect themselves against [[Frost#Effect on plants|frost damage]] by sharp ice crystals. Most plants, in particular, can safely reach temperatures of &amp;minus;4&amp;nbsp;°C to &amp;minus;12&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Bacteria===
Three species of bacteria, ''[[Carnobacterium pleistocenium]]'', ''[[Chryseobacterium greenlandensis]]''. and ''[[Herminiimonas glaciei]]'', have reportedly been revived after surviving for thousands of years frozen in ice.
Certain bacteria, notably ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]'', produce specialized proteins that serve as potent ice nucleators, which they use to force ice formation on the surface of various fruits and plants at about &amp;minus;2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maki LR, Galyan EL, Chang-Chien MM, Caldwell DR | title=Ice Nucleation Induced by Pseudomonas syringae | journal=Applied Microbiology  | volume=28 | issue=3 | year=1974 | pages=456–459 |pmid=4371331 | pmc=186742 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The freezing causes injuries in the epithelia and makes the nutrients in the underlying plant tissues available to the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zachariassen KE, Kristiansen E | title=Ice nucleation and antinucleation in nature | journal=Cryobiology | volume=41 | issue=4 | year=2000 | pages=257–279 |pmid=11222024  | doi=10.1006/cryo.2000.2289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Listeria]]'' grows slowly in temperatures as low as -1.5&amp;nbsp;°C and persists for some time in frozen foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodsafetywatch.com/public/499.cfm Food Safety Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
Many plants undergo a process called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]] which allows them to survive temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°C for weeks to months.

===Animals===

====Invertebrates====
[[Nematodes]] that survive below 0&amp;nbsp;°C include ''Trichostrongylus colubriformis'' and ''Panagrolaimus davidi''. [[Cockroach]] nymphs (''Periplaneta japonica'') survive short periods of freezing at -6 to -8&amp;nbsp;°C. The red flat bark beetle (''[[Cucujus]] clavipes'') can survive after being frozen to -150&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/life/alaskana/story/813668.html Scientist finds fungus gnats survive winter half-frozen | Alaskana | ADN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923173620/http://www.adn.com/life/alaskana/story/813668.html |date=2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fungus gnat]] ''Exechia nugatoria'' can survive after being frozen to -50&amp;nbsp;°C, by a unique mechanism whereby ice crystals form in the body but not the head. Another freeze-tolerant beetle is ''[[Upis ceramboides]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF18/1877.html Alaska beetles survive 'unearthly' temperatures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[insect winter ecology]] and [[antifreeze protein]]. Another invertebrate that is briefly tolerant to temperatures down to -273&amp;nbsp;°C is the [[tardigrade]].

The larvae of ''[[Haemonchus contortus]]'', a [[nematode]], can survive 44 weeks frozen at -196&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Vertebrates====
For the [[wood frog]] (''Rana sylvatica''), in the winter, as much as 45% of its body may freeze and turn to ice. "Ice crystals form beneath the skin and become interspersed among the body's skeletal muscles. During the freeze, the frog's breathing, blood flow, and heartbeat cease. Freezing is made possible by specialized proteins and glucose, which prevent intracellular freezing and dehydration." &lt;ref&gt;[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rana_sylvatica.html ADW: Lithobates sylvaticus: INFORMATION&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002118796_frogs14.html Nation &amp; World | Looking to frozen frogs for clues to improve human medicine | Seattle Times Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The wood frog can survive up to 11 days frozen at -4&amp;nbsp;°C.

Other vertebrates that survive at body temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°C include painted turtles (''[[Chrysemys picta]]''), [[gray tree frog]]s (''Hyla versicolor''), [[box turtles]] (''Terrapene carolina'' - 48 hours at -2&amp;nbsp;°C), [[spring peeper]] (''Pseudacris crucifer''), [[garter snakes]] (''[[Thamnophis sirtalis]]''- 24 hours at -1.5&amp;nbsp;°C), the [[chorus frog]] (''Pseudacris triseriata''), [[Siberian salamander]] (''Salamandrella keyserlingii'' - 24 hours at -15.3&amp;nbsp;°C),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://virgil.ruc.dk/~cryolab/research.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228060221/http://virgil.ruc.dk/~cryolab/research.html |archivedate=2008-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; European common lizard (''[[Lacerta vivipara]]'') and Antarctic fish such as ''[[Pagothenia borchgrevinki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://http-server.carleton.ca/~kbstorey/ftverts.htm ftvert&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.units.muohio.edu/cryolab/ Cryobiology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Antifreeze proteins cloned from such fish have been used to confer frost-resistance on [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] plants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Hibernating [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s may have abdominal temperatures as low as  −2.9&amp;nbsp;°C (26.8&amp;nbsp;°F), maintaining subzero abdominal temperatures for more than three weeks at a time, although the temperatures at the head and neck remain at 0&amp;nbsp;°C or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes |first=Brian M. |date=30 June 1989 |title=Freeze Avoidance in a Mammal: Body Temperatures Below 0°C in an Arctic Hibernator |journal=Science |volume=244 |pages=1521–1616 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |url=http://users.iab.uaf.edu/~brian_barnes/publications/1989barnes.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-23 |doi=10.1126/science.2740905 |issue=4912 |pmid=2740905 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233837/http://users.iab.uaf.edu/~brian_barnes/publications/1989barnes.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied cryobiology==

===Historical background===
[[Image:Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Boyle]]
Cryobiology history can be traced back to antiquity. As early as in 2500 BC, low temperatures were used in Egypt in medicine. The use of cold was recommended by [[Hippocrates]] to stop bleeding and swelling. With the emergence of modern science, [[Robert Boyle]] studied the effects of low temperatures on animals.

In 1949, bull [[semen]] was [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] for the first time by a team of scientists led by [[Christopher Polge]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Polge, AU Smith, AS Parkes, Revival of spermatozoa Effective vitrification and dehydration at low temperatures
Nature, 164 (1949), p. 666&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a much wider use of [[cryopreservation]] today, with many [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[Biological tissue|tissues]] and [[cell (biology)|cell]]s routinely stored at low [[temperature]]s. Large organs such as [[heart]]s are usually stored and transported, for short times only, at cool but not freezing temperatures for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. Cell suspensions (like blood and semen) and thin tissue sections can sometimes be stored almost indefinitely in [[liquid nitrogen]] temperature ([[cryopreservation]]). Human sperm, eggs, and [[embryo]]s are routinely stored in [[fertility]] research and treatments. Controlled-rate and slow freezing are well established techniques pioneered in the early 1970s which enabled the first human embryo frozen birth (Zoe Leyland) in 1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable steps, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human, animal, and cell biology – 'freezing down' a sample to better preserve it for eventual thawing, before it is deep frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen. Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo, sperm, stem cells, and general tissue preservation in hospitals, veterinary practices, and research labs. The number of live births from 'slow frozen' embryos is some 300,000 to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilized]] births. Dr Christopher Chen, Australia, reported the world’s first pregnancy using slow-frozen oocytes from a British controlled-rate freezer in 1986.

[[Cryosurgery]] (intended and controlled tissue destruction by ice formation) was carried out by James Arnott in 1845 in an operation on a patient with cancer. Cryosurgery is not common.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[File:Low temperature bank2.jpg|thumb|Low temperature bank, [[NASU Institute of Cryobiology and Cryomedicine Issues|Institute for Problems of Cryobiology and Cryomedicine]] of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]]]
===Preservation techniques===
Cryobiology as an [[applied science]] is primarily concerned with low-temperature preservation. [[Therapeutic hypothermia|Hypothermic]] storage is typically above 0&amp;nbsp;°C but below normothermic (32&amp;nbsp;°C to 37&amp;nbsp;°C) mammalian temperatures. Storage by cryopreservation, on the other hand, will be in the &amp;minus;80 to &amp;minus;196&amp;nbsp;°C temperature range. Organs, and tissues are more frequently the objects of hypothermic storage, whereas single cells have been the most common objects cryopreserved.

A rule of thumb in hypothermic storage is that every 10&amp;nbsp;°C reduction in temperature is accompanied by a 50% decrease in [[Aerobic exercise|oxygen consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Raison JK | title=The influence of temperature-induced phase changes on the kinetics of respiratory and other membrane-associated enzyme systems
| journal=J Bioenerg  | volume=4 | issue=1 | year=1973 | pages=285–309  | pmid=4577759  | doi=10.1007/BF01516063
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Hibernation#Hibernating animals|hibernating animals]] have adapted mechanisms to avoid [[Metabolism|metabolic imbalance]]s associated with hypothermia, hypothermic organs, and tissues being maintained for transplantation require special preservation solutions to counter [[acidosis]], depressed [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium pump]] activity. and increased intracellular [[calcium]]. Special organ preservation solutions such as [[Viaspan]] (University of Wisconsin solution), [[histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate|HTK]], and Celsior have
been designed for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mühlbacher F, Langer F, Mittermayer C | title=Preservation solutions for transplantation | journal=Transplant Proc  | volume=31 | issue=5 | year=1999 | pages=2069–70  | pmid=10455972  | doi=10.1016/S0041-1345(99)00265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These solutions also contain ingredients to minimize damage by [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], prevent [[edema]], compensate for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] loss, etc.

Cryopreservation of cells is guided by the "two-factor hypothesis" of American cryobiologist [https://www.physics.iupui.edu/~starman/Starman/Cryobiology/Mazur/Mazur.htm Peter Mazur], which states that excessively rapid cooling kills cells by intracellular ice formation and excessively slow cooling kills cells by either [[electrolyte]] [[toxicity]] or mechanical crushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mazur P | title=The role of intracellular freezing in the death of cells cooled at supraoptimal rates | journal=Cryobiology  | volume=14 | issue=3 | year=1977 | pages=251–72  | pmid=330113  | doi=10.1016/0011-2240(77)90175-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During slow cooling, ice forms extracellularly, causing water to [[osmosis|osmotically]] leave cells, thereby [[dehydration|dehydrating]] them. Intracellular ice can be much more damaging than extracellular ice.

For [[red blood cell]]s, the optimum cooling rate is very rapid (nearly 100&amp;nbsp;°C per second), whereas for [[stem cell]]s the optimum cooling rate is very slow (1&amp;nbsp;°C per minute). Cryoprotectants, such as [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] and [[glycerol]], are used to protect cells from freezing. A variety of cell types are protected by 10% dimethyl sulfoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hunt CJ, Armitage SE, Pegg DE | title=Cryopreservation of umbilical cord blood: 1. Osmotically inactive volume, hydraulic conductivity and permeability of CD34(+) cells to dimethyl sulphoxide | journal=Cryobiology  | volume=46 | issue=1 | year=2003 | pages=61–75  | pmid=12623029  | doi=10.1016/S0011-2240(02)00180-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryobiologists attempt to optimize cryoprotectant concentration (minimizing both ice formation and toxicity) and cooling rate. Cells may be cooled at an optimum rate to a temperature between &amp;minus;30 and &amp;minus;40&amp;nbsp;°C before being plunged into liquid nitrogen.

Slow cooling methods rely on the fact that cells contain few [[Nucleation|nucleating]] agents, but contain naturally occurring vitrifying substances that can prevent ice formation in cells that have been moderately dehydrated. Some cryobiologists are seeking mixtures of cryoprotectants for full [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] (zero ice formation) in preservation of cells, tissues, and organs. Vitrification methods pose a challenge in the requirement to search for cryoprotectant mixtures that can minimize toxicity.

Human [[gametes]] and two-, four- and eight-cell [[embryos]] can survive [[cryopreservation]] at -196&amp;nbsp;°C for 10 years under well-controlled laboratory conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Freezing | publisher = Pacific Fertility Center  | year = 2010 | url = http://www.pacificfertilitycenter.com/welcome/lab_freeze.php | accessdate = 2010-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryopreservation in humans with regards to infertility involves preservation of embryos, sperm, or oocytes via freezing.  Conception, ''in vitro'', is attempted when the sperm is thawed and introduced to the 'fresh' eggs, the frozen eggs are thawed and sperm is placed with the eggs and together they are placed back into the uterus or a frozen embryo is introduced to the uterus.  Vitrification has flaws and is not as reliable or proven as freezing fertilized sperm, eggs, or embryos as traditional slow freezing methods because eggs alone are extremely sensitive to temperature.  Many researchers are also freezing ovarian tissue in conjunction with the eggs in hopes that the ovarian tissue can be transplanted back into the uterus, stimulating normal ovulation cycles. In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin's lymphoma and cryopreserved in a (Planer, UK) controlled-rate freezer and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated  after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Livebirth after orthotopic transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue | publisher = J Donnez, M M Dolmans, D Demylle, P Jadoul, C Pirard, J Squifflet, B Martinez-Madrid, A Van Langendonckt | year = 2004 | url = http://www.saintluc.be/presse/communiques/2004/2004-tamara-lancet-complet.pdf | accessdate = 2015-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Therapeutic hypothermia]], e.g. during [[heart surgery]] on a "cold" heart (generated by cold perfusion without any ice formation) allows for much longer operations and improves recovery rates for patients.

==Scientific societies==
The [[Society for Cryobiology]] was founded in 1964 to bring together those from the biological, medical, and physical sciences who have a common interest in the effects of low temperatures on biological systems.  As of 2007, the Society for Cryobiology had about 280 members from around the world, and one-half of them are US-based.  The purpose of the Society is to promote scientific research in low temperature biology, to improve scientific understanding in this field, and to disseminate and apply this knowledge to the benefit of mankind. The Society requires of all its members the highest ethical and scientific standards in the performance of their professional activities. According to the Society's [[bylaw]]s, membership may be refused to applicants whose conduct is deemed detrimental to the Society; in 1982, the bylaws were amended explicitly to exclude "any practice or application of freezing deceased persons in the anticipation of their reanimation", over the objections of some members who were cryonicists, such as [[Jerry Leaf]].&lt;ref name="cryobiology"&gt;{{cite news

This international meeting offers opportunities for presentation and discussion of the most up-to-date research in cryobiology, as well as reviewing specific aspects through symposia and workshops.  Members are also kept informed of news and forthcoming meetings through the Society newsletter, ''News Notes''.  The 2011–2012 president of the Society for Cryobiology was John H. Crowe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Officers &amp; Governors | publisher = Society for Cryobiology | url = http://www.societyforcryobiology.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=1245 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927160016/http://www.societyforcryobiology.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=1245 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-09-27 | accessdate = 2010-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society for Low Temperature Biology was founded in 1964 and became a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] in 2003&lt;ref&gt;([[Charity Commission]] for England &amp; Wales No. 1099747)&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of promoting research into the effects of low temperatures on all types of organisms and their constituent cells, tissues, and organs.  As of 2006, the society had around 130 (mostly British and European) members and holds at least one annual general meeting.  The program usually includes both a [[symposium]] on a topical subject and a session of free communications on any aspect of low-temperature biology.  Recent symposia have included long-term stability, preservation of aquatic organisms, cryopreservation of embryos and [[gamete]]s, preservation of plants, low-temperature [[microscopy]], [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] (glass formation of aqueous systems during cooling), [[freeze drying]] and [[Biomedical tissue|tissue banking]].  Members are informed through the Society Newsletter, which is presently published three times a year. &lt;!-- date The present chair (2010–2011) of the Society for Low Temperature Biology is Hugh Pritchard.--&gt;

== Journals ==
''Cryobiology'' (publisher: [[Elsevier]]) is the foremost scientific publication in this area, with about 60 refereed contributions published each year. Articles concern any aspect of low-temperature biology and medicine (e.g. freezing, [[Freeze drying|freeze-drying]], hibernation, cold tolerance and adaptation, cryoprotective compounds, medical applications of reduced temperature, cryosurgery, [[hypothermia]], and perfusion of organs).

''Cryo Letters'' is an independent UK-based rapid communication journal which publishes papers on the effects produced by low temperatures on a wide variety of biophysical and biological processes, or studies involving low-temperature techniques in the investigation of biological and ecological topics.

''Biopreservation and Biobanking'' (formerly Cell Preservation Technology) is a [[peer-reviewed]] quarterly [[scientific journal]] published by [[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] dedicated to the diverse spectrum of preservation technologies including [[cryopreservation]], dry-state ([[Cryptobiosis#Anhydrobiosis|anhydrobiosis]]), and [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|glassy-state]] and hypothermic maintenance.  ''Cell Preservation Technology'' has been renamed ''Biopreservation and Biobanking'' and is the official journal of International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

===Club career===
Denis John Boocker made his début for Wakefield Trinity, and scored a [[try]] in the 15-8 victory over [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], [[Wakefield]] on Saturday 25 October 1947, he is second on Wakefield Trinity's all-time tries scored in a season list, scoring 32-tries in [[1953–54 Northern Rugby Football League season]], a record later extended to 38-tries by [[Fred Smith (rugby league born 1935)|Fred Smith]], and [[David Smith (1970s rugby league)|David Smith]],  he appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the [[1974–75 Northern Rugby Football League season|1974–75 season]] all goals, whether; [[Try#Conversion|conversion]]s, [[Penalty (rugby)#Penalties in rugby league|penalties]], or [[Drop goal#Rugby league|drop-goal]]s, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the [[1949–50 Northern Rugby Football League season|1949–50 season]], the archaic [[Field goal (rugby)#Rugby league|field-goal]] was also still a valid means of scoring points.

==Contemporaneous Article Extract==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: File:Denis John Boocker Try.jpg|thumb|Denis John Boocker --&gt;A typical action picture of Denis Boocker taken during [[Wakefield Trinity|Trinity]]'s game with [[Broughton Rangers|Belle Vue Rangers]] in August 1935, when the Welsh-Australian scored four tries. It shows the famous "swallow-dive" which Boocker used so effectively on many of his try-scoring occasions.
Born in [[Gelli, Rhondda|Gelli]], Wales, Booker [[Emigration|emigrated]] to Australia two years later. Commenced his football career with [[Kurri Kurri, New South Wales|Karri-Karri]] ([[sic]]) at seventeen. After four years in the [[Armed forces|Forces]] he joined the [[Newtown Jets|Newtown Club]] from where Trinity signed him in 1947.
He made his début for [[Wakefield Trinity|Trinity]] on 25 October 1947, against [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]]. After a period as {{rlp|ce}}-threequarter he tried the {{rlp|wg}} position and soon proved himself one of the best in the game. Made five appearances for [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]], including one against [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]]. Extended the [[Wakefield Trinity|club]] try-scoring record just prior to his return "[[Down Under|down under]]" in April 1954 – and he left in [[Wakefield]] many friends and exciting memories.&lt;ref name="Lindley, John 1960 Pages 46 &amp; 51"/&gt;

The following examples of questions that might be considered in each field illustrate the differences between the fields:
*Descriptive ethics: What do people think is right?
*Meta-ethics: What does "right" even mean?
*Normative (prescriptive) ethics: How should people act?
*Applied ethics: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice?

==What is descriptive ethics?==
Descriptive ethics is a form of [[empirical]] research into the attitudes of individuals or groups of people. In other words, this is the division of philosophical or general ethics that involves the observation of the moral decision-making process with the goal of describing the phenomenon. Those working on descriptive ethics aim to uncover people's beliefs about such things as values, which actions are right and wrong, and which characteristics of moral agents are virtuous. Research into descriptive ethics may also investigate people's [[ideal (ethics)|ethical ideal]]s or what actions societies reward or punish in [[law]] or [[politics]]. What ought to be noted is that culture is generational and not static. Therefore, a new generation will come with its own set of morals and that qualifies to be their ethics. Descriptive ethics will hence try to oversee whether ethics still holds its place.

Because descriptive ethics involves empirical investigation, it is a field that is usually investigated by those working in the fields of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] or [[anthropology]]. Information that comes from descriptive ethics is, however, also used in philosophical arguments.

[[Value theory]] can be either normative or descriptive but is usually descriptive.

==Lawrence Kohlberg: An example of descriptive ethics==
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] is one example of a psychologist working on descriptive ethics. In one study, for example, Kohlberg questioned a group of boys about what would be a right or wrong action for a man facing a moral dilemma: should he steal a drug to save his wife, or refrain from theft even though that would lead to his wife's death?&lt;ref&gt;Kohlberg, Lawrence, (1971). "Stages in Moral Development as a Basis for Moral Education." In C.M. Beck, B.S. Crittenden, and E.V. Sullivan, Eds. ''Moral Education: Interdisciplinary Approaches''. Toronto: Toronto University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kohlberg's concern was not which choice the boys made, but the moral reasoning that lay behind their decisions. After carrying out a number of related studies, Kohlberg devised a theory about the development of human moral reasoning that was intended to reflect the moral reasoning actually carried out by the participants in his research. Kohlberg's research can be classed as descriptive ethics to the extent that he describes human beings' actual moral development. If, in contrast, he had aimed to describe how humans ought to develop morally, his theory would have involved prescriptive ethics.

'''Edwin Adams Cotto''' (1978 &amp;ndash; March 7, 2005) was a Puerto Rican small-time drug dealer.  In 2002 he was accused, along with reporter [[Laura Hernandez]], of [[drug trafficking]] from [[Puerto Rico]] to the [[Dominican Republic]]. He was killed in the [[Higüey Prison fire]].

==Biography==
Not much is known about Adams Cotto's life prior to being caught by the Dominican authorities. He was, apparently, friends with Hernandez and her husband Marcos Irizarry.  In 2002, he joined Hernandez, Irizarry and others on a boat trip to the Dominican Republic, allegedly to travel as tourists.  However, the boat was raided by Dominican police and drugs were found. The group were arrested and Adams Cotto was subsequently convicted and sentenced to seven years in jail.

Adams Cotto and the others in the group made a series of unsuccessful appeals against their sentences.  By 2004, Adams Cotto had been diagnosed with [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. An appeal for clemency was refused.

On March 7, 2005, a prison riot in [[Higuey, Dominican Republic|Higuey]] jail resulted in a fire in which 130 people, including Adams Cotto, were killed.

[[File:eleanor-thornton.jpg|thumb|right|Eleanor Thornton]]

'''Eleanor Velasco Thornton''' (15 April 1880 – 30 December 1915) was an English actress and artist's model.

Eleanor Velasco Thornton was the name adopted by Nelly Thornton, born at 18 Cottage Grove, Stockwell. Her father was Frederick Thornton, an Australian telegraph engineer; her mother was Sarah Ann Thornton.

Despite stories that her mother was Spanish, possibly circulated due to her dark complexion, her mother's family were from humble origins in the City of London, and the names Eleanor and Velasco appear to be merely names she adopted when she started working in the office of a motoring magazine, ''Car Illustrated'', after leaving school.

At 22, she was the secretary of [[John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|John Edward Scott-Montagu]], who became the second [[Baron Montagu of Beaulieu]] in 1905. She became his mistress and they had an illegitimate daughter, Joan Eleanor Thornton, whom she gave up for adoption. Thornton posed for sculptor [[Charles Sykes (sculptor)|Charles Sykes]] and may&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rroc.org.au/library/eleanor_spirit.html|title=RROC(A) Library: Eleanor Thornton - In Body or Spirit?|website=Rroc.org.au|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been the model for his ''[[Spirit of Ecstasy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1896156/Wings-of-desire-the-secret-love-affair-that-inspired-Rolls-Royces-flying-lady.html Wings of desire: the secret love affair that inspired Rolls-Royce's flying lady.] Chris Hastings, ''[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]'', 20 April 2008. Retrieved 27 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which is used as the bonnet/hood ornament on cars manufactured by [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]], as well as a precursor sculpture, ''The Whisperer''.

She drowned with hundreds of other passengers on 30 December 1915 when the [[SS Persia (1900)|SS ''Persia'']], on which she was travelling with Montagu through the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] on the way to [[India]], was torpedoed without warning by the [[German Empire|German]] [[U-boat]] {{SMU|U-38||2}}, commanded by [[Max Valentiner]]. Montagu survived the sinking.
The Probate Registry for June 1916 shows that her sister Rose (1887–1945), by that time the last surviving member of her immediate family, administered her will. Amongst her effects was probably a similar silver model of the Spirit Of Ecstasy, which it is presumed Rose kept. Rose married Gordon Willis Hayter in 1923, and many years later, the silver model was stolen from the home of Dorothy Hayter, Gordon's second wife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">'''Enterocoely''' (adjective forms: '''enterocoelic''' and '''enterocoelous''') is a process by which some animal [[embryonic development|embryos develop]]. In enterocoely, a [[mesoderm]] (middle layer) is formed in a developing [[embryo]], in which the [[coelom]] forms from pouches "pinched" off of the digestive tract (also known as the embryonic gut, or [[archenteron]]). This type of coelom formation occurs in [[deuterostome]] animals, which for this reason are also known as '''enterocoelomates'''.

Enterocoelous development begins once the embryo reaches the [[gastrula]] phase of development. At this point, there are two layers of cells: the [[ectoderm]] (outermost) and the [[endoderm]] (innermost) layers. The mesoderm begins to form as two "pockets" of tissue (one above the endoderm, and one below) are formed via folding of the endoderm. These "pockets" begin to grow larger, and as they do so, they extend towards each other. When the two "pockets" of cells meet, the mesoderm is formed – a complete layer of tissue right in between the endoderm and ectoderm layers. This then leads to the formation of a coelom.

Enterocoelous development is the stage of embryological development of deuterostomes in which the coelom forms. The stage starts with the gastrula; as the archenteron forms, pockets of migrating cells also form, creating another layer between the endoderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm. These pockets gradually expand to form the coelom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/glossarye.html PAE Virtual Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[protostome]]s, the body cavity is formed by [[schizocoely]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6635">'''''Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda'''''{{ref|FHvCoA}} was a 1957 [[California Courts of Appeal]] case in the [[Fellowship of Humanity]], an organization of [[Humanism|humanists]], sought a [[tax exemption]] from [[Alameda County, California]] on the ground that they used their property "solely and exclusively for religious worship." Despite the group's [[Nontheism|nontheistic]] beliefs, the court determined that the activities of the [[Fellowship of Humanity]], which included weekly Sunday meetings, were analogous to the activities of [[Theism|theistic]] churches and thus entitled to an exemption.{{ref|Kalka1}}

==Significance==
Along with ''[[Washington Ethical Society v. District of Columbia]]'', this was one of the earliest cases establishing the right in the U.S. of nontheistic institutions that function like traditional theistic religious institutions to be treated similarly to theistic [[religious]] institutions under the law.

This case was cited by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Hugo Black]] in the decision for ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', in an [[obiter dictum]] listing "[[secular humanism]]" as being among "religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the [[existence of God]]." 

The ''Fellowship of Humanity'' case itself referred to ''[[humanism]]'' but did not mention the term ''[[secular humanism]].'' Nonetheless, this case was cited by Justice Black to justify the inclusion of Secular Humanism in the list of religions in his note. Presumably Justice Black added the word ''secular'' to emphasize the non-theistic nature of the ''Fellowship of Humanity'' and distinguish their brand of humanism from that associated with, for example, [[Christian humanism]].

Black's statement was somewhat misleading in that ''Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda'' did not address the question of whether the secular humanist ideas of the Fellowship of Humanity were religious; it merely determined that Fellowship of Humanity functioned like a church and so was entitled to similar protections. Subsequent cases such as ''[[Peloza v. Capistrano School District]]'' have clarified that "neither the Supreme Court, nor this circuit, has ever held that evolutionism or secular humanism are 'religions' for [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] purposes." Unlike the question of tax exemption, Establishment Clause issues rest on whether or not ideas themselves are primarily religious.

The decision for a subsequent case, ''Kalka v. Hawk'' et al., offered this commentary:{{ref|Kalka2}}

:The Court's statement in ''Torcaso'' does not stand for the proposition that humanism, no matter in what form and no matter how practiced, amounts to a religion under the First Amendment. The Court offered no test for determining what system of beliefs qualified as a "religion" under the First Amendment. The most one may read into the ''Torcaso'' footnote is the idea that a particular non-theistic group calling itself the "Fellowship of Humanity" qualified as a religious organization under California law.

==Rationale for decision==
Rationale for the decision included the following. First, the court argued that the state is not allowed to focus on the content of belief, but only on its function:
:It is perfectly obvious that any type of statutory exemption that discriminates between types of religious belief--that discriminates... on the basis of the content of such belief--would offend both the federal and state constitutional provisions... Under the constitutional provision the state has no power to decide the validity of the beliefs held by the group involved... Thus the only inquiry in such a case is the objective one of whether or not the belief occupies the same place in the lives of its holders that the orthodox beliefs occupy in the lives of believing majorities, and whether a given group that claims the exemption conducts itself the way groups conceded to be religious conduct themselves. The content of the belief, under such test, is not a matter of governmental concern... Under this test the belief or nonbelief in a Supreme Being is a false factor... "religion" fills a void that exists in the lives of most men. Regardless of why a particular belief suffices, as long as it serves this purpose, it must be accorded the same status of an orthodox religious belief.

Second, the court argued that the tax exemption for churches must be justified in terms of non-religious aspects:
:Direct tax subsidies of any church or sect or of all churches and sects are undoubtedly prohibited by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]... A tax exemption is, obviously, an indirect subsidy... it is not easy to justify logically the tax exemption provisions... a logical and legal justification of such provisions must be found, and... in interpreting such provisions the court should be very careful not to limit them by such a narrow construction that by the very limitations imposed, constitutionality is adversely affected... It is sound public policy to encourage, by tax exemption as well as by direct subsidy, private undertakings in the fields that are properly within the realm of governmental responsibility. Thus, welfare, charitable and private educational grants and subsidies are valid. All churches that warrant the exemption perform some of these tasks. Therefore, churches can be indirectly subsidized for the performance of these tasks. But this indirect subsidy is not for the activities that are peculiarily religious in the sense of dogma or doctrine, but for the many other things all churches do... If the words "religious worship" are given a narrow, limited meaning, so as to require a belief in and adoration of a Supreme Being, then grave doubts would exist as to the constitutionality of the section... If the state cannot constitutionally subsidize religion under the First Amendment, then it cannot subsidize theism. If the state can constitutionally subsidize those functions of religious groups which are not related to "religion" in its narrow sense, then it must subsidize those nontheistic groups which perform the same functions.

[[Image:Icehockeyfight.jpg|thumb|A fight during a junior league ice hockey game between [[Frölunda HC]] and [[VIK Västerås HK]]]]
'''Fighting in ice hockey''' is an established tradition of [[Ice hockey|the sport]] in North America, with a long history that involves many levels of [[amateur sports|amateur]] and [[Professional sports|professional]] play and includes some notable individual fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting is usually performed by [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]], or "goons"—players whose role is to fight and intimidate—on a given team,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is governed by a complex system of unwritten rules that players, [[Coach (ice hockey)|coaches]], [[Official (ice hockey)|officials]], and the media refer to as "the code".&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights.

Unique among North American professional team sports, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] players outright for fighting&lt;ref name="Bernstein_31"/&gt; (although they may do so for more flagrant violations as part of a fight) but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection.&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

Physical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as [[Checking (ice hockey)|checking]] and prohibited techniques such as [[elbowing]], [[high-sticking]], and [[Cross-checking (hockey)|cross-checking]], is linked to fighting.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xxi"/&gt; The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Should The NHL Ban Fighting In Hockey? |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/sports/nhl-ban-fighting-hockey/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level have no plans to eliminate fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-province/20070327/282213711371635|title=Fighting part of hockey: Bettman: Canucks players agree with commissioner about the role of fisticuffs|last=McIntyre|first=Gordon|date=27 March 2007|access-date=27 March 2017|journal=[[The Province|The Vancouver Province]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fans and players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question &gt; Should Fighting Be Completely Banished?|publisher=2011/12 Player Poll|url=http://www.playerspoll.ca/results/20112012-results/on-ice/should-fighting-be-completely-banished|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222131442/http://www.playerspoll.ca/results/20112012-results/on-ice/should-fighting-be-completely-banished|archivedate=22 February 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games,&lt;ref name="Barrie Examiner"&gt;{{cite news | author = Barrie Examiner | title = Keep fighting, hockey fans say | journal =Barrie Examiner | date = 5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but considerable opposition to fighting exists and efforts to eliminate it continue.

Fighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in popularity in 19th century Canada.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"/&gt; The implementation of some features, such as the [[Hockey rink|blue lines]] in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt;

In 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56, which formally regulated fighting, or "[[Bare-knuckle boxing|fisticuffs]]" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a [[Penalty (ice hockey)#Types of penalties|five-minute major penalty]]. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; Promoters such as [[Tex Rickard]] of [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], who also promoted [[boxing]] events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised marketing campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current NHL rulebook, the archaic reference to "fisticuffs" has been removed; fighting is now governed under Rule 46 in the NHL rulebook. Referees are given considerable latitude in determining what exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2010–11|publisher=National Hockey League|year=2010|pages=69–74|url=http://www.nhl.com/league/ext/rules/2010-2011_Rulebook.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a face-shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Mike|title=NHL to adopt penalty for removing visor in fight|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|date=19 June 2013|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-to-implement-a-minor-penalty-for-players-that-remove-their-visors-prior-to-fighting/|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Kahane160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahane and Shmanske|2012|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was often brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game's early years that it "was probably more like [[Rugby football|rugby]] on skates than it was modern hockey."&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the [[Original Six]] era, when fewer teams existed than in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Mike|title=History of fighting in hockey|work=The Denver Post|date=1 December 2013|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/history-of-fighting-in-hockey/|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[1967 NHL expansion|NHL's expansion]] in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2006 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an NHL preseason game between the [[Boston Bruin]]s and [[St. Louis Blues]] in 1969, Bruins defenceman [[Ted Green]] and Blues left wing [[Wayne Maki]], attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 2006 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legends of Hockey — NHL Player Search — Player — Wayne Maki|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13497|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[World Hockey Association]] [[Birmingham Bulls]] enforcer [[Dave Hanson (ice hockey)|Dave Hanson]], known for his 11-year professional career, fought [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bobby Hull]] and in the process got Hull's wig caught in his knuckles.

The rise of the "[[Philadelphia Flyers#1972–1979: Broad Street Bullies|Broad Street Bullies]]" in the [[1973-74 NHL season|1973–74]] and [[1974-75 NHL season|1974–75]] [[Philadelphia Flyers]] served as an example for future NHL enforcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armour|first=Nancy|title=Rules, equipment change fighting's impact on NHL|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=16 May 2011|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2011-05-16-2070638346_x.htm|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average number of fights per game rose above 1.0 during the 1980s, peaking at 1.17 in 1983–84.&lt;ref name="Kahane160"/&gt; That season, a bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoff matchup between the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversary of the Good Friday Massacre|publisher=The Sports Network|date=18 April 2014|url=http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Anniversary+of+the+Good+Friday+Massacre+&amp;id=449725|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 11 players were ejected.

Many teams signed enforcers to protect and fight for smaller offensive stars.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights in the 1990s included the [[Red Wings – Avalanche brawl|Brawl in Hockeytown]] in 1997, in which the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]] engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and [[Claude Lemieux]] and [[Goaltender|goalies]] [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkak|first=Ashley|title=17 Years Later, A Look Back At The Greatest Fight In Red Wings History|publisher=[[WWJ-TV]]|date=26 March 2014|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/03/26/17-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-greatest-fight-in-red-wings-history/|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a game between the Avalanche and Red Wings involved a fight between goaltenders [[Chris Osgood]] and Roy after which they received minor, major, and game misconduct penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHL Recap (Colorado-Detroit)|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/scoreboards/1998/04/01/recap.detroit.colorado.html|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2 April 1998|accessdate = 30 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619203307/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/scoreboards/1998/04/01/recap.detroit.colorado.html|archivedate=19 June 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a Philadelphia Flyers – [[Ottawa Senators]] [[Flyers–Senators brawl|game]] resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches.  The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.&lt;ref name="Maaddi"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Maaddi | first=Rob | title = Flyers bully Senators in 5-3 victory | work = USA Today | url = https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/games/2004-03-06-philly-ottawa_x.htm | accessdate = 15 April 2007 | date=6 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009–10, the number of fights in the NHL declined to .58 per game. A further decrease in the frequency of fighting happened over the next five seasons. The 2014–15 season had 0.32 fights per game, as teams placed a greater emphasis on skating ability and fewer young players became enforcers.&lt;ref name="decline"/&gt;

Since the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1971, the league created the "Third Man In" rule which attempts to eliminate the [[bench-clearing brawl]] by providing for the ejection of the first player who joins a fight already in progress, unless a match penalty is being assessed to a player already engaged in that fight.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"&gt;{{Harvnb|NHL Rulebook 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"&gt;{{Harvnb|NHL Rulebook 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the "Instigator" rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight,&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"/&gt; was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/the_code/timeline.html|title=Fighting in Hockey: A Timeline|date=27 February 2009|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304123020/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/the_code/timeline.html|archivedate=4 March 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and penalties==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Frölunda Västerås U18 Fight(2).jpg|thumb|right|A fight during a [[Frölunda HC]] – [[VIK Västerås HK]] game]] --&gt;
Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty.&lt;ref name="broke"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldschmied and Espindola|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahane and Shmanske|2012|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.&lt;ref name="broke"/&gt;

The rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must definitely drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also "drop" or shake off their protective gloves to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players should not remove their own helmet before engaging in a fight due to risk of head injury or else both of the opposing players get an extra two penalty minutes. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_46"/&gt; In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach's lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2006-11-23-notebook_x.htm |title=NHL suspends three players, fines two coaches for Caps-Thrashers melee |author=Associated Press |work=[[USA Today]] |date=23 November 2006 |accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American professional leagues===
[[Image:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|[[Shawn Thornton]] (left) fighting [[Wade Brookbank]] (right)]]
In the NHL, [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), [[ECHL]], [[Southern Professional Hockey League]], and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, wrapping tape around one's hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"/&gt;

A player who commits three major penalties (including fighting) during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_4"/&gt; In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.&lt;ref name="NHL_Rulebook_70"/&gt;

===Collegiate, European, and Olympic===
In Division I and Division III [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|pp=37–38, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Mike|title=Rules against fighting in NCAA hockey don't deter cheap shots|work=The Denver Post|date=1 December 2013|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/rules-against-fighting-in-ncaa-hockey-dont-deter-cheap-shots/|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Match penalty (the player is ejected from the game and another player serves 5 minutes in addition to any other penalties imposed in the penalty box) for a player who starts fisticuffs.
* Minor penalty (2 minutes) for a player who retaliates with a blow or attempted blow.
* Game misconduct penalty (ejection from the game) in addition to any other penalties for any player who is the first to intervene in fisticuffs which are already in progress.
* Double minor penalty (4 minutes), major penalty and game misconduct penalty (5 minutes and ejection from the game), or match penalty (at the discretion of the referee) for a player who continues fisticuffs after being told by officials to stop.
* Misconduct penalty (10 minutes; second misconduct penalty in one game means automatic ejection) for a player who intentionally takes off his gloves in fisticuffs.

Despite the bans, there have been fights in European leagues. In 2001, a game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "some of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial, which eventually escalated into a 36-man [[Bench-clearing brawl|bench-clearing brawl]]. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers' coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 29 December 2006 | publisher = bbc.co.uk | date=10 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 24 December 2007 | publisher = cbc.ca | date=14 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/other_sports/1171302.stm|title=BBC Sport – Other Sports – League punishes teams over brawl|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) had a bench-clearing brawl between [[Vityaz Chekhov]] and [[Avangard Omsk]] in 2010. Officials were forced to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Lenta.ru | title = Матч КХЛ был сорван массовой дракой хоккеистов | url = http://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/01/09/scuffle/ | accessdate = 9 January 2010 | publisher = lenta.ru | year = 2010 | language = Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/9/23770.html|title=This is hockey? |publisher=KHL.ru|date=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.&lt;ref name="bothteamslose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/10/23771.html|title=Both teams lose|publisher=KHL.ru|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punch-up in Piestany]] was a notable instance of fighting in international play. A 1987 [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] game between Canada and the Soviet Union was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987: Canada, USSR brawl at World Junior Hockey Tournament|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1987-punch-up-in-piestany|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcers==
{{Main article|Enforcer (ice hockey)}}
The role of "enforcer" on a hockey team is unofficial.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix" /&gt; Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the [[pest (ice hockey)|pest]], who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wagenheim|first=Jeff|title=As NHL enforcers fade, tough guys will always be needed|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=14 October 2014|url=https://www.si.com/nhl/2014/10/13/vanishing-enforcers-tough-guys-hockey-fights|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw "reaction penalties", and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fights often start in response to an opponent's rough play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|pp=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game-related reasons===
[[Image:hockeyfight.JPG|thumb|right|A large fight in an [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] hockey game between the [[Sudbury Wolves]] and [[Ottawa 67s]]]]

Of the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is retaliation.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_34"/&gt; Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a [[Power play (sporting term)|power play]] due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_36"/&gt; This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_38"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimidation is an important element of a hockey game&lt;ref name="Bernstein_xix" /&gt; and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the late 1950s, [[Gordie Howe]] helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating [[Lou Fontinato]], a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Legends of Hockey | year = 2007 | title = Lou Fontinato | journal = Legends of Hockey | url = http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=12622 | accessdate = 25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Schwartz | first=Larry | year = 2007 | title = The ageless wonder | publisher = [[ESPN]] | url = http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014262.html | accessdate = 7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"/&gt;

For teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason is the protection of star players. Fighting within the game can also send a message to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is sometimes seen as a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by [[Dave Semenko]], [[Marty McSorley]], and others, and [[Brett Hull]], who was protected by [[Kelly Chase]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.&lt;ref name="scott20150115"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/01/bobby-farnham-pittsburgh-penguins-longform | title=The Ivy Leaguer who fought his way to the NHL | work=USA Today | date=15 January 2015 | accessdate=15 January 2015 | author=Scott, Nate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal reasons===
Many young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[Farm team|farm systems]] that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.&lt;ref name="Botterill"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Botterill | first=Cal | year = 2004 | title = The Psychology of Professional Hockey | journal = Athletic Insight | publisher = University of Winnipeg | url = http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol6Iss2/ProfessionalHockey.htm | accessdate = 9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.{{r|scott20150115}}

There are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rivalry that produced many fights was between the [[National Hockey League rivalries#Colorado Avalanche vs. Detroit Red Wings|Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s]].&lt;ref name="Dater_Feud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dater|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on game==
Statistics indicate that fights are detrimental to teams' play, or have inconsequential benefits. Since the 1979–80 season, teams in the bottom three of fighting-related major penalties have finished at the top of the regular-season standings 10 times and have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, while teams in the top three have won the regular season and Stanley Cup only twice each. One statistical analysis calculated that winning a fight benefited a team by about 1/80th of a win in the standings. Two others showed that fights increase scoring, but do so evenly for both teams so do not significantly affect wins.&lt;ref name="klein20120122"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/sports/hockey/flying-fists-dont-add-up-to-victories.html | title=Numbers Indicate That Skill Usually Packs a Bigger Punch Than Fists | work=The New York Times | date=22 January 2012 | accessdate=18 June 2012 | author=Klein, Jeff Z. | page=SP9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to ban fighting==
The Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine announced in ''Position Statement'' in 1988 that "Fighting does cause injuries, which range from fractures of the hands and face to lacerations and eye injuries. At present, it is an endemic and ritualized blot on the reputation of the North American game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kissick|first=James|title=Position Statement: Violence and Injuries in Ice Hockey|publisher=Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine|year=2007|origyear=1988|url=http://casem-acmse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/violence-in-hockey-20071.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=19 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114122248/http://casem-acmse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/violence-in-hockey-20071.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism often arises after single acts of violence committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, [[Colton Orr]] of the [[New York Rangers]] fought with [[Todd Fedoruk]] of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season with [[Derek Boogaard]]. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban.&lt;ref name="Dater"&gt;{{cite news | last=Dater | first=Adrian | title = Debate? Let's drop the gloves | journal = [[The Denver Post]] | url = http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_5514998 | date = 25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue;&lt;ref name="Lebrun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Lebrun | first=Pierre | title = Fighting the good fight | journal = [[Edmonton Sun]] | date = 24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey.&lt;ref name="Dater"/&gt; Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]], have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.&lt;ref name="Naylor"&gt;{{cite news | last=Naylor | first=David | title = Fight On? | journal = The Globe and Mail | date = 23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports journalists have articulated the idea with increasing frequency that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike,&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=P. | title = Hockey brawls ruin a once grand game | journal = [[Windsor Star]] | date = 27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a "knee-jerk" reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game,&lt;ref name="Jenkinson"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Jenkinson | first=Mike | title = NHL no place for fighting | journal = [[Ottawa Sun]] | date = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is simply a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gough | first=David | title = Fighting not necessary for hockey | journal = Courier Press (Wallaceburg, Ontario) | date = 4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Sport and Social Issues''' Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewinson and Palma|2012|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuc|first=Chris|title=Why is fighting vanishing from the NHL?|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=6 February 2016|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-hockey-fighting-fading-spt-0207-20160206-story.html|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various politicians and hockey figures have expressed opposition to fighting. In 2012, [[David Johnston]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], said that fighting should not be part of the sport.&lt;ref name="govgen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/01/26/pol-gg-hockey-fighting-pnp.html | title=Fighting has no place in hockey, GG says | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=26 January 2012 | accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IIHF president [[Rene Fasel]] has protested against fighting, deeming it "[[Neanderthal]] behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeBrun|first=Pierre|title=Hockey community debates merits of fighting|work=The Globe and Mail|date=23 March 2007|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey-community-debates-merits-of-fighting/article1072626/|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Gretzky]], considered by many to be the greatest hockey player of all time, has often spoken out against fisticuffs, although he expressed support for fighting in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burstyn|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]], at a 2007 press conference broadcast on CBC Sports, said, "Fighting has always had a role in the game&amp;nbsp;... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we need to look at just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/03/26/bettman-figting.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=Fighting not up for debate: Bettman | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a [[school board]] trustee in [[London, Ontario]] attended a [[London Knights]] game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it.  This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the [[Ontario Hockey League]], where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues"/&gt; On the advice of its [[Medical Health Officer]], the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Pollett | first=Graham L. | title = Correspondence | journal = Middlesex-London Health Unit | date = 9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known death directly related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the [[Whitby Dunlops]], a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's [[Major League Hockey]], died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, he hit his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/senior-player-dies-from-injury-sustained-in-on-ice-fight/|title=Senior Player Dies From Injury Sustained in On-Ice Fight|last=Hackel|first=Stu |author2=Klein, Jeff Z. |date=2 January 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/562096|title=Editorial: Fighting has no place in hockey|last=Bishop|first=Dr. Pat |date=6 January 2009|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/489744|title=Hockey player's death prompts helmet questions|date=2 January 2009|work=The Hamilton Spectator|agency=Canadian Press|accessdate=7 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121194213/http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/489744|archivedate=21 January 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighters such as [[Bob Probert]] and Boogaard have been posthumously diagnosed with [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], a [[degenerative disease]] of the brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head.&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-brain-going-bad.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp "Derek Boogard - A Brain 'Going Bad'"], ''The New York Times'', 5 December 2011. Part 3 of a three-part series chronicling Boogard's life and the posthumous research on his brain. Retrieved 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol.&lt;ref name="bad"/&gt; His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.&lt;ref name="bad"/&gt;

Beginning in the 2016–17 season, the American Hockey League will impose a fighting major counter, similar to the [[National Basketball Association]]'s unsportsmanlike technical foul counter and soccer's accumulated cards.  A player who collects ten major penalties for fighting during the season will be suspended one game, and will be suspended one game for each fighting major for the next three penalties (the 11th, 12th, and 13th fighting majors).  A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting.  If one player involved in the fight is charged with an instigator penalty, the opponent will not have the fighting major count towards suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theahl.com/board-of-governors-concludes-annual-meeting-p202959 |title=Board of Governors Concludes Annual Meeting|date=7 July 2016 |publisher=American Hockey League|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etiquette==
There are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as granting a "free pass".&lt;ref name="Bernstein_65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcer [[Darren McCarty]] described fighters as being divided into "heavyweights" and "light heavyweights", and said that players in the former category "end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarty and Allen|2014|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not assaulting referees or linesmen.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsmanship is also an important aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.

==Tactics==
Fighting tactics are governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as "going for it", in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include Gordie Howe's tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]], was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time [[Buffalo Sabres]] enforcer [[Rob Ray]] to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is commonly referred to as the "Rob Ray Rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Jim|title=Ray: 'It's not something I planned'|publisher=ESPN|date=19 January 2004|url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=1711851&amp;columnist=kelley_jim|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein_63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officials' role==
Throughout a game, the referee and linesmen have a role in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Chris|title=Report: NHL wants linesmen to break up more fights before they start|publisher=CBS Sports|date=15 October 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/report-nhl-wants-linesmen-to-break-up-more-fights-before-they-start/|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an official's best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL's rule book, but often are guided by "common sense", according to officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title=NHL Fight Time Never Fun for Linesmen Who Must Restore Order|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 March 1988|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-26/sports/sp-206_1_fight|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blackhawks-Flames scrum.JPG|thumb|Officials trying to break up a brawl between [[Calgary Flames]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]]]]
In a single fight situation the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together.  If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/Sport/OPM_English.pdf|title=Officiating Procedures Manual|accessdate=2 March 2009|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a multiple fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight at a time using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will communicate with each other which fight to break up. In a multiple fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

The '''Future of Humanity Institute''' ('''FHI''') is an [[interdisciplinary]] research centre at the [[University of Oxford]] investigating big-picture questions about humanity and its prospects. It was founded in 2005 as part of the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]] and the [[Oxford Martin School]].&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/institutes/future_humanity |title=Humanity's Future: Future of Humanity Institute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Oxford Martin School |publisher= |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its director is philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], and its research staff and associates include futurist [[Anders Sandberg]], engineer [[K.&amp;nbsp;Eric Drexler]], economist [[Robin Hanson]], and [[Giving What We Can]] founder [[Toby Ord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/about/staff/ |title=Staff |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing an office and working closely with the [[Centre for Effective Altruism]], the Institute's stated objective is to focus research where it can make the greatest positive difference for humanity in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/about/mission/ |title=About FHI |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aeon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeon.co/magazine/world-views/ross-andersen-human-extinction |title=Omens |author=Ross Andersen |date=25 February 2013 |website=Aeon Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It engages in a mix of academic and outreach activities, seeking to promote informed discussion and public engagement in government, businesses, universities, and other organizations.

== History ==
Nick Bostrom established the Institute in November 2005 as part of the Oxford Martin School, then the James Martin 21st Century School.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; Between 2008 and 2010, FHI hosted the Global Catastrophic Risks conference, wrote 22 academic journal articles, and published 34 chapters in academic volumes. FHI researchers have been mentioned over 5,000 times in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=%22nick+bostrom%22+OR+%22anders+sandberg%22+OR+%22Toby+ord%22+OR+%22eric+drexler%22&amp;oq=%22nick+bostrom%22+OR+%22anders+sandberg%22+OR+%22Toby+ord%22+OR+%22eric+drexler%22&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i53.1575.17127.0.17432.83.23.6.53.0.0.158.1361.20j3.23.0...0.0...1ac.1.cmZ5I2Aaf_s&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=%22nick+bostrom%22+OR+%22anders+sandberg%22+OR+%22Toby+ord%22+OR+%22eric+drexler%22 |newspaper=Google News |location= |publisher= |accessdate=30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have given policy advice at the [[World Economic Forum]], to the private and non-profit sector (such as the [[Macarthur Foundation]], and the [[World Health Organization]]), as well as to governmental bodies in Sweden, Singapore, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Bostrom and bioethicist [[Julian Savulescu]] also published the book ''Human Enhancement'' in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Nick Bostrom |date=18 July 2007 |archivedate=21 December 2012 |title=Achievements Report: 2008-2010 |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/19900/Achievements_Report_2008-2010.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221144029/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/19900/Achievements_Report_2008-2010.pdf |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute |page= |docket= |accessdate=31 March 2014 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recently, FHI has focused on the dangers of advanced [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).  In 2014, its researchers published several books on AI risk, including Stuart Armstrong's ''Smarter Than Us'' and Bostrom's ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Piesing |date=17 May 2012 |title=AI uprising: humans will be outsourced, not obliterated |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-05/17/the-dangers-of-an-ai-smarter-than-us |newspaper=Wired |location= |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coughlan |first=Sean |date=24 April 2013 |title=How are humans going to become extinct? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22002530 |newspaper=BBC News |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Existential risk ==
{{main article|Existential risk}}
The largest topic FHI has spent time exploring is [[global catastrophic risk]], and in particular ''existential risk''. In a 2002 paper, Bostrom defined an "existential risk" as one "where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nick Bostrom |date=March 2002 |title=Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards |url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume9/risks.html |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=308-314 |doi= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes scenarios where humanity is not directly harmed, but it fails to [[space colonization|colonize space]] and make use of the observable universe's available resources in humanly valuable projects, as discussed in Bostrom's 2003 paper, "Astronomical Waste: The [[opportunity cost|Opportunity Cost]] of Delayed Technological Development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nick Bostrom |date=November 2003 |title=Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html |journal=Utilitas |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=308–314 |doi= 10.1017/s0953820800004076|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bostrom and Milan Ćirković's 2008 book ''Global Catastrophic Risks'' collects essays on a variety of such risks, both natural and anthropogenic. Possible catastrophic risks from nature include [[supervolcano|super-volcanism]], [[impact event]]s, and energetic astronomical events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[cosmic ray]]s, [[solar flare]]s, and [[supernova]]e. These dangers are characterized as relatively small and relatively well understood, though [[pandemic]]s may be exceptions as a result of being more common, and of dovetailing with technological trends.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ross Andersen |date=6 March 2012 |title=We're Underestimating the Risk of Human Extinction |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/ |newspaper=The Atlantic |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aeon"/&gt;

Synthetic pandemics via weaponized [[biological agent]]s are given more attention by FHI. Technological outcomes the Institute is particularly interested in include [[global warming|anthropogenic climate change]], [[nuclear warfare]] and [[nuclear terrorism]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[artificial general intelligence]]. In expecting the largest society-wise risks to stem from future technologies, and from advanced artificial intelligence in particular, FHI agrees with other existential risk reduction organizations, such as the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] and the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kate Whitehead |date=16 March 2014 |title=Cambridge University study centre focuses on risks that could annihilate mankind |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1449541/cambridge-university-study-centre-focuses-risks-could |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jenny Hollander |date=September 2012 |title=Oxford Future of Humanity Institute knows what will make us extinct |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/4682-oxford-future-of-humanity-institute-knows-what-will-make-us-extinct |newspaper=Bustle |location= |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FHI researchers have also studied the impact of technological progress on social and institutional risks, such as [[totalitarianism]], [[Technological unemployment|automation-driven unemployment]], and information hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf |title=Information Hazards: A Typology of Potential Harms from Knowledge |author=Nick Bostrom |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropic reasoning ==
{{main article|Anthropic principle}}
FHI devotes much of its attention to exotic threats that have been little explored by other organizations, and to methodological considerations that inform existential risk reduction and forecasting. The Institute has particularly emphasized [[anthropic principle|anthropic reasoning]] in its research, as an under-explored area with general epistemological implications.

Anthropic arguments FHI has studied include the [[doomsday argument]], which claims that humanity is likely to go extinct soon because it is unlikely that one is observing a point in human history that is extremely early. Instead, present-day humans are likely to be near the middle of the distribution of humans that will ever live.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt; Bostrom has also popularized the [[simulation argument]], which suggests that if we're likely to avoid existential risks, humanity and the world around are not unlikely to be a [[simulated reality|simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Tierney |date=13 August 2007 |title=Even if Life Is a Computer Simulation... |url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/13/even-if-life-is-but-a-computer-simulation/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in FHI's research is the [[Fermi paradox]], the surprising absence of observable alien civilizations. Robin Hanson has argued that there must be a "[[Great Filter]]" preventing space colonization to account for the paradox. That filter may lie in the past, if intelligence is much more rare than current biology would predict; or it may lie in the future, if existential risks are even larger than is currently recognized.

== Human enhancement and rationality ==
Closely linked to FHI's work on risk assessment, astronomical waste, and the dangers of future technologies is its work on the promise and risks of human enhancement. The modifications in question may be biological, digital, or sociological, and an emphasis is placed on the most radical hypothesized changes, rather than on the likeliest short-term innovations. FHI's [[bioethics]] research focuses on the potential consequences of [[gene therapy]], [[life extension]], [[brain implant]]s and [[brain–computer interface]]s, and [[mind uploading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |author=Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FHI's focus has been on methods for assessing and enhancing human intelligence and rationality, as a way of shaping the speed and direction of technological and social progress. FHI's work on human irrationality, as exemplified in [[heuristics in judgment and decision-making|cognitive heuristics]] and [[cognitive bias|biases]], includes an ongoing collaboration with [[Amlin]] to study the [[systemic risk]] arising from biases in modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Amlin and Oxford University launch major research project into the Systemic Risk of Modelling |url=http://www.amlin.com/media/press-releases/2014/11-2-2014.aspx |location= |publisher=Amlin |agency= |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Amlin and Oxford University to collaborate on modelling risk study |url=http://www.cirmagazine.com/cir/Amlin-and-Oxford-University-to-collaborate-on-modelling-risk-study.php |newspaper= |location= |work=Continuity, Insurance &amp; Risk Magazine |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2228">'''Geoffrey Burel of Ambois'''e (d. 1101) was Lord of Amboise ''[[jure uxoris]]'' and a knight in the Crusade of 1101, fighting in the [[Army of William IX on the Crusade of 1101|army of William IX]].  Note that this individual is not the same as the Geoffrey Burel who was a commander in the service of [[Peter the Hermit]].

Geoffrey was arranged to be married to [[Corba of Thorigne]], Lady of Amboise, the daughter of the son-in-law of [[Fulk IV, Count of Anjou|Fulk IV le Réchin, Count of Anjou]].  Widowed twice, Corba’s marriage was arranged by Fulk to maintain control of the estates of [[Amboise]].

As was typical of the army of William, in which wives accompanied their husbands on crusade, Corba went with Geoffrey to the Holy Land.  Geoffrey was killed at the battled of Heraclea and Corba was abducted by the Turks and never heard from again.

'''Grace Oakeshott''' (born '''Grace Cash''', later '''Joan Reeve'''; 1872–1929) was a British activist for women's rights who faked her own death in 1907 and emigrated to New Zealand with her lover, Walter Reeve.

Grace Cash was born in 1872.&lt;ref name="Robson2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=J.|title=Radical Reformers and Respectable Rebels: How the Two Lives of Grace Oakeshott Defined an Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hdp6DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17|date=16 June 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-137-31184-9|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Harold Oakeshott and both were active in socialist circles. Grace wrote a paper in 1900 on ''Women in the Cigar Trade in London'', published in ''[[The Economic Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakeshott|first1=Grace|title=Women in the Cigar Trade in London|journal=The Economic Journal|date=1900|volume=10|issue=40|pages=562–572|jstor=2956851}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was involved  in the foundation of the first Trade School for Girls in 1904, and in the [[Women's Industrial Council]].&lt;ref name=bynum /&gt;

In 1907 a pile of her clothes was found on a beach in [[Brittany]] where she was on holiday, giving the impression that she had drowned. In fact she had made plans to emigrate to New Zealand with her lover Dr Walter Reeve, apparently with the knowledge of her husband, at a time when divorce was difficult and scandalous. The supposed widower, Harold Oakeshott, later married again, bigamously.&lt;ref name=bynum /&gt;

In New Zealand Oakeshott used the name Joan Reeve, and had three children with Walter Reeve. She died of [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1929 in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=bynum /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1607">'''Guillaume Bouteiller''' (or Pierre-Guillaume), born in Paris in 1788, was a French composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=François-Joseph Fétis |title=Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie générale de la musique |volume=2 |publisher=Firmin-Didot |year=1875 |url={{Google books|NE5DAQAAMAAJ|page=46|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], then presented himself in 1806 at the [[Prix de Rome]] (created in 1803) where he was awarded a first prize for his cantata ''[[Hero and Leander]]'', to a text by [[Jacques Bins, comte de Saint-Victor|Saint-Victor]]. Despite this first success, he preferred to decline the offer of the trip to Rome. Following this first, a series of other withdrawals caused a scandal under the Empire.

In 1817 his comic opera ''Le Trompeur sans le vouloir'' was premiered at the [[Theatre Feydeau]] after a libretto by Jean-François Roger and [[Auguste Creuzé de Lesser]]. After the failure of the opera, Bouteiller apparently gave up composing. His cantata was more recently performed in 2007 by the Orchestre National de Montpellier with singer Ana Maria Labin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.anamarialabin.com/fr/ueber-mich Ana Maria Labin]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iwao Takamoto''' (April 29, 1925 – January 8, 2007) was an [[Americans|American]] [[animator]], [[television producer]], and [[film director]]. He began his career as a [[production designer|production]] and character designer for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] films such as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). Later, he moved to [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]], where he designed a great majority of the characters, including [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and [[The Jetsons|Astro]], and eventually became a director and producer.

==Early life and career==
Takamoto was born in [[Los Angeles]], California. His father emigrated from [[Hiroshima]]&lt;ref name=GuardianObit&gt;{{cite news| url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/obituary/0,,2000879,00.html | title= Iwao Takamoto: Brilliant animator who eased the medium's transition from film to television| first= Paul |last= Wells| date= January 28, 2007 | work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate= April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the United States for his health, and returned to Japan only once, to marry his wife. At 15 years of age, Takamoto graduated from [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Thomas Jefferson High School]]&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt; in [[Los Angeles]].

After the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]], Takamoto's family, like many Japanese Americans, was forced to move to an [[Japanese American internment|internment camp]]. They spent the rest of [[World War II]] in the [[Manzanar]] internment camp. It was there that Takamoto received basic illustration training from two co-internees.

Takamoto first entered the cartoon world after the end of the war. Without the benefit of a formal portfolio of his work, he created a sketchbook of, by his own admission, "everything I saw".&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt; It was based on this sketchbook that he applied to work at the Disney studios.

He was hired as an assistant animator by [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]] in 1945. Takamoto eventually became an assistant to [[Milt Kahl]]. He worked as an animator and character designer on such titles as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959), and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961).

==Hanna-Barbera==
Takamoto left Disney in 1961 and joined Hanna-Barbera Productions.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt; He worked in several positions there, but is arguably best known as a character designer. He was responsible for the original character design of such characters as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], ''[[The Jetsons]]''' dog [[Astro (The Jetsons)|Astro]], and [[Penelope Pitstop]]. He  worked as a producer at Hanna-Barbera, supervising shows such as ''[[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[Hong Kong Phooey]]'', and ''[[Jabberjaw]]''. He directed several feature length animated films, including ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'' (1973) and ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'' (1990). The inspiration for Scooby-Doo's creation as a [[Great Dane]] came from an employee of the Hanna-Barbera company, who bred this dog.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;

Takamoto was Vice-President of Creative Design at Hanna-Barbera&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt; and was responsible for overseeing [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera's]] many merchandising lines as well as design work for their Animation Art Dept. In 1996, he received the [[Winsor McCay Award]] for lifetime achievement and contributions in the animation field. In 2005 he received the Golden Award from the [[Animation guild|Animation Guild]], to honor his more than 50 years of service in the animation field.

After [[Time-Warner]] merged with (then owner of Hanna-Barbera Studios) [[Turner Broadcasting]] in 1996, Takamoto became Vice President of Special Projects for Warner Brothers Animation.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Susan|title=Iwao Takamoto, 81, the Animation Artist Who Created Scooby-Doo, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/arts/television/10takamoto.html?_r=0|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Iwao Takamoto married Jane M. (née Shattuck) Baer in 1957. They met at Disney while working on the animated feature ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and were married for almost seven years. They had one son together, Michael. In 1963, he met Barbara Farber, who was the assistant to the public relations director at Hanna-Barbera, Arnie Carr. Part of her job was studio tours, which was how she and Takamoto met. Takamoto married Barbara in 1964 and remained married to her for 44 years, until his death in 2007. Barbara had a daughter from a former marriage, Leslie.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;

==Death==
Takamoto died on January 8, 2007 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 81. Throughout the week following his death, [[Adult Swim]] put up a bumper reading "Iwao Takamoto [1925-2007]". He is buried at [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]] in Gardens of Blessing, Section 3, Lot 1390, Space 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scooby-Doo designer dies in L.A. |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyid=2007-01-09T052341Z_01_N08423986_RTRUKOC_0_US-TAKAMOTO.xml |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224060440/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyid=2007-01-09T052341Z_01_N08423986_RTRUKOC_0_US-TAKAMOTO.xml |archivedate=2007-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scooby-Doo's creator dies aged 81 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6243717.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a memorial added to the end of the Scooby-Doo film ''[[Chill Out, Scooby-Doo!]]''.

==Awards and legacy ==
Takamoto received the [[Winsor McCay Award]], the lifetime achievement award from the [[International Animated Film Association]] (ASIFA) Hollywood.&lt;ref name= GuardianObit /&gt; He received an honorary citation from the [[Japanese American National Museum]].&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt; In 2005, he was given a golden award from the Animation Guild.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit /&gt;

Takamoto's memoirs were published posthumously in 2009 by [[University Press of Mississippi]] as ''Iwao Takamoto: My Life with a Thousand Characters'' by Iwao Takamoto and Michael Mallory. An intimate memoir, ''Living With A Legend'', was published posthumously in 2012 by [[TotalRecall Press]] by his stepdaughter, Leslie E. Stern.

'''Jay Ferdinand Towner III''' (1910 &amp;ndash; November 11, 1933)&lt;ref name=ken&gt;''College Press Urged To Bare Death Clews'', [[Washington Post]], November 17, 1933, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; was a youth from [[Perryman, Maryland]] who was found dead on the campus of [[Princeton University]] shortly after a Princeton versus [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] football game, in 1933. The mystery of Towner's death was taken up by [[United States Senator]] [[Millard Tydings]].

==Death circumstances and investigation==
Towner was discovered a few hours after the game with both of his wrists fractured and internal injuries. However, there was no indication that he had been the victim of [[Crime|foul play]] or hit by a car. Authorities thought perhaps he had been crushed against the wall of [[Palmer Stadium]], while the crowd was exiting from the game. He later died from his injuries as he walked across the Princeton campus. Other information contended that Towner was in one of Princeton's dormitories following the football game. Another source said that he was seen in an automobile parking area.&lt;ref name=deep/&gt;

Three Princeton students reported seeing Towner in the undergraduate cheering section during the game. Princeton police were told on November 13 that Towner was seen falling down the concrete steps of the stadium during the football contest. This occurred during the most exciting part of the game when Princeton scored the only touchdown. Towner rose from his seat, tripped and fell down five concrete steps, landing on his hands. He was assisted to his seat by other spectators, appearing to be uninjured.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Say Towner Fell Before He Died'', Washington Post, November 14, 1933, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Editors of the ''[[Daily Princetonian]]'' established that Towner was not pinned and crushed against a concrete wall by the departing crowd.&lt;ref name=ken/&gt;

Tydings received the cooperation of [[New Jersey Governor]] [[A. Harry Moore]] on November 20, 1933. Moore requested a report from prosecutor Erwin E. Marshall and [[Mercer County, New Jersey]] chief of detectives, James Kirkham.&lt;ref name=deep&gt;''Death At Princeton Taken Up By Moore'', [[New York Times]], November 21, 1933, pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towner's death was the second unexplained and violent demise on the Princeton campus within a month's time. On October 9, 1933 John Tighe, a janitor, was discovered dead between two Princeton buildings. His skull was fractured and he had fractures of one arm and several ribs, as well as internal injuries. It was surmised that Tighe had fallen from a building or been hit by a car. However, there was no evidence to support either hypothesis.&lt;ref name=ken/&gt;

[[File:AclandMonument Broadclyst.JPG|thumb|Acland's monument, Broadclyst Church]]
[[File:Arms of Acland.svg|thumb|150px|Arms of Acland: ''Chequy argent and sable, a fesse gules'']]
'''Sir John Acland''' ({{circa|1552}} – 1620) of [[Columbjohn|Columb John]] in the parish of [[Broadclyst]], Devon, was an English knight, landowner, philanthropist, Member of Parliament and [[Sheriff of Devon]]. He was one of [[John Prince (biographer)|John Prince's]] ''Worthies of Devon''.

==Origins==
He was the second son of [[John Acland (died 1553)|John Acland]] (died 1553), of [[Acland, Landkey|Acland]] in the parish of [[Landkey]], Devon, by his wife Mary Redcliff, daughter and co-heiress of Hugh Redcliff of [[Stepney]] near London. He is said by [[John Prince (biographer)|Prince]] (c.1697) to have been the favourite son of his mother, who thus made him heir to her lands in and about London.&lt;ref name=P2&gt;Prince, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother was Hugh Acland (died 1622), who inherited the paternal estate of Acland, which he modernised in 1591&lt;ref name=A5&gt;Acland, Anne, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; as attested by a surviving date stone,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, Nikolaus]] &amp; Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained throughout his life.&lt;ref name=A4&gt;Acland, Anne, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Acland was appointed to the county bench as a [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1583 and was [[Sheriff of Devon]] for 1608–09. He was elected Member of Parliament firstly for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], in 1586.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=63|title=Acland, John|first=Wolffe|last=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was knighted by King [[James I of England|James I]] on 15 March 1604 in the [[Tower of London]], and at a by-election on 27 January 1607, in the first parliament of the reign, became MP for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon]].

==Marriages==
[[File:ElizabethRolle AclandMonument Broadclyst.JPG|thumb|upright|Effigy of Acland's wife Elizabeth Rolle, in Broadclyst Church]]
Acland married twice, but left no surviving children. His first wife was Elizabeth Rolle, a daughter of the wealthy [[George Rolle]], of [[Stevenstone]] near [[Great Torrington]] in Devon, and the widow of Robert Mallet, of [[Woolleigh, Beaford|Woolleigh]],&lt;ref name=V4&gt;Vivian, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beaford]], near Great Torrington&lt;ref&gt;Prince, p.2 "Woolley", today's "Woolleigh Barton", about 3 miles SE of Great Torrington&lt;/ref&gt; in the same county. During Elizabeth's lifetime the couple lived at Woolleigh.&lt;ref name=P2 /&gt; It was probably due to Elizabeth's wealth that Acland was able to purchase the manor of Columb John&lt;ref name=A4 /&gt; in the parish of [[Broadclyst]]. On his monument in Broadclyst Church a kneeling effigy representing Elizabeth Rolle kneels by his head,&lt;ref name=P4n&gt;Prince, p.4 mentions these effigies, "one at the head and one at the feet"&lt;/ref&gt; below a heraldic escutcheon displaying the arms of Rolle. By Elizabeth he had only one child, a daughter named Dorothy who died an infant.&lt;ref name=V4 /&gt;

After Elizabeth died, Acland married Margaret Portman, another "vastly rich"&lt;ref name=P2 /&gt; widow, a daughter of [[Portman baronets|Sir Henry Portman]], of [[Orchard Portman]]&lt;ref name=P2 /&gt; in [[Somerset]] and the widow of Sir Gabriel Hawley (died 1604)&lt;ref&gt;Will proved 16 Mar 1603/1604 (Prerogative Court of Canterbury,: 47 Harte, quoted in [http://histfam.familysearch.org/getperson.php?personID=I116913&amp;tree=Nixon])&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Buckland Priory]] (''Buckland Sororum''),&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Parliament]] biog. of Sir John Acland&lt;/ref&gt; in the parish of [[Dursley]], Somerset, [[High Sheriff of Somerset]] in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, Robert (1983). A History of Somerset. Chichester: Phillimore &amp; Co. pp. 109–117&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was childless. On Acland's monument in Broadclyst Church a kneeling effigy representing Margaret Portman kneels by his feet&lt;ref name=P4n /&gt; below a heraldic escutcheon displaying the arms of Portman.

==Lands acquired==
He purchased the manor of Columb John&lt;ref name=A4 /&gt; in the parish of [[Broadclyst]], about 32 miles south-east of Acland, where he re-built the old manor house and its domestic chapel,&lt;ref name=A4 /&gt; which he endowed with the annual sum of £25 in eternity "for the encouragement of a chaplain, to preach and read prayers in it every Lord's day".&lt;ref&gt;Prince, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby manor of [[Killerton]], adjacent to Columb John, was not purchased at this time, but by Acland's eldest nephew Sir [[Arthur Acland (died 1610)|Arthur Acland]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristram Risdon|Risdon, Tristram]] (died 1640), Survey of Devon, 1810 edition, London, 1810, p.59, purchased from Sir Thomas Drewe; Vivian, p.307, pedigree of Drewe, states "Sir Thomas Drewe...sold Killerton to Sir Arthur Acland, Bart. (sic)"&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1610) of Acland,&lt;ref&gt;Buried in Landkey Church, where his large monument survives&lt;/ref&gt; whose son [[Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet]] (died 1647) deserted Acland and moved his residence to Columb John. Killerton was first used as a residence for Sir Arthur's widow Eleanor Mallet,&lt;ref&gt;Acland, Anne, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; (daughter and heiress of Robert Mallet of Woolleigh,&lt;ref name=V4 /&gt; whose wife was Elizabeth Rolle who remarried to Sir John Acland (died 1620)).

==Death and burial==
Acland died on 14 February 1620,&lt;ref&gt;Vivian, p.4; "1620" per Acland, Anne, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in [[Broad Clyst]] church, where a monument he had commissioned himself,&lt;ref name=A5 /&gt; dated 1613,&lt;ref name=P4&gt;Prince, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; survives in Broadclyst Church, showing the sculpted figures of himself and his wives. Since he died childless, his heir was his 70-year-old elder brother Hugh Acland (died 1622) of Acland.&lt;ref name=V4 /&gt;

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Exeter Dining Hall.JPG|thumb|Dining Hall, Exeter College, Oxford, built in 1618,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-244919-exeter-college-south-range-main-quadrang&lt;/ref&gt; largely financed by Acland]]
His charitable gifts were numerous. He settled on the mayor and city council of [[Exeter]] the rectorial endowments of two parishes in the South Hams, so that the annual proceeds might be distributed among the poor in Exeter and in other parts of the county. He largely financed a new hall, with cellars underneath, at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], shortly before his death, at a cost of about £800 of the total £1,000 building cost.&lt;ref name=P4 /&gt; Two scholarships were also founded by him at the college. He gave money to buy bread for the poor in each of the 27 parishes in which he held land&lt;ref&gt;Acland, Anne., pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt; and an inscription to Sir John was erected in Pilton Church, near Acland, which is transcribed in [[Dean Milles' Questionnaire]] thus:&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in Acland, Anne, p.5 &amp; footnote 2 to chap. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;Here Sr John Acland to the poor's a friend,
In giving bread noe times to have an end,
Sixpence a week by him to us is measured,
A crown for him in Heaven's laid up and treasured&lt;/poem&gt;

==Monument==
[[File:AclandAchievementBroadclyst.JPG|thumb|upright|Acland's Heraldic [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]]]
Sir John Acland's monument in Broadclyst Church was described by Pevsner as "one of the most sumptuous Jacobean monuments in Devon and the most splendid of a related group".&lt;ref name=Pev215&gt;Pevsner, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned by Sir John during his lifetime&lt;ref name=A5 /&gt; and bears the dates 1613&lt;ref name=P5&gt;Prince, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; and 1614.&lt;ref&gt;Above heraldic achievement, see image&lt;/ref&gt; He lies recumbent, in full armour, propped up on his right elbow, with his two widows kneeling at prayer at his head and feet.&lt;ref name=A5 /&gt; It was probably constructed by John Deymond, an Exeter mason.&lt;ref name=Pev215 /&gt; The Renaissance style&lt;ref name=H352 /&gt; comprises columns, [[strapwork]], cartouches, obelisks, fruit and [[Putto|putti]]&lt;ref name=Pev215 /&gt; It displays the following Latin inscriptions:&lt;ref name=P5 /&gt; ''Anno Domini 1613''; ''Mors janua vitae'' (Death is the gateway to life) and the well-known ''Mors mihi lucrum''&lt;ref&gt;St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians , 1:21&lt;/ref&gt; (Death to me is reward); ''Post tenebras spero lucem'' (After darkness I hope for light); ''Caro mea requiescit in spe'' (May my flesh rest in hope); ''A Deo omnis victoria'' (All victory comes from God). A rectangular space above his effigy which should have contained a marble tablet inscribed with his epitaph remains blank, as it was in 1697 when described by John Prince.&lt;ref name=P5 /&gt;

===Armorials===
At the top of the monument is a heraldic [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]] of Sir John Acland (died 1620), showing an escutcheon [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterly]] of 6:

'''John Cyril Cranko''' (15 August 1927 – 26 June 1973) was a South African born ballet dancer and [[choreographer]] with the [[Royal Ballet]] and the [[Stuttgart Ballet]].

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Cranko was born in [[Rustenburg]] in the former province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], [[South Africa]].  As a child, he would put on puppet shows as a creative outlet.  Cranko received his early ballet training in Cape Town under the leading South African ballet teacher and director, [[Dulcie Howes]], of the [[University of Cape Town]] Ballet School. In 1945 he choreographed his first work (using Stravinsky's Suite from ''The Soldier's Tale'') for the Cape Town Ballet Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuttgart-ballet.de/company/john-cranko/ "John Cranko"], Stuttgart Ballet, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to London, studying with the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in 1946 &lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Dromgoole, Nicholas. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30978 "John Cranko"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', retrieved 19 March 2015, {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dancing his first role with the Sadler's Wells Ballet in November 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohcollections.org.uk/SearchResults.aspx?searchtype=performance&amp;page=0&amp;person=Cranko "John Cranko"], Royal Opera House Performance Database, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===London===
Cranko collaborated with the designer [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] on ''Sea Change'', performed at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin]] in July 1949. They collaborated again for Sadler's Wells Ballet on ''The Shadow'', which opened on 3 March 1953.&lt;ref name=RCM2008_94&gt;Reed, Cooke &amp; Mitchell, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; This period marked a transition in Cranko's career from dancer to full-time choreographer, with his last performance for the Sadler's Wells Ballet taking place in April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohcollections.org.uk/SearchResults.aspx?searchtype=performance&amp;page=2&amp;person=Cranko "John Cranko"], Royal Opera House Performance Database, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At 23 years old, he was appointed as resident choreographer for Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet's 1950–51 season.&lt;ref&gt;"John Cranko", Programme booklet for ''[[Onegin (Cranko)|Onegin]]'', Royal Opera House, Covent Garden 2014–2015 season, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

For the company's [[Festival of Britain]] season in 1951 Cranko choreographed the comic [[ballet]] ''[[Pineapple Poll]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = John Cranko - Pineapple Poll - YouTube| accessdate = 2018-08-31| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SJG89TSSw8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the music of [[Arthur Sullivan]] (newly out of copyright) arranged by the conductor [[Charles Mackerras]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another collaboration with Mackerras followed in 1954 with ''[[The Lady and the Fool]]'', to music by [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In January 1954 Sadler's Wells Ballet announced that Cranko was collaborating with [[Benjamin Britten]] to create a ballet. Cranko devised a draft scenario for a work he originally called ''The Green Serpent'', fusing elements drawn from ''[[King Lear]]'', ''Beauty and the Beast'' (a story he had choreographed for Sadler's Wells in 1948) and the oriental tale published by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] as ''Serpentin Vert''. Creating a list of dances, simply describing the action and giving a total timing for each, he passed this to Britten and left him to compose what eventually became ''[[The Prince of the Pagodas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Cooke &amp; Mitchell, pp. 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranko wrote and developed a musical revue ''Cranks'', which opened in London in December 1955, moved to a West End theatre the following March, and ran for 223 performances. With music by [[John Addison]], its cast of four featured the singers [[Anthony Newley]], [[Annie Ross]], Hugh Bryant and the dancer Gilbert Vernon; it transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Bijou Theatre (Manhattan)|Bijou Theatre]]. An original cast CD has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Cranks | publisher =The Guide to Musical Theatre | date =2014 | url =http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_c/cranks.htm | accessdate = 26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranko followed the format of ''Cranks'' with a new revue ''New Cranks'' opening at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith on 26 April 1960 with music by David Lee and a cast including [[Gillian Lynne]], [[Carole Shelley]] and [[Bernard Cribbins]], but it failed to have the same impact.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1960, Cranko directed the first production of Benjamin Britten's opera ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', at the [[Aldeburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;"A New Midsummer Night's Dream", ''The Times'', 11 June 1960, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When the work had its London premiere the following year at Covent Garden, Cranko was not invited to direct, and [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]] was brought in.&lt;ref&gt;"London Triumph for Britten's Dream", ''The Times'',  3 February 1961, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuttgart===
Prosecuted for homosexual activity, Cranko left the UK for Stuttgart, and in 1961 was appointed director of the Stuttgart Ballet,&lt;ref name=RCM2008_94/&gt; where he assembled a group of talented performers such as [[Marcia Haydée]], [[Egon Madsen]], [[Richard Cragun]], [[Birgit Keil]] and [[Suzanne Hanke]]. Among his following choreographies were ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Cranko)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] in 1962, set to music by [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], ''[[Onegin (Cranko)|Onegin]]'' in 1965, an adaptation of the verse novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' by [[Alexander Pushkin]], set to music by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] (mainly ''[[The Seasons (Tchaikovsky)|The Seasons]]''), orchestrated by [[Kurt-Heinz Stolze]], ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (ballet)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' by Shakespeare in 1969, ''Brouillards'' in 1970, ''Carmen'' in 1971 (music by [[Wolfgang Fortner]] and [[Wilfried Steinbrenner]]) and ''Spuren (Traces)'' in 1973.

Cranko's work was a major contribution to the international success of German ballet beginning with a guest performance at the New York [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1969. At Stuttgart, Cranko invited [[Kenneth MacMillan]] to work with the company, for whom MacMillan created four ballets in Cranko's lifetime and a fifth, ''[[Requiem (MacMillan)|Requiem]]'', as a tribute after Cranko's death.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, pp. 711–716&lt;/ref&gt; At Cranko's instigation the company established its own ballet school in 1971; it was renamed the John Cranko Schule in his honour in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.john-cranko-schule.de/history/ "History"] John Cranko Schule, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His assistant and choreologist [[Georgette Tsinguirides]] preserved his works in [[Benesh Movement Notation]].

Cranko choked to death after suffering an allergic reaction to a sleeping pill he took during a transatlantic charter flight from Philadelphia to Stuttgart two days after the company completed a successful tour of the United States at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in Philadelphia. The flight made an emergency landing in Dublin where Cranko was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="John Cranko Dies at 45; Stuttgart Ballet Director"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/27/archives/john-cranko-dies-at-45-stuttgart-ballet-director-hurok-pays-tribute.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York ''Times''|date=June 27, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother, Grace, who was divorced from Herbert and lived in what was then [[Rhodesia]], heard about his death from a radio broadcast. Cranko was buried at a small cemetery near [[Castle Solitude]] in Stuttgart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Legacy===
In 2007, the Stuttgart Ballet celebrated what would have been Cranko's 80th birthday with the Cranko Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/de/das-stuttgarter-ballettwunder/1634898,CmC=1634922.html "Das Stuttgarter Ballettwunder"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112217/http://www.arte.tv/de/das-stuttgarter-ballettwunder/1634898%2CCmC%3D1634922.html |date= 2 April 2015 }}, Arte,  retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet ''Voluntaries'' by [[Glen Tetley]] was created in his memory. The John Cranko Society in Stuttgart, founded in 1975, promotes knowledge of ballet and Cranko's work, supports performances and talented dancers, and every year presents the John Cranko Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.john-cranko-gesellschaft.de/web/aktuelles.html "Aktuelles"], John-Cranko-Gesellschaft, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Gordon''' (died February 14, 1845) was the last person [[Capital punishment in Rhode Island|executed]] by [[Rhode Island]]. His conviction and execution have been ascribed by researchers to anti-[[Roman Catholic]] and anti-[[Ireland|Irish]] [[immigrant]] bias.&lt;ref name="mckay"&gt;McKay, Scott. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080501000000*/http://www.projo.com/news/content/death_penalty_case_05-25-08_TCA892N_v56.2f760d1.html "Judge's old notes shed light on last execution in R.I."] ''[[Providence Journal]]''. May 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was posthumously pardoned in 2011.&lt;ref name = pardon/&gt;  

In 1844, Gordon was tried and convicted for the December 31, 1843, beating [[murder]] of Amasa Sprague, a [[Cranston, Rhode Island|Cranston]] [[textile]] factory owner. Sprague was a member of a prominent Rhode Island family. His brother [[William Sprague III|William]] was a [[United States Senate|United States senator]]. Six months before his murder, Amasa Sprague had used his family's political influence to have Cranston resident Nicholas Gordon's [[liquor license]] removed by the city council.&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt; (Sprague's employees were habitually getting drunk at Gordon's premises.) Nicholas Gordon and his brother John were [[Roman Catholic]] immigrants from [[Ireland]]. Nicholas, John and William Gordon (another brother) were all tried for murder, but only John was convicted, a conviction based on contradictory circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt; William was found not guilty and in Nicholas's case, held after John's execution, the [[jury]] was [[Hung jury|hung]]. John Gordon was executed by [[hanging]] in the state jail in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. The court justices, which included Justice [[Job Durfee]], that were involved in all three trials acted as both trial judges and the court of final appeal.&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, Charles G. and Tess Hoffmann (1998). ''Brotherly Love: Murder and the Politics of Prejudice in Nineteenth-Century Rhode Island''. Boston: [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. {{ISBN|1-55849-163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Included in jury instructions, Durfee "told the jurors to give greater weight to Yankee witnesses than Irish witnesses."&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt;

Seven years after Gordon's execution, Rhode Island abolished the death penalty.&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt; Although it was reintroduced in 1872, no executions took place before capital punishment was abolished again by the state in 1984. In the 1990s, when the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] considered reinstating the death penalty, Gordon's case has been used by those against reinstatement to demonstrate the dangers of capital punishment.&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt;

Rhode Island Governor [[Lincoln Chafee]] pardoned Gordon on June 29, 2011, following passage of legislation by the state's General Assembly urging such action.&lt;ref name=pardon&gt;Erika Niedowski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110702114523/http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2011/06/29/ri_governor_pardons_irish_man_hanged_in_1845/ "RI governor pardons Irish man hanged in 1845"], [[Associated Press]], 2011-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was sponsored in the [[Rhode Island House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by [[Peter F. Martin]] and in the [[Senate of Rhode Island|Senate]] by [[Michael McCaffrey]].&lt;ref name = pardon/&gt; Chafee signed the proclamation of pardon at the Old State House, where Gordon's trial had taken place more than 150 years before.&lt;ref name = pardon/&gt;

In September 2014, [[Enda Kenny]], the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, visited the Rhode Island Irish Famine Memorial and in a speech praised Chafee for pardoning Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Carswell, [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/government-in-talks-to-set-up-direct-flight-between-shannon-and-rhode-island-1.1940633 "Government in talks to set up direct flight between Shannon and Rhode Island"], ''[[Irish Times]]'', 24 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life Goes On''''' is a 2009 film by Sangeeta Datta. It shows how a Hindu family in Britain copes with the death of the wife and mother. The story recalls Shakespeare’s ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life Goes On – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/13/life-goes-on-review|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 March 2011|author=[[Philip French]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film is set in modern London. The central character is Sanjay, a Hindu doctor, respected in his community. After the sudden death of his wife Manju, he struggles to relate to his three daughters. The drama follows the week from Manju's death to her funeral.

As well as dealing with grief and family ties, the film addresses inter-faith issues as Sanjay discovers that the youngest daughter Dia has a Muslim boyfriend, Imtiaz.

Wandering the streets of London the night before the funeral, Sanjay recalls his own childhood, when he left home with his parents during the [[partition of India]].

The following is a list of mummies that include Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s and their named [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|mummified]] family members.{{efn|Mummies have been found by archaeologists whom have determined their royal status, but have not been able to provide any conclusive name. These mummies are not listed here as not enough information is available on the subject.}} Some of these mummies have been found to be remarkably intact, while others have been damaged from [[Grave robbery#Effects on archaeology around the world|tomb robbers]] and environmental conditions.

The following entries are previously identified mummies that are now in dispute. Over time through the advance in technology, new information comes to light that discredits old findings and beliefs. The mummies that have been lost or destroyed since initial discovery may never be properly identified.

| [[File:Mummy Ahmose-Nefertari Smith.JPG|90px]]
| Ahmose-Nefertari is assumed to have been retrieved from her tomb at the end of the New Kingdom and moved to the royal cache in [[DB320]]. Her presumed body, with no identification marks, was discovered in the 19th century and unwrapped in 1885 by Emile Brugsch but this identification has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dylanb.me.uk/wp/?page_id=977|title=The so-called Royal Cachette TT 320 was not the grave of Ahmose Nefertari!|work=www.dylanb.me.uk|author=Dylan|date=July 22, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the mummy was found it emitted such a bad odor that it was reburied on museum grounds in Cairo until the offensive smell abated. If this is  Ahmose-Nefertari, then she was determined to have died in her 70s. The mummy's hair had been thinning and plaits of false hair had been woven in with its own to cover this up. The body also had been damaged in antiquity and was missing its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2006. {{ISBN|0-500-05145-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[File:Sapair-cercueil-momie.jpg|90px]]
| In 1881, a mummy of a 5- to 6-year-old boy was found in cache ([[DB320]]) and identified as Ahmose-Sipair. This was disputed as Prince Ahmose-Sipair is always portrayed as an adult on the coffin of the scribe and other antiquities, thus the child-mummy cannot be his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/anubis4_2000/mummypages1/Early18.htm#Sipair|title=XVIII'th Dynasty Gallery I|work=The Theban Royal Mummy Project|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: center;"| &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;1907&lt;/span&gt; 1907
| [[File:Akhenaten skull profile.png|90px]]
| Uncertainty remains over the identity of this mummy as the young age at death is inconsistent with Akhenaten's reign. CT scans done in 2010 strongly suggest that the mummy may be Pharaoh [[Smenkhkare#Death and burial|Smenkhkare]].

| Believed to be [[Ankhesenamun]], as she is the mother of the two fetuses found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s grave. Uncertainty remains if the mummy found in [[KV55]] is accepted to be [[Akhenaten]]. She is also known as mummy [[Ankhesenamun#Mummy KV21A|KV21A]] from the tomb that she was discovered in.

Routledge, London/New York 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-203-44328-6}}, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally assumed that she was a daughter of the king as she was about five years old when she died.

| {{*}}'''Main article:''' [[The Younger Lady]]&lt;br&gt; Two main DNA tests have been done on this mummy which have resulted in three different possible identities. Early speculation was that the mummy belonged to [[Queen Nefertiti]], and while DNA testing was done it neither confirmed nor denied this as being factual. Another later DNA testing revealed her to be a daughter of Pharaoh [[Amunhotep III]], and the mother of [[Tutankhamun]]. This DNA report concluded that the mummy is likely [[Beketaten]], or [[Nebetah]], but again no conclusive answer was found. In any case the mummy was found to be extensively damaged by past tomb robbers which caused numerous holes.

| [[File:Setnacht Mummy.jpg|90px]]
| The alleged mummy of Setnakhte has never been identified with certainty, although the so–called "mummy in the boat" found in [[KV35]] was sometimes identified with him, an attribution rejected by Aidan Dodson who rather believes the body belonged to a royal family member of [[Amenhotep II]] of the [[18th Dynasty]]. In any case the mummy was destroyed by looters in 1901, thus preventing any analysis on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas|last=Schneider|year=2010|title=Contributions to the Chronology of the New Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period|journal=Ägypten &amp; Levante|pp=|url=|volume=20}}, pp. 386–387&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[File:Thutmose I mummy head.png|90px]]
| Egyptologist [[Gaston Maspero]] thought this was the mummy of Thutmose I largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III. In 2007 though, [[Zahi Hawass|Dr. Zahi Hawass]] announced that the mummy is a thirty-year-old man who had died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest. Due to the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it was determined that the mummy was probably not of Thutmose I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Anderson  | first =  Lisa   | title = Mummy awakens new era in Egypt  | newspaper =  Chicago Tribune  | pages =   | date = 14 July 2007  | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-07-14/news/0707130698_1_mummy-18th-dynasty-ct-scan  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">'''Morphological freedom''' refers to a proposed [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify their own body]], on their own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[medical technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bostrom | first1 = N. | title = In Defense of Posthuman Dignity | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x | journal = Bioethics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–214 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16167401| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may have been coined by [[transhumanist]] [[Max More]] in his 1993 article, ''Technological Self-Transformation: Expanding Personal Extropy'', where he defined it as "the ability to alter bodily form at will through technologies such as surgery, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, uploading". The term was later used by science debater [[Anders Sandberg]] as "an extension of one’s right to one’s body, not just [[self-ownership]] but also the right to modify oneself according to one’s desires."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bradshaw | first1 = H.

==Politics==
According to [[technocritic]] [[Dale Carrico]], the politics of morphological freedom imply a commitment to the value, standing, and social legibility of the widest possible variety of desired [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s. More specifically, morphological freedom is an expression of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[secularism]], [[progressivism|progressive]] [[cosmopolitanism]], and [[posthumanist]] [[multiculturalism]]s applied to the ongoing and upcoming transformation of the understanding of [[medicine|medical practice]] from one of conventional therapy to one of [[informed consent|consensual]] [[Self-Determination Theory|self-determination]], via [[human genetic engineering|genetic]], [[cyberware|prosthetic]], and [[neuropharmacology|cognitive]] modification.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Religion==
According to authors Calvin Mercer and Tracy J. Trothen there is tension between religion and transhumanists, particularly the [[Abrahamic]] traditions, with regards to morphological freedom. While religion generally recognizes the need to heal people and improve their situation from a medical perspective they are generally hesitant to promote a wholesale modification of the body as they see it ultimately belonging to their god.&lt;ref name="MercerTrothen2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Calvin Mercer|author2=Tracy J.

'''Murray's law''' predicts the thickness of branches in transport networks, such that the cost for transport and maintenance of the transport medium is minimized.

Like [[Hagen-Poiseuille Law]] and [[Fick's Law]], which were also formulated from a biological context, Murray’s law is a basic physical principle for transfer networks.&lt;ref name="sherman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcculloh" /&gt;

Murray's law is also a powerful [[biomimetics]] design tool in engineering. It has been applied in the design of [[self-healing material]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[photocatalysts]], and [[gas sensors]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, since its discovery, little attention has been paid to exploit this law for designing advanced materials, reactors and industrial processes for maximizing mass or energy transfer to improve material performance and process efficiency.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

The original version of Murray's law is only applicable to [[Conservation of mass|mass-conservative]] transport in the network. There are generalizations for non-conservative networks, which describe effects such as chemical reactions and diffusion through the walls.&lt;ref name="Zheng2017"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Murray's law in mass-conservative networks ==

The Vascular System and the Cost of Blood Volume|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=12|issue=3|pages=207–214|doi=10.1073/pnas.12.3.207|pmc=1084489|pmid=16576980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="murray2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Cecil D.|year=1926|title=The Physiological Principle of Minimum Work: II.

Larger vessels lower the expended energy for transport, but increase the overall volume of blood in the system; blood being a living fluid and hence requiring metabolic support. Murray's law is therefore an optimisation exercise to balance these factors.

For &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; child branches splitting from a common parent branch, the law states that:

&lt;math&gt;r^3 = r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 +...+ r_n^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the parent branch, and &lt;math&gt;r_1, \ldots, r_n&lt;/math&gt; are the radii of the child branches. This law is only valid for [[laminar flow]], since its derivation uses the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]] as a measure for the transport work (see below). Williams et al. deduced the formula for [[turbulent flow]]:&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/55.full|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r^{(7/3)} = r_1^{(7/3)} + r_2^{(7/3)} + r_3^{(7/3)} + ... + r_n^{(7/3)} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===

As stated above, the underlying assumption of the Murray's law is that the [[Power (physics)|power]] ([[energy (physics)|energy]] per [[time]]) for transport and upkeep is minimal in a natural transport system. Hence we seek to minimize &lt;math&gt;P = P_t + P_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt; is the power required for transport and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; the power required to maintain the transport medium (e.g. blood).

==== Laminar Flow ====

We first minimize the power of transport and upkeep in a single channel of the system, i.e. ignore bifurcations. Together with the assumption of mass-conservation this will yield the law. Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be the [[laminar flow|laminar]] [[volumetric flow rate|flow rate]] in this channel, which is assumed to be fixed. The power for transport in a laminar flow is &lt;math&gt;P_t = Q \Delta p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure difference between the entry and exit of a tube of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Hagen-Poiseuille Law]] for laminar flow states that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q = \frac{\pi\,r^4}{8\,\mu\,l}\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Delta p = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the fluid. Substituting this into the equation for &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt;, we get&lt;math display="block"&gt;P_t = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q^2.&lt;/math&gt;We furthermore make the assumption that the power necessary for maintenance is proportional to the [[Volume#Volume formulas|volume of the cylinder]] &lt;math&gt;V = \pi\,l\,r^2&lt;/math&gt; :&lt;math display="block"&gt;P_m = \lambda\,V = \lambda\,\pi\,l\,r^2&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant number (metabolic factor). This yields&lt;math display="block"&gt;P = P_t + P_m = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q^2 + \lambda\,\pi\,l\,r^2. &lt;/math&gt;Since we seek the radius with minimal power, we calculate the [[stationary point]] with respect to r &lt;math display="block"&gt;{\operatorname{d}\over\operatorname{d}\!r} P = 0 \;\Leftrightarrow\; - \frac{32\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^5} Q^2 + 2\,\lambda\,\pi\,l\,r = 0 \;\Leftrightarrow\; Q^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \frac{\lambda}{\mu} r^6 \;\Leftarrow\; Q = \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}} r^3. &lt;/math&gt;With this relationship between the flow rate &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; on an arbitrary channel, we return to the bifurcation: Since mass is conserved, the flow rate of the parent branch &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the flow rates in the children branches &lt;math&gt;Q_1, \ldots, Q_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since in each of these branches the power is minimized, the relationship above holds and hence, as claimed:&lt;math display="block"&gt; Q = \sum_{i=1}^N Q_i \;\Rightarrow\; \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}} \, r^3 = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}}\, r_i^3 \; \Rightarrow\; r^3 = \sum_{i=1}^N  r_i^3.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Diffusion ====

The power for transport spent by diffusion is given by

&lt;math&gt;P_t = Q\,\Delta C = \left( \pi\,D\,r^2 \frac{\Delta C}{l}\right) \Delta C&lt;/math&gt;

where the flow rate is given by Fick's Law, whose &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusivity constant and &lt;math&gt;\Delta C&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of concentration between the ends of the cylinder. Similarly to the case of laminar flow, the minimisation of the objective function results in

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta C}{l} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{D}} \Rightarrow Q = \pi\,D\,r^2 \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{D}} \Leftrightarrow Q = k\,r^2&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

&lt;math&gt; Q_p = \sum_{i=1}^N Q_i \Rightarrow k\, r_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N k\, r_i^2 \Leftrightarrow r_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N  r_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

== The generalized Murray’s law ==

However, the special Murray’s law is only applicable to flow processes involving no mass variations. Significant theoretical advances need to be made for more broadly applicable in the fields of chemistry, applied materials, and industrial reactions.

The generalized Murray’s law defines the basic geometric features for porous materials with optimum transfer properties. The generalized Murray’s law can be used to design and optimize the structures of an enormous range of porous materials. This concept has led to materials, termed as the [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14921 '''Murray materials'''], whose pore-sizes are multiscale and are designed with diameter-ratios obeying the generalized Murray’s law.&lt;ref name="Zheng2017" /&gt;

'''Nicolau dos Reis Lobato''' (24 May 1946&amp;nbsp;– 31 December 1978) was an [[East Timor|East-Timorese]] politician and national hero.

He was born in 1946 in [[Soibada]], [[Portuguese Timor]]. Lobato as 1st [[Prime Minister of East Timor]] from 28 November to 7 December 1975. Upon the arrival of the [[Indonesian military]] Lobato, along with other key [[Fretilin]] leaders, fled into the Timorese hinterland to fight against the occupying forces. On the final day of 1978 Lobato was ambushed by Indonesian special forces led by Lieutenant [[Prabowo|Prabowo Subianto]] (later son-in-law of President Suharto). He was killed after being shot in the stomach, and his body was brought to Dili to be inspected by Indonesian press. What then happened to his body is unknown, but the East-Timorese government continues to pursue the issue with the Indonesian government, so that his remains can be given a proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-21/new-push-to-find-ex-east-timor-pm-dos-reis-lobartos-body/9468250 East Timor's latest attempt to find the body of its first prime minister Nicolau dos Reis Lobato] ''ABC News'', 21 February 2018.

'''Olive Thomas''' (born '''Olive R. Duffy'''; October 20, 1894 – September 10, 1920) was an American [[silent film|silent-film]] actress and [[Model (person)|model]].

Thomas began her career as an illustrator's model in 1914, and moved on to the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' the following year. During her time as a [[Ziegfeld girl]], she also appeared in the more risqué show ''The Midnight Frolic''. In 1916, she began a successful career in silent films and would appear in more than 20 features over the course of her four-year film career. That year she also married actor [[Jack Pickford]], the younger brother of fellow silent-film star [[Mary Pickford]].

On September 10, 1920, Thomas died of acute [[nephritis]] in Paris five days after consuming [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercury bichloride]]. Although her death was ruled accidental, news of her hospitalization and subsequent death were the subject of speculation in the press. Thomas' death has been cited as one of the first heavily publicized [[Hollywood]] scandals.

==Early life==
Thomas was born Olive R. Duffy in [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania]], but often claimed her birth name was Oliveretta Elaine Duffy.&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2001|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the eldest of three children born to James and Rena Duffy, both of whom were of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. She had two brothers: James (born 1896) and William (born 1899).&lt;ref name="vogel13"&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|2007|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas later helped both of her brothers to secure work in the film industry; after serving in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] in France during [[World War I]], William worked as a [[cameraman]], and James worked as an [[assistant director]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|2007|pp=41, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of Thomas's death, both brothers were employed by [[David O. Selznick|Selznick]] Productions.&lt;ref name="assumption.edu_top"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/Olive%20Thomas/default.html|title=Memories of Olive|publisher=assumption.edu|location=Worcester, Massachusetts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214182130/http://www.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/Olive%20Thomas/default.html|archivedate=December 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their father, James Duffy, a [[steelworker]], died in a work-related accident in 1906. After his death, the family moved to [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]], a small [[mill town]]. Thomas and her brothers often stayed with their grandparents while her mother Rena worked in a local factory. Rena Duffy later married Harry M. Van Kirk, a worker on the [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]]. The two had a daughter, Harriet, born in 1914; she was killed in a car accident in 1931.&lt;ref name="vogel13"/&gt;

Thomas left school at the age 15 to help support her siblings. She got a job selling [[gingham]] at [[Joseph Horne Company|Joseph Horne's department store]] for {{US$|2.75|long=no|link=no}} per week ({{Inflation|index=US|value=2.75|start_year=1911|r=2|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="pitz"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Marylynne|last=Pitz|title=Olive Thomas, the original 'Flapper' and a Mon Valley native, still fascinates|date=September 26, 2010|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10269/1090121-60.stm|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1911, aged 16, she married Bernard Krugh Thomas in McKees Rocks. During the two-year marriage, she reportedly worked as a clerk in [[Kaufmann's]], a major [[department store]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. After their separation in 1913, Thomas moved to [[New York City]] and lived with a family member. She later found work in a [[Harlem]] department store.&lt;ref name=golden /&gt;

==Career==

===Modeling===
[[File:Oliveartistic.jpg|thumb|right|''Memories of Olive'' painted by [[Alberto Vargas]]]]

In 1914, Thomas entered and subsequently won the "Most Beautiful Girl in New York City" contest held by [[Howard Chandler Christy]], a [[commercial artist]]. Winning the contest helped establish her career as an artists' model, and she would later pose for [[Harrison Fisher]], [[Raphael Kirchner]], and Haskell Coffin. Thomas was featured on many magazine covers, including that of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UzUsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CsoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3975,1734959&amp;dq=olive+thomas+model&amp;hl=en|title=The Most Beautiful Girl In The Movies|date=October 22, 1919|work=Herald-Journal|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ogden"&gt;{{harvnb|Ogden|2009|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
Fisher wrote a letter of recommendation to [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.]], resulting in Thomas' being hired for the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]''. However, Thomas later disputed this, claiming she "walked right up and asked for the job".&lt;ref name="ogden" /&gt; She made her stage debut in the ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1915'' on June 21, 1915. Thomas' popularity in the ''Follies'' led to her being cast in Ziegfeld's more risqué ''Midnight Frolic'' show. The ''Frolic'' was staged after hours in the roof garden of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]]. It was primarily a show for famous male patrons who had plenty of money to bestow on the young and beautiful female performers. Thomas received expensive gifts from her admirers; it was rumored that [[Germany|German]] [[Ambassador]] [[Solf Circle#The tea party and betrayal of the Solf Circle|Albrecht von Bernstorff]] had given her a $10,000 string of pearls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hladik|2010|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time in ''The Follies'', Thomas began an affair with Florenz Ziegfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2001|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegfeld, who was married to actress [[Billie Burke]], had affairs with other Ziegfeld girls, including [[Lillian Lorraine]] and [[Marilyn Miller]] (who would later marry Thomas' widower [[Jack Pickford]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanson, Bruce K.|2011|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mizejewski|1999|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas ended the affair with Ziegfeld after he refused to leave Burke to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenrick|2008|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas continued modeling while appearing in the ''Follies''. She became the first "[[Vargas Girl]]" after she posed for a portrait painted by Peruvian artist [[Alberto Vargas]].&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{harvnb|Fleming|2008|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait, titled ''Memories of Olive,'' features Thomas nude from the waist up while clutching a rose. The portrait was reportedly commissioned by Florenz Ziegfeld but Vargas later denied this claim. Ziegfeld purchased and hung the portrait in his office at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Vargas, who called Thomas "one of the most beautiful brunettes that Ziegfeld ever glorified," kept a copy of the painting for his personal collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silent films===
In July 1916, Thomas signed with the International Film Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pizzitola|2002|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her on-screen debut in "Episode 10" of ''[[Beatrice Fairfax]]'', a film serial. In 1917, she made her full-length feature debut in ''A Girl Like That'' for [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1995|editor-last=Long|editor-first=Bruce|title=The Life and Death of Olive Thomas|journal=Taylorology|issue=33|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~ialong/Taylor33.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olive Thomas Out Yonder.jpg|left|thumb|Thomas in ''Out Yonder'' (1919)]]

That same year, she signed with Triangle Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2001|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, news broke of her engagement to actor Jack Pickford, whom she had married a year prior. Thomas and Pickford, who was the younger brother of [[Mary Pickford]], kept the marriage secret because Thomas did not want people to think her success in film was due to her association with the Pickfords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = York| first = Cal.| title = Plays and Players| url = https://books.google.com/?id=GH4XAQAAMAAJ| volume = 18| year = 1920| publisher = Macfadden Publications| page = 89| issue = 2–6| journal = Photoplay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first film for Triangle, ''Madcap Madge'', was released in June 1917. Thomas' popularity at Triangle grew with performances in ''Indiscreet Corrine'' (1917) and ''Limousine Life'' (1918). In 1919, she portrayed a French girl who poses as a boy in ''Toton the Apache''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1922|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas later said that she felt her work in ''Toton'' was "the first real thing I've ever done."&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt; She made her final film for Triangle, ''The Follies Girl'', that same year.

After leaving Triangle, Thomas signed with [[Myron Selznick]]'s Selznick Pictures Company in December 1918 for a salary of $2,500 a week. She hoped for more serious roles, believing that with her husband signed to the same company, she would have more influence. Her first film for Selznick, ''Upstairs and Down'' (1919), proved to be successful and established her image as a "[[Femme fatale|baby vamp]]." She followed with roles in ''[[Love's Prisoner]]'' and ''Out Yonder'', both in 1919.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt;&lt;ref name="golden1"&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2001|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Thomas played a teenage schoolgirl ''[[The Flapper]],'' who yearns for excitement beyond her small Florida town. Thomas was the first actress to portray a lead character who was a [[flapper]] and the film was the first of its kind to portray the flapper lifestyle. [[Frances Marion]], who wrote the scenario, was responsible for bringing the term into the American vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desser|Jowett|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagert|2010|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Flapper'' proved to be popular and became one of Thomas' most successful films.&lt;ref name=golden1 /&gt;

On October 4, 1920, Thomas' final film, ''[[Everybody's Sweetheart (1920 film)|Everybody's Sweetheart]]'', was released.

==Personal life==
Thomas' first marriage was to Bernard Krug Thomas, a man she met at age 15 while living in [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]]. They married on April 1, 1911, and lived with his parents in McKees Rocks for the first six months of their marriage. The couple later moved into their own apartment. Krug Thomas worked as a clerk at the [[Pressed Steel Car Company]] while Olive took care of the home.&lt;ref name="pittsburgpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BiUcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O0sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4122,163928&amp;dq=olive+thomas+james+duffy&amp;hl=en|title=From $2.75 To $4,000 Weekly As A Movie Star|date=February 4, 1931|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=19|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the couple separated and Olive moved to New York City to pursue a career as a model. She was granted a divorce on September 25, 1915, on the grounds of desertion and cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eMMWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OiEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3280,2737798&amp;dq=olive+thomas+divorce&amp;hl=en|title=Thomas Death Starts Quiz Into Paris Night Orgies|date=September 11, 1920|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Bernard Krug Thomas gave an interview to ''[[The Pittsburg Press]]'', detailing his marriage to Olive, implying that a cause of the demise of their marriage was her ambition, a desire to obtain a life of "luxury", and "improve her station".&lt;ref name=pittsburgpress /&gt;

[[File:OliveThomasAutographedPhoto.JPG|right|thumb|Autographed photo of Olive Thomas, circa 1916]]

In late 1916, Thomas met actor Jack Pickford, brother of one of the most successful silent stars, Mary Pickford, at a beach cafe on the [[Santa Monica Pier]]. Both Thomas and Pickford were known for their partying. Screenwriter Frances Marion remarked, "I had seen her often at the [[Pickfair|Pickford home]], for she was engaged to Mary's brother, Jack. Two innocent-looking children, they were the gayest, wildest brats who ever stirred the stardust on Broadway. Both were talented, but they were much more interested in playing the roulette of life than in concentrating on their careers."&lt;ref name="silentsgolden_top"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/lpolivethomasdeath.html|title=''The Mysterious Death of Olive Thomas''|author= Lussier, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas [[eloped]] with Pickford on October 25, 1916, in [[New Jersey]]. None of their family was present, with only actor [[Thomas Meighan]] as their witness. Although the couple never had any children of their own, in 1920, they adopted Thomas' six-year-old nephew, the son of one of her brothers, after his mother died.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt;

By most accounts, Thomas was the love of Pickford's life. However, the marriage was tumultuous and filled with highly charged conflict, followed by lavish making up through the exchange of expensive gifts.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt; Pickford's family did not always approve of Thomas, though most of the family did attend her funeral. In Mary Pickford's 1955 autobiography ''Sunshine and Shadow'', she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I regret to say that none of us approved of the marriage at that time. Mother [i.e., [[Charlotte Hennessey]]] thought Jack was too young, and [[Lottie Pickford|Lottie]] and I felt that Olive, being in [[musical comedy]], belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] never forgave Jack for taking her away from ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|the Follies]]''. She and Jack were madly in love with one another, but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickford|1955|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
For many years, Thomas and Pickford had intended to vacation together. Both were constantly traveling and had little time to spend together. With their marriage on the rocks, the couple decided to take a second [[honeymoon]].&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt; In August 1920, the pair headed for Paris, hoping to combine a vacation with some film preparations.&lt;ref name=golden1 /&gt;

On the night of September 5, 1920, they went out for a night of entertainment and partying at the famous bistros in the [[Montparnasse]] Quarter of Paris. Returning to their room in the [[Hotel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]] around 3 a.m., Pickford either fell asleep or was outside the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|2007|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intoxicated and tired Thomas ingested [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercury bichloride]] liquid solution. It had been prescribed to Pickford to topically treat sores caused by his chronic [[syphilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|2000|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas had either thought the flask contained drinking water or sleeping pills; accounts vary. The label was in [[French language|French]], which may have added to her confusion. After drinking the liquid she screamed, "Oh, my God!" and Pickford ran to pick her up. She was taken to the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]] in the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], where Pickford and his former brother-in-law [[Owen Moore]] remained at her side until she died five days later.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt;

===Controversy and death ruling===
While Thomas lay in the American Hospital dying, the press began reporting on the various rumors that began to arise about the circumstances of the incident. Some papers reported that Thomas had attempted suicide after having a fight with Pickford over his alleged infidelities, while others said she attempted suicide after discovering Pickford had given her syphilis. There were rumors that Thomas was plagued by a drug addiction, that she and Pickford had been involved in "champagne and cocaine orgies," or that Pickford tricked her into drinking poison in an attempt to murder her to collect her insurance money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blum|2011|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="petrucelli"&gt;{{harvnb|Petrucelli|2009|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beauchamp|1998|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Moore, who accompanied Pickford and Thomas in Paris, denied the rumors, saying that Thomas was not suicidal and that she and Pickford had not fought that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EckWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=biEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5330,7111&amp;dq=olive+thomas+poison&amp;hl=en|title=Denies Olive Thomas Suicide|date=September 26, 1920|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Pickford also denied the rumors, stating, "Olive and I were the greatest pals on Earth. Her death is a ghastly mistake."&lt;ref name=petrucelli /&gt;

On September 13, 1920, Pickford gave his account of that night to the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked airplane seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.&lt;p&gt;Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me to find out what was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.&lt;p&gt;Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.&lt;p&gt;She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.&lt;p&gt;She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Thomas' death, the police initiated an investigation and an [[autopsy]] was performed. Thomas' death was attributed to acute [[nephritis]] caused by mercury bichloride absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L0pLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6ikDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3680,4398473&amp;dq=olive+thomas+mercury&amp;hl=en|title=Bichloride of Mercury Killed Olive Thomas|date=September 15, 1920|work=The Toronto World|page=6|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 1920, her death was ruled [[accidental death|accidental]] by the Paris physician who conducted her autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fiZlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iYgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4685,1379476&amp;dq=olive+thomas+death&amp;hl=en|title=Olive Thomas' Death Declared An Accident|date=September 14, 1920|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|page=1|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral===
[[File:Olive Thomas Pickford Mausoleum 2009.jpg|thumb|Olive Thomas Pickford's [[mausoleum]] in New York]]

Jack Pickford brought Thomas' body back to the United States. Several accounts state that Pickford tried to commit suicide en route but was talked out of it. In her autobiography, Mary Pickford recalls her brother's disclosure that he had made such an attempt during the return trip:{{quote|Jack crossed the ocean with Ollie's body. It wasn't until several years later that he confessed to Mother how one night during the voyage back he put on his trousers and jacket over his pajamas, went up on deck, and was climbing over the rail when something inside him said: "You can't do this to your mother and sisters. It would be a cowardly act. You must live and face the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickford|1955|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On September 29, 1920, an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] funeral service for Thomas was held at [[Saint Thomas Church (New York City)|St. Thomas Episcopal Church]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y3lHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w_4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6493,2301497&amp;dq=olive+thomas+funeral&amp;hl=en|title=Funeral Service For Olive Thomas Largely Attended|date=September 20, 1920|work=Meriden Morning Record|page=1|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', police escorts were needed at the event, for the entire church was crowded with “hundreds” of fellow actors, other invited attendees, as well as a horde of curious onlookers. Several women are reported to have fainted during the ceremony, and several men had their hats crushed in the rush to view the casket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C05E2D91F31E433A2575AC2A96F9C946195D6CF|title=Women Faint At Olive Thomas Rite|date=September 20, 1920|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 19, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas is interred in a [[crypt]] at the [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanson, Nils|2011|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estate===
Thomas did not leave a will upon her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ObgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=okkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3757,1781642&amp;dq=olive+thomas+no+will&amp;hl=en|title=Olive Thomas Leave No Will; Estate Is Value At $25,000|date=October 5, 1920|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=16|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her estate, which was later valued at $27,644,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9904E1DF1239EF3ABC4D52DFB1668389639EDE|title=OLIVE THOMAS LEFT $27,644; Jack Pickford's Wife, Who Died by Poison, Left Everything to Mother.|date=July 15, 1922|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 19, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; was split between her mother, her two brothers, and husband Jack Pickford. Adjusted for inflation, that amount would be the equivalent to $348,323 in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm "CPI Inflation Calculator"], Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. Retrieved August 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Pickford later relinquished his right to a portion of the money, choosing instead to give his share to Thomas' mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ObgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=okkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3757,1781642&amp;dq=olive+thomas+no+will&amp;hl=en|title=Pickford Gets None Of Wife's Estate|date=August 15, 1922|work=[[Daily Record (Washington)|Ellensburg Daily Record]]|page=8|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 1920, the bulk of Thomas' personal property was auctioned off in an [[estate sale]], which netted approximately $30,000. [[Lewis J. Selznick|Lewis Selznick]] bought Thomas' [[town car]] for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cx8bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=60kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1062,2781654&amp;dq=olive+thomas+sold&amp;hl=en|title=$30,000 Realized As Olive Thomas' Effects Are Sold|date=November 23, 1920|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|page=4|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mabel Normand]] bought a 20-piece toilet set, a 14 karat gold [[cigarette case]], and three pieces of jewelry, including a [[sapphire]] pin.&lt;ref name=fleming /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The press coverage of Olive Thomas' death was one of the first examples of the media sensationalism related to a major Hollywood star. Her death has been cited as one of the first major [[Hollywood]] scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DiMare|2011|p=XXXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowe|2005|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scandals including the [[Roscoe Arbuckle#The scandal|Fatty Arbuckle trial]] in 1921, the murder of [[William Desmond Taylor]] in 1922, and the drug-related death of [[Wallace Reid]] caused many religious and morality groups to label Hollywood as "immoral". The public outcry prompted Hollywood studios to begin writing contracts with "morality clauses" or "[[moral turpitude]] clauses," allowing the dismissal of contractees who breached them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Menefee|2004|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* A legend that Thomas's ghost haunts the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] in [[New York City]] arose in the years following her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanson, Nils|2011|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2004, with funding from Timeline Films, and with the help of [[Hugh Hefner]] and his film preservation organization, Sarah J. Baker premiered her documentary on Olive Thomas' life, titled ''Olive Thomas: Everybody's Sweetheart''.
* In 2007, [[Michelle Vogel]] wrote a biography titled, ''Olive Thomas: The Life and Death of a Silent Film Beauty'', published by McFarland Publishing Company.
* ''Ghostlight'', a musical about the life of Olive Thomas, was written by Matthew Martin and [[Tim Realbuto]]. ''Ghostlight'' opened in New York City at the Signature Theatre on September 26, 2011, and was presented by the [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]]. It starred Drama Desk Award winner [[Rachel York]] as [[Billie Burke]], Tony nominee [[Michael Hayden (actor)|Michael Hayden]] as [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.]], Tony Award winner [[Daisy Eagan]] as Molly Cook, Kimberly Faye Greenberg as [[Fanny Brice]], Matt Leisy as Jack Pickford, and newcomer Rachael Fogle in the leading role of Olive Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/154882-Daisy-Eagan-Michael-Hayden-and-Rachel-York-Step-Into-Ghostlight-at-NYMF-Sept-26|title=Daisy Eagan, Michael Hayden and Rachel York Step Into Ghostlight at NYMF Sept. 26|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|date=September 26, 2011|publisher=playbill.com|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, novelist [[Laini Giles]] released a fictionalized biography of Olive called ''The Forgotten Flapper''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lainigiles.com/index.php/books-2/the-forgotten-flapper-a-novel-of-olive-thomas/|title=The Forgotten Flapper - A Novel of Olive Thomas -|first=|last=http://lainigiles.com|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based completely on factual information, it goes from her poor roots in Pennsylvania to her death, and is narrated by her ghost, now haunting the New Amsterdam Theatre.

__NOTOC__
'''Parashurama''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परशुराम, [[IAST]]: ''Paraśurāma'', lit. ''Rama with an axe'')&lt;!--Do not remove, WP:INDICSCRIPT doesn't apply to WikiProject Hinduism--&gt; is the [[dashavatara|sixth avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in [[Hinduism]]. Born as a [[brahmin]], Parshuram carried traits of a [[Kshatriya]] and is often regarded as a Brahmin-Kshatriya. He carried a number of [[Kshatriya]] traits, which included aggression, warfare and valor, also, serenity, prudence and patience. He, along with only [[Hanuman]] and [[Indrajit]] is considered to be an [[Atimaharathi]] ever born on Earth. Like other incarnations of Vishnu, he was foretold to appear at a time when overwhelming evil prevailed on earth. The Kshatriyas class, with weapons and power, had begun to abuse their power, take what belonged to others by force and tyrannize people. Parashurama corrects the cosmic equilibrium by destroying these evil Kshatriya warriors.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC |year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|pages=500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p324"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

He is also referred to as '''Rama Jamadagnya''', '''Rama Bhargava''' and '''Veerarama''' in some Hindu texts.&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p66"/&gt;
He is worshipped as the mool-purusha by Niyogi [[Bhumihar Brahmin]], [[Chitpavan Brahmin]], [[Tyagi]], Mohyals, Anavil and [[Nambudiri Brahmin]] communities.

==Legends==
[[File:Parashurama with axe.jpg|thumb|left|Parashurama by Raja Ravi Varma.]]
{{Vaishnavism}}
{{Hinduism}}
According to Hindu legends, Parashurama was the son of sage Jamadagni and his wife Renuka, living in a hut. They have a celestial cow called Surabhi which gives all they desire (such a cow is known as ''[[kamdhenu]]'').&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500"/&gt; A king named [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] (not to be confused with Arjuna the Pandava)&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p64"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ''Mahabharata'' includes legends about both Arjuna, one is dharmic (moral) and other adharmic (immoral); in some versions, Arjuna Kartavirya has mixed moral-immoral characteristics consistent with the Hindu belief that there is varying degrees of good and evil in every person.&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p64"/&gt;}} – learns about it and wants it. He asks Jamadagni to give it to him, but the sage refuses. While Parashurama is away from the hut, the king takes it by force.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500"/&gt; Parashurama learns about this crime, and is upset. With his axe in his hand, he challenges the king to battle. They fight, and Parushama kills the king, according to the Hindu mythology.&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p66"/&gt; The warrior class challenges him, and he kills all his challengers. The legend, states James Lochtefeld, likely has roots in the ancient conflict between the Brahmin varna with religious duties and the Kshatriya varna with warrior and enforcement role.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p324"/&gt;&lt;ref name=donaldson159&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas E Donaldson|editor= Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P. Shah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fETebHcHKogC |year=1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-316-8|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some versions of the legend, after his martial exploits, Parashurama returns to his sage father with the Surabhi cow and tells him about the battles he had to fight. The sage does not congratulate Parashurama, but reprimands him stating that a Brahmin should never kill a king. He asks him to expiate his sin by going on pilgrimage. After Parashurama returns from pilgrimage, he is told that while was away, his father was killed by warriors seeking revenge. Parashurama again picks up his axe and kills many warriors in retaliation. In the end, he relinquishes his weapons and takes up [[Yoga]].&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p82"/&gt;

In [[Kannada]] folklore, especially in devotional songs sung by the [[Devdasi]]s he is often referred to as son of [[Yellamma]].

Parasurama legends are notable for their discussion of violence, the cycles of retaliations, the impulse of ''krodha'' (anger), the inappropriateness of ''krodha'',  and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E Donaldson|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P. Shah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fETebHcHKogC |year=1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-316-8|pages=161–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Madeleine Biardeau, Parasurama is a mythical character constructed in ancient Hindu thought as a fusion of contradictions, possibly to emphasize the ease with which those with military power tend to abuse it, and the moral issues in circumstances and one's actions, particularly violent ones.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine BIARDEAU (1976), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43731697 Études de Mythologie Hindoue (IV): Bhakti et avatāra], Bulletin de l'École française d'Extrême-Orient, École française d’Extrême-Orient, Vol. 63 (1976), pp. 182-191, context: 111-263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freda Matchett|title=Krishna, Lord Or Avatara? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6znEVPmI8UsC&amp;pg=PA206 |year=2001| publisher= Routledge| isbn= 978-0-7007-1281-6|pages=206 with note 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Biardeau, in the Parashurama legend:

{{Quote|
The violent Brahmin is condemned, ultimately transformed (Jamadagni [his father] rids himself of anger and is slain without resisting; Rama [Parashurama] retires, his mind at peace, to his mountain refuge).
|Madeleine Biardeau&lt;ref&gt;M Biardeau (1970). ''The Story of Arjuna Kartavirya without Reconstruction'', Purana, Volume XII, Issue 2, pp. 293-294, context: 286-303&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to David Shulman, "Parashurama carries to a mythic extreme an enduring Brahmin conflict: on the one hand, restraint, purity, nonviolence, detachment; on the other, inherent power, and the recurring temptation to use it in the violent pursuit of an uncompromising vision". Indeed, states Shulman, the Parashurama myth implies that "the Brahmin can never be wholly free of violence, although it fails to specify its precise nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Dean Shulman|title=The King and the Clown in South Indian Myth and Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOv_AwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5775-3|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texts===
He is generally presented as the fifth son of Renuka and [[rishi]] Jamadagni, states Thomas E Donaldson.&lt;ref name=donaldson159/&gt; The legends of Parashurama appear in many Hindu texts, in different versions:&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornelia Dimmitt|title=Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=re7CR2jKn3QC |year=2012|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-4399-0464-0|pages=82–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In chapter 3.33 of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', he is the grandson of Satyavati, and the son of princess Renuka after she marries a Vedic scholar living in a forest.&lt;ref name=donaldson159/&gt;
*In chapter 6 of the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'', he is born from the thigh with intense light surrounding him that blinds all warriors, who then repent their evil ways and promise to lead a moral life if their eyesight is restored. The boy grants them the boon.&lt;ref name=donaldson159/&gt;
*In chapter 4 of the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', Rcika prepares a meal for two women, one simple, and another with ingredients that if eaten would cause the woman to conceive a son with martial powers. The latter is accidentally eaten by Renuka, and she then gives birth to Parashurama.&lt;ref name=donaldson159/&gt;
*In chapter 2 of the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'', he is born after his mother Renuka eats a sacrificial offering made to both [[Rudra]] (Shiva) and [[Vishnu]], which gives him dual characteristics of Kshatriya and Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E Donaldson|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

Parashurama is described in some versions of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' as the angry Brahmin who with his axe, killed huge number of Kshatriya warriors because they were abusing their power.&lt;ref name="Conquest of Parasurama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07067.htm|title=Drona Parva Section LXX|date=1883|publisher=Sacred Texts|work=The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa|accessdate=15 June 2016|author=Ganguly KM}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions, he even kills his own mother because his father asks him to and claim she had committed a sin by having lustful thoughts after seeing a young couple frolicking in water.&lt;ref name=daniel30/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p64"/&gt; After Parasurama obeys his father's order to kill his mother, his father grants him a boon.

He plays important roles in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' serving as mentor to [[Bhishma]] (chapter 5.178), [[Drona]] (chapter 1.121) and [[Karna]] (chapter 3.286), teaching weapon arts and helping key warriors in both sides of the war.&lt;ref name="Karna the conqueror of the entire world"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03252.htm|title=Mahabaratha, Digvijaya yatra of Karna|date=1896|publisher=Sacred Texts|work=The Mahabharata|accessdate=11 June 2015|author=Kisari Mohan Ganguli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Thomas|editor=Julia Leslie|title=Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrLKAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77881-0|pages=66–69 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Sanskrit epic uses multiple names for Parashurama in its verses: Parashurama, Jamadagnya, Rama (his name shortened, but not to be confused with [[Rama]] of Ramayana), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Thomas|editor=Julia Leslie|title=Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrLKAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77881-0|pages=69–71 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', he is the teacher of warrior [[Karna]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500"/&gt; In the regional literature of [[Kerala]], he is the founder of the land, the one who brought it out of the sea and settled a Hindu community there.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p324"/&gt; He is also known as Rama Jamadagnya and Rama Bhargava in some Hindu texts.&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p66"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Leslie|title=Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7LKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-77888-9|pages=63–66 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parashurama retired in the Mahendra mountain, according to chapter 2.3.47 of the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E Donaldson|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

==Parashurama Kshetras==
The region of [[Konkan]] is considered as Parashurama Kshetra.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wolpert (2006), Encyclopedia of India, Thomson Gale, {{ISBN|0-684-31350-2}}, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E Donaldson|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

The ancient Saptakonkana is a slightly larger region described in the Sahyadrikhanda which refers to it as Parashuramakshetra (Sanskrit for "the area of Parashurama").&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra|first=Suresh |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of Hindu Gods &amp; Goddesses |publisher= Sarup &amp; Sons|year= 1998|location= |page= 376|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mfTE6kpz6XEC|doi= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Parshuram Kund]], a Hindu pilgrimage centre in Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh which is dedicated to the sage Parashurama.Thousands of pilgrims visit the place in winter every year, especially on the [[Makar Sankranti]] day for a holy dip in the sacred kund which is believed to wash away one's sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Thousands gather at Parshuram Kund for holy dip on Makar Sankranti | publisher=The News Mill| url = http://thenewsmill.com/thousands-gather-parshuram-kund-holy-dip-makar-sankranti/ | accessdate = 2017-01-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 70,000 devotees take holy dip in Parshuram Kund|publisher=Indian Express | url = http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/70000-devotees-take-holy-dip-in-parshuram-kund/1061283/ |date=Jan 18, 2013| accessdate = 2014-06-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The Hindu literature on iconography such as the ''Vishnudharmottara Purana'' and ''Rupamandana'' describe him as a man with matted locks, with two hands, one carrying an axe. However, the ''[[Agni Purana]]'' portrays his iconography with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrow and sword. The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' describes his icon as one four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrows and a shield like a warrior.&lt;ref name=donaldson178&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E Donaldson|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

Typically, he is shown with two hands, with axe in his right hand either seated or standing.&lt;ref name=donaldson178/&gt;

The officers gave it as their opinion that they were decidedly guilty and that the safety of the vessel required that they should be immediately put to death, Commander Mackenzie entirely concurring in their opinion ordered preparations to be made for hanging them at the yard arm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of [[John C. Spencer]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] in [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John Tyler]]'s administration, and the grandson of [[Ambrose Spencer]], a [[New York (state)|New York]] politician and lawyer.

==Background==

Spencer was born in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]]. He was described as handsome, despite a "wandering eye" (possibly [[strabismus]]) which surgery was unable to correct. As a youth at Geneva College (now [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]]), he was considered wild and uncontrollable despite displaying signs of high intelligence. His favorite reading matter was pirate stories.

After an abortive stay at [[Union College]] &amp;ndash; where he was a founder of the [[Chi Psi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternity]] &amp;ndash; Spencer ran away and signed on a whaler at [[Nantucket]]. His father located him and convinced him that if a life on the sea was what he wanted, to live it as "a gentleman"; i.e., as a [[commissioned officer]].

As Secretary of War, it was easy for Spencer's father to procure his son a midshipman's commission. Spencer proved to be just as intractable as ever, assaulting a superior officer aboard the [[USS North Carolina (1820)|USS ''North Carolina'']] twice while under the influence of alcohol. Reassigned to the [[USS John Adams (1799)|USS ''John Adams'']], he was involved in a drunken brawl with a [[Royal Navy]] officer while on shore leave in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He was allowed to resign rather than face [[court-martial]], but due to his father's position in the Cabinet, his resignation was not accepted. Instead, he was posted to the [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']].

Aboard the ''Somers'', Spencer gained favor with the [[Naval rating|rating]]s &amp;ndash; many of whom were boys &amp;ndash; through his privileged access to tobacco and rum. He also exhibited an irreverent attitude toward the navy and his captain, [[Alexander Slidell Mackenzie]]. In November 1842, during the return home from a voyage to [[Liberia]], suspicion arose that Spencer had formed a plan to seize the ''Somers'' and sail her as a [[pirate ship]]. His friendship with crew members [[Samuel Cromwell]] and [[Elisha Small]] was cited as evidence, as both these men were rumored to have sailed aboard in the past.
[[File:Somers, starboard side, under sail, 1842 - NARA - 512981.tif|left|thumb|200px|USS ''Somers'', 1842 lithograph, with men hanging from yardarm.]]
On November 26, Spencer was shackled and detained on the ''Somers''' foredeck after a list of names was found in his razor case. The names had been written using [[Greek letters]]. The following day, Cromwell and Small were also detained on the foredeck. After a meeting of the ship's officers, all three men were hanged on the yardarm on December 1 (at {{Coord|17|34|28|N|41|24|45|W|type:event|display=inline,title}}).&lt;ref name="SouthernLiterary" /&gt; Spencer was nearly 20 years old.

===Court of Inquiry===

When the brig returned to New York, the Secretary of the Navy convened a court of [[flag officers]] to investigate the matter. Following a month of testimony, on January 23, 1843, the court of inquiry exonerated the captain and his officers, ruling the hangings fully justified.&lt;ref name="SouthernLiterary"&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=Thomas W. |editor1-last=White |editor1-link= |date= March 1843 |title=Cases of Mutiny at Sea |journal=[[Southern Literary Messenger]] |volume=IX  |issue=III|pages=135&amp;ndash;136 |publisher=P. D. Bernard |location=[[Richmond, Virginia]]  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGAAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA135 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the commander was exonerated, public opinion was against him. Mackenzie requested that he be charged and tried by court martial. The court martial acquitted him on a split vote.

===Court of public opinion===

The government accepted the court's decision, but the acquittal did not satisfy public concerns with the case. Many commentators, including [[James Fenimore Cooper]], denounced the hangings as murder and criticized the Navy's handling of the matter as an example of what today could be called a "whitewash."

The circumstance of Spencer, Cromwell and Small's deaths is one reason the U.S. Navy stopped training boys at sea and founded the [[United States Naval Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Review of William Leeman's Naval Academy history, ''The Long Road to Annapolis'' |first=John |last=Lehman |authorlink=John Lehman  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080602819.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id=   |date=August 8, 2010 |page=B6 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |quote=In 1842, midshipman Philip Spencer, who happened to be the son of the secretary of war, was hanged aboard the training brig Somers by his captain on suspicion of conspiracy to mutiny.

[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
'''Premature burial''', also known as '''live burial''', '''burial alive''', or '''vivisepulture''', means to be [[burial|buried]] while still alive.

Animals or humans may be buried alive accidentally on the mistaken assumption that they are dead, or intentionally as a form of torture, murder, or [[execution (legal)|execution]]. It may also occur with consent of the victim as a part of a [[stunt]], with the intention to escape.

[[Fear of being buried alive]] is reported to be among the most common [[phobia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Bondeson'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology ==
Premature burial can lead to death through the following: [[asphyxiation]], [[dehydration]], [[starvation]], or (in cold climates) [[hypothermia]]. A person trapped with fresh air to breathe can last a considerable time and burial has been used as a very cruel method of execution (as in cases of [[Vestal Virgin]]s who violated the oath of celibacy), lasting sufficiently long for the victim to comprehend and imagine every stage of what is happening (being trapped in total darkness with very limited or no movement) and to experience great psychological and physical torment including extreme panic. The medical term for the fear of being buried alive is [[taphophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11719|title=Taphephobia|work=MedicineNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unintentional live burial ==
At least one (almost certainly [[apocryphal]]) report of accidental burial dates back to the fourteenth century. Upon the reopening of his tomb, the philosopher [[John Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308) was reportedly found outside his coffin with his hands torn and bloody after attempting to escape.&lt;ref&gt;For a variant, see ''Encycl. Brit.'' (1823) [https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=r8YnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.24]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Blunden]] of [[Basingstoke]] was said in a contemporaneous account to have been buried alive, not once but twice, in 1674.

Revivals of supposed "corpses" have been triggered by dropped coffins, grave robbers, embalming, and attempted dissections.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Mikkelson'' (2006), [http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesome/buried.asp Just Dying To Get Out]&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of unintentional live burial has been overestimated, and that the normal, physical effects of decomposition are sometimes misinterpreted as signs that the person whose remains are being exhumed had revived in his or her coffin.&lt;ref&gt;''Barber'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, patients have been documented as late as the 1890s as accidentally being sent to the [[morgue]] or trapped in a steel box after erroneously being declared dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Mikkelson'' (2006), [http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesome/buried.asp Just Dying To Get Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers have reported cases of exhumed corpses which appear to have been accidentally buried alive. On February 21, 1885, ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave a disturbing account of such a case. The victim was a man from [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]] whose name was given as "Jenkins". His body was found turned over onto its front inside the coffin, with much of his hair pulled out. Scratch marks were also visible on all sides of the coffin's interior. His family were reportedly "distressed beyond measure at the criminal carelessness" associated with the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/02/21/109780353.pdf|title=A MAN BURIED ALIVE. -  WHAT HIS FRIENDS DISCOVERED WHEN THE COFFIN WAS OPENED. - View Article – NYTimes.com|date=21 February 1885|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar story was reported in ''The Times'' on January 18, 1886, the victim of this case being described simply as a "girl" named "Collins" from [[Woodstock, Ontario]], Canada. Her body was described as being found with the knees tucked up under the body, and her burial shroud "torn into shreds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/01/19/103950202.pdf|title=BURIED ALIVE.|date=19 January 1886|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a body bag was delivered to the Matarese Funeral home in Ashland, Massachusetts with a live occupant.   Funeral director John Matarese discovered this, called paramedics, and avoided live embalming or premature burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94291|title=Body-bagged Woman Still Alive|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidabel9.blogspot.com/2005/05/corpse-is-alive.html|title=Profiles, Etc.|author=David Abel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 in [[Peraia, Thessaloniki|Peraia]], [[Thessaloniki]], in [[Greek Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Greece]], the police discovered that a 45-year-old woman was buried alive and died of asphyxia after being declared clinically dead by a private hospital; she was discovered just shortly after being buried by children playing near the cemetery who heard screams from inside the earth and afterwards her family was reported as considering suing the private hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news247.gr/eidiseis/koinonia/anatrixiastikh-kataggelia-ethapsan-zwntanh-45xronh-sth-thessalonikh.3047624.html|title=Ανατριχιαστική καταγγελία: Έθαψαν ζωντανή 45χρονη στη Θεσσαλονίκη|author=news247|date=25 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it was reported that in 2014 again in Peraia, Thessaloniki, in Macedonia, Greece, police investigation concluded that a 49-year-old woman was buried alive after being declared dead due to cancer; her family reported that they could hear her scream from inside the earth at the cemetery shortly after burial and the investigation revealed that she died of heart failure inside the coffin and found out that it was the medicines given to her by her doctors for her cancer that caused her to be declared clinically dead and buried alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news247.gr/eidiseis/koinonia/porisma-sok-h-49xronh-karkinopathhs-sthn-peraia-htan-zwntanh-otan-thn-ethapsan.3654172.html|title=Πόρισμα σοκ: Η 49χρονη καρκινοπαθής στην Περαία ήταν ζωντανή όταν την έθαψαν|author=news247|date=9 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to prevent live burial ==
[[File:Premature Burial Vault.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A burial vault built c. 1890 with internal escape hatches to allow the victim of accidental premature burial to escape.]]
[[Robert Robinson (Dissenting minister)|Robert Robinson]] died in Manchester in 1791. A movable glass pane was inserted in his coffin, and the mausoleum had a door for purposes of inspection by a watchman, who was to see if he breathed on the glass. He instructed his relatives to visit his grave periodically to check that he was actually dead.&lt;ref&gt;James Cocks; ''Memorials of Hatherlow and of the old Chadkick Chapel''; Stockport, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Safety coffin]]s were devised to prevent premature burial, although there is no evidence that any have ever been successfully used to save an accidentally buried person. On 5 December 1882, J. G. Krichbaum received {{US Patent|268693}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00268693&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=21E9B9F5F7EE|title=Patent Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his "Device For Life In Buried Persons". It consisted of a movable periscope-like pipe which provided air and, when rotated or pushed by the person interred, indicated to passersby that someone was buried alive.  The patent text refers to "that class of devices for indicating life in buried persons," suggesting that such inventions were common at the time.

In 1890, a family designed and built a burial vault at the Wildwood Cemetery in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]], with an internal hatch to allow the victim of accidental premature burial to escape. The vault had an air supply and was lined in felt to protect a panic-stricken victim from self-inflicted injury before escape. Bodies were to be removed from the casket before interment.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'' (1921), p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Association for the Prevention of Premature Burial was co-founded in 1896 by [[William Tebb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/74781|title=William Tebb |work=Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Hadwen]].

The [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]] ({{zh|t=焚書坑儒|s=焚书坑儒|p=fénshū kēngrú}}) refers to a suppression of intellectual thought carried out by [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor of a [[Imperial China|unified China]]. Books and texts deemed to be subversive [[Book burning|were burned]] and 460 [[Confucianism|Confucian scholars]] were buried alive in 212 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Lois Mai | last = Chan  | title = The Burning of the Books in China, 213 B.C.  | journal = The Journal of Library History | year = 1972  | volume = 7 | number = 2 | pages = 101–108  | jstor = 25540352   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tacitus]], in his work ''[[Germania]]'', records that German tribes practiced two forms of [[capital punishment]]; the first where the victim was hanged from a tree, and another where the victim was tied to a wicker frame, pushed face down into mud and buried. The first was used to make an example of traitors; the second was used for punishment of dishonourable or shameful vices, such as cowardice. According to Tacitus, the Ancient Germans thought that crime should be exposed, whereas infamy should be buried out of sight.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Church, Brodribb (1868), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P9pUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=buried&amp;f=false p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Rome, a [[Vestal Virgin]] convicted of violating her vows of [[celibacy]] was "buried alive" by being sealed in a cave with a small amount of bread and water, ostensibly so that the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] could save her were she truly innocent,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Perrin (1914), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#10 Life of Numa Pompilius]&lt;/ref&gt; essentially making it into a [[trial by ordeal]]. This practice was, strictly speaking, [[immurement]] (i.e., being walled up and left to die) rather than premature burial. According to Christian tradition, a number of saints were martyred this way, including [[Saint Castulus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ökumen. HeilgenLex. [http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienC/Castulus_Kastulus.htm Castulus]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saint Vitalis of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15486a.htm St. Vitalis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, in the [[Ribe]] city statute, which was promulgated in 1269, a female thief was to be buried alive, and in the law by [[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret I]], adulterous women were to be punished with premature burial, men with beheading.&lt;ref&gt;Stemann (1871), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gF4DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA633 pp. 633–634]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] a variety of offenses including rape, infanticide and theft could be punished with live burial. For example, the [[Schwabenspiegel]], a law code from the 13th century, specified that the rape of a virgin should be punished by live burial (whereas the rapist of a non-virgin was to be beheaded).&lt;ref&gt;''Berner'' (1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6PFCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA417 p. 417]&lt;/ref&gt; Female murderers of their own employers also risked being buried alive. In [[Augsburg]] 1505, for example, a 12-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl were found guilty of killing their master, in conspiracy with the cook. The boy was beheaded, and the girl and the cook were buried alive beneath the gallows.&lt;ref&gt;Welser, Werlich, Gasser (1595), [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=TodPAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=k%C3%B6chin+m%C3%A4gdlin#v=snippet&amp;q=k%C3%B6chin%20m%C3%A4gdlin pp. 264–265]&lt;/ref&gt; The jurist [[Eduard Henke]] observed that in the Middle Ages, live burial of women guilty of infanticide was a "very frequent" punishment in city statutes and ''[[Landrecht (medieval)|Landrechten]]''. For example, he notes those in [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Hesse]], [[Bohemia]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].&lt;ref&gt;Henke (1809), [https://books.google.com/books?id=G0MUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96, footnote r]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Berlinisches Stadtbuch" records that between 1412 and 1447, 10 women were buried alive there,&lt;ref&gt;Fidicin (1837), [https://books.google.com/books?id=x6BSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA275 pp. 275–276]&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as in 1583, the archbishop of Bremen promulgated (alongside the somewhat milder 1532 [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] punishment of [[drowning]]) live burial as an alternate execution method for punishing mothers found guilty of infanticide.&lt;ref name="Observationes iuris universi"&gt;Pufendorf (1757) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;id=MQpBAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=gliedmassen+empfangen#v=snippet&amp;q=gliedmassen%20empfangen p. 649, p. 57 in "Appendix Variorum Statutorum et Jurium", article 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Elias Pufendorf,&lt;ref name="Observationes iuris universi" /&gt; a woman buried alive would afterwards be impaled through the heart. This combined punishment of live burial and impalement was practiced in [[Nuremberg]] until 1508 also for women found guilty of theft, but the city council decided in 1515 that the punishment was too cruel, and opted for drowning instead.&lt;ref&gt;''Siebenkees, Kiefhaber'' (1792), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2X8AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA599 p.599-600]&lt;/ref&gt; Impalement was, however, not always mentioned together with live burial. [[Eduard Osenbrüggen]] relates how the live burial of a woman convicted of infanticide could be pronounced in a court verdict. For example, in a 1570 case in [[Ensisheim]]:
{{quote |The verdict commanded the executioner to place the perpetrator in the grave alive, "and place two layers of thorns, the one beneath, the other above her. Prior to that he should place a bowl over her face, in which he had made a hole, and to give her through that&lt;ref&gt;(in order that she would live for a longer time and expiate the evil act she was condemned for), parenthesis included in original&lt;/ref&gt; a reed/tube into the mouth, then jump three times upon her, and lastly cover her with earth"&lt;ref&gt;German original: Das Urtheil befahl dem Nachrichter, die Thäterin lebendig in das Grab zu legen, "und zwo Wellen Dornen, die eine under, die ander uff sie,-, doch das es Irn zuvor ein Schüssel uff das Angesicht legen, in welche er ein Loch machen und ihr durch dasselb (damit sie desto lenger leben und bemelte böse Misshandlung abbiesen möge) ein Ror in Mund geben, volgens uff sie drey spring thun und sie darnach mit Erden bedecken solle&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In this particular case, however, some noblewomen made an appeal for mercy, and the convicted woman was drowned instead.&lt;ref&gt;Osenbrüggen (1868), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YWE7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA357 p. 357]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieter Furcht speculates that the impalement was not so much to be regarded as an execution method, but as a way to prevent the condemned from becoming an avenging, undead [[Wiedergänger]].&lt;ref&gt;Feucht (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Italy, unrepentant murderers were buried alive, head down, feet in the air, a practice referred to in passing in Canto XIX of [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alighieri, O'Donnell (1852), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qFWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA120 p. 120]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Faroe Islands]], a powerful 14th-century woman landowner in the village of [[Húsavík, Faroe Islands|Húsavík]] was said to have buried two servants alive.

In the 16th-century [[Habsburg Netherlands]], where the Catholic authorities made a prolonged effort to stamp out the Protestant churches, live burial was commonly used as the punishment of  women found guilty of heresy. The last to be so executed was Anna Utenhoven, an [[Anabaptist]] buried alive at  [[Vilvoorde]] in 1597. Reportedly, when her head was still above the ground she was given a last chance to recant her faith, and upon her refusal she was completely covered up and suffocated. The case aroused a great deal of protest in the [[Dutch Revolt|rebellious north provinces]], and foiled the peace feelers which King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] was at the time extending to the Dutch. Thereafter the Habsburg authorities avoided further such cases, punishing heresy with fines and deportations rather than death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Into the seventeenth century in feudal Russia, live burial as execution method was known as "the pit" and used against women who were condemned for killing their husbands. In 1689, the punishment of live burial was changed to beheading.&lt;ref&gt;''Muravyeva, Rosslyn, Tosi'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rUqU5305GxEC&amp;pg=PA227 p. 227] Source in Russian:[http://allpravo.ru/library/doc101p/instrum2363/]&lt;/ref&gt; Live burial of Jews in such countries as Ukraine is reported; for example some instances occurred during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki Massacre]] (1648–1649) in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen (2005) [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/ukraine.html Virtual Jewish History Tour: Ukraine], for example: Chmielnicki Massacre (1648–1649): "In the city of Mogila they slaughtered 800 nobles together with their wives and children as well as 700 Jews, also with wives and children.

== Voluntary burial ==
[[File:Codice Casanatense Hindu Burial.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[Códice Casanatense]], depicting a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ritual, in which a widow is buried alive with her dead husband]]
On rare occasions, people have willingly arranged to be buried alive, reportedly as a demonstration of their controversial ability to survive such an event. In one story taking place around 1840, [[Sadhu Haridas]], an Indian [[fakir]], is said to have been buried in the presence of a British military officer and under the supervision of the local [[maharajah]], by being placed in a sealed bag in a wooden box in a vault. The vault was then interred, earth was flattened over the site and crops were sown over the place for a very long time. The whole location was guarded day and night to prevent fraud and the site was dug up twice in a ten-month period to verify the burial, before the fakir was finally dug out and slowly revived in the presence of another officer. The fakir said that his only fear during his "wonderful sleep" was to be eaten by underground worms. However, according to current medical science, it is not possible for a human to survive for a period of ten months without food, water, and air.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysterious People'' [http://www.mysteriouspeople.com/suspended_animation.htm Mind Power – Strange Cases of Suspended Animation]&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources the entire burial was 40 days long. The Indian government has since made the act of voluntary premature burial illegal, because of the unintended deaths of individuals attempting to recreate this feat.

In 2010 a Russian man died after being buried alive to try to overcome his fear of death but he was crushed to death by the earth on top of him.&lt;ref name="bbc2011"&gt;''BBC News'' (2011)[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13623938 Russian who buried himself alive dies by mistake]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, another Russian died after being buried overnight in a makeshift coffin "for good luck".&lt;ref name="bbc2011" /&gt;

''[[Buried Alive (performance)|Buried Alive]]'' is a controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/02/06/alarm_raised_over_burial_performance.html|title=Alarm raised over burial performance – Toronto Star|website=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; art and lecture performance series by art-tech group [[monochrom]]. Participants have the opportunity to be buried alive in a coffin for fifteen to twenty minutes. As a framework program monochrom offers lectures about the history of the science of determining death and the medical cultural history of premature burial.

== Myths and legends ==
[[Saint Otteran|St. Oran]] was a [[druid]] living on the [[Iona|Island of Iona]] in Scotland's [[Inner Hebrides]]. He became a follower of [[St. Columba]], who brought Christianity to Iona from Ireland in 563 AD. When St. Columba had repeated problems building the original [[Iona Abbey]], citing interference from the [[Devil]], St. Oran offered himself as a human sacrifice and was buried alive. He was later dug up and found to be still alive, but he uttered such words describing what of the afterlife he had seen and how it involved no heaven or hell, that he was ordered to be covered up again. The building of the abbey went ahead, untroubled, and St. Oran's chapel marks the spot where the saint was buried.&lt;ref&gt;''MacLeod Banks'' (1931), pp.55-60&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourteenth through nineteenth centuries, a popular tale about premature burial in European [[folklore]] was the "[[Lady with the Ring]]". In the story, a woman who was prematurely buried awakens to frighten a grave robber who is attempting to cut a ring off her finger.&lt;ref&gt;''Bondeson'' (2001), pp.35-50&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'' tested the myth to see if someone could survive being buried alive for two hours before being rescued. Host [[Jamie Hyneman]] attempted the feat, but when his steel coffin began to bend under the weight of the earth used to cover it, the experiment was aborted.&lt;ref&gt;[[MythBusters]].[[MythBusters (2003 season)#Episode 5 – "Buried Alive"|Season 1: Episode 5, "Buried Alive"]], Original airdate: October 24, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radomir Radović''' (1951 – 30 April 1984) was a civil engineering technician and trade unionist who advocated creating an independent trade union in [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. He was among 28 members of [[Milovan Djilas|Milovan Đilas's]] Open University arrested on 20 April 1984. He was found dead several days later, on 30 April, under unsolved circumstances.

== Early life and political engagement ==
He graduated from a vocational technical high school. He soon became involved in trade union activism.

He helped to organize a petition, circulated by the workers of the Belgrade engineering enterprise ''Minela'', demanding the replacement and punishment of one of the directors, Radoje Stefanović, for misappropriation and theft. An investigation was started but soon dropped, the signatories being informed that Stefanović had been appointed to head the executive of the Belgrade City Council. Radović was sacked.

He then found a job at ''Hidrotehnika'', where he was also involved in a workers' petition against Mikaina Savić, a judge in the Court of Associated Labor. The petition led nowhere and the city's new top executive moved in to protect her.&lt;ref name = "Magaš"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magaš|first1=Branka|title=The Destruction of Yugoslavia: Tracking the Break-up 1980-92|year=1993|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0860915935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5np99Vgc0YC|accessdate=3 October 2017|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982. Radović wrote to the Ninth Congress of the Union of Syndicates criticizing the system and suggesting measures to stop the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Collapse of the Yugoslav economy|financial crisis]]. He requested that the trade union be free from government control and a free association of workers, the [[right to strike]], and punishment for those governing structures and individuals who contributed to the crisis. He requested that all government business be subject to control by the public. He advocated for the [[freedom of the press]] and a public dialog on all burning issues. Radović especially requested that the Congress condemn the juntas in [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|Turkey]] and [[Martial law in Poland|Poland]]. The ruling party treated this as "heretical" and connected it to support for [[Lech Wałęsa]].&lt;ref name = "Ivanović"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivanović|first1=Ivan|title=Toplica sa lica|year=2017|publisher=Presing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhAZDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest and death ==
He was arrested on 20 April 1984 together with the 28 members of the Open University led by Milovan Đilas. During the night between the 20th and the 21st, Radović was interrogated by Ranko Savić, the brother of Mikaina Savić.&lt;ref name = "Magaš" /&gt; He was released on the 21st, and then arrested again on the 22nd only to be released on the 23rd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/02/Yugoslav-dissident-found-dead/5924452318400/ Yugoslav dissident found dead - UPI Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''raising of the son of the widow of Nain''' is an account of a miracle by [[Jesus]], recorded in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Jesus arrived at the village of Nain during the burial ceremony of the son of a widow, and raised the young man from the dead. ({{bibleref|Luke|7:11–17|NIV}})

The location is the village of [[Nein|Nain]], two miles south of [[Mount Tabor]]. This is the first of three [[miracles of Jesus]] in the [[canonical gospels]] in which he raises the dead, the other two being the [[raising of Jairus' daughter]] and [[Raising of Lazarus|of Lazarus]].

==Biblical account==
The miracle is described thus:

{{Quotation|11 Soon afterward Jesus went to a town named Nain, accompanied by His disciples and a large crowd. 12 And when He arrived at the gate of the town, a funeral procession was coming out.  A young man had died, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.  And a large crowd from the town was with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, His heart was filled with pity for her, and He said to her, “Do not weep”. 14 Then He walked over and touched the coffin, while the pallbearers stood still.  Jesus said to the dead man, “Young man, I say to thee, arise!” And he who was dead, sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

16 Then they all were filled with awe and praised God.  And they said, “A great prophet has risen among us”, and “God has visited His people”.

17 This news about Jesus went out through all the country and the surrounding territory. |}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Niin 120.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Widow's Son Church at [[Nein|Nain]] which is the site of the miracle.]]
The [[raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath]], by the Old Testament prophet [[Elijah]] (1 ''Kings'' 17), is seen by [[Fred Craddock]] as the model for this miracle, as there are several parallels in the details.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Craddock]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HX10bLsVOqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=craddock+luke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VgCJUveSN_CM7Abd7IDADQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nain&amp;f=false Luke]'', 2009 {{ISBN|0664234356}} page 43, 95–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[raising of the son of the woman of Shunem]] (2 ''Kings'' 4) by [[Elisha]] is also similar, including the reaction of the people. In particular, the location of Nain is very close to [[Shunem]], identified with modern [[Sulam]]. [[Sinclair Ferguson]] calls attention to this as an example of a repeated pattern in the history of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinclair Ferguson]], ''[http://www.proctrust.org.uk/dls/christ_paper.pdf Preaching Christ from the Old Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903060849/http://www.proctrust.org.uk/dls/christ_paper.pdf |date=2013-09-03 }}'', Proclamation Trust, 2002, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the pattern repetition 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"comes to its fullness in the person of Jesus Christ, the great prophet who heals not merely through delegated authority from God, but on his own authority, without rituals or prayers, but with a simple word of power. Here is the great God and Saviour of Israel in the flesh"...&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The woman in the story had lost both her husband and her only son, so that there was no one left to support her. As she could not have inherited the land, the loss of her only son would have left her dependent on the charity of more distant relatives and neighbours.&lt;ref name=Sizer&gt;[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/resources/sermons/sizer_widow_naian.htm Sizer, Peter.

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully. The definition of ''religio'' by [[Cicero]] is ''cultum deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' II, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar used ''religio'' to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caesar |first1=Julius |last2=Translated by |first2=W.A. McDevitte and W.S. Bohn |title=The Works of Julius Caesar: Parallel English and Latin |date=2007 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=9781605063553 |pages=377–378 |chapter=Civil Wars – Book 1|quote= Sic terror oblatus a ducibus, crudelitas in supplicio, nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit." – (Latin); "Thus the terror raised by the generals, the cruelty and punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed all hopes of surrender for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced matters to the former state of war."- (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder, used the term ''religio'' on elephants in that they venerate the sun and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1 |publisher=Perseus – Tufts University |language=Book 8 Chapter 1|quote= maximum est elephans proximumque humanis sensibus, quippe intellectus illis sermonis patrii et imperiorum obedientia, officiorum quae didicere memoria, amoris et gloriae voluptas, immo vero, quae etiam in homine rara, probitas, prudentia, aequitas, religio quoque siderum solisque ac lunae veneratio." – (Latin); "The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it has been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon." – (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligare}}'' bind, connect, probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re'' (again) + ''ligare'' or to reconnect, which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation given by [[Lactantius]] in ''Divinae institutiones'', IV, 28.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.''

Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huizinga |first1=Johan |title=The Waning of the Middle Ages |date=1924 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=86|title-link=The Autumn of the Middle Ages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature: From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=254|chapter=10. Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, ''religio'' referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards God.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; ''Religio'' was most often used by the ancient Romans not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions such as hesitation, caution, anxiety, fear; feelings of being bound, restricted, inhibited; which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context.&lt;ref name="religio roman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=1. 'Religio' without “Religion” |pages=15–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also closely related to other terms like ''scrupulus'' which meant "very precisely" and some Roman authors related the term ''supertitio'', which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame, to ''religio'' at times.&lt;ref name="religio roman" /&gt; When ''religio'' came into English around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of "life bound by monastic vows" or monastic orders.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle" /&gt; The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious things were separated from worldly things, was not used before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17|chapter=Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8. Imagine No 'Threskeia': The Task of the Untranslator  |pages=123–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;
Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0801887567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; Others argue that using religion on non-western cultures distorts what people do and believe.&lt;ref name="Smith Meaning and End"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Wilfred Cantwell |title=The Meaning and End of Religion|date=1991|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0800624750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish ideologies of Peace and Peacemaking|pages=86-87|quote=Yet despite its ingrained theological tradition, one must acknowledge that the Jewish people did not begin to think of Judaism as a religion until fairly recently. To be clear, the contemporary religious category popularly known as Judaism can be traced back to an ancient Jewish culture traditionally entailing certain fixed ideas about God. That culture also involved unique rites and behaviors related to the worship of God later to be construed as key elements of the Jewish faith. But these cultural effects did not constitute a religion in the formal sense of the word (Nongbri 2013, 46-50). They entailed no compulsory system of belief or regulatory ritual program by which to measure one's Jewish identity. To be a Jew was primarily a matter of national or ethnic identification, a function of being born into a family of Jewish descent or choosing to disavow one's own ancestral culture to become a Jew. By and large, it was not a matter of confession or creed (Satlow 2006, 1-19). It was not until the nineteenth century that Jewish thinkers began to conceive of their ancestral culture in systematized religious terms. Seeking entry into a European civil society dominated by Christian values, many Jews touched by the liberal values of the European Enlightenment undertook to interpret their Judaism in terms analogous to Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; It was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish" /&gt; The Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. ''Threskeia'' is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300154160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''[[Din (Arabic)|din]]'' is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as law.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; 

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]].

In other words, the category itself is a colonialist imposition that cannot work with any accuracy for Indian folk in the final analysis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

The indigenous religions of the Americas and Africa were not represented.

But these diverse identities were united, each an integral part of life; no part existed in a separate sphere identified as "religious." Nor were the diverse traditions lumped together under the term "Hinduism" unified by sharing such common features of religion as a single founder, creed, theology, or institutional organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hindu" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...). It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion.

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A.M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017| citeseerx=10.1.1.613.6995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0034412504007462|title='Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited|journal=Religious Studies|volume=41|pages=81–94|year=2005|last1=Finlay|first1=Hueston E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the preistly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-516655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''. New York: NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-6701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

A global poll in 2012 surveyed 57 countries and reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious, 23% as [[irreligion|not religious]], 13% as convinced [[atheism|atheists]], and also a 9% decrease in identification as religious when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries.&lt;ref name="gia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |title= Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism |publisher= WIN-Gallup International |date= 27 July 2012 |accessdate= 24 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120906165952/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |archivedate= 6 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as convinced atheists.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

==Specific religions==
{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

===Dharmic (Indian)===
[[File:Rama, Lakshman and Sita at the Kalaram Temple, Nashik..jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hindu]] statue of [[Lord Rama]] in Kalaram Temple ([[India]])]]
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.

The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

===Indigenous and folk===
[[File:Chinese temple incence burner.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] burner in China]]

[[Iranian religions]] are ancient religions whose roots predate the [[Islamization]] of [[Greater Iran]]. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.

[[Zoroastrianism]] is based on the teachings of prophet [[Zoroaster]] in the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrians worship the [[Creator deity|creator]] [[Ahura Mazda]]. In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.

[[Mandaeism]] is a [[monotheistic]] religion with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the Last [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]].

===New religious movements===
{{Main|New religious movement}}
*  [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]] among hundreds of smaller groups.
* [[Cao Đài]] is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in [[Vietnam]] in 1926.

* [[Unitarian Universalism]] is a religion characterized by support for a free and responsible search for truth and meaning, and has no accepted [[creed]] or [[theology]].
* [[Noahidism]] is a monotheistic ideology based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and on their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism.
* [[Scientology]] teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience and understand painful or traumatic events and decisions in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.
* [[Eckankar]] is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one's life.
* [[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], involving the worship of a God and Goddess.
* [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]] is a religion promoting harmony with nature, and drawing on the practices of the druids.

* [[Satanism]] is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity ([[Theistic Satanism]]) or use Satan as a symbol of carnality and earthly values ([[LaVeyan Satanism]]).

[[Sociological classifications of religious movements]] suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including [[Church (building)|churches]], [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, and [[institution]]s.

==Related aspects==

===Law===
{{main|Law and religion}}
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=John |year=2012 |title=The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x12000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, ''Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham and Brett G.

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |isbn=978-0802828231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri/&gt; The term science emerged in the 19th century out of [[natural philosophy]] in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ([[natural science]]),&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226482149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"/&gt; It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy|last2=Rachels|first2=(ed) Stuart|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-078-03824-2|edition=7|location=New York|page=|last1=Rachels|first1=(ed) James}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Christianity, morality can have a [[Secular morality|secular basis]].

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===

{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics like [[Hector Avalos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regina Schwartz]],&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2007"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God is not Great |publisher=Twelve |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, "The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour", ''Proc. R. Soc. B'' (2009) 276, 31–37] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042608/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf |date=28 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "C1 World Dialogue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|title=konsoleH :: Login|work=c1worlddialogue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195027/http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|archivedate=28 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambuddhism.com/|title=Islam and Buddhism|work=islambuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/|title=» World Interfaith Harmony Week UNGA Resolution A/65/PV.34|work=worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Humans''''' is a puzzle game published and released by [[GameTek]] in 1992. The goal of ''The Humans'' varies per level, but is usually to bring at least one of the player-controlled [[human]]s to the designated end area, marked by a red tile. To do this, the player must take advantage of the humans' ability to build a human ladder and use tools, such as [[spear]]s, [[torch]]es, [[wheel]]s, [[rope]]s, in later levels, a [[witch doctor]].

''The Humans'' was released for many different consoles, with the [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] and [[Lynx (console)|Lynx]] versions, published by [[Atari]], titled ''Evolution: Dino Dudes'' and ''Dinolympics'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Humans| publisher=MobyGames| accessdate=2011-05-14| url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/humans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two sequels have been released: ''The Humans 2: The Jurassic Levels'' for Amiga and PC, and ''The Humans III: Evolution—Lost in Time...'' for Amiga (AGA) and PC.&lt;ref name="ign gametek"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2011-05-14| title=Gametek| url=http://games.ign.com/objects/025/025030.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DY0evtWF?url=http://www.ign.com/companies/gametek| archivedate=2013-01-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was rereleased for [[Windows]] under the name ''The Humans: Meet the Ancestors!''&lt;ref name="humans 3"&gt;{{cite web| title=The Humans: Meet the Ancestors!| publisher=MobyGames| accessdate=2011-05-15| url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/humans-meet-the-ancestors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release, ''The Humans'' was received very well, praised for its originality and decent graphics and music.&lt;ref name="amiga mania"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Humans Screenshot.png|left|thumb|The user interface of ''The Humans'' consists of the play area on top and displays of the player's remaining time, choice of actions, and remaining tribe members at the bottom.]]

''The Humans'' is a puzzle game whose objective is to manipulate the given number of humans, taking advantage of abilities and tools, to achieve the level's goal, usually consisting of finding a certain tool, killing a certain number of dinosaurs, or bringing at least one human to the end point, marked by a conspicuous red tile. Each level is independent of the next, each with its own tools, goal, and set number of humans allowed per level. The only things that carry from level to level are the total number of humans in the player's tribe and the player's total score.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Humans Instruction Manual for Sega Genesis| year=1992| publisher=GameTek| pages=26| accessdate=2011-05-14| url=http://www.replacementdocs.com/request.php?7401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player controls one human at a time, and may switch between any human at any time. In order to complete a level, it is often necessary to use certain tools or abilities, such as stacking to reach a high ledge. For instance, the spear, a tool obtained in the first level of the game, may be thrown across gaps to other humans, used to jump chasms, thrown to kill dinosaurs or other enemies, or brandished to hold off dinosaurs temporarily. Certain levels also feature [[Non-player character|NPC]]'s, like the pterodactyl that can be ridden in order to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, that cannot be controlled, but can be used to the player's advantage. Several forms of enemy appear and can range from dinosaurs that eat a human if he is unarmed and within its walking range to spear-wielding members of enemy tribes.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

There can be up to eight controllable humans in a level, though some levels only allow as few as three. Though there is a preset number of humans allowed per level, there is no limit to how many humans are in the player's tribe. If a human dies, he is replaced by one from the tribe as long as there are humans there to replace him. During the course of the game, the player is given chances to rescue other humans and add them to his tribe. If there are fewer humans in the player's tribe than the minimum required number for any given level, the game will end in a [[game over]]. Each level, however, has a password that can be used to jump to that particular level from the beginning of the game.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==Development==
''The Humans'' is modeled after [[Psygnosis]]'s ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'' series of games in that it is a timed puzzle game that requires the player to make each individual perform different tasks to achieve one goal, but differs in that it gives direct control of individual humans to the player, rather than only allowing the player to simply assign tasks. GameTek released this game in 1992, shortly after ''Lemmings'' was released hoping to capitalize the popularity of this style of game. ''The Humans'' also derives its pre-game screen, featuring a code that may be used to reach that particular level, used by both ''Lemmings'' as well as ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]''.&lt;ref name="allgame"&gt;{{Allgame|15555|The Humans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known commercial ports of the original game include: [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], and [[Personal Computer|PC]].&lt;ref name="ign gametek"/&gt; The Genesis version differs slightly from the other versions of this game in that the levels are in a different order than in the Amiga and PC versions. In addition, the Genesis version requires the player to choose between hearing sound effects or a music track, unlike the PC and Amiga versions, which utilize both simultaneously.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Following the success of the original release, an expansion pack containing 80 additional levels was released in 1992 under the name ''Humans 2: The Jurassic Levels'' in the [[UK]] and ''The Humans: Insult to Injury'' in the [[United States]]. in 1993, the two games were combined and released for both Amiga and DOS under the name ''Humans 1 and 2''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Humans 1 and 2| publisher=MobyGames| accessdate=2011-05-15| url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/humans-1-and-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included English, French, German, Italian and Spanish versions. The DOS was distributed on a [[CD-ROM]] and was improved in several ways, including adding a [[Saved game|save game]] feature so the player could quit, then restart at a later time. In 1995, GameTek released ''The Humans 3: Evolution- Lost in Time'' for Amiga and DOS. The third installment keeps to the original game idea, but differs from the original in storyline, gameplay style, and level continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Humans 3: Evolution- Lost in Time| publisher=MobyGames| accessdate=2011-05-15| url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/humans-3-evolution-lost-in-time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About a decade after GameTek declared bankruptcy, ''The Humans'' was upgraded and rereleased by [[Koch Media#Deep Silver|Deep Silver]] for Windows under the name ''The Humans: Meet the Ancestors''.&lt;ref name="humans 3"/&gt; This version kept the same general gameplay style, but improved the graphics and added more interactive objects and enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Dinosaur Games: The Humans Meet the Ancestors- Windows PC| date=2011-03-26| accessdate=2011-05-15| publisher=Dinosaur Games| url=http://dinosaurgames.gamesw.org/2011/03/26/dinosaur-games-the-humans-meet-the-ancestors-windows-pc/| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324041112/http://dinosaurgames.gamesw.org/2011/03/26/dinosaur-games-the-humans-meet-the-ancestors-windows-pc/| archivedate=2012-03-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga and PC versions of ''The Humans'' received excellent reviews, while those of versions ported to other consoles were more lukewarm. Ashley Cotter-Cairn, of [[Amiga Mania]], gave the Amiga version an overall score of 93% and ranked it number 1 claiming "''The Humans'' has everything: great graphics, including a variety of backdrops, some neat sound...(she's) pleased to say that those long months at the keyboard were worth every second."&lt;ref name="amiga mania"/&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called the PC version of ''The Humans'' "delightful". While stating that the [[VGA graphics]]' limited color palette resembled those of a console game more than a computer's, it liked the [[video game soundtrack|soundtrack]] and documentation. The magazine concluded that while "not quite the calibre of ''Lemmings'' ... In all, much pleasure is to be had".&lt;ref name="miller199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=Gametek's The Humans | work=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1993 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | author=Miller, Chuck | pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the Genesis version, the four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the game's twist on the ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'' formula and the high level of challenge in the later levels. However, all but one of the reviewers complained that the game's slow pace is aggravating, especially since a single mistake can force the player to restart an entire level.&lt;ref name="EGM47"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: The Humans|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=47|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=June 1993|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also criticized the stiff controls and lack of multiplayer modes, but still rated it as one of the better Jaguar games to date due to the "brain-twisting" gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProvReview: Evolution:Dino Dudes|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=57|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1994|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tierra''' is a [[computer simulation]] developed by [[ecologist]] [[Thomas S. Ray]] in the early 1990s in which [[computer program]]s compete for time (central processing unit ([[Central processing unit|CPU]]) time) and space (access to [[main memory]]). In this context, the computer programs in Tierra are considered to be [[evolvability|evolvable]] and can [[mutation|mutate]], [[self-replication|self-replicate]] and [[Genetic recombination|recombine]]. Tierra's virtual machine is written in [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=What this Program is|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#What|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It operates on a custom instruction set designed to facilitate code changes and reordering, including features such as jump to template&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=Available instructions|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#Idt|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to the relative or absolute jumps common to most instruction sets).

== Simulations ==
The basic Tierra model has been used to experimentally explore ''[[in silico]]'' the basic processes of [[evolution]]ary and [[ecology|ecological]] dynamics. Processes such as the dynamics of [[punctuated equilibrium]], [[Host (biology)|host]]-[[parasite]] [[co-evolution]] and density-dependent [[natural selection]] are amenable to investigation within the Tierra framework. A notable difference between Tierra and more conventional models of [[evolutionary computation]], such as [[genetic algorithm]]s, is that there is no explicit, or [[exogenous]] [[fitness (biology)|fitness function]] built into the model. Often in such models there is the notion of a function being "optimized"; in the case of Tierra, the fitness function is endogenous: there is simply survival and death.

According to Thomas S. Ray and others, this may allow for more "open-ended" evolution, in which the dynamics of the feedback between evolutionary and ecological processes can itself change over time (see [[evolvability]]), although this claim has not been realized – like other digital evolution systems, it eventually reaches a point where novelty ceases to be created, and the system at large begins either looping or ceases to 'evolve'. The issue of how true [[open-ended evolution]] can be implemented in an artificial system is still an open question in the field of [[artificial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedau M.A., McCaskill J.S. et al., "Open problems in artificial life", ''Artificial Life'', 2000 Fall '''6'''(4):363-76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Bedau]] and [[Norman Packard]] developed a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, Bedau ''et al.'' applied these statistics to Evita, an [[Artificial life]] model similar to Tierra and [[Avida]], but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, and concluded that Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bedau, M.A., Snyder, E., Brown, C.T. and Packard, N.H. 1997, "A Comparison of Evolutionary Activity in Artificial Evolving Systems and in the Biosphere", in ''Fourth European Conference on Artificial Life'', Husbands and Harvey (eds), MIT press, p125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell K. Standish]] has measured the informational complexity of Tierran 'organisms', and has similarly not observed complexity growth in Tierran evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, R.K. 2003 "Open-ended artificial evolution", ''International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications 3(2)'', 167-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Tierra is an abstract model, but any quantitative model is still subject to the same validation and verification techniques applied to more traditional [[mathematical model]]s, and as such, has no special status. The creation of more detailed models in which more realistic dynamics of biological systems and organisms are incorporated is now an active research field (see [[systems biology]]).

'''Vitalism''' is the belief that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things".&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Williamson, Robert C. |year=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=E. Craig |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|reference_name_A|a}} Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the "vital spark", "energy" or "[[élan vital]]", which some equate with the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|discussed among biologists]], between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed [[Falsifiability|testable hypotheses]] meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by [[Scientific evidence|empirical evidence]], and hence regard it as a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]].&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Elizabeth Ann |title=A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvqYl4sdwaYC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-0881-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jidenu, Paulin (1996) ''African Philosophy, 2nd Ed.'' Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-21096-8}}, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek philosophy]], the [[Milesian school]] proposed natural explanations [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable ''[[clinamen]]'' of [[Epicurus]]), and in [[Stoic physics]], the ''[[pneuma]]'' assumed the role of ''[[logos]]''. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of pneuma, helping to shape later [[aether theories]].

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a ''vis essentialis'' (an organizing, formative force), stating "All believers in epigenesis are vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] (1788–1869) later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).&lt;ref name=Ede/&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater ''[[Hydra (zoology)|Hydra]]'' and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, "like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification". In the early 18th century, the physicians [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognized a "living principle" in addition to mechanics.&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] argued that only life could catalyse [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century fathers of modern [[chemistry]], argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.&lt;ref name=Ede&gt;Ede, Andrew. (2007) ''The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;filename=13463.pdf Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/cheng.html ''The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the Wöhler Myth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schummer, J. http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a [[soul]] makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

===20th century===

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.&lt;ref name="DevBio"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2015}}[http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031180529/http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="DevBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sebastian Normandin |author2=Charles T.

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Richard. "Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants)". https://www.academia.edu/6789277/Jungs_concept_of_die_Dominanten_the_Dominants_1997_&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168" /&gt; The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]].

Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

{{quote|We must find a different theoretical basis of biology, based on the observation that all the phenomena concerned tend towards being so coordinated that they express what is normal for an adult organism.|&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95" /&gt;}}

By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95"&gt;Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. ''The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science'', 2010, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergentism ==
{{main|Emergentism}}

Some aspects of contemporary science make reference to [[emergence|emergent processes]]; those in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schultz | first1=S.G. | title=A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal=The American Journal of Physiology | volume=274 | issue=1 Pt 1 | pages=C13–23 | year=1998 | pmid=9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Sarkar | first2=S. | title=Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal=Developmental Dynamics | volume=219 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | year=2000 | pmid=10974666 | doi=10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653–693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and cross-disciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.|&lt;ref name="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels.

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mesmerism ==
{{main|Animal magnetism}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Mesmer]] proposed the vitalist force of ''[[animal magnetism|magnétisme animal]]'' in animals with breath.]]

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''," for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus''="breath") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid," but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Best | first1=M. | last2=Neuhauser | first2=D. | last3=Slavin | first3=L. | title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped | url=http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 | journal=Quality &amp; safety in health care | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=232–3 | year=2003 | pmid=12792017 | pmc=1743715 | doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humours]]; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] or [[prana]]. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] concept of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Complementary and alternative medicine]] therapies include [[energy therapy|energy therapies]],&lt;ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.&lt;ref name="Rubik"&gt;Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214125248/https://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these therapies, the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a  practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt;

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Criticism ==
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|The 17th century French playwright [[Molière]] mocked vitalism in his 1673 play ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]''.]]

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its '''dormitive virtue''' (i.e., [[soporific]] power)."&lt;ref name="fr.wikisource.org"&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".&lt;ref name="The Physical Basis of Life"&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for [[organic chemistry]] and [[developmental biology]], but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, [[Jacques Loeb]] published ''The Mechanistic Conception of Life'', in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as [[Bertrand Russell]] put it (''Religion and Science''). He offered this challenge:

: "... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible." (pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6)

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

: "It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical "life principle" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this "principle" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well-known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the "aquosity" be also taken into consideration." (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15)

Bechtel states that vitalism "is often viewed as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; For many scientists, "vitalist" theories were unsatisfactory "holding positions" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]], stated "And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only [[Crank (person)|cranks]] will believe tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;Crick, Francis (1967) ''Of Molecules and Men''; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/reviews/crickandkurtz.htm here]. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m821384707h6h254/fulltext.pdf Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism.] ''Synthese'' 20:238–253, who describes Crick's remark as "raising spectral red herrings".&lt;/ref&gt;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. [[Alan Sokal]] published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of "scientific theories" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?).&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a technique called [[therapeutic touch]] was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, "nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism" and added that "Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time."&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525203939/http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses vitalism's past and present roles in [[chiropractic]] and calls vitalism "a form of [[bio-theology]]." He further explains that:

: "Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate"&gt;{{citation |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Keating, Joseph C.  |volume=46 |issue=1 |pmc=2505097 |journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |year=2002 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

: "Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint:

: "Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]], for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

According to Williams,&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, W. (2000) ''The [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]. From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File. Conway, D. and L. Dalton, R. Dolby, R. Duval, H. Farrell, J. Frazier, J. McMillan, J. Melton, T. O'Niell, R. Shepherd, S. Utley, W. Williams. {{ISBN|0-8160-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force." "Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality."

[[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html Victor J. Stenger's site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202347/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the term "bioenergetics" "is applied in biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable [[Biological thermodynamics|exchanges of energy]] within organisms, and between organisms and the environment, which occur by normal physical and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the [[Energy (esotericism)|bioenergetic]] field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=The Physics of 'Alternative Medicine': Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url=http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger |access-date=2006-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218144228/http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |archive-date=2006-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt; Joanne Stefanatos states that "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics."&lt;ref name="Stefanatos"&gt;Stefanatos, J. 1997, ''Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine'', Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, ''Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices'', Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt; offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called "human energy fields".&lt;ref name="Biley"&gt;Biley, Francis C. 2005, ''Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings'', University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024515/http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt;

Vitalistic thinking has also been identified in the naive biological theories of children: "Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.06.004 | last1=Inagaki | first1=K. | last2=Hatano | first2=G. | year=2004 | title='Vitalistic causality in young children's naive biology.' | url=| journal=Trends Cogn Sci | volume=8 | issue=8| pages=356–62 | pmid=15335462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vyacheslav Valeryevich Solovyov '''(born March 12, 1970 in [[Yaroslavl]], [[RSFSR]] - December 2, 2008 in Yaroslavl, [[Russia]]), known as the "'''Yaroslavl Poisoner'''", was a [[Russia]]n [[serial killer]] and poisoner. He poisoned six people, including his wife and daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfA0GriqqMs|title=Криминальные хроники - Отравитель|author=Криминальная Россия|date=2013-06-24|accessdate=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparing for the murders ==
Between 2001 and 2002, the Yaroslavl resident became seriously interested in the effect of poisons on humans. "I was interested that you can kill a man and leave no traces", Solovyov later said during the investigation.&lt;ref name="kp"&gt;[http://kp.ru/daily/24079.3/314099/ Маньяк-отравитель свёл в могилу двух жён, дочь и следователя милиции] // [//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B0 Комсомольская правда]&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators believed that he could drew interest from the film "''[[The Young Poisoner's Handbook]]''", based on the biography of poisoner [[Graham Young]], then proceeded to search for the poison - he studied special literature, searched for information on the Internet, tried to synthesize the poison from the originating plant, but did not succeed. Subsequently, according to the prosecutor's office, he bought at one of the regional enterprises a number of toxic metal salts, including 400 grams of [[thallium sulfate]], which would later be used for the murders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/34760.html Вынесен приговор жителю Ярославской области, отравившему 6 человек] // [//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0 Новая газета]&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation could not establish from where Solovyov bought the poison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.newsru.ua/crime/03dec2008/manyakk.html Ярославский маньяк-отравитель стал жертвой собственных экспериментов с ядами] // newsru.ua&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thallium poisoning]] is difficult to recognize, because symptomps are very similar to diseases. Solovyov also probably chose thallium due to a lasting impression from reading [[Agatha Christie]]'s "''[[The Pale Horse]]''", in which the killer uses thallium, stressing on the fact that the substance is hard to trace.

== Murders ==
Solovyov chose his wife Olga as his first victim, with whom he had been since school and had lived together for 14 years. For a while, he threw small amounts of poison into her food, which caused her to die on December 9, 2003. The doctors could not establish that it was poisoning.

The next victim was to be Solovyov's neighbor, whom he suspected of stealing a car battery, but as a result of a tragic combination of circumstances, Solovyov's 14-year-old daughter Nastya ate a poisond red [[caviar]] from the can. Despite being seriously ill, she still decided to attend school. After six months of failed attempts to cure the girl, she died. Of course, Solovyov did not tell the doctors that he had poisoned her.

The next victim was Solovyov's common-law wife Irina Astakhova, who died in hospital on May 3, 2005. The doctors found irreversible [[lesions]] on the liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="mk"&gt;[http://www.mk.ru/95496.html Травить — и никаких семей!] // [//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%86 Московский комсомолец]&lt;/ref&gt;

Solovyov, in a peculiar way, "experimented" with poisons, pouring them in small doses to a number of colleagues at work, who suddenly began to have health problems - aches in joints, hair loss, vomiting and [[diarrhea]].

In the fall of 2006, Solovyov moved to live with Oksana Gurieva, who worked as an acrobatics trainer and had two little daughters. Soon he used the poison - while visiting Oksana's grandmother, he poured thallium into the decanter. The very healthy Oksana safely tolerated the poisoning, finding it to be a serious complication of the [[flu]], but her grandmother Taisiya Iosifovna soon died.

The next poisoning was particularly insolent - Solovyov poured poison into the investigator Shcherbakov's coffee directly at the interrogation in the case in which Solovyov took part. And again, doctors did not establish the poisoning.

Solovyov then tried to poison his sister Oksana and her family - he poured poison into the jar, in which they destilled drinking water. Oksana and her husband survived in the hospital, but their 1-year-old child passed away. In this case, the appearance of the same symptomps in the whole family interested law enforcement. The examination found that there was poisoning with salts from heavy metals, and the investigation led to Solovyov, around whom people perished too often for suspicious reasons. In March 2007, he was arrested.

== Trial and death ==
After the first meeting, the defendant attempted suicide by cutting open his veins. After a break, the hearing resumed, and the examination found that Solovyov is imputed. The court found him guilty of 6 murders committed with special cruelty, and many attempted ones. Before the announcement of the verdict Solovyov expressed remorse for his crimes, and said that he would not ask for forgiveness from the victims' families, as he knew he would get none. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kp.ru/daily/24108/333312 Ярославский инженер-отравитель попросил не давать ему пожизненного заключения] // [//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B0 Комсомольская правда]&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of December 2, Solovyov died in the cell of the pre-trial detention center, with the [[Forensic science|forensic medical examination]] finding that the cause of death was [[phlegmon]] - purulent inflammation of the subcutaneous tissues. Experts expressed the opinion that Solovyov's health was weakened thoroughly by experimenting with poisons, many of which he tested on himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ru/daily/24209/413053/ Инженер, отравившей шесть человек, умер во сне] // [//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B0 Комсомольская правда]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wheatland hop riot''' was a violent confrontation during a [[strike action|strike]] of [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[working class|workers]] demanding decent working conditions at the Durst Ranch in [[Wheatland, California]], on August 3, 1913. The [[riot]], which resulted in four deaths and numerous injuries, was subsequently blamed by local authorities, who were controlled by management, upon the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW). The Wheatland hop riot was among the first major farm labor confrontations in California and a harbinger of further such battles in the United States throughout the 20th century.

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Hopfendolde-mit-hopfengarten.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hops plants produce a resinous flower cone which is used as a flavoring agent in [[beer]].]]

[[Ralph H. Durst]] (March 28, 1865 – May 4, 1938) was a leading grower of [[hops]] in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of [[California]]. The Durst Ranch, located on 640 acres ({{convert|1|sqmi}}) outside the town of [[Wheatland, California|Wheatland]] in [[Yuba County, California]], was the largest single employer of agricultural labor in the state, requiring each summer the hiring of hundreds of seasonal workers to help bring in the harvest.&lt;ref name=Wrath&gt;* David A. Kulczyk, [http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/hops-of-wrath/content?oid=455416 "Hops of Wrath: 1913's Bloody Wheatland Hop Riot Eventually Led to Better Conditions for Workers. Too Bad it was Only Temporary"], ''Sacramento News-Review'', August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The farm also dried and packaged the picked hops on site, before transporting them by train to [[San Francisco]] for export to England.&lt;ref name=Wrath /&gt;

In the summer of 1913 Durst advertised for temporary harvest workers as he had always done, promising ample work at high rates of pay.&lt;ref name=Dubofsky294&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World.'' First paperback edition. New York: Quadrangle Books, 1969; pg. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; In one flier soliciting laborers, the Durst Ranch promised a job to every [[white people|white]] hops picker who arrived on his farm by August 5.&lt;ref name=Hall48&gt;Greg Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies: The Industrial Workers of the World and Agricultural Laborers in the American West, 1905–1930.'' Corvallis, OR: Oregon State University Press, 2001; pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this year, however, the number of willing workers far outstripped demand, with some 2800 men, women, and children flocking to the Durst Ranch to work as pickers in the fields.&lt;ref name=Dubofsky294 /&gt; Jobs actually existed for only about 1500 workers daily, and pay rates were consequently slashed.&lt;ref&gt;Cletus E. Daniel, ''Bitter Harvest: A History of California Farmworkers, 1870–1941.'' Paperback edition. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1982; pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the lack of employment for many of those arriving at the Durst Ranch, living conditions for the temporary field hands were particularly abysmal.&lt;ref name=Dubofsky294 /&gt; Workers lived in tents in the hot summer sun on a barren hillside, paying Durst 75 cents per week for the privilege as a rental fee.&lt;ref name=Hall48 /&gt; More workers were on hand than could be accommodated in these tents, however, forcing some to make do in the elements under crude structures constructed from poles and [[burlap]] sacks.&lt;ref name=Hall48 /&gt;

Toilet facilities were grossly insufficient for such a large workforce. They were often extremely filthy, overflowing with human waste and covered with flies.&lt;ref name=Dubofsky294 /&gt; Drinking water was a mile from the fields and Durst refused to supply any to the pickers under his employ, instead allowing his cousin to operate a commercial [[lemonade]] wagon.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All'', pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lemonade was an inferior synthetic brew, sold for five cents a glass.&lt;ref name=Boys&gt;"The Wheatland Boys", ''International Socialist Review'', vol. 14, no. 7 (January 1914), pp. 442–443.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wages were to be paid based on the weight of hops picked, with pickers promised a pay rate of $1 per 100 pounds harvested.&lt;ref name=Hall49&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pg. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This rate was deceptive in that the picked hops were heavily cleaned before final weighing, with no pickers allowed to be present to verify the work of the cleaning crew.&lt;ref name=Hall49 /&gt; Workers generally received less than $1.50 per day for twelve hours of toil under a summer sun that could reach {{convert|110|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers on other farms in the area typically netted twice as much.&lt;ref name=Hall50&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further stoking worker unrest, Durst maintained a policy of retaining 10% of the daily wage owed each worker until the end of harvest, to be received only by those who remained at the Durst Ranch to the end.&lt;ref name=Dubofsky294 /&gt; Workers would in this way be obligated to stay at the farm to the end of harvest or face forfeiture of a substantial portion of their earnings.&lt;ref name=Hall49 /&gt;

===Strike===
[[File:Ford-Richard-Blackie-1914.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Richard "Blackie" Ford, spokesman for striking field workers at the time of the Wheatland hop riot]]

Harvest of hops began on the Durst Ranch on July 29, 1913.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt; Discontent over pay and conditions immediately erupted among the migrant workers as the actual terms of their employment and living conditions became clear.

On Friday, August 1, 1913, a group of about thirty field workers loosely affiliated with the radical [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (members of which were known as "Wobblies") established themselves as a temporary local of that organization and began to agitate among their peers to take action about the dire conditions which they faced.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt; A former Wobbly, Richard "Blackie" Ford, was chosen to be the spokesman for the field workers' demands, which included a pay rate of $1.25 per 100 picked pounds, a new system in which workers cleaned their own picked hops, drinking water to be provided in the fields, improvement of toilet facilities and separate bathrooms for women, and the hiring of assistants to help women and children with the loading of heavy hop sacks into wagons.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt;

Durst responded that he would henceforth improve toilet facilities, provide water in the fields, and allow one worker to witness the cleaning process.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt; A strike was threatened by Ford if the other demands were not met, to which Durst responded by immediately terminating Ford and the others on the strike committee who accompanied him.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt; Ford and the strike committee refused to collect their pay and exit the ranch, prompting Durst to call Deputy Sheriff Henry Daken and ask him to arrest the strike leader.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt; No arrests were made owing to the lack of an arrest warrant.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt;

The tense situation began to boil over. A mass meeting was called, which was addressed by Ford and Herman Suhr, an IWW member who was acting as secretary of the temporary Durst Farm local.&lt;ref name=Hall50 /&gt; Other speakers addressed the crowd in the German, Greek, Italian, Arabic, and Spanish languages.&lt;ref name=Hall51&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; A show of hands indicated that a large majority of pickers at the meeting were in favor of a strike.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; The crowd remained peaceful and sang Wobbly songs through the afternoon.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt;

Additional small meetings were held among the pickers on Saturday, August 2.&lt;ref name=Dubofsky295&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All'', pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events of August 3, 1913===

With a major strike of hop pickers in the offing, Ralph Durst headed to town to round up local authorities to put down the revolt. He gathered Yuba County District Attorney Edward Manwell (who was also his own lawyer), [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] Sheriff George Voss, and a number of deputies.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; The sheriff and his men approached the speakers' platform to arrest Ford, who was addressing the assembly.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; Workers began to intervene on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; Greatly outnumbered, one of the law enforcement officials fired a shotgun into the air in an effort to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; The shot provoked the opposite effect intended and many members of the crowd jumped on District Attorney Manwell and Deputy Sheriff Lee Anderson and began beating them.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt;

Gunfire erupted and a full-fledged riot ensued.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; In the aftermath the 45-year-old Manwell, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Reardon, a Puerto Rican hop picker, and an English hop picker lay dead.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; One picker lost an arm to a shotgun blast.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt;

Eyewitness accounts of the incident were contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;One local newspaper, the ''Marysville Appeal'', noted that while a large number of people had witnessed the shooting, "their stories varied considerably." Quoted in Philip S. Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 4: The Industrial Workers of the World, 1905–1917.'' New York: International Publishers, 19654; pg. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; In the best estimation of historian Greg Hall:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The crowd...was unarmed. By most accounts, the deaths of Manwell and Reardon resulted from Reardon and perhaps another member of the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] having their guns taken away and used against them.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another historian of the Wheatland events indicates that the district attorney and the deputy were killed by the Puerto Rican worker, who had successfully disarmed a lawman and used his firearm against them, only to be killed himself by a member of the posse.&lt;ref name=Daniel90&gt;Daniel, ''Bitter Harvest'', pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The English picker who was killed is said to have been an innocent bystander in this alternative account.&lt;ref name=Daniel90 /&gt;

In the aftermath of the violence many hop workers immediately vacated the Durst Ranch, scattering in every direction.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; Meanwhile, Wheatland and Marysville authorities immediately contacted Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] requesting rapid dispatch of units of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to maintain order.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; Local law enforcement authorities themselves rushed into action, making about 100 arrests of seasonal agricultural workers.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt;

Those arrested were subjected to starvation and physical beating in an effort to gain testimony to be used against strike leaders.&lt;ref name=Hall52&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; One such prisoner, a field worker named Alfred Nelson, was hauled from county to county where he was held incommunicado, sweated, starved, beaten, and repeatedly threatened with death unless he confessed to participation in the killings.&lt;ref name=Foner4-266&gt;Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4'', pg. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Martinez, California|Martinez]], Nelson was taken from jail to a room in a hotel where he was beaten by a sheriff and a private detective with pistol butts and a rubber hose and threatened with summary execution.&lt;ref name=Foner4-266 /&gt; Nelson refused to confess and was eventually returned to jail. The treatment of Nelson shocked Martinez District Attorney A.B. McKenzie, who declared Nelson's treatment to have been "one of the biggest outrages that has ever been perpetuated in this state."&lt;ref name=Foner4-266 /&gt; The Swedish [[Consulate#Consulates and embassies|consulate]] in San Francisco lodged a formal protest on behalf of Nelson, a Swedish national.&lt;ref name=Foner4-266 /&gt;

A [[inquest|coroner's inquest]] was conducted which concluded that the IWW strike leadership had caused the riot which led to the death of District Attorney Manwell.&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; Arrest warrants were hastily issued for Ford and Suhr on charges of [[murder]].&lt;ref name=Hall51 /&gt; The pair were soon detained, as were their fellow workers Walter Bagan and William Beck, all of whom were held over for trial.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; The psychological pressure was so severe that Nels Nelson, the picker who lost his arm to a gunshot wound, hanged himself to death in his cell.&lt;ref name=Boys /&gt; Another prisoner unsuccessfully attempted to do the same.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; A third prisoner suffered a [[mental breakdown|breakdown]] and had to be committed to a [[mental hospital]].&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt;

===Trial===
[[File:Suhr-Herman-D-1914.jpg|thumb|right|220 px|Herman D. Suhr, secretary of the Durst Farm local of the Industrial Workers of the World and a leader of the ill-fated August 1913 strike.]]

The defense of the IWW defendants was conducted by [[socialism|Socialist]] attorney [[Austin Lewis (attorney)|Austin Lewis]], a friend of the organization.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; Two [[legal defense organization]]s were established to raise funds for the trial — the Wheatland Hop Picker's Defense League, launched by the IWW itself, and the International Workers' Defense League, which was a coalition effort.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; By the middle of February 1914 the groups had raised a combined $5,575 to aid the defense effort.&lt;ref name=Foner4-267&gt;Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4'', pg. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers around the state tarred the IWW defendants as fanatics committed to violence and local sentiment was overwhelmingly hostile.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; One local newspaper, the ''Marysville Democrat'', denounced the Wobblies as "venomous human snakes" who "always urged armed resistance to constituted authority" and were thus "more dangerous and deadly than the wild animals of the jungles.''&lt;ref&gt;''Marysville Democrat'', August 4, 1913. Quoted in Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4'', pg. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial opened in neighboring Marysville. Attorney Lewis attempted to obtain a [[change of venue]] so that the defendants might be tried in a more neutral setting than the superheated environment of Yuba County.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; In addition to pervasive bias against the IWW in the local community, Lewis noted that the judge in the case, E.P. McDaniel, was a personal friend of the dead district attorney.&lt;ref name=Foner4-267 /&gt; The request for the change of venue was denied and Governor Johnson likewise declined to appoint a new judge in the case.&lt;ref name=Foner4-267 /&gt;

Eight of the twelve members of the jury for the trial of the agricultural strike organizers were farmers.&lt;ref name=Hall52 /&gt; Testimony for the prosecution emphasized the fact that Ford and Suhr were "agitators."&lt;ref name=Foner4-270&gt;Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4'', pg. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; No witness indicated that they had seen Ford with a gun; rather the case was made that by mobilizing the hop pickers the IWW organizer had "filled the magazines of wrath."&lt;ref name=Foner4-270 /&gt; Suhr's so-called "confession" was not introduced into evidence, indicative that it had been obtained through the use of illegal force, but three deputies were put on the stand to testify that Suhr had told them he had taken a gun from an old man while fleeing the scene and fired twice.&lt;ref name=Foner4-270 /&gt; This accusation was denied by Suhr.&lt;ref name=Foner4-270 /&gt; No eyewitness evidence was produced to indicate that Suhr had actually fired the fatal shots.&lt;ref name=Foner4-270 /&gt;

Defense witnesses indicated that the shots which killed the law enforcement officials were fired by the dead Puerto Rican picker from Deputy Reardon's gun, which had been seized in the scuffle.&lt;ref name=Foner4-270 /&gt; Attorney Lewis emphasized in his closing that

&lt;blockquote&gt;None of the defendants took part in the shooting. None was seen with a gun in his hands. None advised or abetted violence. Nothing in the evidence points to a conspiracy — much less proves it.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4'', pg. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Lewis's best efforts, the result of the trial was never really in doubt. On January 13, 1914 Blackie Ford and Herman Suhr, the recognized leaders of the strike which had degenerated into a fatal riot, were found guilty of [[second-degree murder]] after one day of [[jury deliberations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Both received life sentences in the state penitentiary.&lt;ref name=Hall53&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Bagan and William Beck, owing to their lesser role in the strike and no evidence tying them to the violence which resulted, were acquitted.&lt;ref name=Hall53 /&gt;

Despite the convictions of Ford and Suhr, the stature of the IWW grew among the migrant workers of California following the Wheatland Hop Riot and that organization emerged as a primary representative of farm workers in the state.&lt;ref name=Hall53 /&gt; The number of Wobblies in California rose to 5,000 by the end of 1914, with forty locals of the organization dotting the state.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Harvest Wobblies'', pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wheatland hop riot of 1913 focused public opinion for the first time on the plight of California's [[agricultural]] laborers. California's progressive [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] Governor Hiram Johnson empowered a new Commission on Immigration and Housing to investigate the underlying causes behind the Wheatland Riot, which resulted in new legislation providing for the state inspection of labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, ''Bitter Harvest'', pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The California State investigation attracted federal attention and in August 1914 the [[US Commission on Industrial Relations]] conducted hearings on the Wheatland Hop Riot in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Foner4-271&gt;Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 4'', pg. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Testimony gathered further exposed the conditions faced by California agricultural workers in general and those on the Durst Ranch in particular, as well as the systemic violence practiced by private detectives working in cooperation with Yuba County law enforcement authorities.&lt;ref name=Foner4-271 /&gt;

Appeals to the [[California Supreme Court]] on their behalf were unsuccessful and the two convicted leaders of the Wheatland strike remained behind bars for over a decade.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;Ryan McCarthy, [http://www.appeal-democrat.com/articles/platform-98837-district-aftermath.html "Hop Riots' Aftermath Echoes in Wheatland, 97 Years Later"], ''Marysville Appeal-Democrat'', September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackie Ford was eventually paroled in 1924 only to be immediately re-arrested and charged for murder by the Yuba City District Attorney, this time for the death of sheriff's deputy Reardon.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; A trial was held, after which the jury deliberated for 77 hours before returning a verdict of acquittal.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; Herman Suhr was pardoned not long after.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;

Today, the site of the Wheatland hop riot is registered as [[California Historical Landmark]] #1003.&lt;ref name=CHL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21537 | title=California Historical Landmark: Yuba County | publisher=California State Parks | work=Office of Historic Preservation | accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
