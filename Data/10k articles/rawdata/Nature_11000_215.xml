'''{{mp|2010 AB|78}}''' is a dark [[asteroid]] on an eccentric orbit, classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]]. It was first observed by the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) on 12 January 2010.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The asteroid measures approximately 1.7 kilometers in diameter and has a low [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.03, which is rather typical for carbonaceous asteroids.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== First ''WISE'' discovery ==

{{mp|2010 AB|78}} is expected to become the first of the many thousands of discoveries to be accredited to the WISE [[space observatory]].&lt;ref name="PLANETARY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPACED" /&gt; However, the official discoverer will only be defined upon the asteroid's numbering.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

The first observation of {{mp|2010 AB|78}} by WISE was on January 12, 2010, being observed again the next day. The [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] observed it the days 18 and 19 of January, allowing the [[Minor Planet Center]] to publish a circular on January 22 confirming the discovery.&lt;ref name="PLANETARY" /&gt;

== Orbit ==

{{mp|2010 AB|78}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–3.5&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 5 months (1,236 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.55 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 33[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; Due to its eccentric orbit it is also a [[Mars-crosser]]. {{mp|2010 AB|78}} has the lowest possible [[Uncertainty parameter|orbital uncertainty]], which suggests that it will be numbered in the near future.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

This near-Earth asteroid has an [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert |0.2058 |AU |km |abbr=on |sigfig=3}}, which corresponds to 80.2 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It does not make any notable close approaches to Earth within the next hundred years.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

According to the survey carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's discovering WISE observatory, {{mp|2010 AB|78}} measures 1.671 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.030.&lt;ref name="Mainzer-2011" /&gt; Objects known for such low albedos are the carbonaceous [[C-type asteroid|C]], [[D-type asteroid|D]] and [[P-type asteroid]]s.

As of 2018, no [[lightcurve]] has been obtained. The body's [[rotation period]], shape and [[Poles of astronomical bodies|pole]] remain unknown.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Numbering and naming ===

As of 2018, this [[minor planet]] has not been named or numbered.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

For OEA, energy assurance represents a vast array of activities across three categories - preparation and planning; mitigation and response; and education and outreach - focused on the goal of energy resiliency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Energy/OEA|title=Office of Energy Assurance|website=Safie.hq.af.mil|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; OEA uses a holistic, enterprise-level approach across all Air Force installations with a focus on optimizing cost and providing resilient and cleaner sources of energy to assure the mission. 
{{buzzword|date=June 2018}}
OEA's mission is to deliver creative installation energy resiliency solutions to meet 21st century threats. Its vision is to be the recognized leader for implementing innovative energy assurance solutions that provide the Air Force with mission-ready installations. 

OEA works with installations to determine energy requirements critical to the mission and provides practical tools and support to develop projects to meet those needs. OEA develops energy assurance projects on or near installations by collaborating with community stakeholders to identify shared interests, such as costs, risks and goals, and to develop mutually beneficial solutions. OEA leverages the expertise, resources and capabilities of private industry to design and execute creative solutions to energy challenges. The office [http://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Energy/OEA/WorkWithOEA seeks innovative solutions] for energy assurance projects, including but not limited to alternative generation methods, smart controls, increased cyber security, infrastructure upgrades and storage.

[[Image:Worshipper Larsa Louvre AO15704.jpg|180px|thumb|left|"The Worshipper of Larsa", a votive statuette dedicated to the god Amurru for [[Hammurabi]]'s life, early [[2nd millennium BC]], [[Louvre]]]]

'''Amurru''' and '''Martu''' are names given in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] texts to the god of the [[Amorite]]/Amurru people, often forming part of personal names. He is sometimes called ''[[DINGIR|Ilu]] Amurru'' (&lt;sup&gt;[[Dingir|D]]&lt;/sup&gt;MAR.TU). He was the patron god of the Mesopotamian city of [[Ninab]], whose exact location is unknown.

==Description==
Amurru/Martu was probably a western [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic]] god originally. He is sometimes described as a 'shepherd' or as a storm god, and as a son of the sky-god [[An (god)|Anu]]. He is sometimes called ''bêlu šadī'' or ''bêl šadê'', 'lord of the mountain'; dúr-hur-sag-gá sikil-a-ke, 'He who dwells on the pure mountain'; and kur-za-gan ti-[la], 'who inhabits the shining mountain'. In [[Cappadocia]]n Zinčirli inscriptions he is called ''ì-li a-bi-a'', 'the god of my [[ab (father)|father]]'.&lt;ref name=The-Targum-from-the-Beginnings&gt;The Targum from the Beginnings: "[http://www.dalamatiacity.com/urantia-clues.htm Tablet 1]." Retrieved on September 12, 2010 {{Unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, it has been suggested by L. R. Bailey (1968) and Jean Ouelette (1969), that this ''Bêl Šadê'' might be the same as the Biblical ''[[El Shaddai|’Ēl Šaddāi]]'' who is the [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] in the "[[Priestly source]]" of narrative, according to the [[documentary hypothesis]]. ''Bêl Šadê'' could also have become the fertility-god '[[Ba'al]]', possibly adopted by the [[Canaan]]ites, a rival and enemy of the Hebrew God [[YHWH]], and famously combatted by the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[prophet]] [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]].

Amurru also has storm-god features. Like [[Adad]], Amurru bears the epithet ''ramān'' 'thunderer', and he is even called ''bāriqu'' 'hurler of the thunderbolt' and ''Adad ša a-bu-be'' 'Adad of the deluge'. Yet his iconography is distinct from that of Adad, and he sometimes appears alongside Adad with a baton of power or throwstick, while Adad bears a conventional thunderbolt.

==Wife==
'''Amurru's''' wife is usually the goddess Ašratum (see '''[[Asherah]]''') who in northwest Semitic tradition and Hittite tradition appears as wife of the god '''[[El (deity)|Ēl]]''' which suggests that Amurru may indeed have been a variation of that god. If Amurru was identical with Ēl, it would explain why so few Amorite names are compounded with the name ''Amurru'', but so many are compounded with ''Il''; that is, with Ēl.

Another tradition about Amurru's wife (or one of Amurru's wives) gives her name as [[Belit-Sheri]], 'Lady of the Desert'.

A third tradition appears in a Sumerian poem in pastoral style, which relates how the god Martu came to marry Adg̃ar-kidug the daughter of the god Numushda of the city of Inab. It contains a speech expressing urbanite Sumerian disgust at uncivilized, nomadic Amurru life which Adg̃ar-kidug ignores, responding only: "I will marry Martu!".

'''Beberibe Cliffs Natural Monument''' ({{lang-pt|Monumento Natural das Falésias de Beberibe}} is a [[Natural monument (Brazil)|natural monument]] in the state of [[Ceará]], Brazil.

==Foundation==

The Beberibe Cliffs Natural Monument was instituted on 3 June 2004 by Ceará governor [[Lúcio Alcântara]].
At the same ceremony he signed the decree creating the Mata Fresca Private Ecological Reserve.
The natural monument, of major environmental and tourist interest, is visited by about 400 people per day.
The decree turned it into a fully protected area so that only eco-tourism and research would be allowed, and that only with permission from the responsible agency.
Local youth were to be employed as guides, and explanatory signs installed.{{sfn|Clícia Weyne|2004}}

==Location==

The natural monument is in the municipality of [[Beberibe]] on the east coast of the state of Ceará, between the Morro Branco and Fontes beaches.
It has an area of {{convert|31.2|ha}} and a perimeter of {{convert|5709|m}}.
The objective of the reserve is to protect the cliffs against the environmental impacts that had occurred earlier.
Other cliffs in the region are unprotected and are occupied by hotels and vacation houses.{{sfn|Oliveira Silva|Silva|2012|p=130}}

==Cliffs==

The cliffs in the area run along the coast for about {{convert|6|km}} where the Barreiras tableland reaches the coast.
They are formed of sand-clay sediments from the [[Tertiary]] or [[Quaternary]] ages, with fine to medium grains, and with colors ranging from white to yellow to red.
They are evolving as the sea acts on their bases and wind and rain erodes their upper parts.{{sfn|Oliveira Silva|Silva|2012|p=134}}
They are cut by gullies formed by the main streams that flow down to the sea.{{sfn|Oliveira Silva|Silva|2012|p=135}}
One famous structure is the Gruta da Mãe D’água (Cave of the Water Mother) on the Fontes beach, outside the protected area.
This has been created by wave action on the cliffs, and is much visited by people.
It has been degraded by the visitors, and is at risk of collapse.{{sfn|Oliveira Silva|Silva|2012|p=135}}

Implementation of the protected area does not appear to have had a significant effect in slowing down degradation of the cliffs.
It has therefore been proposed to implement a buffer zone, or to implement a larger [[Environmental Protection Area (Brazil)|Environmental Protection Area]] around the cliffs including the Morro Branco and Fontes beaches so as to better manage the site.{{sfn|Oliveira Silva|2008|p=9}}

'''Big Oak Tree State Park''' is a state-owned nature preserve with recreational features encompassing {{convert|1029|acre}} in [[East Prairie, Missouri]], [[United States]]. The [[state park]] was established in a large expanse of drained cropland in 1938 to protect some of the largest trees in the state and in the nation.&lt;ref name=parks/&gt; The park was declared a [[National Natural Landmark]] in May 1986, recognized as a rare, untouched [[wet-mesic]] [[bottomland hardwood forest]] in the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] portion of the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]].&lt;ref name="nnl"/&gt;

==List of champion trees==
Big Oak Tree State Park is the home of many current and past state and national champion trees—trees that are, for their species, the largest in the state or in the nation.

'''Boso Triple Junction''' (also known as '''Off-Boso Triple Junction''') is a [[triple junction]] off the coast of Japan; it is the only known example of a [[Oceanic trench|trench]]-trench-trench triple junction on the Earth. It is the meeting point of the [[North American Plate]] (represented by the [[Okhotsk Plate]]) to the north, the [[Pacific Plate]] to the east and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] to the south.&lt;ref name="RenardEtAl1987"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/people/seno/Papers/epsl1987.renard.pdf | title=Trench triple junction off Central Japan—preliminary results of French-Japanese 1984 Kaiko cruise,  Leg 2 | author=Renard, V. et al. | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | year=1987 | volume=83 | pages=243–256 | doi=10.1016/0012-821x(87)90069-0 | bibcode=1987E&amp;PSL..83..243R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name origin ==
The Boso Triple Junction is named after the [[Boso peninsula]].

== Formation ==
It is formed from the junction of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc]] where the [[Izu-Bonin Trench]] meets with the [[Japan Trench]] and the [[Sagami Trough|Sagami Trench]].

== Risks ==
Located some {{convert|300|km}} from the Boso triple junction, [[Tokyo]] is subject to quakes and tsunamis generated from slips along this junction. Furthermore, there is a large populated region along the coast of the main island that would also be subject to damage. This junction probably has the highest associated insurance risk in the world, due to its proximity to extensive urban development.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] were generated along the Japan trench well to the north of the junction and did not involve the other two trenches, although quakes that may have been aftershocks have been observed there{{clarify|date=February 2017}}&lt;!--Where is "there"?--&gt;.

'''Centro de Estudios Científicos''' ('''CECs'''; Center for Scientific Studies) is a [[Privately-held company|private]], [[non-profit]] [[corporation]] based in [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], [[Chile]], devoted to the development, promotion and diffusion of [[scientific research]]. CECs research areas include [[biophysics]], [[molecular physiology]], [[theoretical physics]], [[glaciology]] and [[climate change]]. The centre was created in 1984 as Centro de Estudios Científicos de Santiago, with a grant of 150,000 dollars a year (for three years) from the [[Tinker Foundation]] of [[New York City]]. In 2004-2005 glaciologists from CECs organized the [[Chilean South Pole Expedition]] in collaboration with the [[Chilean Navy]] and [[Instituto Antártico Chileno]]. CECs was founded in Santiago but is since 2000 housed in the recently modernized, German-style Hotel Schuster located by [[Valdivia River]]. [[Claudio Bunster]], a physicist and winner of Chile's [[National Prize for Exact Sciences (Chile)|National Prize for Exact Sciences]], is the director of CECs.

In 2014 CECs discovered what would be a [[subglacial lake]] in the [[West Antarctica]], They investigated and concluded after a year that it is a lake, which was named [[Lake CECs]] in honor of the institution. The conclusion was published in ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' on May 22, 2015. 
The authors of the discovery are Andrés Rivera, Jose Uribe, Rodrigo Zamora and Jonathan Oberreuter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CECs Article|url=http://www.CECs.cl/website/index.php/en/menu-noticias/1092-cientificos-del-CECs-descubren-nuevo-lago-subglacial-en-la-antartica-occidental}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earth's magnetic field''', also known as the '''geomagnetic field''', is the [[magnetic field]] that extends from the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]] out into space, where it meets the [[solar wind]], a stream of [[charged particle]]s emanating from the [[Sun]]. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|microteslas]] (0.25 to 0.65&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]).&lt;ref name="GeomagneticReferenceField"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finlay|first1=C.

The [[North geomagnetic pole]], located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. The magnetic field is generated by [[electric current]]s due to the motion of [[convection current]]s of molten iron in the Earth's [[outer core]] driven by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a [[Dynamo theory|geodynamo]].

While the North and South [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]] are usually located near the geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary [[compass]]es to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, [[Geomagnetic reversal|the Earth's field reverses]] and the North and [[South Magnetic Pole]]s relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the [[geomagnetic pole]]s leave a record in rocks that are of value to [[Paleomagnetism|paleomagnetists]] in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of [[plate tectonics]].

The [[magnetosphere]] is the region above the [[ionosphere]] that is defined by the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into [[Outer space|space]], protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the [[solar wind]] and [[cosmic rays]] that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the [[ozone layer]] that protects the Earth from [[Ultraviolet#Harmful effects|harmful ultraviolet radiation]].

The Earth's magnetic field serves to deflect most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solar wind hammers the ozone layer |first=Quirin |last=Shlermeler |date=3 March 2005 |doi=10.1038/news050228-12 |journal=News@nature |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050228/full/news050228-12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Solar wind ripping chunks off Mars |url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/ |work=Cosmos Online |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=21 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072916/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/solar-wind-ripping-chunks-mars/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of [[Mars]], resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luhmann|Johnson|Zhang|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scign.jpl.nasa.gov/learn/plate1.htm Structure of the Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315042223/http://scign.jpl.nasa.gov/learn/plate1.htm |date=2013-03-15 }}.

Humans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temple |first=Robert |title=The Genius of China |publisher=Andre Deutsch |year=2006 |isbn=0-671-62028-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[magnetic declination]] does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using [[magnetoreception]] various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.

== Main characteristics ==

===Description===
At any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the ''declination'' ({{math|&lt;var&gt;D&lt;/var&gt;}}) or ''variation''. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the ''inclination'' ({{math|&lt;var&gt;I&lt;/var&gt;}}) or ''[[magnetic dip]]''. The ''intensity'' ({{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;}}) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in {{math|&lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;}} (North), {{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;/var&gt;}} (East) and {{math|&lt;var&gt;Z&lt;/var&gt;}} (Down) coordinates.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;
[[File:XYZ-DIS magnetic field coordinates.svg|500px|thumb|center|Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field.]]

====Intensity====
The intensity of the field is often measured in [[Gauss (unit)|gauss (G)]], but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1&amp;nbsp;G = 100,000&amp;nbsp;nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (γ).&lt;ref name="NGDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml#What_are_the_magnetic_elements |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] is the [[SI]] unit of the magnetic field, '''B'''.  The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000&amp;nbsp;nT (0.25–0.65&amp;nbsp;G). By comparison, a strong [[refrigerator magnet]] has a field of about {{convert|10000000|nT|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/magnetminute/tesla-transcript.html |last1=Palm |first1=Eric |title=Tesla |publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A map of intensity contours is called an ''isodynamic chart''. As the [[Earth's magnetic field#Geographical variation|World Magnetic Model]] shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733" /&gt;

====Inclination====
{{main article|Magnetic dip}}
The inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the [[North Magnetic Pole]] and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a [[dip circle]].

An ''isoclinic chart'' (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown [[#Geographical variation|below]].

====Declination====
{{main article|Magnetic declination}}
Declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of a [[celestial pole]]. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).

{{see also|Dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field}}
Near the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.&lt;ref name="NGDC" /&gt; The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar [[magnet]], with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Casselman |title=The Earth Has More Than One North Pole |newspaper=Scientific American |date=28 February 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-earth-has-more-than-one-north-pole |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;

Historically, the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the Earth's magnetic field, not vice versa, since one of the first uses for a magnet was as a compass needle. A magnet's  North pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).&lt;ref name="Serway"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Serway  | first = Raymond A. |author2=Chris Vuille | title = Essentials of college physics | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2006 | location = USA | page = 493 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8n4NCyRgUMEC&amp;pg=PA493 | isbn = 0-495-10619-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emiliani"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Emiliani | first = Cesare | title = Planet Earth: Cosmology, Geology, and the Evolution of Life and Environment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1992 | location = UK | page = 228 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MfAGpVq8gpQC&amp;pg=PA228 | isbn = 0-521-40949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manners"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Manners | first = Joy | title = Static Fields and Potentials | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2000 | location = USA | page = 148 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vJyqbRPsXYQC&amp;pg=PA148 | isbn = 0-7503-0718-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;{{cite web | last = Nave | first = Carl R. | title = Bar Magnet | work = Hyperphysics | publisher = Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State Univ.  | year = 2010 | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html | accessdate = 2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Wallace A. |last1=Campbell |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/96EO00237/abstract |title="Magnetic" pole locations on global charts are incorrect |journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union |volume=77 |issue=36 |page=345 |year=1996 |doi=10.1029/96EO00237 |bibcode=1996EOSTr..77..345C |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |title=The Magnetic North Pole |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90° (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90° (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to {{convert|40|km}} per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the [[Boothia Peninsula]] in 1831 to {{convert|600|km}} from [[Resolute Bay]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="inconstant" /&gt; The ''magnetic equator'' is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).

The global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant [[Multipole expansion|non-dipolar]] contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.

== Magnetosphere ==

{{main article|Magnetosphere}}

Earth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's [[corona]] and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000&amp;nbsp;kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF).&lt;ref name="MerrillMagnetosphere"&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|2010}}, pages 126–141&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The [[magnetopause]], the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10&amp;nbsp;[[Earth radius|Earth radii]] out but the other side stretching out in a [[magnetotail]] that extends beyond 200&amp;nbsp;Earth radii.&lt;ref name="ParksIntro" /&gt;
Sunward of the magnetopause is the [[bow shock]], the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.&lt;ref name="MerrillMagnetosphere" /&gt;

Inside the magnetosphere is the [[plasmasphere]], a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This region begins at a height of 60&amp;nbsp;km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.&lt;ref name="ParksIntro" /&gt; There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10&amp;nbsp;million [[Electronvolt|electron volts]] (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2&amp;nbsp;Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7&amp;nbsp;Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Darrouzet |first1=Fabien |last2=De Keyser |first2=Johan |last3=Escoubet |first3=C. Philippe |date=10 September 2013 |title=Cluster shows plasmasphere interacting with Van Allen belts |url=http://sci.esa.int/cluster/52802-cluster-shows-plasmasphere-interacting-with-van-allen-belts/   |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects [[cosmic ray]]s, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the [[Solar system]]. (Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or [[heliosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shields Up! A breeze of interstellar helium atoms is blowing through the solar system |author=&lt;!-- Author not provided --&gt; |date=27 September 2004 |newspaper=Science@NASA |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2004/27sep_shieldsup/ |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.&lt;ref name="MerrillMagnetosphere" /&gt;

Some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a [[ring current]]. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="MerrillMagnetosphere" /&gt; Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] and also emit [[X-rays]].&lt;ref name="ParksIntro" /&gt;

The varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as [[space weather]], are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called [[geomagnetic storm]]s, can occur when a [[coronal mass ejection]] erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; [[Halloween solar storms, 2003|the "Halloween" storm of 2003]] damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.&lt;ref name="MerrillMagnetosphere" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |title=The great solar superstorm of 1859 |journal=Technology through time |publisher=NASA |volume=70 |year=2010 |url=http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2010/TTT/70.php |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time dependence ==

===Short-term variations===
[[File:Magnetic Storm Oct 2003.jpg|thumb|'''Background''': a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a [[magnetic storm]] in 2000.&lt;br /&gt; '''Globe''': map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity in [[Micro-|μ]] [[Tesla (unit)|T]].]]

The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere ([[ionospheric dynamo region]]) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the [[Earth's interior]], particularly the iron-rich [[Inner core|core]].&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;

Frequently, the Earth's magnetosphere is hit by [[solar flare]]s causing geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the [[K-index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/info/Kindex.html |title=The K-index |publisher=Space Weather Prediction Center |accessdate=20 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022183358/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/info/Kindex.html |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from [[THEMIS]] show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth – opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this could result in [[Power outage|blackouts]] and disruptions in [[artificial satellite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Steigerwald |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/news/themis_leaky_shield.html |title=Sun Often "Tears Out A Wall" In Earth's Solar Storm Shield |work=THEMIS: Understanding space weather |publisher=NASA |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as ''secular variation''. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt; A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.&lt;ref name="declination"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=Andrew |last2=Jonkers |first2=Art R.

The direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt; At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years.&lt;ref name="GSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov |title=Secular variation |work=Geomagnetism |publisher=Canadian Geological Survey |year=2011 |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.&lt;ref name="Constable_dipole"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Constable |first=Catherine |chapter=Dipole Moment Variation |pages=159–161 |year=2007 |editor-last=Gubbins |editor-first=David |editor2-last=Herrero-Bervera |editor2-first=Emilio |title=Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism |publisher=Springer-Verlag |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4423-6_67 |ref=harv |isbn=978-1-4020-3992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a ''westward drift'' at a rate of about 0.2 degrees per year.&lt;ref name="GSC" /&gt; This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.&lt;ref name="Dumberry"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dumberry |first=Mathieu |last2=Finlay |first2=Christopher C. |title=Eastward and westward drift of the Earth's magnetic field for the last three millennia |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=254 |pages=146–157 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.11.026 |ref=harv |bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.254..146D |url=http://www.epm.geophys.ethz.ch/~cfinlay/publications/dumberry_finlay_epsl07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as ''paleomagnetic secular variation'' or ''paleosecular variation (PSV)''. The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting [[geomagnetic excursion]]s and reversals.&lt;ref name="TauxeCh1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tauxe|1998|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic field reversals===
[[File:Geomagnetic polarity late Cenozoic.svg|right|thumb|180px|Geomagnetic polarity during the late [[Cenozoic Era]]. Dark areas denote periods where the polarity matches today's polarity, light areas denote periods where that polarity is reversed.]]
{{main article|Geomagnetic reversal}}

Although generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South [[geomagnetic poles]] trade places. Evidence for these ''geomagnetic reversals'' can be found in [[basalt]]s, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vacquier |first=Victor |title=Geomagnetism in marine geology |year=1972 |publisher=Elsevier Science |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9780080870427 |page=38 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]], occurred about 780,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="inconstant"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield/ |title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field |work=Science@Nasa |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMMch5"&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121016084936.htm |title=Ice Age Polarity Reversal Was Global Event: Extremely Brief Reversal of Geomagnetic Field, Climate Variability, and Super Volcano |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.06.050 |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=21 March 2013|bibcode=2012E&amp;PSL.351...54N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMMexcursion"&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|pp=148–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laschamp event]] is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).

The past magnetic field is recorded mostly by [[Magnetic mineralogy#Strongly magnetic minerals|strongly magnetic minerals]], particularly [[iron oxides]] such as [[magnetite]], that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This [[remanent magnetization]], or ''remanence'', can be acquired in more than one way. In [[lava flow]]s, the direction of the field is "frozen" in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a [[thermoremanent magnetization]]. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called ''detrital remanent magnetization''.&lt;ref name="McElhinny2000" /&gt;

Thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, [[magma]] wells up from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.&lt;ref name="McElhinny2000" /&gt;

[[Radiometric dating]] of lava flows has been used to establish a ''geomagnetic polarity time scale'', part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of [[magnetostratigraphy]], a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.&lt;ref name="McElhinny2000" /&gt;

Studies of lava flows on [[Steens Mountain]], Oregon, indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works.&lt;ref name="nature.com" /&gt; This finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study, not rapid field change, by one of the original authors of the 1995 study.&lt;ref name="epsl.com" /&gt;

Temporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity are known as ''excursions''.&lt;ref name="MMMexcursion" /&gt;

===Earliest appearance===
Paleomagnetic studies of [[Paleoarchean]] lava in Australia and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about {{Ma|3450}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB085iB07p03523/abstract |first1=T.

===Future===
[[File:Brunhes geomagnetism western US.png|thumb|Variations in virtual axial dipole moment since the last reversal.]]
At present, the overall geomagnetic field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated in the past several years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.

The nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of [[heteroscedastic]] fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.

The Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern [[Canada]] towards [[Siberia]] with a presently accelerating rate—{{convert|10|km}} per year at the beginning of the 20th century, up to {{convert|40|km}} per year in 2003,&lt;ref name="inconstant" /&gt; and since then has only accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091224-north-pole-magnetic-russia-earth-core.html |title=North Magnetic Pole Moving Due to Core Flux |last=Lovett |first=Richard A. |date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical origin ==
{{main article|Dynamo theory}}

The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive material of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core.  However the process is complex, and computer models that reproduce some of its features have only been developed in the last few decades.

===Earth's core and the geodynamo===
[[File:Outer core convection rolls.jpg|thumb|A schematic illustrating the relationship between motion of conducting fluid, organized into rolls by the Coriolis force, and the magnetic field the motion generates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How does the Earth's core generate a magnetic field? |work=USGS FAQs |publisher=United States Geological Survey |url=http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories/9782/2738 |accessdate=21 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118213104/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories%2F9782%2F2738 |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] fluids.&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss |first=Nigel |title=Dynamos in planets, stars and galaxies |journal=Astronomy and Geophysics |year=2002 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=3.09–3.15 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-4004.2002.43309.x|bibcode=2002A&amp;G....43c...9W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's field originates in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400&amp;nbsp;km (the radius of the Earth is 6370&amp;nbsp;km). It is divided into a solid [[inner core]], with a radius of 1220&amp;nbsp;km, and a liquid [[outer core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Jordan |first=T. H. |title=Structural Geology of the Earth's Interior |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=1979 |volume=76 |issue=9 |pages=4192–4200 |doi=10.1073/pnas.76.9.4192|bibcode=1979PNAS...76.4192J |pmid=16592703 |pmc=411539}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about {{convert|6000|K}}, to the [[core-mantle boundary]], which is about {{convert|3800|K}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earth's Center Is 1,000 Degrees Hotter Than Previously Thought, Synchrotron X-Ray Experiment Shows |date=25 April 2013 |newspaper=ScienceDaily |author=European Synchrotron Radiation Facility |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130425142355.htm |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat is generated by potential energy released by heavier materials sinking toward the core ([[planetary differentiation]], the [[iron catastrophe]]) as well as decay of [[radioactive]] elements in the interior.  The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.&lt;ref name="Buffett2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=B. A. |last1=Buffett |title=Earth's Core and the Geodynamo |journal=Science |volume=288 |issue=5473 |year=2000 |pages=2007–2012 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5473.2007 |bibcode=2000Sci...288.2007B |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]].&lt;ref name="Weiss" /&gt; The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields ([[Ampère's circuital law]]); a changing magnetic field generates an electric field ([[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the [[Lorentz force]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |authorlink=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman lectures on physics |year=2010 |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York |isbn=9780465024940 |pages=13-3,15-14,17-2 |edition=New millennium}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects can be combined in a [[partial differential equation]] for the magnetic field called the ''magnetic induction equation'',

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} + \nabla \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B}), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''u'''}} is the velocity of the fluid; {{math|'''B'''}} is the magnetic B-field; and {{math|η{{=}}1/σμ}} is the [[magnetic diffusivity]], which is inversely proportional to the product of the [[electrical conductivity]] {{math|σ}} and the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] {{math|μ}} .&lt;ref name=MMMch8&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term {{math|∂'''B'''/∂''t''}} is the time derivative of the field; {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[Laplace operator]] and {{math|∇×}} is the [[curl (mathematics)|curl operator]].

The first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a [[diffusion]] term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref name=MMMch8/&gt;

In a perfect conductor (&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \infty\;&lt;/math&gt;), there would be no diffusion. By [[Lenz's law]], any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the ''frozen-in-field theorem''. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.&lt;ref name=MMMch8/&gt;

The motion of the fluid is sustained by [[convection]], motion driven by [[buoyancy]]. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called ''compositional convection''. A [[Coriolis effect]], caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.&lt;ref name=Buffett2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=MMMch8/&gt;

A dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a "seed" field to get it started.&lt;ref name=MMMch8/&gt; For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a [[T Tauri star|T-Tauri phase]] in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind.&lt;ref name=MMMch10&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo.&lt;ref name=MMMch11&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average magnetic field in the Earth's outer core was calculated to be 25 gausses, 50 times stronger than the field at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bruce A. |last1=Buffett |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7326/full/nature09643.html |title=Tidal dissipation and the strength of the Earth's internal magnetic field |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=468 |pages=952–954 |year=2010 |bibcode=2010Natur.468..952B |doi=10.1038/nature09643 |issue=7326 |pmid=21164483 |laysummary=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/first_measurement_magnetic_field_inside_earths_core |laysource=Science 20 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Numerical models====
Simulating the geodynamo requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating ''kinematic dynamo'' computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.&lt;ref name=Kono2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kono |first1=Masaru |last2=Roberts |first2=Paul H. |title=Recent geodynamo simulations and observations of the geomagnetic field |journal=[[Reviews of Geophysics]] |year=2002 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=1–53 |doi=10.1029/2000RG000102 |bibcode=2002RvGeo..40.1013K |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''self-consistent'' dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kageyama |first1=Akira |last2=Sato |first2=Tetsuya |author3=the Complexity Simulation Group |title=Computer simulation of a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo.

===Currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere===
Electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Janez |last1=Stepišnik |title=Spectroscopy: NMR down to Earth |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=439 |pages=799–801 |year=2006|bibcode=2006Natur.439..799S |doi=10.1038/439799a |issue=7078 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection===
The Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1832&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gauss, C.F |date=1832 |title=The Intensity of the Earth's Magnetic Force Reduced to Absolute Measurement |url=http://21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |volume=1988 |issue=16 |page=435 |title=Time Variations of the Earth's Magnetic Field: From Daily to Secular |first1=Vincent |last1=Courtillot |author1-link=Vincent Courtillot |first2=Jean Louis |last2=Le Mouel |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.16.050188.002133 |bibcode=1988AREPS..16..389C |year=1988 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magsat]] satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth's magnetic field.

Governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are [[geomagnetic observatories]], typically part of a national [[Geological survey]], for example the [[British Geological Survey]]'s [[Eskdalemuir Observatory]]. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.

The [[Intermagnet|International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network]], with over 100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world, has been recording the Earth's magnetic field since 1991.

The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect ''anomalies'' in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s are flown in aircraft like the UK's [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.

Commercially, [[geophysical]] [[prospecting]] companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from [[ore]] bodies, such as the [[Kursk Magnetic Anomaly]].

When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Kious"/&gt;

===Statistical models===
Each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.

====Spherical harmonics====
{{see also|Multipole expansion}}
[[File:Spherical harmonics positive negative.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of spherical harmonics on a sphere and their nodal lines. {{math|&lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ℓ &lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to 0 along {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}} [[great circle]]s passing through the poles, and along {{math|ℓ-&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}} circles of equal latitude. The function changes sign each ℓtime it crosses one of these lines.]]
[[File:VFPt four charges.svg|thumb|Example of a quadrupole field. This can also be constructed by moving two dipoles together.]]

The most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of [[spherical harmonics]]. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.&lt;ref name=Wallace2003&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2003}}, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such ''[[nodal line]]s'' is the absolute value of the ''order'' {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}}. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the ''degree'' ℓ. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A ''[[Magnetic monopole|monopole]]'' is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A ''[[Magnetic dipole|dipole]]'' is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a ''[[quadrupole]]'' to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.&lt;ref name=MMMch2&gt;{{harvnb |Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996 |loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spherical harmonics can represent any [[scalar field]] (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a [[vector field]], but if it is expressed in Cartesian components {{math|&lt;var&gt;X, Y, Z&lt;/var&gt;}}, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the ''[[magnetic potential]]''. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  ''Gauss coefficient'' {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;

The lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients – {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} – determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10° with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;

=====Radial dependence=====
Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as {{math|1/&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ℓ+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and one that ''increases'' with radius as {{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ℓ&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;

The remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source ({{math|ℓ{{=}}1}}) drops off as {{math|1/&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as {{math|1/&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Quadrupole terms drop off as {{math|1/&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree {{math|14}} or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about {{convert|2000|km}} or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.&lt;ref name="MMMch2" /&gt;

====Global models====
The [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] maintains a standard global field model called the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]]. It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites ([[Ørsted (satellite)|Ørsted]], [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]] and [[SAC-C]]) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Finlay |first1=C.

Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrfhw.html |title=The International Geomagnetic Reference Field: A "Health" Warning |date=January 2010 |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another global field model, called the [[World Magnetic Model]], is produced jointly by the United States [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the [[British Geological Survey]]. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the [[United States Department of Defense]], the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]], the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), and the [[International Hydrographic Office]] as well as in many civilian navigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Magnetic Model |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third model, produced by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] ([[NASA]] and [[GSFC]]) and the [[Danish Space Research Institute]], uses a "comprehensive modeling" approach that attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herbert |first=Frey |title=Comprehensive Modeling of the Geomagnetic Field |url=http://core2.gsfc.nasa.gov/CM/ |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020054217/http://core2.gsfc.nasa.gov/cm/ |archivedate=2011-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For users with higher accuracy needs, the United States [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] developed  the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), which extends to degree and order 790 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. {{As of|2018}}, the latest version, EMM2017, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm satellite mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Enhanced Magnetic Model|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/EMM/ |publisher=United States [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geothermal exploration''' is the exploration of the subsurface in search of viable active geothermal regions with the goal of building a geothermal power plant, where hot fluids drive turbines to create electricity.&lt;ref name="Manzella"/&gt;  Exploration methods include a broad range of disciplines including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[geochemistry]] and [[engineering]].&lt;ref name="Hulen"/&gt;

Geothermal regions with adequate heat flow to fuel power plants are found in [[rift zone]]s, [[subduction zone]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.  [[Hotspot (geology)|Hot spots]] are characterized by four geothermal elements.  An active region will have:&lt;ref name="Manzella"/&gt;
# Heat Source - Shallow [[magma]]tic body, decaying radioactive elements or ambient heat from high pressures
# Reservoir - Collection of hot rocks from which heat can be drawn
# Geothermal Fluid - Gas, vapor and water found within the reservoir
# Recharge Area - Area surrounding the reservoir that rehydrates the geothermal system.

Exploration involves not only identifying hot geothermal bodies, but also low-density, cost effective regions to drill and already constituted plumbing systems inherent within the subsurface.&lt;ref name="XDT"/&gt;  This information allows for higher success rates in geothermal plant production as well as lower drilling costs.

As much as 42% of all expenses associated with [[geothermal energy]] production can be attributed to exploration. These costs are mostly from drilling operations necessary to confirm or deny viable geothermal regions.&lt;ref name="Jennejohn"/&gt;    Some geothermal experts have gone to say that developments in exploration techniques and technologies have the potential to bring the greatest advancements within the industry.&lt;ref name="USDOE"/&gt;

Drilling provides the most accurate information in the exploration process, but is also the most costly exploration method.

Thermal gradient holes (TGH), [[exploration well]]s (slim holes), and full-scale production wells (wildcats) provide the most reliable information on the subsurface.&lt;ref name="Jennejohn"/&gt;  Temperature gradients, thermal pockets and other geothermal characteristics can be measured directly after drilling, providing valuable information.
 
Geothermal exploration wells rarely exceed 4&amp;nbsp;km in depth.  Subsurface materials associated with geothermal fields range from [[limestone]] to [[shale]], volcanic rocks and [[granite]].&lt;ref name="Manzella"/&gt;  Most drilled geothermal exploration wells, up to the production well, are still considered to be within the exploration phase.  Most consultants and engineers consider exploration to continue until one production well is completed successfully.&lt;ref name="Jennejohn"/&gt; 
 
Generally, the first [[wildcat]] well has a success rate of 25%.  Following more analysis and investigation, success rates then increase to a range from 60% to 80%.  Although expenses vary significantly, drilling costs are estimated at $400/ft.&lt;ref name="Jennejohn"/&gt;  Therefore, it is becoming paramount to investigate other means of exploration before drilling operations commence.  To increase the chances of successfully drilling, innovations in [[remote sensing]] technologies have developed over the last 2 decades.  These less costly means of exploration are categorized into multiple fields including geology, geochemistry and geophysics.

===Geophysics===

====Seismology====

[[Seismology]] has played a significant role in the [[oil and gas]] industry and is now being adapted to geothermal exploration.&lt;ref name="Jennejohn"/&gt;  Seismic waves propagate and interact with subterranean components and respond accordingly.  Two sub categories exist that are relevant to the source of the seismic signal.&lt;ref name="Burger"/&gt;  Active seismology relies on using induced/man-made vibrations at or near the surface.  [[Passive seismic|Passive seismology]] uses earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other tectonic activity as sources.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;

Passive seismic studies use natural wave propagation through the earth.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;  Geothermal fields are often characterized by increased levels of seismicity. Earthquakes of lesser magnitude are much more frequent than ones of larger magnitude.&lt;ref name="Burger"/&gt;  Therefore, these [[Microearthquake|micro earthquakes]] (MEQ), registering below 2.0 magnitude on the [[Richter scale]], are used to reveal subsurface qualities relating to geothermal exploration.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;  The high rate of MEQ in geothermal regions produce large datasets that don’t require long field deployments.

Active Seismology, which has history in the oil and gas industry, involves studying man made vibrational wave propagation.  In these studies [[geophone]]s (or other seismic sensors) are spread across the study site.  The most common geophone spreads are in line, offset, in-line with center shot and Fan shooting.&lt;ref name="Burger"/&gt;

Many analytical techniques can be applied to active seismology studies but generally all include [[Huygens Principle]], [[Fermat|Fermat’s Princeple]] and [[Snell’s law]].  These basic principles can be used to identify subsurface anomalies, reflective layers and other objects with high [[Acoustic impedance|impedance contrasts]].&lt;ref name="Burger"/&gt;

====Gravity====
[[Gravimetry]] studies use changes in densities to characterize subsurface properties.&lt;ref name="Burger"/&gt;  This method is well applied when identifying dense subsurface anomalies including granite bodies, which are vital to locate in the geothermal exploration projects.  Subsurface [[fault lines]] are also identifiable with gravitational methods.  These faults are often identified as prime drilling locations as their densities are much less than surrounding material.  Developments in airborne gravitational studies yield large amounts of data, which can be used to model the subsurface 3 dimensionally with relatively high levels of accuracy.

Changes in [[groundwater]] levels may also be measured and identified with gravitational methods.  This recharge element is imperative in creating productive geothermal systems.  Pore density and subsequent overall density are affected by fluid flow and therefore change the [[gravitational field]].  When correlated with current weather conditions, this can be measured and modeled to estimate the rate of recharge in geothermal reservoirs.&lt;ref name="Manzella"/&gt;

Unfortunately, there are many other factors that must be realized before data from a gravity study can be interpreted.  The average gravitational field the earth produces is 920&amp;nbsp;cm/c^2.  Objects of concern produce a significantly smaller gravitational field.  Therefore, instrumentation must detect variations as small as 0.00001%.  Other considerations including elevation, latitude and weather conditions must be carefully observed and taken into account.&lt;ref name="Burger"/&gt;

====Resistivity and magnetotellurics====

[[Magnetotellurics]] (MT) measurements allow detection of [[resistivity]] anomalies associated with productive geothermal structures, including [[fault (geology)|fault]]s and the presence of a [[cap rock]], and allow for estimation of geothermal reservoir temperatures at various depths. MT has successfully contributed to the successful mapping and development of geothermal resources around the world since the early 1980s, including in the U.S. and countries located on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] such as Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Ecuador, and Peru.

Geological materials are generally poor electrical conductors and have a high resistivity. Hydrothermal fluids in the pores and fractures of the earth, however, increase the conductivity of the subsurface material. This change in conductivity is used to map the subsurface geology and estimate the subsurface material composition. Resistivity measurements are made using a series of probes distributed tens to hundreds of meters apart, to detect the electrical response of the Earth to injection of electrical impulses in order to reconstruct the distribution of electrical resistance in the rocks. Since flowing geothermal waters can be detected as zones of low resistance, it is possible to map geothermal resources using such a technique. However, care must be exercised when interpreting low resistivity zones since they may also be caused by changes in rock type and temperature.

The Earth’s magnetic field varies in intensity and orientation during the day inducing detectable electrical currents in the Earth’s crust. The range of the frequency of those currents allows a multispectral analysis of the variation in the electromagnetic local field. As a result, it is possible a tomographic reconstruction of geology, since the currents are determined by the underlying response of the different rocks to the changing magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Glassley"/&gt;

====Magnetics====
[[File:Geothermal stream iceland.jpg|right|thumb|Stream in Icelandic geothermal exploration field.]]The most common application magnetism has in geothermal exploration involves identifying the [[Curie depth|depth of the curie point or curie temperature]].  At the curie point, materials will change from [[ferromagnetic]] to paramagnetic.  Locating curie temperatures for known subsurface materials provides estimates on future plant productivity.  For example, titanomagnetitite, a common material in geothermal fields, has a curie temperature between 200-570 degrees Celsius.  Simple geometric anomalies modeled at different depths are used to best estimate the curie depth.&lt;ref name="Manzella"/&gt;

===Geochemistry===

This science is readily used in geothermal exploration.  Scientists within this field relate surface fluid properties and geologic data to geothermal bodies.  Temperature, isotopic ratios, elemental ratios, mercury &amp; CO2 concentrations are all data points under close examination.  Geothermometers  and other instrumentation are placed around field sites to increase the fidelity of subsurface temperature estimates.&lt;ref name="Jennejohn"/&gt;

== US geothermal potential ==
Geothermal Energy is an underdeveloped energy resource and warrants further investigation and exploration.&lt;ref name="Hulen"/&gt;  According to the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], Utah's geothermal capabilities alone, if fully developed, could provide 1/3 of the state's  power needs. Currently, the United States is planning to organize national geothermal databases, expand [[USGS]] resources nationally and develop geophysical projects to validate advances in exploration technologies.&lt;ref name="USDOE"/&gt;  Below lists U.S. counties and regions that potentially can utilize geothermal power and would warrant further exploration.&lt;ref name="GEO"/&gt;

'''Harrington paradox''' is a notion in the [[Environmental economics|environmental]] and [[ecological economics]] describing the [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] of firms to the [[environmental regulation]]s. The [[paradox]] was first described in Winston Harrington's paper in 1988 and was based on the research over monitoring, realization and compliance to ecological standards in the USA from the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1980s. According to the paradox, the firms in general comply with ecological standards in spite of the fact that:

* Frequency of ecological monitoring of firms is low
* In case of detection of violations, the violator-firm is rarely punished
* The expected [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] is low in comparison to the cost of compliance

==Explanation==
Firms' compliance at such level is contrary to the rational crime theory of [[Gary Becker]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ww.uni-magdeburg.de/bizecon/material/becker.1968.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the behavior of profit maximizing entities. The rational firms will comply to the standards only in case the expected fine is higher than the cost of compliance. In order to explain the paradox it was suggested that firms exhibit [[altruism]] or self-image concern.

==Observation==
The [[empirical data]] observing the paradox is rare. In the research conducted by [[Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.klif.no/english//|title = Norwegian Environment Agency|website = www.klif.no|access-date = 2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 no serious violations were revealed, but in the majority of firms (80%) there were minor deviations from standards. The fact that in Norway there is low frequency of monitoring and the fine system for minor violations is light can not bring strong evidence to the paradox, as major violations imply very strict [[punishment]]s which is conforming to the rational crime theory.

An '''Ion Gun''' typically refers to an instrument that generates a beam of [[heavy ions]] with a well defined energy distribution. The [[ion beam]] is produced from a plasma that has been confined within a volume. Ions of a particular energy are extracted, accelerated, collimated and/or focused. The ion gun is composed of an [[ion source]], extraction grid structure and a collimation/lensing structure. The plasma can be made up of an inert or reactive gas (e.g. N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or an easily condensable substance (e.g. C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). The plasma can be formed from molecules that contain the substance which will form the beam, in which case, these molecules must be fragmented then ionized (e.g. H and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can together be fragmented and ionized to create a beam for depositing diamond-like carbon films).

The ion [[current density]] (or similarly the ion flux), the ion energy spread, and the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of the ion beam are key factors in ion gun design. The ion current density is controlled by the [[ion source]], the energy spread is determined primarily by the extraction grid, and the resolution is determined primarily by the optical column.

The ion gun is an important component in [[surface science]] in that it provides the scientist with a means to sputter etch a surface and generate an elemental or chemical depth profile.&lt;ref&gt;Giannuzzi, L.A., Stevie, F.A., "Introduction to focused ion beams: instrumentation, theory, techniques, and practice", Springer (2005), p.315&lt;/ref&gt; Modern ion guns can produce beam energies from 10eV to more than 10keV.

==Measurement and Detection==

A [[Nanocoulombmeter]] in combination with a [[Faraday cup]] can be used
to detect and measure the beams emitted from ion guns.

'''Lechatelierite''' is [[silica]] glass, [[amorphous]] SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, non-crystalline [[mineraloid]].

==Structure==
Lechatelierite is a [[mineraloid]] as it does not have a [[crystal structure]]. Although not a true mineral, it is often classified in the [[quartz]] mineral group.

==Formation==
One common way in which lechatelierite forms naturally is by very high temperature melting of [[quartz]] sand during a [[lightning]] strike. The result is an irregular, branching, often foamy hollow tube of silica glass called a [[fulgurite]].&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-2363.html Lechatelierite on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all fulgurites are lechatelierite; the original sand must be nearly pure silica.

Lechatelierite also forms as the result of high pressure [[shock metamorphism]] during [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]ing and is a common component of a type of glassy [[ejecta]] called [[tektite]]s. Most tektites are blobs of impure glassy material, but tektites from the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]] in [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]], known as ''[[Libyan desert glass]]'', are composed of almost pure silica that is almost pure lechatelierite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-39796.html Libyan Desert Glass on Mindat]&lt;/ref&gt; High pressure experiments have shown that shock pressures of 85 [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]] are needed to produce lechatelierite in quartz grains embedded in [[granite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC98/pdf/1671.pdf C. Schrand and A. Deutsch, 1998, ''Formation of Lechatelierite and Impact Melt Glasses in Experimentally Shocked Rocks'', Lunar and Planetary Science XXIX 1671.pdf retrieved Sept. 13, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechatelierite was formed during the impact of a [[meteorite]] into a layer of [[Coconino Sandstone]] at [[Meteor Crater]] in [[Arizona]]. During the rapid pressure reduction following the impact, steam expanded the newly formed lechatelierite. The shattered and expanded glass has a density less than that of water.&lt;ref name="AMNH"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/earth-and-planetary-sciences-halls/arthur-ross-hall-of-meteorites/meteorite-impacts/meteor-crater/puffed-up-and-pulverized | title=Puffed up and pulverised | publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] | accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechatelierite may also form artificially, a unique example being the ''[[trinitite]]'' produced by melting of quartz sand at the first nuclear bomb explosion at Trinity Flats, [[White Sands, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Lechatelierite.shtml Lechatelierite on Webmineral]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local Nature Reserve]]s are designated by local authorities under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. Local Nature Reserves are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically. Local authorities have a duty to care for them, and can apply local [[Byelaws in the United Kingdom|bye-laws]] to manage and protect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|title=Protected or Designated Areas|date=9 April 2013|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145328/https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|title=Local Nature Reserves: Setting up and Management|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704111109/https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6402">This is a list of all [[tornado]]es reported in the US state of [[Rhode Island]]. Although tornadoes are very rare in this state, at least 15 have been recorded in modern history. Additionally, because of high population density and property values, Rhode Island ranks 5th among states in potential losses due to tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_n27206808 A.M.

==Tornadoes==
*August 15, 1787: A part of the '''[[Four-State Tornado Swarm]]''' of 1787, a tornado moved into the state from [[Windham County, Connecticut]] and tore the roofs from some homes in [[Glocester, Rhode Island|Glocester]] before passing into [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="tornado project"&gt;[[The Tornado Project]].

*August 30, 1838: A major tornado, possibly the worst in Rhode Island history, passed south of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. It uprooted and stripped trees of their branches, unroofed or destroyed many houses, and sucked water out of ponds. The tornado barely missed a local railroad depot, where many people were waiting for a train. Five people were injured by the tornado.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen, Zachariah |author2=Hare, Robert  | year = 1839 | title = Account of a Tornado | journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 6 | pages = 297–301 | publisher = [[American Philosophical Society]] | jstor = 1005326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*August 7, 1986: The only multiple-tornado day ever recorded in Rhode Island.  A weak '''F1''' tornado briefly touched down near [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]] around 3:30 PM local time.  At approximately 4:30pm a tornado destroyed a home at 43 Hillwood St, Providence owned by Lynn Panchuk Price.  It stayed on the ground for 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km), injuring 20 people and causing around $2.5 million in damage.&lt;ref name="tornado project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="severe plot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10117647 Event Details: 1986-08-07 15:15:00.0 EST]&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 8, 1986: Another tornado struck the state again on this day.  Touching down at the unusual time of 9:30 AM north of [[Bridgeton, Rhode Island|Bridgeton]], it continued on the ground for more than 6 miles (9&amp;nbsp;km) before passing into [[Massachusetts]] near [[Smithfield, Rhode Island|North Smithfield]].

This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Hampshire]]''', [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England uses the borders of Hampshire to mark one of its [[Area of Search|Areas of Search]]. {{As of|2012}}, there are 118 sites designated in this Area of Search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSSIs in Hampshire|work=English Nature|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1019|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 4 sites with a purely geological interest, and 108 listed for biological interest. A further 6 sites are designated for both reasons.

Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974&amp;ndash;1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=2006-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here. The data in the table is taken from Natural England in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI, and the County Background Datasheet for Hampshire.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/reportAction.cfm?Report=sdrt07&amp;Category=CF&amp;Reference=1019 Natural England County Background datasheet for HampshireSSSIs] Accessed 14 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

For other counties, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

'''Litharge''' (from Greek lithargyros, lithos (stone) + argyros (silver) ''λιθάργυρος'') is one of the natural mineral forms of [[lead(II) oxide]], PbO. Litharge is a secondary mineral which forms from the [[oxidation]] of [[galena]] [[ore]]s. It forms as coatings and encrustations with internal [[tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal crystal structure]]. It is dimorphous with the [[orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] form [[massicot]]. It forms soft ([[Mohs hardness]] of 2), red, greasy-appearing crusts with a very high [[specific gravity]] of 9.14–9.35.  PbO may be prepared by heating lead metal in air at approximately 600°C (lead melts at only 300°C). At this temperature it is also the end product of oxidation of other [[lead oxide (disambiguation)|lead oxide]]s in air.&lt;ref&gt;N.N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, "Chemistry of Elements", 2nd edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often done with a set of bellows pumping air over molten lead and causing the oxidized product to slip or fall off the top into a receptacle, where it quickly solidifies in minute scales.&lt;ref&gt;http://chestofbooks.com/health/materia-medica-drugs/Treatise-Therapeutics-Pharmacology-Materia-Medica-Vol1/VI-Semivitrified-Oxide-Of-Lead-Oxide-Of-Lead-Plumbi-Ox.html#.UYdA2crhfU4&lt;/ref&gt;
:PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; –(293 °C)→ Pb&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; –(351 °C)→ Pb&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; –(375 °C)→ Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; –(605 °C)→ PbO

==Historical terminology==

Historically, the term "litharge" has been combined to refer to other similar substances. For example, ''litharge of gold'' is litharge mixed with [[red lead]], giving it a red color;  ''litharge of bismuth'' is a similar result of the oxidation of bismuth; ''litharge of silver'' is litharge that comes as a by-product of separating silver from lead, in fact ''litharge'' originally meant the mineral residue from silver refining. The term has also been used as a synonym for [[white lead]] or red lead.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|litharge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litharge smelting==
According to Probert, "[[silver]] [[ore]], litharge (crude lead oxide) [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] and [[charcoal]] were mixed and [[smelting|smelted]] in very small [[clay]] and stone [[furnace]]s.  Resulting silver-bearing lead [[bullion]] was later refined in a second furnace which yielded fine silver, and litharge skimmings which were used again."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Probert, "Bartolomé de Medina: The Patio Process and the Sixteenth Century Silver Crisis" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. ''Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas''. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997, pp. 96, {{ISBN|0860785130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Warner Morley''' (February 17, 1858 in [[Montrose, Iowa]] – December 12, 1923 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) was an American educator, biologist, and author of many children's books on nature and biology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392455/Margaret-Warner-Morley|title=Margaret Warner Morley {{!}} American biologist, educator, and author|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Morley grew up in [[Brooklyn]]. She studied at [[State University of New York at Oswego]] and [[Hunter College]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She continued her biology education at the Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago and at the Woods Hole marine laboratory in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBj5-zHEMvoC&amp;dq=margaret+warner+morley&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern American Educators|last=Ohles|first=Frederik|last2=Ohles|first2=Shirley M.|last3=Ramsay|first3=John G.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997|isbn=978-0313291333|location=|pages=232|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a teacher and was considered an expert in agriculture and [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was most well known for her work as an illustrator, photographer, and author of books on nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As early as 1890 she visited [[Tryon, North Carolina]] with the painter [[Amelia Watson]] where she resided in the cottage of playwright [[William Gillette]]. She finally acquired her own home in Tryon where she lived for many years&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;.

In one of her many trips she went to Europe to the [[Val Gardena]] the valley of toy carvers where she was inspired to write the novel ''Donkey John of the toy valley''&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;.

A collection of Morley's work is held at the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. The collection consists of travel logs and sketchbooks of rural North Carolina, and book manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org/pdf/manuscript_collection.pdf|title=A Guide to the Manuscript Collections at the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center|last=|first=|date=2008|website=www.harrietbeecherstowecenter.org|publisher=|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Carolina Museum of History owns a collection of original photographs that Morley donated to the museum in 1914.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhu.edu/news-events/news-articles/rural-heritage-museum-to-display-photographs-of-margaret-morley |title=News &amp; Events - News Articles - Rural Heritage Museum to Display Photographs of Margaret Morley |date=2016-05-10 |access-date=2017-01-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510103400/http://www.mhu.edu/news-events/news-articles/rural-heritage-museum-to-display-photographs-of-margaret-morley |archivedate=2016-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11936">{{short description|A pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial wastewater, stormwater, combined sewer overflows, cooling water, or brine effluents from water desalination plants to the sea}}
A '''marine outfall''' is a pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[combined sewer overflow]]s, [[cooling water]], or [[brine]] effluents from [[water desalination]] plants to the sea. Usually they discharge under the sea's surface (submarine outfall). In the case of municipal wastewater, effluent is often being discharged after having undergone no or only primary [[Wastewater treatment|treatment]], with the intention of using the assimilative capacity of the sea for further treatment. Submarine [[outfall]]s are common throughout the world and probably number in the thousands. More than 200 outfalls alone have been listed in a single international database maintained by the Institute for Hydromechanics at [[Karlsruhe University]] for the [[International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research]] (IAHR) / [[International Water Association]] (IWA) Committee on Marine Outfall Systems.&lt;ref name="Database"&gt;[http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ Outfalls Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628233110/http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ |date=2008-06-28 }} Click on "Activities", then "Outfalls repository", then "database", then "Output"&lt;/ref&gt;

The World's first marine outfall was built in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], United States, in 1910. In Latin America and the Caribbean there were 134 outfalls with more than 500 m length in 2006 for wastewater disposal alone, according to a survey by the Pan American Center for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS) of [[Pan American Health Organization|PAHO]]. According to the survey, the largest number of municipal wastewater outfalls in the region exist in Venezuela (39), Chile (39) and Brazil (22).&lt;ref  name="Database"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest marine outfall is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/about_bwsc/systems/outfall_maps/outfall_maps.asp&lt;/ref&gt;Currently, Boston has approximately 235 miles of combined sewers and 37 active CSO outfalls. Lots of outfalls are simply known by a public used name, e.g. Boston Outfall.&lt;ref name="MWWD2002"&gt;[http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf OUTFALLS DATABASE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728014543/http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf |date=2015-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_INNERHARBOR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_DORCHESTERBAY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_CHARLES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

According to the Australian engineer [[Sharon Beder]] the main advantages of marine outfalls for the discharge of wastewater are:
*the natural [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] and [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] of [[organic matter]], [[pathogens]] and other pollutants
*the ability to keep the sewage field submerged because of the depth at which the [[sewage]] is being released
*the greater die-off rate of pathogens due to the greater distance they will have to travel to shore.&lt;ref name="Beder"&gt;Beder, Sharon: [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/sewage/phd.html From Pipe Dreams to Tunnel Vision: Engineering Decision-Making and Sydney's Sewerage System], Ph.D. Thesis, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA 1989, Chapter 8: The 'Science' and 'Metaphysics' of Submarine Outfalls&lt;/ref&gt;

They also tend to be less expensive than advanced wastewater treatment plants, using the natural assimilative capacity of the sea instead of energy-intensive treatment processes in a plant. For example, preliminary treatment of wastewater is sufficient with an effective outfall and diffuser. The costs of preliminary treatment are about one tenth that of secondary treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Philip JW Roberts:"Underwater and underused: The case of marine outfalls in wastewater disposal", in Water21, Magazine of the International Water Association, October 2010, pp. 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary treatment also requires much less land than advanced wastewater treatment.

== Disadvantages ==

Marine outfalls for partially treated or untreated wastewater remain controversial. Still according to [[Sharon Beder]], the design calculation and computer models for pollution modeling have been criticized, arguing that dilution has been overemphasized and that other mechanisms work in the opposite direction, such as [[bioaccumulation]] of [[toxins]], [[sedimentation]] of [[sludge]] particles and [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] of sewage particles with [[Fat|grease]]. Accumulative mechanisms include slick formation, windrow formation, [[flocculate]] formation and agglomerated formation. Grease or wax can interfere with dispersion, so that bacteria and viruses could be carried to remote locations where the concentration of bacterial predators would be low and the die-off rate much lower.&lt;ref name="Beder"/&gt;

== Technology ==

Outfalls vary in diameter from as narrow as 15&amp;nbsp;cm to as wide as 8 m; the widest registered outfall in the world with 8 m diameter is located in [[Navia (Spain)]] for the discharge of industrial wastewater. Outfalls vary in length from 50 m to 55&amp;nbsp;km, the longest registered outfalls being the [[Boston]] outfall with a length of 16&amp;nbsp;km and an industrial outfall in [[Ankleshwar]] (India) with a length of 55&amp;nbsp;km. The depth of the deepest point of an outfall varies from 3 m to up to 60 m, the deepest registered outfall being located in [[Macuto, Vargas]] (Venezuela) for the discharge of untreated municipal wastewater.

Outfall materials include [[polyethylene]], [[stainless steel]], [[carbon steel]], [[glass-reinforced plastic]], [[reinforced concrete]], [[cast iron]] or tunnels through rock. Common installation methods for pipelines are float and sink, bottom pull and top pull.&lt;ref name="Database"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

In the 1960s the city of [[Sydney]] decided to build ocean sewage outfalls to discharge partially treated sewage 2–4&amp;nbsp;km offshore at a cost of US$ 300 million. In the late 1980s, however, the government promised to upgrade the coastal treatment plants so that sewage would be treated to at least secondary treatment standards before discharge into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/sbeder/sewage/elephants.html Sharon Beder, 'Getting into Deep Water: Sydney's Extended Ocean Sewage Outfalls'] in Pam Scott, ed., A Herd of White Elephants: Australia's Science &amp; Technology Policy, Hale and Iremonger, Sydney, 1992, pp62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The submarine outfall in [[Cartagena, Colombia]] was financed with a loan by the [[World Bank]]. It was subsequently challenged by residents claiming that the wastewater caused damage to the marine environment and to fisheries. The case was taken up by the [[World Bank's Inspection Panel]], which contracted two independent three-dimensional modeling efforts in 2006. Both "confirmed that the 2.85km long submarine outfall (was) adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/12/13/000020953_20061213134653/Rendered/INDEX/38182.txt World Bank Inspection Panel Progress Report on Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22823">In [[physics]], '''  motion''' is a change in [[Position (vector)|position]] of an object over time. Motion is [[mathematically]]  described in terms of [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[distance]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[time]], and [[speed]]. Motion of a body is observed by attaching a [[frame of reference]] to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame.

If the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference (reference point), the body is said to be ''at rest'', ''motionless'', ''immobile'', ''[[wikt:stationary|stationary]]'', or to have constant ([[time-invariant]]) position. An object's motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a [[force]], as described. Momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring the motion of an object. An object's [[momentum]] is directly related to the object's [[mass]] and velocity, and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system (one not affected by external forces) does not change with time, as described by the [[law of conservation of momentum]].

As there is no absolute frame of reference, ''[[Absolute space and time|absolute motion]]'' cannot be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wahlin|first=Lars|chapter=9.1 Relative and absolute motion |title=The Deadbeat Universe|year=1997|publisher=Coultron Research|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=0-933407-03-3|pages=121–129|url=http://www.colutron.com/download_files/chapt9.pdf |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, everything in the universe can be considered to be moving.&lt;ref name=Tyson&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyson|first=Neil de Grasse|author2=Charles Tsun-Chu Liu |author3=Robert Irion  |title=The universe : at home in the cosmos|year=2000|publisher=[[National Academy Press]]|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-06488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

Motion applies to objects, bodies, and matter particles, to radiation, radiation fields and radiation particles, and to space, its curvature and space-time. One can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries. So, the term motion, in general, signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system. For example, one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle, where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions.

==Laws of motion==
{{Main|Mechanics}}

In physics, motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory [[scientific law|laws]] of mechanics. Motions of all large-scale and familiar objects in the universe (such as [[projectile]]s, [[planet]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, and [[human]]s) are described by [[classical mechanics]]. Whereas the motion of very small [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|sub-atomic]] objects is described by [[quantum mechanic]]s.
{| class="wikitable"
|'''First law''':
|In an [[inertial reference frame]], an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant [[velocity]], unless acted upon by a [[net force]].
|-
|'''Second law''':
|In an inertial reference frame, the vector [[Vector sum|sum]] of the [[forces]] '''F''' on an object is equal to the [[mass]] ''m'' of that object multiplied by the [[acceleration]] '''a''' of the object: '''F''' = ''m'''''a'''.
|-
|'''Third law''':
|When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
|}

===Classical mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics}}
Classical mechanics is used for describing the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects, from [[projectiles]] to parts of [[machinery]], as well as [[astronomical objects]], such as [[spacecraft]], [[planets]], [[star]]s, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. It produces very accurate results within these domains, and is one of the oldest and largest in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]].

Classical mechanics is fundamentally based on [[Newton's laws of motion]]. These laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body. They were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] in his work ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', first published on July 5, 1687. Newton's three laws are:
# A [[Physical body|body]] either is at rest or moves with constant velocity, until and unless an outer force is applied to it.
# An object will travel in one direction only until an outer force changes its direction.
# Whenever one body exerts a force '''F''' onto a second body, (in some cases, which is standing still) the second body exerts the force −'''F''' on the first body. '''F''' and −'''F''' are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense. So, the body which exerts '''F''' will go backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's "Axioms or Laws of Motion" can be found in the "[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 19 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's three laws of motion were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model for understanding [[orbit]]ing bodies in [[outer space]]. This explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth.

Classical mechanics was further enhanced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. Special relativity is concerned with the motion of objects with a high [[velocity]], approaching the [[speed of light]]; general relativity is employed to handle [[gravitation]]al motion at a deeper level.

'''Uniform Motion:'''
{{Missing information|section|the information in the last sentence of this section '''does not provide sufficient and complete information'''|date=October 2017}}

When an object moves with a constant speed at a particular direction at regular intervals of time it's known as the ''uniform motion.'' For example: a bike moving in a straight line with a constant speed.

EQUATIONS OF UNIFORM MOTION:

If v = final velocity, u = initial velocity, a = acceleration, t = time, s = displacement, then :
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{a}\mathbf{t}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v}^2 = \mathbf{u}^2 + 2\mathbf{a}\mathbf{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}\mathbf{t} + \frac{\mathbf{a}\mathbf{t}^2}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
[[Quantum mechanics]] is a set of principles describing [[Physical systems|physical reality]] at the atomic level of matter ([[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s) and the [[subatomic particle]]s ([[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and even smaller [[elementary particle]]s such as [[quark]]s). These descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both [[matter]] and [[radiation]] energy as described in the [[wave–particle duality]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In classical mechanics, accurate [[measurement]]s and [[prediction]]s of the state of objects can be calculated, such as [[Absolute location|location]] and [[velocity]]. In the quantum mechanics, due to the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], the complete state of a subatomic particle, such as its location and velocity, cannot be simultaneously determined. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena, quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large-scale phenomenon such as [[superfluidity]], [[superconductivity]], and [[biological system]]s, including the function of [[Olfactory receptor|smell receptors]] and the [[protein structure|structures of proteins]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==List of "imperceptible" human motions==
Humans, like all known things in the universe, are in constant motion;&lt;ref name=Tyson/&gt;{{rp|8–9}} however, aside from obvious movements of the various external [[anatomy|body]] parts and [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to [[Motion perception|perceive]].  Many of these "imperceptible motions" are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation. The larger scales of imperceptible motions are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons: [[Newton's laws of motion]] (particularly the third) which prevents the feeling of motion on a mass to which the observer is connected, and the lack of an obvious [[frame of reference]] which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Safkan|first=Yasar|title=Question: If the term 'absolute motion' has no meaning, then why do we say that the earth moves around the sun and not vice versa?|url=http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae118.cfm|work=Ask the Experts|publisher=PhysLink.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller scales of these motions are too small to be detected conventionally with human [[sense]]s.

===Universe===
[[Spacetime]] (the fabric of the universe) is [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]] meaning everything in the [[universe]] is stretching like a [[rubber band]]. This motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such, but rather a change in the very nature of the universe. The primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by [[Edwin Hubble]] who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from Earth, known as [[Hubble's law]], predicted by a universal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hubble, Edwin, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30954 A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae]" (1929) ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 168–173 ([http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168 Full article], PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galaxy===
The [[Milky Way Galaxy]] is moving through [[space]] and many astronomers believe the velocity of this motion to be approximately {{convert|600|km/s|mph|sigfig=3}} relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies. Another reference frame is provided by the [[Cosmic microwave background]]. This frame of reference indicates that the Milky Way is moving at around {{convert|582|km/s|mph|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name="dipole"&gt;{{cite journal

===Internal body===
The human [[heart]] is constantly contracting to move [[blood]] throughout the body. Through larger veins and arteries in the body, blood has been found to travel at approximately 0.33&amp;nbsp;m/s. Though considerable variation exists, and peak flows in the [[venae cavae]] have been found between {{convert|0.1|and|0.45|m/s|ft/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wexler|first=L.|author2=D H Bergel |author3=I T Gabe |author4=G S Makin |author5=C J Mills |title=Velocity of Blood Flow in Normal Human Venae Cavae|journal=Circulation Research|date=1 September 1968|volume=23|issue=3|pages=349–359|doi=10.1161/01.RES.23.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; additionally, the [[smooth muscle]]s of hollow internal [[viscera|organs]] are moving. The most familiar would be the occurrence of [[peristalsis]] which is where digested [[food]] is forced throughout the [[digestive tract]].

===Cells===
The [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the [[human body]] have many structures which move throughout them. [[Cytoplasmic streaming]] is a way which cells move molecular substances throughout the [[cytoplasm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028448/cytoplasmic-streaming|title=cytoplasmic streaming - biology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[motor proteins]] work as [[molecular motors]] within a cell and move along the surface of various cellular substrates such as [[microtubules]], and motor proteins are typically powered by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and convert chemical energy into mechanical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/kinesin.htm|title=Microtubule Motors|work=rpi.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130175151/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/kinesin.htm|archivedate=2007-11-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vesicle (biology)|Vesicle]]s propelled by motor proteins have been found to have a velocity of approximately 0.00000152&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Particles===
According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], all [[Subatomic particle|particles]] of [[matter]] are in constant random motion as long as the [[temperature]] is above [[absolute zero]]. Thus the [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s which make up the human body are vibrating, colliding, and moving. This motion can be detected as temperature; higher temperatures, which represent greater [[kinetic energy]] in the particles, feel warm to humans who sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched to their nerves. Similarly, when lower temperature objects are touched, the senses perceive the transfer of heat away from the body as feeling cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html Temperature and BEC.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110174808/http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html |date=2007-11-10 }} Physics 2000: Colorado State University Physics Department&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subatomic particles===
Within each atom, [[electron]]s exist in an area around the nucleus.  This area is called the [[electron cloud]].  According to [[Bohr model|Bohr's model]] of the atom, electrons have a high [[Electron velocity|velocity]], and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move.  If electrons 'move' about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun, then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light.  However, there is no reason that one must confine one's self to this strict conceptualization, that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do.  Rather one can conceptualize electrons to be 'particles' that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/newton/askasci/1993/physics/PHY112.HTM|title=Classroom Resources - Argonne National Laboratory|work=anl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the [[atomic nucleus]], the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s are also probably moving around due to the electrical repulsion of the protons and the presence of [[angular momentum]] of both particles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/teachersguide/pdf/Chap02.pdf Chapter 2, Nuclear Science- A guide to the nuclear science wall chart.

==Light==
{{main|Speed of light}}
Light propagates at 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s, often approximated as {{convert|299792|km/s|mi/s}} in a vacuum. The speed of light (or ''c'') is also the speed of all [[massless particle]]s and associated [[field (physics)|field]]s in a vacuum, and it is the upper limit on the speed at which energy, matter, [[physical information|information]] or [[Causality (physics)|causation]] can travel; the speed of light is the limit of speed for all physical systems.

In addition, the speed of light is an invariant quantity: it has the same value, irrespective of the position or speed of the observer. This property makes the speed of light ''c'' a natural measurement unit for speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28141">The [[Azerbaijan]] is a country with very favorable natural conditions and rich natural resources. Snowy peaks, high mountains, foothill fertile soils, wide plains, Lowest Land Points Below Ocean Level are the main landscape forms of republic. This complex landscape structure has caused the variety in natural conditions - climate, soil-vegetation, and water resources. This, in turn, led to the uneven distribution of population and farms on the territory, and the specialization of production on different types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/32_folder/32_articles/32_minerals.html|title=The Natural Mineral Resources of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the natural resources are understood by all the natural components that people use in life and economic activities. Natural resources are divided into the following groups:

== Inexhaustible ==

Solar, geothermal, wind, nuclear energy, climate, water withdrawal and flood, sea currents.

== Exhaustible ==

===       Non-renewable ===

All minerals and hydrocarbons.

===        Renewable ===

Soil, biological resources, water energy.

== Mining resources in Azerbaijan ==
The richness of mining resources in Azerbaijan is related to the complexity of the geological structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/Nature/Geostructure/geostructure_02_e.html|title=MINERALS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of mining resources ===
Mining minerals in Azerbaijan are [[oil]], [[gas]], [[shale]], [[peat]], etc. The oil and gas industry are the most valuable among the other resources. Oil is extracted by means of both onshore and offshore ([[Caspian Sea]]) operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Azerbaijan-Oil-and-Gas|title=Azerbaijan - Oil and Gas|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaee.org/usaee2011/submissions/OnlineProceedings/Ciarreta_Nasirov-Article1.pdf|title=Analysis of Azerbaijan Oil and Gas Sector|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory of Republic (especially the Absheron peninsula) is one of the world's oldest oil producing regions. The extraction and distribution of oil from Absheron peninsula to other countries has started from VII-VI centuries of BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoilandgasyear.com/market/azerbaijan/|title=The oil and gas|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1.2 billion tons of oil (25% from offshore oilfields) has been produced in [[Azerbaijan]] until 1985. The oil produced in Azerbaijan territory is high quality, low-sulphuric and low-paraffin content. The density of oil changes in a large range (780–940&amp;nbsp;kg/m3). In [[Naftalan, Azerbaijan|Naftalan]], the extracted oil from the Maykop and Agjagil sediments is considered to be the only oil in the world to have healing properties.

The flammable gases produced in the country are hydrocarbons composed. They are in various forms such as soluble gas in oil, gas cap and pure gas fields. A lot of gas condensate fields have been explored and executed during the last 30–50 years. There are currently 8 producing oil and gas fields ([[Absheron gas field|Absheron]], [[Shamakhi District|Shamakhi]]-[[Gobustan District|Gobustan]], Ashaghi Kur, archipelago [[Baku]] , [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Yevlakh District|Yevlakh]]-[[Aghjabadi District|Aghjabadi]], [[Quba|Guba]]-Khazaryani, Kur-Gabirri rivers) and 2 prospective fields regions can be mentioned ([[Ajinohur|Acinohur]] and [[Cəlilabad|Jalilabad]]).

The main productive oil and gas producing layers are in [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron]], [[Shamakhi District|Shamakhi]]-[[Gobustan District|Gobustan]], Down-Kur and Baku archipelagi regions. The thickness of total layers consisting of sand, sandstone and mud reaches 4,000 meters (even more in some places).

Fields with productive layers ([[Balaxanı|Balakhani]]-[[Sabunçu raion|Sabunchu]]-Ramana, [[Suraxanı raion|Surakhani]]-[[Qaraçuxur|Garachukhur]]-[[Zıxır|Zykh]], Gala, [[Bibiheybət|Bibiheybat]], Neft Dashlari, Puta, May 28, Lokbatan-Binagadi, Sangachal-Deniz-Duvanny-Deniz-Bulla, Bulla-Deniz etc.) is horizontal and anticlinal structured. The largest oil and gas condensate fields are located in the [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron]], Baku archipelagi and the Lower Kuryani regions.

Many shale and coal manifestations have been discovered in the Maykop-Absheron old sediments in the Republic.

=== The Burning Mountain (Yanar dag) ===
''Main article:'' [[Yanar Dag|''Yanar dag'']]

The burning mountain is an unknown origin historical monument located in the [[Absheron Peninsula]], near [[Baku]], on the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the village of Mahammedi, occurred as a result of the released natural gas at the foot of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odditycentral.com/travel/yanar-dag-the-eternally-burning-mountain-of-azerbaijan.html|title=Yanar Dag – The Eternally Burning Mountain of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Yanar dag in Azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|Yanar dag in Azerbaijan]]
The location is 27&amp;nbsp;km away from the city center of [[Baku]], and about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from the village center, on the left side of the Mahammedi-Digah highway.

The flame in this area has been resulted from the burning of natural gas flowing to the surface from the underground oil and gas storing layers through cracks that was caused by volcanic-tectonic movements and processes. Sometimes, the height of flame reaches 10–15 meters.

By the Decree of the Azerbaijani President dated May 2, 2007, the territory of the "Burning Mountain" was declared to be state-cultural and nature preservation. The territory of this area is 64.55 hectares. This area includes the ‘’Gurd yuvasi’’, two cemeteries with age of thousand years and an ancient mosque, Gothursu fount, Ali Stone, Kardashi, Girmaki valley and [[Yanar Dag|Yanar dag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kataloq.gomap.az/en/poi/9361d17ad56611e0ad4900226424597d|title="Yanardagh" State historical-and-cultural Natural Reservation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081324/http://kataloq.gomap.az/en/poi/9361d17ad56611e0ad4900226424597d|archive-date=2017-12-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-mountain-yanar-dag|title=Yanar Dağ (Fire Mountain)-Mysterious hillside with a continuously burning natural fire.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metalliferous resources ===
These excavations ([[iron]], [[Aluminium|aluminum]], [[chromite]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[cobalt]], [[molybdenum]] [[ore]] etc.) brings different ore deposits in the mountainous parts of the republic.

[[Iron ore]]s ([[magnetite]], [[hematite]]) are found in four classes in [[Azerbaijan]]: segregation-magmatic, skarn-magnetite (contact-metasomatic), hydrothermal-metasomatic and sedimentation. Only [[Dashkasan District|Dashkasan]], South Dashkesen and İron  ore-bearing regions with skarn-magnetite are for commercial use as ore-deposits. These deposits are composed of Kellovey, Oxford, Kimeric aged volcanogenic, pyroclastic and sedimentary-volcanogenic rocks. Industry reserves of the [[Dashkasan District|Dashkasen]] iron ore group deposits are 250mln tons.

The significant industrial cobalt ores is placed in the Dashkasek ore region. The cobalt ores are formed both independently (with the Yukhari Dashkasan field) and together with skarn-magnetite ores.

The [[gold]] deposits and manifestations are mainly found in the territory of the [[Lesser Caucasus]]: Söyüdü, Qızılbulaq, Dağ Qəsəmən, Veynəli, Qoşa, Gədəbəy, Çovdar;  Shekerdere, Pyezbashi, Agyurt and Baskand deposits are spread in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The silver, copper, etc. mixtures are also can be found in these deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angloasianmining.com/home/|title=Gold and copper producer in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, numerous manifestations of gold have been discovered (Tulallar, Kepez, Dabalt, Kungutchay, Keleki, Unus and others). Evaluation of gold deposits in powder form from Alincachay and Kurekchay Basin was carried out, initial reserves were calculated and industrial significance was determined.

[[Chromite]] deposits and manifestations (Goydere, Kazimbinasi, Ipek, Khatavang etc.) are mainly located in Kalbajar and Lachin regions.

The small sized deposits and manifestations of manganese are known in the Somxeti-Agdam (Mollacelli, Dash Salahli, etc.) of the [[Lesser Caucasus|LesserCaucasus]], Vandam (Mugar, Balakenchay) and Araz (Bichanak, Alahi) of the [[Greater Caucasus]] structure-formation zones.

[[List of copper ores|Copper ore]] are [[Chalcopyrite|copper-pyrite]] and [[Porphyry copper deposit|copper-porphyry]] origin in [[Azerbaijan]]. The mineral content of copper-pyrite formations is mainly composed of pyrite and chalcopyrite. Copper-porphyry formations’ ores consist of molybdenum and small amount of noble metals.

There are many copper-porphyry formation’s ore in this region except [[Qaradağ raion|Garadagh]] and Xarxar deposits (Gedebey ore region). There are copper-porphyte in the Mehmana ore-bearing region (Demirli and Xançincay).

[[Porphyry copper deposit|Copper-porphyry]] ore-bearing in the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]], is mainly located on the Mehri-Ordubad granitoid batholite's exo and endocontact zones (Diakhchay, Goygol, Goydagh etc.). In addition, Halhal [[Chalcopyrite|copper-pyrite]], Goygol, Agridağ copper, Nashirvaz, Kilit-Katam copper-cobalt, Nergirvaz copper-polymetallic are known in this region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nakhchivan.preslib.az/en_a5.html|title=Nature and Natural resources: Geological structure and minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molybdenum]] field are found in Dalidagh (Teymuruchandagh, Baghırsag, etc.) and Ordubad ore regions (Paraghachay Diachchay).

The largest field of aluminum ore ([[alunite]]) is in the Dashkasan region (Zaylik alunit deposit). Alunite - bearing is also found in Shamkir and Ordubad. The Zaylik alunite deposit has been operated since 1960. This deposit is the largest one in the [[Europe]]. Aluminum oxide together with [[potassium fertilizer]], soda, sulfuric acid and so on. is extracted from this ore in Ganja aluminum plants.

Bauxite ore (Sadarak-Sharur districts) which is the best raw material of aluminum is found in areas where Permian deposit site are spread in the western part of the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mercuric ore deposits are widely spread in the central part of the [[Lesser Caucasus]] (Kalbajar-Lachin zone). Mercuric ore reserves contained within the largest ore deposits as Agh-Yatagh, Shor-Bulag, Levchay ([[Kalbajar District|Kalbajar]] region), Jilgaz-chay, and Narzanly (Lachin region) have been evaluated. Mercuric mineralization (Cinnebar) occurs at various age and composition rocks, most commonly Upper Cretaceous volcanic-sedimentary rocks and area where hyperbasites and Miocene-Pliocene aged acid magmatic rocks are spread. The pyrite, chalcopyrite, antimonite, magnetite, hematite, sphalerite and other minerals are in association with Kinovar ore. Kishlak ores are found in Badamli-Ashaghi of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan AR]].

The largest deposits of Arsenic in [[Azerbaijan]] are found in the [[Gadabay District|Gadabay]] (Bitibulag Enargit Field) and [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] (Dardagh auripigment-real bed) areas. This field was exploited until 1941. Arsenic ore body has a shtok-shape geometry.  The content of the ore consists of red [[orpiment]], [[realgar]], [[antimony]] and [[arsenopyrite]].

=== Non-metallic mining resources ===
Non-metallic mining resources-play an important role in the overall balance of crude mineral resources of [[Azerbaijan]]. This group includes rock-salt, [[gypsum]], [[anhydride]], [[bentonite]] clays, building materials, [[pyrite]], [[Baryte|barite]], semi-precious and colorful stones, [[dolomite]], Icelandic quarry and so on.

Rock-salt deposits are located in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] (Nehram, Düzdağ, Pusyan). The deposits are in the sandstone, clay and limestone sediments of Miocene. Balanced reserves of the Nehrame field are 73600min tons on the B + S1 category and 64200min on category S2. Reserves are estimated to be 2-2.5 billion tones. The industrial reserves of the Duzdag field are 94517 thousand tons on the A + B + S1 category and 37810 thousand tons on the S2 category.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gypsum]], [[anhydrite]] deposits are formed in homogenous way in the Chalky sediments of Yukhari Aghcakand and Manash villages of Goranboy region. They consist of separate stocks, with total inventory of 65-70 million tons. Industrial reserves of 120&amp;nbsp;km to the south-east of the city of [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] (Aras, Gypsum) and around the city of Ganja are 40632 thousand tons on the A + B + S1 category.

The field of [[Bentonite]] clay is identified in [[Gobustan District|Gobustan]], [[Goranboy (city)|Goranboy]], [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Sheki]], etc. The largest field was found in Gazakh region ([[Daş Salahlı|Dash Salahli]]). The field is mainly formed by the influence of hydrothermal product on the Santonian aged volcanism and its industrial reserves are 8,4553 tons.

There are lot of construction materials in the territory of Azerbaijan. Currently, the estimated commercial reserves of the sawn stone-block deposit on A + B + S1 category (Goyshtak, [[Qaradağ raion|Garadagh]], Guzdek, Stateyarlı, Dilagar, Shahbulag, [[Naftalan, Azerbaijan|Naftalan]], Mardakan, [[Daş Salahlı|Dash Salahli]], Zayam and others) is 295836 thousand tons, whereas covering stone deposit (Dashkasan, Shahtakhti, Gulabli, Musakoy, Söyglu and others) is 23951 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; thousand for the time being.

There are raw materials in the Garadagh field, which are suitable for cement production (Shakhga limestone, Garadagh clay, etc.). Many clay deposits for drilling, brick and ceramics are exploited. The limestone deposit with 8.3 thousand m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is determined which is suitable for the production of flysch and carbide in the territory of [[Siyəzən|Siyazan region]].

The volcanic ash-tuff is a zeolite raw material and the belonged field (Aydagh) is located in 7&amp;nbsp;km north-western of Tovuz. The average thickness of the volcanic ash and tuff in the Aydagh field is 25-30m. And it is among Santonian-Campanian carbonate deposits. Moreover, zeolites(clinoptilolites) mixed with 20-80% silica have been found within these tuffs. The average amount of zeolite on that deposit is 55%. Estimated potential reserve of Aidagh tuffs is 20 mln tons.

Semi-precious and precious minerals (gems) were reported to be associated with the Dashcasan and Ordubad skarn ore deposits (granite, garnet, amethyst) of Lesser Caucasus, as well as volcanic rocks with [[Gadabay District|Gadabay]] (tourmaline) and Khanlar regions (chalcedony, agate, heliotrop).

There are large-scale deposits of dolomite nearby Nehram village ([[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan AR]]) and Boyanata Mountain (Gobustan). Quartz sand for the glass production was found in Gobustan, [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron peninsula]] and [[Quba|Guba region]].

There are chemical paints in [[Daşkəsən|Dashkesen]], [[Shamakhi District|Shamakhi]], [[Kalbajar District|Kalbajar]] and Khanlar districts.

The mud with medical treatment properties is located in the [[Absheron Peninsula]], Masazir Lake, Gobustan and Lower Kura and in areas where mud volcanoes outbursts are pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2010/myb3-2010-aj.pdf|title=2010 Minerals Yearbook, Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2011/myb3-2011-aj.pdf|title=2011 Minerals Yearbook, Azerbaijan|last=The Mineral Industry of Azerbaijan|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Mud Volcanos ==
''Main article:'' [[Mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan|''Mud volcanos in Azerbaijan'']]
[[File:Gobustan mud volcanoes .jpg|thumb|Gobustan mud volcanoes]]
Azerbaijan is known as a unique and classic development zone of mud volcanoes on the Earth. The 344 of the 2000 widely known mud volcanoes on the Earth are located in the east of Azerbaijan and in the Caspian Sea boundary. Most of the mud volcanoes are spread over Baku and the Absheron Peninsula, and some of them have been formed as a natural monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-mud-volcano|title=Largest mud volcano|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902191649/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-mud-volcano|archive-date=2015-09-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mud volcanoes play an important role in placing exploration wells of oil and gas fields without extra surveying costs. Additionally, mud volcano clays are considered to be useful and important minerals. Also, volcanic mud is successfully used in the treatment of many diseases - nervous system, skin and bone joints. At the same time, volcanoes are important in terms of prediction of events such as seismic events and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mud-volcanoes-of-azerbaijan|title=Mud Volcanoes of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/azerbaijan/mud-volcanoes.html|title=Mud Volcanoes in Azerbaijan- Mysterious Phenomena Fascinate Scientists and Tourists|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2015/02/04/mud_volcanoes_in_gobustan_azerbaijan.html|title=The Gurgling Mud Volcanoes of Gobustan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton is named as "white gold" in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/32_folder/32_articles/32_agriculture.html|title=Azerbaijan's "White Gold" and Its Agricultural Resources|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Caucasus|Caucasus regions]], especially in [[Azerbaijan]], cotton is spread by means of countries of the Ancient East, mainly by [[Iran]]. The exporting of textile made of cotton from the cities such as [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]], [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], [[Beylagan (city)|Beylagan]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Shamkir District|Shamkir]] and others to abroad, as well as cotton fabrics exporting from Shamakhi to Russia in the 15th century can be highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/azerbaijan-2016/cotton-kings/focus|title=COTTON KINGS, Cotton industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton exports from Azerbaijan to [[Russia]] have been expanded from XVII century. In the 18th century, there were large cotton fields on the plains of Mil-Mughan and Shirvan. At the beginning of the 19th century the cotton industry was being developed in Guba and Baku. In the 1930s, [[Egypt]] and [[America]], as well as local Mazandaran and Iravan cotton varieties were being cultivated in [[Azerbaijan]].

After the Northern Azerbaijan was being joined to Russia, cotton production in Azerbaijan was developed especially since the end of the 19th century.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the cotton industry area was expanded in Azerbaijan due to Russian textile industry being down. In 1913 the cotton industry area was more than 100 thousand hectares, whereas the cotton production was 65 thousand tons.

There are five types of cotton in [[Azerbaijan]]:

• Ordinary cotton ([[Gossypium hirsutum]] L.) (medicine purposed)

• Gossipium Barbadenze ([[Gossypium barbadense]])

• [[Gossipium Triquspitatum]]

• Gossipium Arboreum ([[Gossypium arboreum]])

• Gossipium Herboseum ([[Gossypium herbaceum]])

== Water resources ==
{{Main|Bodies of water of Azerbaijan}}

=== Water reservoirs ===
There are 61 reservoirs (each of them has capacity of 1 mln m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) available in Azerbaijan. The total volume of water reservoirs is 21.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Water reservoirs are built on the riverbed as well as beyond it (in a distance from river). Most reservoirs are regulated according to seasons and used for irrigation purposes.

The largest Mingachevir reservoir of the republic started to be operated in 1953 and it is operated in a multi-year regime, the flow of the Kur River is completely regulated in its downstream and overfloods are prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Azerbaijan#ref481406|title=Relief, drainage, and soils|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivers ===
The river system of the Republic has more than 8350 rivers, 2 of them are the lengths of more than 500&amp;nbsp;km, the length of the 22 rivers are between 101–500&amp;nbsp;km, the length of the 324 rivers are between 11–100&amp;nbsp;km, and the length of majority rivers is less than 10&amp;nbsp;km.

The river system of the Republic consists of the Kur River and its branches, as well as rivers directed into the [[Caspian Sea]].

Kur River is the main water source and artery of Azerbaijan. The flowing path of river goes through [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The cumulative area of the river is 188,000 square km, which of 58,000 square km or 31% of the area belongs to Azerbaijan. After passing the Georgian border, the Kur river’s flowrate in the Girag Kasaman settlement is 270 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / s or 8.52&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Whereas, in the Kur-Salyan station the average perennial flowrate is 445 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / s or 14.04&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Araz River, the second largest river in the Republic and the right branch of the Kur River flow path starts from Turkey territory, as well as it is a border river between Turkey and Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan and Iran and Azerbaijan. The cumulative area of the Araz River is 102,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where the 18,740&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 18% of the river area belongs to Azerbaijan. Average annual flowrate of [[Aras (river)|Araz]] River through Novruzlu (Saatli) settlement is 121 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / s or 3.82&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The river system of the republic consists of three groups: transboundary, border and local rivers. The transboundary (flowing through two or several countries) rivers include Kur, Ganikh (Alazan), Gabrirri (Iori), Khrami, Arpachay and others. Border rivers (which are in border between two or more countries) include Araz, Samur, Bolgarchay and others. Local rivers are formed and flowing in the territory of the Republic.

The water collection area is supplied by 2 large rivers of the Republic (Kur and Araz), 12 medium rivers, and other small rivers. Only 4 of the local rivers (Pirsaat, Hekericay, Tertçay, and Kurekchay) can be considered as medium rivers.

The mountain rivers flowing from the southern slope of the [[Greater Caucasus]] (Balakanchay, Talacay, Kurmukchay, Kishchay, Turyanchay, Goychay, Girdimanchay, etc.) are the left branches of the Kur river, however, flowing from the north-eastern slope (Gusarchay, Gudyalchay, Garachay, Valvalachay, etc.) and the Gobustan rivers (Sumqayitchay, Pirsaat, etc.) are the rivers directed into the Caspian Sea. Moreover, the rivers flowing from the north-eastern slope of the [[Lesser Caucasus]] (Zeyamchay, Shamkirchay, Goshagachay, Ganjachay, Kurekchay etc.) flowing from the Karabakh Range (Khachinchay, Terterchay, Gargarchay, etc.) are the right branches of the Kur, however, flowing from the Zangazur Range (Nakhchivanchay, Alinjaychay, Gilanchay, etc.) and the rivers flowing from the south-western slope of the [[Lesser Caucasus]] (Hekerichay, Guruchay, Kondalanchay etc.) are the left branches of the Araz River.

Lankaran rivers (Vishonchay, Lankaranchay, Tengerchay, Astarachay and etc.) are the rivers directed into the Caspian Sea.

=== Lakes ===
[[File:Goy gol Azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|Goy gol Azerbaijan]]
Cumulative 450 lakes with a total area of 395&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were identified in [[Azerbaijan]], where 10 lakes have area over 10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The largest lake of the Republic is Sarısu lake, located in the Kur-Araz lowland (water area 65.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, volume of water is 59.1 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The highest mountainous lake in the Republic is Tufangol (area 0.01&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, volume 0.11 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) located in the basin of Damiraparanchay and at a height of 3277 m. One of the most attractive lakes of the Republic is the famous [[Lake Göygöl|Lake Goygol]]. The lake was formed in the middle stream of Aghsuchay after strong earthquake at 1139.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eco.gov.az/en/hid-chay-gol-suanbar.php|title=RIVERS, LAKES AND RESERVOIRS OF AZERBAIJAN REPUBLIC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702101035/http://www.eco.gov.az/en/hid-chay-gol-suanbar.php|archive-date=2014-07-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural Reserve ==
{{Main|State reserves of Azerbaijan}}

The [[Goy-Gol State Reserve|Goy-gol State Reserve]] which is the first protection area in Azerbaijan was established in 1925. The [[Ghizil-Agaj State Reserve|Gizilagac]] and Zagatala Reserves in 1929, and the Hirkan Reserve was established in 1936. So, four reserves have been functioning until 1958. The process of reserve establishments has actively continued from 1958 to 1990. Altiagac State Reserve was established in 1990. As well as [[Şahbuz|Shahbuz]] in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] in 2003, [[Eldar Pine State Reserve|Eldar Shamı]] in 2004, Mud Volcanoes group in [[Baku]] and [[Absheron Peninsula]] in 2007, and Korchay State Reserve in 2008. At the same time, the Reserve of [[Turian-Chay State Reserve|Turyanchay]], [[Pirgulu State Reserve|Pirgulu]], [[Ilisu State Reserve|Ilisu]], [[Gara-Yaz State Reserve|Gara-Yaz]], [[Ismailli State Reserve|Ismayilli]] in 2003 and [[Zagatala State Reserve]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in 2008 were being expanded.

Natural Reserves include fish resources of the [[Caspian Sea]], rivers, water reservoirs, mainly the various species of animals spread in the mountainous areas, reptiles in the plains (especially the Caucasian viper, which has a very valuable poison), many birds and so on.

[[Ukraine]] operates four [[nuclear power plants]] with 15 reactors located in [[Volhynia]] and [[South Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="UuneU22816"/&gt; 
The total installed nuclear power capacity is over 13 GWe,&lt;ref name="World Nuclear"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryDetails.aspx?current=UA|title = PRIS - Country Details: Ukraine|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking seventh in the world in 2016.&lt;ref name="UuneU22816"/&gt;

Ukraine relies to a large extent on [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. 
The largest [[nuclear power plant]] in Europe, the [[Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]], is located in Ukraine. 
In 2006, the government planned to build 11 new [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] by the year 2030, which would almost double the current amount of nuclear [[electricity|power capacity]].&lt;ref name="Nuclear UA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf46.html|title=Nuclear Power in Ukraine|accessdate=2007-12-22|publisher=World Nuclear Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ukraine's power sector is the twelfth-largest in the world in terms of installed capacity, with 54&amp;nbsp;gigawatts (GW).&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|title=Ukraine|accessdate=2007-12-22|work=[[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA)|publisher=US government|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015222346/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|archivedate=2009-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Renewable energy]] still plays a very modest role in electrical output; in 2005 energy production was met by the following sources: nuclear (47&amp;nbsp;percent), thermal (45&amp;nbsp;percent), [[hydroelectric]] and other (8&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref name="Nuclear UA"/&gt;

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] was a [[nuclear accident]] that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Ukraine]]. 
An explosion and fire released large quantities of [[radioactive contamination]] into the atmosphere, which spread over much of Western USSR and Europe. 
It is considered the worst [[nuclear power]] plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (the other being the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]).&lt;ref name="BBCWorse"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13048916 |title='&amp;#39;Fukushima: As Bad as Chernobyl?'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18&amp;nbsp;billion [[ruble]]s, crippling the Soviet economy.&lt;ref&gt;From interviews with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Hans Blix]] and [[Vassili Nesterenko]]. {{cite video |title=The Battle of Chernobyl |publisher=Discovery Channel}} Relevant video locations: 31:00, 1:10:00.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine used to receive its [[nuclear fuel]] exclusively from [[Russia]] by the Russian company [[TVEL]]. Since 2008 the country also gets nuclear fuel from [[Westinghouse Electric Company#Europe|Westinghouse]].&lt;ref name="Westinghouse and Ukraine’s Energoatom extend nuclear fuel contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://analysis.nuclearenergyinsider.com/supply-chain/westinghouse-and-ukraine%E2%80%99s-energoatom-extend-nuclear-fuel-contract|title=Westinghouse and Ukraine’s Energoatom extend nuclear fuel contract|accessdate=2014-04-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140423155039/http://analysis.nuclearenergyinsider.com/supply-chain/westinghouse-and-ukraine%E2%80%99s-energoatom-extend-nuclear-fuel-contract|archivedate=2014-04-23|df=}}&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.unian.info/economics/1166817-westinghouse-ceo-we-are-ready-to-put-our-fuel-in-all-of-ukraines-npps.html Westinghouse CEO: We are ready to put our fuel in all of Ukraine’s NPP], [[UNIAN]] (28 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Energoatom]] began a project to bring safety into line with international standards at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, with a target completion date of 2017. In 2015 the completion date was put back to 2020, due to financing delays.&lt;ref name=wnn-20150807&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Ukraine-aims-to-complete-safety-upgrade-program-in-2020-07081501.html |title=Ukraine aims to complete safety upgrade program in 2020 |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=7 August 2015 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 some government agencies made [[Corruption in Ukraine|corruption]] allegations against Energoatom, with concerns raised by Prime Minister [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]].&lt;ref name=wnn-20150812&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Energoatom-chief-recalls-highs-and-lows-of-first-half-year-12081501.html |title=Energoatom chief recalls highs and lows of first half-year |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=12 August 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Energoatom's assets and bank accounts were frozen by Ukrainian courts over allegedly unpaid debts; Energoatom appealed the decision, but the frozen finances led to contractual breaches.&lt;ref name=nei-20160607&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newscontinued-ukraine-russia-tensions-over-fuel-4915829 |title=Continued Ukraine-Russia tensions over fuel |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 its bank accounts were unfrozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/353272.html |title=Energoatom's accounts unblocked |newspaper=Interfax-Ukraine |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 400&amp;nbsp;ppb, fluorine is estimated to be the 24th most common element in the universe.  It is comparably rare for a light element (elements tend to be more common the lighter they are).  All of the elements from atomic number 6 (carbon) to atomic number 14 (silicon) are hundreds or thousands of times more common than fluorine except for 11 (sodium).  One science writer described fluorine as a "shack amongst mansions" in terms of abundance.&lt;ref name=Crosswell/&gt;  Fluorine is so rare because it is not a product of the usual nuclear fusion processes in stars.  And any [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|created]] fluorine within stars is rapidly eliminated through strong [[nuclear fusion]] reactions—either with hydrogen to form oxygen and helium, or with helium to make neon and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Crosswell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fXcdHyLUVnEC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=abundance+of+fluorine+in+the+universe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wOVaUviBPZW-4AODjYHwCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=fluorine&amp;f=false Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos: Hydrogen to Gallium]; Donald Clayton; pages 101-104&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of fluorine at all—outside of temporary existence in stars—is somewhat of a mystery because of the need to escape these fluorine-destroying reactions.&lt;ref name=Crosswell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milky Way"/&gt;

Three theoretical solutions to the mystery exist: In [[type II supernova]]e, atoms of neon could be hit by [[neutrino]]s during the explosion and converted to fluorine. In [[Wolf-Rayet stars]] (blue stars over 40 times heavier than the Sun), a strong solar wind could blow the fluorine out of the star before hydrogen or helium could destroy it. Finally, in [[asymptotic giant branch]] (a type of red giant) stars, fusion reactions occur in pulses and [[convection]] could lift fluorine out of the inner star. Only the red giant hypothesis has supporting evidence from observations.&lt;ref name=Crosswell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croswell|first1=Ken|title=Fluorine: An element–ary mystery| journal=Sky and Telescope| date = 2003|url=http://kencroswell.com/fluorine.html|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milky Way"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Renda|first1=A.|first2=Y.|display-authors=4|last2=Fenner|first3=B.K.|last3=Gibson|first4=A.I. |last4=Karakas|first5=J.C. |last5=Lattanzio|first6=S.|last6=Campbell|first7=A.|last7=Chieffi

In space, fluorine commonly combines with hydrogen to form hydrogen fluoride. (This compound has been suggested as a tracer to enable tracking reservoirs of hydrogen in the universe.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neufeld, David|author2=Bergin, Edwin|author3=Gerin, Maryvonne |date=2010|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|title=Tracing the Milky Way's hidden reservoirs of gas|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Tracing_the_Milky_Way_s_hidden_reservoirs_of_gas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to HF, monatomic fluorine has been observed in the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snow|first1=T.

==On Earth==

{{See also|List of countries by fluorite production}}

Fluorine is [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|the thirteenth most common]] element in Earth's crust, comprising between 600 and 700&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] of the crust by mass. Because of its reactivity, it is essentially only found in compounds.

===Commercial sources===

Three minerals exist that are industrially relevant sources of fluorine: [[fluorite]], [[fluorapatite]], and [[cryolite]].{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=4}}{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=795}}

====Fluorite====

Fluorite (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), also called fluorspar, is the main source of commercial fluorine. Fluorite is a colorful mineral associated with hydrothermal deposits. It is common and found worldwide. China supplies more than half of the world's demand and Mexico is the second-largest producer in the world

The United States produced most of the world's fluorite in the early 20th century, but its last mine, in Illinois, shut down in 1995.  Canada also exited production in the 1990s. The United Kingdom has declining fluorite mining and has been a net importer since the 1980s.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=795}}&lt;ref name="AcountF"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Villalba|first1 = Gara|last2 = Ayres|first2 = Robert U.|last3 = Schroder|first3 = Hans|title = Accounting for fluorine: production, use, and loss|journal= Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume = 11|pages = 85–101|date = 2008|doi =10.1162/jiec.2007.1075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historical fluorspar statistics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=T.D|title=Historical fluorspar statistics|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140/fluorspar.pdf||publisher=United States Geological Service|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK fluorspar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lusty|first=P.

====Fluorapatite====

Fluorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F) is mined along with other [[apatite]]s for its [[phosphate]] content and is used mostly for production of fertilizers. Most of the Earth's fluorine is bound in this mineral, but because the percentage within the mineral is low (3.5%), the fluorine is discarded as waste. Only in the United States is there significant recovery. There, the [[hexafluorosilicate]]s produced as byproducts are used to supply water fluoridation.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=795}}

====Cryolite====

Cryolite (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is the least abundant of the three major fluorine-containing minerals, but is a concentrated source of fluorine. It was formerly used directly in aluminium production. However, the main commercial mine, on the west coast of Greenland, closed in 1987.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=795}}

===Minor occurrences===

Several other minerals, such as the gemstone [[topaz]], contain fluoride. Fluoride is not significant in seawater or brines, unlike the other [[halide]]s, because the alkaline earth fluorides precipitate out of water.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=795}}  Commercially insignificant quantities of organofluorines have been observed in volcanic eruptions and in geothermal springs. Their ultimate origin (from biological sources or geological formation) is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gribble&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Gribble|first1 =Gordon W.|title =Naturally occurring organofluorines|volume =3N|pages =121–136|date =2002|doi =10.1007/10721878_5|journal= The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry|series =The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry|isbn =3-540-42064-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of small amounts of gaseous fluorine within crystals has been debated for many years. One form of fluorite, [[antozonite]], has a smell suggestive of fluorine when crushed. The mineral also has a dark black color, perhaps from free calcium (not bonded to fluoride). In 2012, a study reported detection of trace quantities (0.04% by weight) of diatomic fluorine in antozonite. It was suggested that radiation from small amounts of [[uranium]] within the crystals had caused the free fluorine [[Crystallographic defect|defects]].&lt;ref name="Elementar"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schmedt, Jörn|author2=Mangst, Martin|author3=Kraus, Florian|title=Elementares Fluor F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in der Natur – In-situ-Nachweis und Quantifizierung durch NMR-Spektroskopie|journal=Angewandte Chemie|date=2012|volume=124|issue=31|pages=7968–7971|doi= 10.1002/ange.201203515|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">The '''Park Connector Network''' (PCN) of [[Singapore]] is a network of walking/running/cycling paths that connects the various parks and other green spaces in Singapore. Both the parks and the PCN are managed by [[National Parks Board]] (NParks).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nparks.gov.sg/about-us/annual-reports/nparks-annual-report-archives National Parks Board Annual Report 2010/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the National Cycling Plan to promote cycling, the [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) is constructing networks of cycling paths within towns. These cycling paths connect with the PCN, enabling people to safely cycle both intra-town (e.g., from home to [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] station) and inter-town (longer distance cycling).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mot.gov.sg/About-MOT/Land-Transport/Cycling/ |title=Cycling |publisher=[[Ministry of Transport (Singapore)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The proposal to form a park connector network was approved in 1991 by The Garden City Action Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Linking People, Linking Nature: The Park Connector Network of Singapore, Lena Chan et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, The Kallang Park Connector became the first park connector to be implemented. Stretching over nine kilometres, the park connector links two regional parks: [[Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park|Bishan Park]] and [[Kallang Riverside Park]]. In December 2007, the Eastern Coastal Loop, a 42-kilometre loop, was completed, providing a link from [[East Coast Park]] to [[Changi Beach Park]]. By January 2012, 200 kilometres of the PCN has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mnd.gov.sg/Newsroom/NewsPage.aspx?ID=3259&amp;category=Parliamentary%20Q%20&amp;%20A&amp;year=2012&amp;RA1=&amp;RA2=&amp;RA3= Newsroom, Ministry of National Development]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, NParks has completed 300 kilometres of the PCN, along with the Central Urban Loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nparks.gov.sg/news/2015/9/community-gathers-to-celebrate-25-years-of-the-park-connector-network |title=Community gathers to celebrate 25 years of the Park Connector Network |date=20 September 2015 |publisher=[[National Parks Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rayleigh fractionation''' describes the evolution of a system with multiple phases in which one phase is continuously removed from the system through [[fractional distillation]]. It is used in particular to describe [[isotopic enrichment]] or depletion as material moves between reservoirs in an [[Equilibrium fractionation|equilibrium process]]. Rayleigh fractionation holds particular importance in [[hydrology]] and [[meteorology]] as a model for the [[isotopic enrichment|isotopic differentiation]] of [[meteoric water]] due to condensation.

== The Rayleigh equation ==

The original Rayleigh equation was derived by [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] for the case of fractional distillation of mixed liquids. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Carol|last2=Caldwell|first2=Eric A|editor1-last=Kendall|editor1-first=C|editor2-last=McDonell|editor2-first=J. J.|title=Fundamentals of Isotope Geochemistry in Isotope Tracers in Catchment Hydrology|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam|url=https://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/isopubs/itchch2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an [[Exponental relationships|exponential relation]] that describes the partitioning of isotopes between two reservoirs as one reservoir decreases in size. The equations can be used to describe an [[isotope fractionation]] process if: (1) material is continuously removed from a mixed system containing [[molecule]]s of two or more isotopic species (e.g., water with 18O and 16O, or sulfate with 34S and 32S), (2) the [[fractionation]] accompanying the removal process at any instance is described by the fractionation factor a, and (3) a does not change during the process. Under these conditions, the evolution of the isotopic composition in the residual (reactant) material is described by:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{R^0} = \left(\frac{X}{X^0} \right)^{a-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where R = ratio of the isotopes (e.g., 18O/16O) in the reactant, Rº = initial ratio, X = the concentration or amount of the more abundant (lighter) isotope (e.g.,16O), and Xº = initial concentration. Because the concentration of X &gt;&gt; Xh (heavier isotope concentration), X is approximately equal to the amount of original material in the phase. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;f = X/X^0&lt;/math&gt; = fraction of material remaining, then:

&lt;math&gt;R = R^0 f^{a-1}&lt;/math&gt;

For large changes in concentration, such as they occur during e.g. distillation of heavy water, these formula's need to be integrated over the distillation trajectory. For small changes such as occur during transport of [[Water vapor|water vapour]] through the [[atmosphere]], the differentiated equation will usually be sufficient.

The '''Regional African Satellite Communication Organization''' (RASCOM) will provide telecommunication services, direct TV broadcast services and Internet access in rural areas of Africa. Under an agreement with RASCOM, '''RascomStar-QAF''' (a private company registered in [[Mauritius]]) will implement RASCOM's first 14[[communications satellite]] project. This joint African project is expected to lower the continent's dependency on international satellite networks such as [[Intelsat]].

== RASCOM-QAF1 ==
RASCOM-QAF1 is the first satellite entirely dedicated to the African continent. [[Thales Alenia Space]] built the satellite in the [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], [[France]]. The company has delivered the satellite in-orbit, and will supply the ground infrastructure needed to operate it. The spacecraft is based on the [[Spacebus]] 4000B3 platform, with a payload of twelve Ku-band transponders and eight C-band transponders. It weighed about {{convert|3200|kg}} at launch. 

Launch aboard an [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5GS]] rocket took place on 2007-12-21.&lt;ref&gt;

A rescue occurred at [[Riesending cave]] between 8 June and 19 June 2014 in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], after a [[Speleology|speleologist]], who had been exploring the cave in a group of three, suffered a [[traumatic brain injury]] as a result of a [[rockfall]]. It became one of the largest [[cave rescue]]s in history, involving more than 700 people for eleven days and an estimated cost of close to one million [[euro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article145511801/Riesending-Rettung-kostete-knapp-eine-Million-Euro.html|title=Höhlenunglück: Riesending-Rettung kostete knapp eine Million Euro - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== Descending and accident ===
Around noon on 7 June 2014, speleologist and caver Johann Westhauser and two colleagues descended into the Riesending cave, the deepest and longest [[pit cave]] in Germany located in the south-eastern edge of the country on the border to [[Austria]]. It is known to be "technically challenging from the first metres on".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berchtesgadener-anzeiger.de/region+lokal/landkreis-berchtesgadener-land/marktschellenberg_artikel,-Dem-Riesending-auf-den-Grund-gegangen-_arid,137233.html|title=Dem »Riesending« auf den Grund gegangen - Gemeinde Marktschellenberg - Berchtesgadener Anzeiger|website=www.berchtesgadener-anzeiger.de|language=de|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 8 June, Westhauser was hit by rockfall around 1:30 am and suffered a brain trauma despite wearing a helmet. At this time, the team had already descended about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) down the cave. While one of the teammates stayed with Westhauser, the second person started his 10 hour ascent towards the entrance, as there is no radio or cell phone reception inside,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.planet-wissen.de/natur/forschung/hoehlenforschung/pwiechronikeinerhoehlenrettungderfalljohannwesthauser100.html|title=Höhlenforschung: Chronik der Höhlenrettung von Johann Westhauser|last=Wieland|first=Andrea|date=2017-06-02|access-date=2017-06-24|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; a distance of around 6&amp;nbsp;km (3.72 miles). After reaching daylight and making the urgent call, emergency procedures were initiated.

=== Rescue operations ===
[[File:Riesending-Verletztentransport.jpg|thumb|Transport of the stretcher]]
On the same evening, three groups of cave rescuers, eleven people in total, entered the cave to make their way towards Westhauser and the remaining teammate. A [[Through-the-earth mine communications|cave-link]] system was established to send and receive basic communication signals through solid rock, allowing the exchange of text messages between the cave entrance and the scene of the accident. Further mountain rescue teams from Germany and Austria reached the scene, supported by [[Bavarian State Police|State]]- and [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]] helicopters. On the evening of 11 June, a [[physician]] was able to reach the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/panorama/hoehlenforscher-erlitt-schaedel-hirn-trauma-1.18319827|title=Ein Arzt erreicht den Verletzten: Höhlenforscher erlitt Schädel-Hirn-Trauma|last=Lahrtz|first=Stephanie|date=2014-06-11|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|access-date=2017-06-24|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A minor traumatic brain injury was diagnosed and together with a second physician arriving later at night, it was decided that Westhauser was fit to be transported.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The paths within the cave had to be secured with additional [[fixed rope]]s, [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]] and footrests.  At peak times, up to 60 people were in the cave and 90% of all cave rescue equipment of the Bavarian mountain rescue ([[Bergwacht]]) had been fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ingenieur.de/Panorama/Am-Rande/Forscher-Westhauser-Riesending-Schachthoehle-gerettet|title=Forscher Westhauser ist aus der Riesending-Schachthöhle gerettet|work=ingenieur.de|access-date=2017-06-24|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Riesending-Verletztentransport-Heli.jpg|thumb|Rescued explorer Westhauser is being brought to a German Federal Police helicopter evacuating him to the trauma hospital in Murnau]]
The transport through the narrow passages and supplies for the large number of people inside and outside the cave was challenging.  The stretcher had been made shock proof to a certain extent. Luckily, Westhauser’s condition stabilized within the days of the rescue operation.  There were no engines or other machinery available, so all work had to be done by hand.  In vertical passages, the rescue staff used their own bodies as a counterweight to the stretcher.  On 19 June at 11:44 am, they reached the surface and exited the Riesending with the help of a manual [[winch]].  Westhauser was then transported to the trauma hospital in [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]] via helicopter.

=== Aftermath ===
The operation became well known to the general public for the large rescue effort and was called a "chapter of alpine rescue history",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/ungluecke/nach-forscher-unglueck-bayerns-innenminister-will-riesending-hoehle-schliessen-12997979.html|title=Nach Forscher-Unglück: Bayerns Innenminister will Riesending-Höhle schließen|last=Geiger|first=Stephanie|date=2014-06-19|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=2017-06-24|last2=Berlin|language=de-DE|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking eleven days by more than 700 members of a multinational group of cave rescuers, consisting of people from [[Italy]], Austria, Germany, [[Switzerland]], [[Croatia]] and others. In August, 2015 the interior ministry of Bavaria reported that the costs were estimated around 960,000 Euros, while the victim himself had been "taking responsibility for a substantial amount", although no bill was issued by the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/riesending-hoehle-rettung-von-westhauser-kostete-960-000-euro-a-1049360.html|title=Riesending-Drama: Rettung von Höhlenforscher kostete fast eine Million Euro - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Panorama|last=|first=|date=|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of June, the entrance to the cave was sealed by police to prevent further accidents by curious people and tourists. A special permit is now required and only issued to people with justified interest, physical suitability and professional qualification.

Researcher Westhauser was able to recover from his injuries and slowly started exploring caves again in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/hoehlenforscher-johann-westhauser-kehrt-zurueck-in-die-tiefe-1.3137272#redirectedFromLandingpage|title=Johann Westhauser kehrt zurück in die Tiefe|last=Eisenberger|first=Korbinian|date=2016-08-26|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2017-06-24|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Selandian''' is in the [[geologic timescale]] an [[age (geology)|age]] or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[Paleocene]]. It spans the time between {{ma|Selandian|and}} {{ma|Thanetian|Ma}}. It is preceded by the [[Danian]] and followed by the [[Thanetian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale International Commission on Stratigraphy 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Paleocene is subdivided in subepochs, in which the Selandian forms the "Middle Paleocene".

==Stratigraphic definition==
The Selandian was introduced in scientific literature by Alfred Rosenkrantz in 1924. It is named after the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Sjælland'').{{why?|date=August 2017}}

The base of the Selandian is close to the boundary between [[biozone]]s NP4 and NP5. It is slightly after the first appearances of many new species of the calcareous [[Plankton#Size groups|nanoplankton]] [[genus]] ''Fasciculithus'' (''F. ulii'', ''F. billii'', ''F. janii'', ''F. involutus'', ''F. tympaniformis'' and ''F. pileatus'') and close to the first appearance of calcareous nanoplankton species ''Neochiastozygus perfectus''. At the original [[type locality (geology)|type location]] in Denmark the base of the Selandian is an [[unconformity]]. The official [[GSSP]] was established in the [[Zumaia]] section (43° 18'N, 2° 16'W) at the beach of Itzurun in the [[Pais Vasco|Basque Country]],  northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Arenillas ''et al.'' (2008) or Bernaola ''et al.'' (2009) for a description of the Danian-Selandidan boundary&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GSSP Golden spike Itzurun, Zumaia, Basque Country (02).jpg|thumb|The [[GSSP]] marking the lower boundary of the Selandian at Itzurun, Spain]]
The top of the Selandian (the base of the Thanetian) is laid at the base of magnetic chronozone C26n.

The Selandian stage overlaps with the lower part of the [[Tiffanian]] [[North American Land Mammal Age]], the [[Peligran]], [[Tiupampan]] and lower [[Itaboraian]] [[South American Land Mammal Ages]] and part of the Nongshanian [[Asian Land Mammal Age]]. It is coeval with the lower part of the Wangerripian stage from the [[Australia]]n regional timescale.

The start of the Selandian represents a sharp depositional change in the [[North Sea]] Basin, where there is a shift to [[siliciclastic]] deposition due to the uplift and erosion of the [[Scotland]]-[[Shetland]] area after nearly 40 million years of [[calcium carbonate]] deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemmensen|first=Anne|last2=Thomsen|first2=Erik | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|title=Palaeoenvironmental changes across the Danian–Selandian boundary in the North Sea Basin |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=219 |issue=3-4 |pages=351–394 |doi= 10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change occurs at the same time as the onset of a [[foreland basin]] formation in [[Spitsbergen]] due to compression between [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones MT, Augland LE, Shephard GE, Burgess SD, Eliassen GT, Jochmann MM, Friis B, Jerram DA, Planke S, Svensen HH | title = Constraining shifts in North Atlantic plate motions during the Palaeocene by U-Pb dating of Svalbard tephra layers | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 6822 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28754976 | pmc = 5533774 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-06170-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a common tectonic cause that altered the relative motions of the [[Greenland Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. This plate reorganisation event is also manifest as a change in [[seafloor spreading]] direction in the [[Labrador Sea]] around this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Oakey GN, Chalmers JA  | date=2012 |title=A new model for the Paleogene motion of Greenland relative to North America: Plate reconstructions of the Davis Strait and Nares Strait regions between Canada and Greenland |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth | volume=117|issue=B10|pages=B10 |doi=10.1029/2011jb008942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna and Flora==
The fauna of the Selandian consisted of giant snakes (''[[Titanoboa]]''),&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;

The flora was composed of cacti, ferns, angiosperms, and palm trees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3521">The '''Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|subtropical coniferous forest]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]], found in the [[Sierra de la Laguna]] mountain range at the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], [[Mexico]].

It is found within [[Los Cabos Municipality]] and eastern [[La Paz Municipality, Baja California Sur|La Paz Municipality]] of southern [[Baja California Sur]] state.

==Setting==
The ecoregion encompasses an area of {{convert|1100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The pine-oak forests are found above {{convert|800|m|ft}} in elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Sierra de la Laguna dry forests]]. The pine-oak forests have a unique and diverse flora and fauna, including 694 plant species, of which approximately 85 are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]].

The higher elevation gives the ecoregion a subtropical to temperate climate, in contrast to the dry tropical climate of the lowlands. Rainfall is higher than the lower-elevation dry forests and deserts of the peninsula, averaging 760&amp;nbsp;mm annually. Rain falls mostly in the summer, with occasional winter rains.

==Flora==
{{See also category|Flora of Baja California Sur}}
The composition of the [[pine]]-[[oak]] forests varies with elevation; oak [[woodland]]s predominate from {{convert|800|-|1200|m|ft}} in  elevation, with oak-pine woodlands between {{convert|1200|-|1600|m|ft}} in elevation, transitioning to pine-oak forests above {{convert|1600|m|ft}} in elevation. [[Moss]]es and [[lichen]]s are abundant throughout.

The oak woodlands from {{convert|800|-|1200|m|ft}} in elevation are warmer and drier, with evergreen oaks predominant (principally ''[[Quercus devia]]''; ''[[Quercus arizonica]]'' and ''[[Quercus rugosa]]'' have a limited distribution), along with lower trees and shrubs such as ''[[Dodonaea viscosa]]'', ''[[Sideroxylon peninsulare]]'', and ''[[Buddleia]] crotonoides.''

Above {{convert|1200|m|ft}} in elevation, the oak woodlands transition to oak-pine forests. The only pine present is an endemic [[subspecies]] of [[Mexican Pinyon]], ''Pinus cembroides'' subsp. ''lagunae'', mixed with oaks, including ''[[Quercus devia]]'' and ''[[Quercus tuberculata]]'', and other broadleaf trees, including ''[[Arbutus|Arbutus peninsularis]]'' and ''[[Nolina|Nolina beldingi]]''. Lower trees and understory shrubs include ''[[Calliandra|Calliandra peninsularis]]'', ''[[Mimosa|Mimosa xanti]]'', ''[[Heterotoma (plant)|Heterotoma aurita]]'', ''[[Verbesina|Verbesina pustulata]]'' and ''[[Hypericum|Hypericum peninsulare]]''. Above {{convert|1600|m|ft}} in elevation, pine predominates, mixed with oaks, and with an understory of grasses (''[[Muhlenbergia]]'' spp. and ''[[Festuca]]'' spp.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9642">'''Stellar mass''' is a phrase that is used by [[astronomer]]s to describe the mass of a [[star]]. It is usually enumerated in terms of the Sun's mass as a proportion of a [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}). Hence, the bright star [[Sirius]] has around {{Solar mass|2.02|link=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Liebert2005" /&gt; A star's mass will vary over its lifetime as additional mass becomes accreted, such as from a companion star, or mass is ejected with the [[stellar wind]] or pulsational behavior.

==Properties==
Stars are sometimes grouped by mass based upon their evolutionary behavior as they approach the end of their nuclear fusion lifetimes.

''Very low mass stars'' with masses below 0.5 {{Solar mass|link=yes}} do not enter the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) but evolve directly into white dwarfs. (At least in theory; the lifetimes of such stars are long enough—longer than the age of the universe to date—that none has yet had time to evolve to this point and be observed.)

''Low mass stars'' with a mass below about 1.8–2.2 {{Solar mass}} (depending on composition) do enter the AGB, where they develop a degenerate helium core.

''Intermediate-mass stars'' undergo [[helium fusion]] and develop a degenerate [[Carbon-burning_process|carbon-oxygen]] core.

''Massive stars'' have a minimum mass of 7–10 {{Solar mass}}, but this may be as low as 5–6 {{Solar mass}}. These stars undergo [[Carbon burning process|carbon fusion]], with their lives ending in a core-collapse [[supernova]] explosion.&lt;ref name=kwok2000/&gt; [[Black hole]]s created as a result of a stellar collapse are termed [[stellar mass black hole]]s.

The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the [[absorption line]]s.&lt;ref name="new cosmos" /&gt;

==Range==
One of the most massive stars known is [[Eta Carinae]],&lt;ref name=smith1998/&gt; with {{Solar mass|100–150|link=yes}}; its lifespan is very short—only several million years at most. A study of the [[Arches cluster]] suggests that {{Solar mass|150}} is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.&lt;ref name=nasa20050303/&gt; The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the [[Eddington luminosity]] which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space. However, a star named [[R136a1]] in the RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 {{Solar mass}}, putting this limit into question.&lt;ref name=eso20100721/&gt; A study has determined that stars larger than 150 {{Solar mass}} in [[R136]] were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close [[binary star|binary systems]], providing a way to sidestep the 150 {{Solar mass}} limit.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/mystery-monster-stars-solved-monster-mash-161251348.html?_esi=1 "Mystery of the 'Monster Stars' Solved: It Was a Monster Mash"], Natalie Wolchover, 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 {{Solar mass}} or more,&lt;ref name=hsca20050922/&gt; due to the complete absence of elements heavier than [[lithium]] in their composition. This generation of supermassive, [[population III stars]] is long extinct, however, and currently only theoretical.

With a mass only 93&amp;nbsp;times that of [[Jupiter]] ({{Jupiter mass|link=yes}}), or .09 {{Solar mass}}, [[AB Doradus|AB Doradus C]], a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.&lt;ref name=eso20050101/&gt; For stars with similar metallicity to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have, and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 {{Jupiter mass}}.&lt;ref name=boss20010403/&gt;&lt;ref name="minimum"/&gt; When the metallicity is very low, however, a recent study of the faintest stars found that the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 {{Jupiter mass}}.&lt;ref name="minimum" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc20060818/&gt; Smaller bodies are called [[brown dwarf]]s, which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and [[gas giant]]s.

==Change==
In the present day, the Sun is losing mass from the emission of electromagnetic energy and by the ejection of matter with the [[solar wind]]. It is expelling about (2&amp;ndash;3){{e|-14}} {{Solar mass|link=yes}} per year.&lt;ref name=carroll_ostlie1995/&gt; The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the [[red giant]] stage, climbing to (7&amp;ndash;9){{e|−14}} {{Solar mass}} y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; when it reaches the [[tip of the red giant branch]]. This will rise to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass}} y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[asymptotic giant branch]], before peaking at a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; {{Solar mass}} y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the Sun generates a [[planetary nebula]]. By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate [[white dwarf]], it will have lost 46% of its starting mass.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The '''subparhelic circle''' is a rare [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], an [[optical phenomenon]] located below the [[horizon]].  It passes through both the [[subsun]], below the [[sun]], and the [[antisolar point]], opposite to the sun.  The subparhelic circle is the subhorizon counterpart to the [[parhelic circle]] located above the horizon.

Located on the subparhelic circle are several relatively rare optical phenomena: The [[subsun]], the [[subparhelion|subparhelia]], the [[120° subparhelion|120° subparhelia]], [[Liljequist subparhelion|Liljequist subparhelia]], the [[diffuse arc]]s, and the [[Parry antisolar arc]]s.&lt;ref name="atoptics-subhorizon"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Fargo Sundogs 2 18 09.jpg|thumb|250px|Very bright sun dogs in [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. Also visible are parts of the [[22° halo]] (the arcs passing through each sundog), a [[sun pillar]] (the vertical line) and the [[parhelic circle]] (the horizontal line).]]
&lt;!--[[File:Sun dog at Stonehenge.jpg|thumb|Left-hand sun dog at Stonehenge]]--&gt;

A '''sun dog''' (or '''sundog''') or '''mock sun''', formally called a '''parhelion'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?id=P5078500|title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry — parhelion|website=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (plural '''parhelia''') in [[meteorology]], is an [[atmospheric optics|atmospheric]] [[optical phenomenon]] that consists of a bright spot to one or both sides of the [[Sun]]. Two sun dogs often flank the Sun within a [[22° halo]].

The sun dog is a member of the family of [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], caused by the [[refraction]] of sunlight by [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere. Sun dogs typically appear as a pair of subtly colored patches of light, [[angular distance|around 22°]] to the left and right of the Sun, and at the same [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] above the horizon as the Sun. They can be seen anywhere in the world during any season, but are not always obvious or bright. Sun dogs are best seen and most conspicuous when the Sun is near the horizon.

==Formation and characteristics==
[[File:Solar halos and sundog, Salem, MA, Oct 27, 2012.JPG|thumb|left|Right-hand sun dog in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], Oct 27, 2012. Also visible are a [[Parry arc]], an [[upper tangent arc]], a 22° halo and part of the parhelic circle.]]

Sun dogs are commonly caused by the [[refraction]] and [[light scattering|scattering]] of light from plate-shaped [[hexagonal]] [[ice crystals]] either [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in high and cold [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cirrostratus cloud]]s, or drifting in freezing moist air at low levels as [[diamond dust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/diamonds.htm|title=Diamond dust|website=Atmospheric Optics|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crystals act as [[prism (optics)|prisms]], bending the light rays passing through them with a minimum deflection of 22°. As the crystals gently float downwards with their large hexagonal faces almost horizontal, sunlight is refracted horizontally, and sun dogs are seen to the left and right of the Sun. Larger plates wobble more, and thus produce taller sundogs.&lt;ref name="Sundog formation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/dogfm.htm | title = Sundog formation | website = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun dogs are red-colored at the side nearest the Sun; farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue.  The colors overlap considerably and are muted, never pure or saturated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/dogcol.htm|title=Sundog Colours|website=Atmospheric Optics|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors of the sun dog finally merge into the white of the [[parhelic circle]] (if the latter is visible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parcirc.htm|title=Parhelic Circle|website=Atmospheric Optics|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same plate-shaped ice crystals that cause sun dogs are also responsible for the colorful [[circumzenithal arc]], meaning that these two types of halo tend to co-occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/czaform.htm|title=Circumzenithal Arc|website=Atmospheric Optics|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is often missed by viewers, since it is located more or less directly overhead. Another halo variety often seen together with sun dogs is the [[22° halo]], which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the sun dogs, thus appearing to interconnect them. As the Sun rises higher, the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane, causing their angle of deviation to increase and the sun dogs to move farther from the 22° halo, while staying at the same elevation.&lt;ref name="atoptics-sunalt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/dogalt.htm | title = Sundogs &amp; Sun Altitude | website = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 16 May 2017 | first = L | last = Cowley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to predict the forms of sun dogs as would be seen on other planets and moons.   [[Mars]] might have sun dogs formed by both water-ice and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ice.  On the gas giant planets — [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]—other crystals form clouds of [[ammonia]], [[methane]], and other substances that can produce halos with four or more sun dogs.&lt;ref name="atoptics-other-worlds"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/oworld.htm | title = Other Worlds | website = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 16 May 2017 | first = L | last = Cowley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Doppelsonne Halo Echzell Hessen 12-08-2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Halo (optical phenomenon)|Halo]] with sun dogs in [[:en:Hesse|Hesse]], [[:en:Germany|Germany]] - August 12, 2012]]

== Terminology ==
A somewhat common misconception among the general public is to refer to any member of the ice [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] family as a "sun dog" (especially the [[22° halo]], being one of the most common varieties). However, sun dogs represent just one of many different types of halos. Moreover, the term ''sun dog'' (singular) specifically refers to either of the two bright spots to the left and right of the [[Sun]], each of them is a ''separate'' sun dog. Since they typically appear in pairs, it would thus be more accurate to use the plural ''sun dogs''. For referring to the atmospheric phenomenon in general, the term ''(ice crystal) halo(s)'' is more appropriate.

== Etymology ==
The exact etymology of ''sun dog'' largely remains a mystery. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states it as being "of obscure origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100542361|title=Sundog|publisher=''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Abram Palmer's 1882 book ''Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy'', sun-dogs are defined:

{{quote |The phenomena [sic] of false suns which sometimes attend or dog the true when seen through the mist (''parhelions''). In Norfolk a ''sun-dog'' is a light spot near the sun, and ''water-dogs'' are the light watery clouds; ''dog'' here is no doubt the same word as ''dag'', dew or mist as "a little ''dag'' of rain" (''Philolog. Soc. Trans.'' 1855, p. 80). {{abbr|Cf.|Compare}} Icel. {{lang|is|dogg}}, Dan. and Swed. {{lang|da|dug}} &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; Eng. "''dew''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX5BAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;ots=P57jb6Hjn5&amp;dq=etymology+sundog&amp;pg=PA379&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy |last=Palmer |first=Abram Smythe |date=1882 |publisher=G. Bell and Sons |accessdate=16 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(''Dog'' in English as a verb can mean "hunt, track, or follow",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Dog|accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; so ''Dog the true [sun]'' has meant ''track the true [sun]'' since the 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|dog|accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Alternatively, Jonas Persson suggested that out of [[Norse mythology]] and archaic names — {{lang-da|solhunde}} (sun dog), {{lang-no|solhund}} (sun dog), {{lang-sv|solvarg}} (sun wolf) — in the Scandinavian languages, constellations of [[sköll|two]] [[hati Hróðvitnisson|wolves]] hunting the Sun and the Moon, one after and one before, may be a possible origin for the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaliseducation.com/resources-norse.html|title=Norse Constellations|author=Persson, Jonas|publisher=Digitalis Education Solutions, Inc.|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Parhelion'' (plural ''parhelia'') comes from {{lang-grc|παρήλιον}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|parēlion}}, 'beside the sun'; from {{lang|grc|παρά}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|para}}, 'beside') and {{lang|grc|ἥλιος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|helios}}, 'sun')).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/parhelion |title=Parhelion |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=16 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Anglo-Cornish]] dialect of [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]], sun dogs are known as ''weather dogs'' (described as "a short segment of a rainbow seen on the horizon, foreshowing foul weather"). It is also known as ''a lagas in the sky'' which comes from the [[Cornish language]] term for the sun dog {{lang|kw|lagas awel}} meaning 'weather's eye' ({{lang|kw|lagas}}, 'eye' and {{lang|kw|awel}}, 'weather/wind'). This is in turn related to the Anglo-Cornish term ''cock's eye'' for a halo round the sun or the moon, also a [[sign|portent]] of bad weather.&lt;ref name="Nance - Cornish Sea-Words"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nance |first1=Robert Morton |last2=Pool |first2=P. A. S. |title=A Glossary of Cornish Sea-Words |date=1963 |publisher=Federation of Old Cornwall Societies |pages=61, 104,  155, 172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Sun Dogs (CCIIIv).jpg|thumb|Sun dog phenomenon depicted in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]

===Greece===
[[Aristotle]] (Meteorology III.2, 372a14) notes that "two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it all through the day until sunset." He says that "mock suns" are always to the side, never above or below, most commonly at sunrise or sunset, more rarely in the middle of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.3.iii.html#98|title=Meteorology by Aristotle – Part 2|website=The Internet Classics Archive|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Aratus]] (Phaenomena 880–891) mentions parhelia as part of his catalogue of Weather Signs; according to him, they can indicate rain, wind, or an approaching storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/AratusPhaenomena.html|title=Aratus, Phaenomena|website=Theoi Classical Texts Library|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artemidorus]] in his ''Oneirocritica'' ('On the Interpretation of Dreams') included the mock suns amongst a list of celestial deities.&lt;ref&gt;p. 125 Artemidorus – The Interpretation Of Dreams Oneirocritica by Artemidorus Translation and Commentary by Robert J. White c. 1975 1990 Origingal Books, Inc. 2nd Edition   {{ISBN|0-944558-03-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
A passage in [[Cicero]]'s  ''[[De re publica|On the Republic]]'' (54–51 BC) is one of many by Greek and Roman authors who refer to sun dogs and similar phenomena:

{{quote |Be it so, said Tubero; and since you invite me to discussion, and present the opportunity, let us first examine, before any one else arrives, what can be the nature of the parhelion, or double sun, which was mentioned in the senate. Those that affirm they witnessed this prodigy are neither few nor unworthy of credit, so that there is more reason for investigation than incredulity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14988/14988-h/14988-h.htm#FNA-296 | title = On the Commonwealth, Book 1 | author = Cicero | author-link = Cicero | pages = (260), 367, (369) | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | translator=  CD Yonge| date = 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] makes an incidental reference to sun dogs in the first book of his ''[[Naturales Quaestiones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, Ricerche sulla Natura, P. Parroni editor, Mondadori, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd century Roman writer and philosopher [[Apuleius]] in his ''Apologia'' XV says "What is the cause of the prismatic colours of the rainbow, or of the appearance in heaven of two rival images of the sun, with sundry other phenomena treated in a monumental volume by [[Archimedes]] of Syracuse."{{Citation needed|reason=no reference given, is this original research?|date=January 2015}}

The prelude to the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]] in [[Herefordshire]], [[England]] in 1461 is supposed to have involved the appearance of a halo display with three "suns". The [[House of York|Yorkist]] commander, later [[Edward IV of England]], convinced his initially frightened troops that it represented the three sons of the Duke of York, and Edward's troops won a decisive victory. The event was dramatized by [[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[Henry VI, Part 3|King Henry VI, Part 3]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.decodedscience.org/the-mortimers-cross-parhelion-how-a-meteorological-phenomenon-changed-english-history/3437|title=The Mortimer’s Cross Parhelion: How a Meteorological Phenomenon Changed English History|date=2 October 2011|first=Jennifer|last=Young|website=Decoded Science|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Sharon Kay Penman]] in ''[[The Sunne In Splendour]]''.

===Jakob Hutter===
Possibly the earliest clear description of sun dogs is by [[Jacob Hutter]], who wrote in his ''Brotherly Faithfulness: Epistles from a Time of Persecution'':

{{quote |My beloved children, I want to tell you that on the day after the departure of our brothers Kuntz and Michel, on a Friday, we saw three suns in the sky for a good long time, about an hour, as well as two rainbows. These had their backs turned toward each other, almost touching in the middle, and their ends pointed away from each other. And this I, Jakob, saw with my own eyes, and many brothers and sisters saw it with me. After a while the two suns and rainbows disappeared, and only the one sun remained. Even though the other two suns were not as bright as the one, they were clearly visible. I feel this was no small miracle…&lt;ref name="Hutter"&gt;{{cite book | first=Jakob | last=Hutter | author-link = Jakob Hutter | title = Brotherly Faithfulness: Epistles from a Time of Persecution | pages = 20–21 | date = 1979 | publisher = Plough Publishing | location = Rifton, NY | isbn = 0-87486-191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The observation most likely occurred in [[Hustopeče|Auspitz (Hustopeče)]], [[Moravia]] on 31 October 1533. The original was written in German and is from a letter originally sent in November 1533 from Auspitz in Moravia to the [[Adige Valley]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. The Kuntz Maurer and Michel Schuster mentioned in the letter left Hutter on the Thursday after the feast day of [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]] and [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], which is 28 October.  The Thursday after was 30 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Schaaf | first = Fred | page = 94 | date = November–December 1997 | title = [[Sky &amp; Telescope]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the "two rainbows with their backs turned toward each other, almost touching" involved two further halo phenomena, possibly a [[circumzenithal arc]] (prone to co-occur with sun dogs) together with a partial [[46° halo]] or [[supralateral arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz463.htm|title=Look for the rare one|website=Atmospheric Optics|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vädersolstavlan===
[[File:Vädersoltavlan cropped.JPG|thumb|The so-called "Sun Dog Painting" (''Vädersolstavlan'') depicting [[Stockholm]] in 1535 and the celestial phenomenon at the time interpreted as an ominous presage]]
While mostly known and often quoted for being the oldest color depiction of the city of [[Stockholm]], ''[[Vädersolstavlan]]'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]; "The Sundog Painting", literally "The Weather Sun Painting") is arguably{{Citation needed|reason=no reference given, is this original research?|date=January 2015}} also one of the oldest known depictions of a halo display, including a pair of sun dogs. For two hours in the morning of 20 April 1535, the skies over the city were filled with white circles and arcs crossing the sky, while additional suns (i.e., sun dogs) appeared around the sun. The phenomenon quickly resulted in rumours of an [[omen]] of God's forthcoming revenge on King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] (1496–1560) for having introduced [[Protestantism]] during the 1520s and for being heavy-handed with his enemies allied with the Danish king.{{Citation needed|reason=no reference given, is this original research?|date=January 2015}}

Hoping to end speculations, the Chancellor and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] scholar [[Olaus Petri]] (1493–1552) ordered a painting to be produced documenting the event. When confronted with the painting, the king, however, interpreted it as a conspiracy – the real sun of course being himself threatened by competing fake suns, one being Olaus Petri and the other the clergyman and scholar [[Laurentius Andreae]] (1470–1552), both thus accused of treachery, but eventually escaping capital punishment. The original painting is lost, but a copy from the 1630s survives and can still be seen in the church [[Storkyrkan]] in central Stockholm.

===Rome, 1629 and 1630===
A series of complex parhelia displays in Rome in 1629, and again in 1630, were described by [[Christoph Scheiner]] in his book ''Parhelia'', one of the earliest works on the subject. It had a profound effect, causing [[René Descartes]] to interrupt his metaphysical studies and led to his work of natural philosophy called ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/#MetTurComPhyDis René Descartes - Metaphysical turn], Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danzig 1661===

A '''tornado''' is a rapidly rotating column of [[air]] that is in contact with both the surface of the [[Earth]] and a [[cumulonimbus cloud]] or, in rare cases, the base of a [[cumulus cloud]]. The windstorm is often referred to as a '''twister''', '''[[whirlwind]]''' or '''[[cyclone]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyclone |title=merriam-webster.com |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the word [[cyclone]] is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a [[Low-pressure area|low-pressure]] area in the center around which winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Oceanography|last=Garrison|first=Tom|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8400-6155-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of a [[funnel cloud|condensation funnel]] originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating [[debris]] and [[dust]] beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than {{convert|110|mph|km/h|sigfig=2}}, are about {{convert|250|ft|-1}} across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The [[Tornado records#Highest winds observed in a tornado|most extreme]] tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than {{convert|300|mph|km/h|sigfig=2}}, are more than {{convert|2|mi|km|0|spell=in}} in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="fastest wind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm|title=Doppler On Wheels |accessdate=2009-12-13 |author=Wurman, Joshua |publisher=Center for Severe Weather Research |date=2008-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205124033/http://www.cswr.org/dow/dow.htm |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="widest tornado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax/archive/hallam/hallam.php|title=Hallam Nebraska Tornado|accessdate=2009-11-15|work=[[National Weather Service]]| publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2005-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|accessdate=2006-09-08|author=Roger Edwards|authorlink=Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|date=2006-04-04|work=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929185156/http://www.spc.ncep.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/|archivedate=2006-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of tornadoes include the [[multiple vortex tornado]], [[landspout]] and [[waterspout]]. Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-[[supercell]]ular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the [[equator]], and are less common at [[high latitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/15Jan2009/overview.shtml|title=15 January 2009: Lake Champlain Sea Smoke, Steam Devils, and Waterspout: Chapters IV and V|author=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-06-21|authorlink=National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the [[gustnado]], [[dust devil]], [[fire whirl]]s, and [[steam devil]].

Tornadoes occur in North America, particularly in the area of the [[United States]] known as [[tornado alley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|title=Tornado Alley, USA: Science News Online, May 11, 2002|author=|date=25 August 2006|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825011156/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|archivedate=25 August 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in northern and east-central South America, [[Southern Africa]], northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="EB tornado climatology"/&gt; Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of [[Pulse-Doppler radar]] by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as [[hook echo]]es or [[debris ball]]s, as well as through the efforts of [[storm spotter]]s.

There are several scales for rating the strength of tornadoes. The [[Fujita scale]] rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large [[skyscraper]]s. The similar [[TORRO scale]] ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/ECSS_Slide_Show/2004%20SPAIN%20ECSS%20Post-FINAL%20slide%20show.html |title=Wind Scales: Beaufort, T&amp;nbsp; – Scale, and Fujita's Scale |author=Meaden, Terrance |publisher=Tornado and Storm Research Organisation |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430211910/http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/ECSS_Slide_Show/2004%20SPAIN%20ECSS%20Post-FINAL%20slide%20show.html |archivedate=2010-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doppler [[weather radar|radar]] data, [[photogrammetry]], and ground swirl patterns ([[trochoid]]al marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.&lt;ref name="EF SPC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced F Scale for Tornado Damage|work=Storm Prediction Center|date=2007-02-01|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/ef-scale.html|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Roger et al.

==Etymology==
The word ''tornado'' comes from the Spanish word tornado (past participle of to turn, or to have torn)&lt;ref name="etymology 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tornado|title=Online Etymology Dictionary| accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Douglas Harper|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etymology 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary| accessdate=2009-12-13|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tornado|author=Frederick C Mish|edition=10th|year=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-87779-709-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Tornadoes opposite phenomena are the [[derecho]]es ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|tʃ|oʊ}}, from {{lang-es|derecho}} {{IPA-es|deˈɾetʃo|}}, "straight"). A tornado is also commonly referred to as a "twister", and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term ''cyclone''.&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nssl faq"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_faq.shtml| title =Frequently Asked Questions about Tornadoes | date =2009-07-20| publisher =National Severe Storms Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cyclone" is used as a synonym for "tornado" in the often-aired 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The term "twister" is also used in that film, along with being the title of the 1996 tornado-related film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''.

==Definitions==
A tornado is "a violently rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a [[cumuliform cloud]] or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud".&lt;ref name="Glossary of Meteorology"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/index.php?title=Special:AllPages/T|title=Section:T|author=Glossary of Meteorology|edition=2|accessdate=2009-11-15|publisher=American Meteorological Society|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base. Scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word; for example, there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt; ''Tornado'' refers to the [[vortex]] of wind, not the condensation cloud.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tornado?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles A Doswell III|url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~doswell/a_tornado/atornado.html|title=What is a tornado?|accessdate=2008-05-28|publisher=Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies|date=2001-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funnel cloud===
{{Main|Funnel cloud}}
[[File:Tornado with no funnel.jpg|thumb|left|This tornado has no funnel cloud; however, the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface, and thus it is a true tornado.]]
A tornado is not necessarily visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by [[Bernoulli's principle]]) and rapid rotation (due to [[cyclostrophic balance]]) usually cause [[water vapor]] in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to [[adiabatic cooling]]. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.&lt;ref name="Renno"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nilton O. Renno|title=A thermodynamically general theory for convective vortices|journal=[[Tellus A]] |volume=60|issue=4|pages=688–99|date=2008-07-03|url=http://vortexengine.ca/misc/Renno_2008.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0870.2008.00331.x|accessdate=2009-12-12|bibcode = 2008TellA..60..688R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the ''Glossary of Meteorology'', a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/index.php?title=Special:AllPages/F|title=Funnel cloud|author=Glossary of Meteorology|edition=2|accessdate=2009-02-25|date=2000-06-30|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;

Tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface, and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;

===Outbreaks and families===
{{Main|Tornado family|tornado outbreak|tornado outbreak sequence}}
Occasionally, a single storm will produce more than one tornado, either simultaneously or in succession. Multiple tornadoes produced by the same [[storm cell]] are referred to as a "tornado family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php#t|title=A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather Terms for Storm Spotters|accessdate=2007-02-27|author=Michael Branick|year=2006|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803230231/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php#t |archivedate=2003-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system. If there is no break in activity, this is considered a tornado outbreak (although the term "tornado outbreak" has various definitions). A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a tornado outbreak sequence, occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak.&lt;ref name="Glossary of Meteorology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/81933.pdf|title=Tornado Outbreak Day Sequences: Historic Events and Climatology (1875–2003)|accessdate=2007-03-20|author1=Russell S Schneider |author2=Harold E. Brooks |author3=Joseph T. Schaefer  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Size and shape===
[[File:Binger Oklahoma Tornado.jpg|thumb|right|A wedge tornado, nearly a mile wide, which hit [[May 1981 tornado outbreak|Binger, Oklahoma in 1981]]]]
Most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow [[funnel]], a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"/&gt; Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.

Small, relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground. Although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground, if associated surface winds are greater than {{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the circulation is considered a tornado.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt; A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a "stovepipe" tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]] stuck into the ground, and so are known as "wedge tornadoes" or "wedges". The "stovepipe" classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.&lt;ref name="wedge tornado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/binger.htm|title=Wedge Tornado|author=Roger Edwards|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2008-07-18|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roping tornado.jpg|thumb|left|A rope tornado in its dissipating stage, [[Tecumseh, Oklahoma]].]]Tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes, and often curl or twist into complex shapes. These tornadoes are said to be "roping out", or becoming a "rope tornado". When they rope out, the length of their funnel increases, which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to [[conservation of angular momentum]].&lt;ref name="thebible"&gt;{{cite journal|pages=57–58|journal=Bible of Weather Forecasting|volume=1|issue=4|title=27.0.0 General Laws Influencing the Creation of Bands of Strong Bands|author=Singer, Oscar|date=May–July 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center, or they may be completely obscured by condensation, dust, and debris, appearing to be a single funnel.&lt;ref name="rope tornado"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/el_reno.htm|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2008-07-18|title=Rope Tornado|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Roger Edwards|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, tornadoes are around {{convert|500|ft|m}} across on average and travel on the ground for {{convert|5|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"/&gt; However, there is a wide range of tornado sizes. Weak tornadoes, or strong yet dissipating tornadoes, can be exceedingly narrow, sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across. One tornado was reported to have a damage path only {{convert|7|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"/&gt; On the other end of the spectrum, wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide or more. A [[May 2004 tornado outbreak sequence|tornado that affected Hallam, Nebraska]] on May 22, 2004, was up to {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} wide at the ground, and [[2013 El Reno tornado|a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma]] on May 31, 2013 was approximately {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} wide, the widest on record.&lt;ref name="widest tornado" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 31–June 1, 2013 Tornado and Flash Flood Event: The May 31, 2013 El Reno, OK Tornado|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=events-20130531-elreno|date=July 28, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2014|work=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|location=Norman, Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of path length, the [[Tri-State Tornado]], which affected parts of [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]] on March 18, 1925, was on the ground continuously for {{convert|219|mi|km}}. Many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of {{convert|100|mi|km}} or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession; however, there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the Tri-State Tornado.&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas P Grazulis|title=Significant Tornadoes 1680–1991|date=July 1993|publisher=The Tornado Project of Environmental Films|location=St. Johnsbury, VT|isbn=978-1-879362-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun {{convert|15|mi|km}} further west than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/ams/AMS%20VP/Storm%20Conference/NESC%20Presentations/32ndNESC_Presentation/Banquet/Doswell.ppt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614014358/http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/ams/AMS%20VP/Storm%20Conference/NESC%20Presentations/32ndNESC_Presentation/Banquet/Doswell.ppt|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-14|title=The Tri-State Tornado of 18 March 1925 |publisher=Reanalysis Project|accessdate=2007-04-07|author1=Charles A|author2=III Doswell |format=Powerpoint Presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance===
Tornadoes can have a wide range of colors, depending on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the [[Great Plains]] can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"/&gt;

[[File:Waurika Oklahoma Tornado Back and Front.jpg|thumb|right|Photographs of the [[Waurika, Oklahoma]] tornado of May 30, 1976, taken at nearly the same time by two photographers. In the top picture, the tornado is lit with the sunlight focused from behind the [[camera]], thus the funnel appears bluish. In the lower image, where the camera is facing the opposite direction, the sun is behind the tornado, giving it a dark appearance.&lt;ref name="PD tornado images"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/torscans.htm|title=Public Domain Tornado Images|work=[[National Weather Service]]|accessdate=2009-11-17|year=2009|author=Roger Edwards|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado. A tornado which is "[[Backlighting (lighting design)|back-lit]]" (viewed with the sun behind it) appears very dark. The same tornado, viewed with the sun at the observer's back, may appear gray or brilliant white. Tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors, appearing in hues of yellow, orange, and pink.&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Marshall |url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/tttttttt.htm |title=The Tornado Project's Terrific, Timeless and Sometimes Trivial Truths about Those Terrifying Twirling Twisters! |accessdate=2008-11-09 |publisher=The Tornado Project |date=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016163615/http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/tttttttt.htm |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="target tornado"&gt;{{cite video|people=Linda Mercer Lloyd|date=1996|title=Target: Tornado|medium=Videotape|publisher=The Weather Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only [[weather radar]] observations, or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's ''updraft base'', which is rain-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/stormspotting/basics.php |work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|title=The Basics of Storm Spotting|date=2009-01-15|accessdate=2009-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031011045434/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/stormspotting/basics.php |archivedate = 2003-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Peterson | first1 = Franklynn | last2 =Kwsselman | first2 = Judi R | title =Tornado factory – giant simulator probes killer twisters | journal = Popular Science | volume =213 | issue =1 | pages = 76–78 | date = July 1978| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds.&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt; Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.

There is mounting evidence, including [[Doppler on Wheels]] mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, akin to the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of [[tropical cyclone]]s.

===Rotation===
Tornadoes normally rotate [[cyclone|cyclonically]] (when viewed from above, this is counterclockwise in the [[northern hemisphere]] and clockwise in the [[southern hemisphere|southern]]). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the [[Coriolis effect]], thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large [[Rossby number]]s. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected.&lt;ref name="Origin of Updraft Rotation in Supercells"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert Davies-Jones|authorlink=Robert Davies-Jones|title=Streamwise Vorticity: The Origin of Updraft Rotation in Supercell Storms|journal=J.

Approximately 1&amp;nbsp;percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending [[rear flank downdraft]] (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell.&lt;ref name="Recent Example of an anticyclonic tornado in El Reno, OK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_9262.html |title=anticyclonic tornado in El Reno, OK |publisher=The Weather Channel |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2006-12-30 |author=Greg Forbes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011194725/http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_9262.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On rare occasions, [[anticyclonic tornado]]es form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.&lt;ref name="Sunnyvale Tornado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/StormChasing/Cases/Sunnyvale/Sunnyvale.html|title=Sunnyvale and Los Altos, CA Tornadoes 1998-05-04|accessdate=2006-10-20|author=John Monteverdi|date=2003-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound and seismology===
[[File:Tornado infrasound sources.png|thumb|left|An illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the [[Earth System Research Laboratory]]'s Infrasound Program]]
Tornadoes emit widely on the [[acoustics]] [[Audio frequency|spectrum]] and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.

The winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of "noise".&lt;ref name="tornado music"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abdul Abdullah|title=The "Musical" Sound Emitted by a Tornado"|journal=Mon. Wea. Rev.|volume=94|issue=4|pages=213–20|date=April 1966|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1966)094&lt;0213:TMSEBA&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode=1966MWRv...94..213A|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/094/mwr-094-04-0213.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921230829/https://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/094/mwr-094-04-0213.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-21|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.3099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many tornadoes are audible only when very near, sound is not to be thought of as a reliable warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.&lt;ref name="sound obs"&gt;{{cite journal|author=David K. Hoadley |title=Tornado Sound Experiences |journal=[[Storm Track]] |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=5–9 |date=1983-03-31 |url=http://www.stormtrack.org/archive/0636.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619210634/http://www.stormtrack.org/archive/0636.htm |archivedate=2012-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible [[infrasonic]] signatures.&lt;ref name="tornado infrasonics"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. J. Bedard|title=Low-Frequency Atmospheric Acoustic Energy Associated with Vortices Produced by Thunderstorms|journal=Mon. Wea. Rev.|volume=133|issue=1|pages=241–63|date=January 2005|doi=10.1175/MWR-2851.1|bibcode = 2005MWRv..133..241B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike audible signatures, tornadic signatures have been isolated; due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound, efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology, dynamics, and creation.&lt;ref name="field programs history"/&gt; Tornadoes also produce a detectable [[seismic]] signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.&lt;ref name="tornado seismic signal"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frank Tatom |author2=Kevin R.

===Electromagnetic, lightning, and other effects===
Tornadoes emit on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with [[sferics]] and [[E-field]] effects detected.&lt;ref name="field programs history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John R Leeman, E.D.

Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges.&lt;ref name="CG tor"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Antony H Perez |author2=Louis J.

[[Luminosity]] has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and [[power flash]]es from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]]. For example, on June 24, 2003 near [[Manchester, South Dakota]], a probe measured a 100 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]) (2.95&amp;nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]) (25.10&amp;nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Julian J. Lee |author2=Timothy P.

==Life cycle==
{{further|Tornadogenesis}}
[[File:Dimmit Sequence.jpg|thumb|right|A sequence of images showing the birth of a tornado. First, the rotating cloud base lowers. This lowering becomes a funnel, which continues descending while winds build near the surface, kicking up dust and debris and causing damage. As the pressure continues to drop, the visible funnel extends to the ground. This tornado, near [[Dimmitt, Texas]], was one of the best-observed violent tornadoes in history.]]

===Supercell relationship===
{{See also|Supercell}}
Tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercells contain [[mesocyclone]]s, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually {{convert|1|–|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]) develop from supercells. In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.

Most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;
[[File:Evolution of a Tornado.jpg|thumb|left|Composite of eight images shot in sequence as a tornado formed in [[Kansas]] in 2016]]

===Formation===
As the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base, it begins to take in cool, moist air from the downdraft region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Tornadoes Form and Why They're so Unpredictable|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150511-tornadoes-storms-midwest-weather-science|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-05-11|first = Brian Clark|last = Howard|publisher = National Geographic |date= May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maturity===
Initially, the tornado has a good source of warm, moist air [[inflow (meteorology)|flowing inward]] to power it, and it grows until it reaches the "mature stage". This can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour, and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage, and in rare cases can be more than one&amp;nbsp;mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) across. The low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#The%20Basics|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=www.spa.noaa.gov|publisher=Roger Edwards, Storm Prediction Center|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the RFD, now an area of cool surface winds, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;

===Dissipation===
As the RFD completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the "dissipating stage", often lasting no more than a few minutes, after which the tornado ends. During this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns.&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PD tornado images"/&gt;&lt;ref name="target tornado"/&gt; Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to [[conservation of angular momentum]], winds can increase at this point.&lt;ref name="thebible"/&gt;

As the tornado enters the dissipating stage, its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop [[wikt:cycle|cyclically]]. As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.

Although this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.&lt;ref name="tornadogenesis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060&lt;0795:TRFTTO&gt;2.0.CO;2|title=Tornadogenesis Resulting from the Transport of Circulation by a Downdraft: Idealized Numerical Simulations|author=Markowski, Straka, and Rasmussen|journal=J.

==Types==

===Multiple vortex===
{{Main|Multiple-vortex tornado}}

[[File:1957 Dallas multi-vortex 1 edited.JPG|thumb|right|A multiple-vortex [[Early-April 1957 tornado outbreak sequence|tornado]] outside [[Dallas, Texas]] on April 2, 1957.]]

A ''multiple-vortex tornado'' is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axis and at the same time around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt; This is a phenomenon that is distinct from a [[satellite tornado]], which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large, strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to "[[orbit]]" the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex tornado. However, a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;

===Waterspout===
{{Main|Waterspout}}

[[File:Trombe.jpg|thumb|left|A waterspout near the [[Florida Keys]] in 1969.]]

A ''waterspout'' is defined by the [[National Weather Service]] as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish "fair weather" waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to [[dust devil]]s and [[landspout]]s. They form at the bases of [[cumulus congestus]] clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth [[laminar flow|laminar]] walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the [[Florida Keys]] and in the northern [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref name="USA Today 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/0504tornb.htm|title=Tornado Chase 2000|accessdate=2007-05-19|author=Dave Zittel|date=2000-05-04|newspaper=USA Today|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104170204/http://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/0504tornb.htm|archivedate=2007-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wspouts.htm|title=Waterspouts are tornadoes over water|date=2007-11-01|accessdate=2007-05-19|author=Joseph Golden|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas P.

They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from [[severe thunderstorm]]s and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mfl/?n=waterspouts|title=About Waterspouts|accessdate=2009-12-13|date=2007-01-04|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESWD definitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://essl.org/cgi-bin/eswd/eswd.cgi?action=showdefinitions&amp;lang=en_0|title=European Severe Weather Database definitions|author=No author given|date=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landspout===
{{Main|Landspout}}

A ''landspout'', or ''dust-tube tornado'', is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The name stems from their characterization as a "fair weather waterspout on land". Waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics, including relative weakness, short lifespan, and a small, smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface. Landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground, due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes. Though usually weaker than classic tornadoes, they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"/&gt;

===Similar circulations===

====Gustnado====
{{Main|Gustnado}}

A ''gustnado'', or ''gust front tornado'', is a small, vertical swirl associated with a [[Outflow boundary|gust front]] or [[downburst]]. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a [[thunderstorm]] is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a "rolling" effect (often exemplified through a [[roll cloud]]). If low level [[wind shear]] is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gustnado AMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gustnado|title=Gustnado|accessdate=2006-09-20|publisher=American Meteorological Society|work=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.

====Dust devil====
{{Main|Dust devil}}

[[File:Dust devil.jpg|right|thumb|A dust devil in [[Arizona]]]]

A ''dust devil'' (also known as a whirlwind) resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter A Lyons|title=The Handy Weather Answer Book|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Visible Ink press|location =[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0|pages=175–200|chapter=Tornadoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dust devil injury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ssd/techmemo/sr207.htm|title=Severe Weather Climatology for New Mexico|accessdate=2006-09-29|author1=Charles H Jones |author2=Charlie A. Liles |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire whirls====
{{Main|Fire whirl}}

Small-scale, tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense [[wildfire]]s are called ''fire whirls''. They are not considered tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a [[pyrocumulus]] or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt;

====Steam devils====
{{Main|Steam devil}}

A ''steam devil'' is a [[rotating]] [[updraft]] between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations do not involve high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. [[Hot springs]] and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.&lt;ref name="Handy Weather Answer Book"/&gt;

The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by [[expert elicitation]], using engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large [[skyscraper]]s. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] data, [[photogrammetry]], and ground swirl patterns ([[cycloid]]al marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo%3Dcys%26storyid%3D28445%26source%3D2 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lyrvy2Nr?url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=cys&amp;storyid=28445&amp;source=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-13 |title=Goshen County Tornado Given Official Rating of EF2 |work=[[National Weather Service]] |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2009-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=David C Lewellen |author2=M I Zimmerman |date=2008-10-28|title=Using Simulated Tornado Surface Marks to Decipher Near-Ground Winds|conference=24th Conf.

Tornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes tend to be stronger.&lt;ref name="width/length intensity relationship"&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Relationship of Tornado Path Length and Width to Intensity|author=Harold E Brooks|journal=Weather Forecast.|volume=19|issue=2|pages=310–19 |doi=10.1175/1520-0434(2004)019&lt;0310:OTROTP&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2004WtFor..19..310B|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from [[multiple vortex tornado|subvortices]].&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt;

North America is a large continent that extends from the [[tropics]] north into [[arctic]] areas, and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas. In the [[middle latitudes]], where most tornadoes of the world occur, the [[Rocky Mountains]] block moisture and buckle the [[prevailing winds|atmospheric flow]], forcing drier air at mid-levels of the [[troposphere]] due to downsloped winds, and causing [[cyclogenesis|the formation of a low pressure area]] downwind to the east of the mountains.

===Associations with climate and climate change===
[[File:Tornado-counts-1976-2011.png|thumb|U. S. Annual January–December Tornado Count 1976–2011 from NOAA National Climatic Data Center]]
Associations with various [[climate]] and environmental trends exist. For example, an increase in the [[sea surface temperature]] of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and [[Mediterranean Sea]]) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in [[severe weather]] and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.&lt;ref name="Edwards GoM"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Roger Edwards |author2=Steven J. Weiss |authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|title=Comparisons between Gulf of Mexico Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies and Southern U.S. Severe Thunderstorm Frequency in the Cool Season|booktitle=18th Conf.

Some evidence does suggest that the [[Southern Oscillation]] is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the [[ENSO]] phase is that of [[El Niño]] or [[La Niña]].&lt;ref name="AGU ENSO tor"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Ashton Robinson Cook |author2=Joseph T.

Ocean conditions could be used to forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://nature.com|journal=Nature|title= El Niño brings fewer tornados|volume= 519|date= 26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climatic shifts may affect tornadoes via [[teleconnection]]s in shifting the jet stream and the larger weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes.

==Detection==
[[File:Tornado1857.jpg|thumb|right|Path of a tornado across Wisconsin on August 21, 1857]]
{{Main|Convective storm detection}}
Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public [[tornado warning]]s were issued in 1950 and the first [[tornado watch]]es and [[convective outlooks]] came about in 1952. In 1953, it was confirmed that [[hook echo]]es were associated with tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|title=The First Tornadic Hook Echo Weather Radar Observations|publisher=Colorado State University|url=http://www.chill.colostate.edu/w/CHILL_history#The_First_Tornadic_Hook_Echo_Weather_Radar_Observations|accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from several miles away.&lt;ref name="hook echoes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul M. Markowski|authorlink=Paul Markowski|title=Hook Echoes and Rear-Flank Downdrafts: A Review|journal=Mon. Wea. Rev.|volume=130 |issue=4|pages=852–76|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(2002)130&lt;0852:HEARFD&gt;2.0.CO;2|date=April 2002|bibcode = 2002MWRv..130..852M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radar===
{{See also|Pulse-Doppler radar|weather radar}}
Today, most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which serves as the primary method of detecting hook signatures that are likely associated with tornadoes. In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler weather radar stations are used. These devices measure the velocity and radial [[direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] (towards or away from the radar) of the winds within a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from over {{convert|100|mi|km|spell=in}} away. When storms are distant from a radar, only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled.&lt;ref name="airbusradar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/163.pdf|title=Flight Briefing Notes: Adverse Weather Operations Optimum Use of Weather Radar|page=2|author=Airbus|publisher=SKYbrary|date=2007-03-14|accessdate=2009-11-19 |format=PDF|authorlink=Airbus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar. Some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and tornado development may occasionally take place more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. Doppler radar systems can detect [[mesocyclone]]s within a supercell thunderstorm. This allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/tools/radar/|title=Research tools: Radar|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nssl.noaa.gov|publisher=NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storm spotting===
In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train [[Storm spotting|storm spotters]] so they could spot key features of storms that indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as storm damage and [[flash flood]]ing. The program was called '''[[Skywarn]]''', and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, [[amateur radio operator]]s, [[civil defense]] (now [[emergency management]]) spotters, [[storm chasing|storm chasers]], and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request these spotters to look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.

Spotters usually are trained by the [[National Weather Service|NWS]] on behalf of their respective organizations, and report to them.

Storm spotters are required because radar systems such as [[NEXRAD]] do not really detect tornadoes; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes.&lt;ref name="NSSLsearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_detecting.html|title=Detecting Tornadoes: What Does a Tornado Look Like?|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2006-11-15|accessdate=2009-12-13|authorlink=National Severe Storms Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or an imminent one, but [[ground truth]] from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stormeyes.org/tornado/verf/|title=Proposals For Changes in Severe Local Storm Warnings, Warning Criteria and Verification|year=2003|accessdate=2009-12-13|author=Roger and Elke Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spotter's ability to see what radar can't is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.&lt;ref name="airbusradar"/&gt;

===Visual evidence===
[[File:Wall cloud12 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|right|A rotating [[wall cloud]] with [[rear flank downdraft]] clear slot evident to its left rear]]
Storm spotters are trained to discern whether or not a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of [[updraft]] and inflow. Under that updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of [[tornadogenesis]] is the formation of a rotating [[wall cloud]]. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.&lt;ref name="Basic Spotter Guide"/&gt;

Evidence of a supercell is based on the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large [[overshooting top]], a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level [[wind]]s), and a corkscrew look or [[striation (meteorology)|striations]]. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and the likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a "beaver tail", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and [[rear flank downdraft]], and requires a balance between the outflow and inflow.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax/skywarn/adv_spotters.pdf|title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2009-12-13|date=2003-01-03|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and they usually precede the tornado between five and thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds may be a visual manifestation of a low-level mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of [[cloud]] adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly afterwards; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also develop without wall clouds, under flanking lines and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the [[cloud base]] and surface.&lt;ref name="NSSL tornadoes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions and Answers about Tornadoes|work=A Severe Weather Primer|publisher=National Severe Storms Laboratory|date=2006-11-15|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_basics.html|accessdate=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extremes==
{{Main|Tornado records}}
[[File:Super Outbreak Map.jpg|thumb|left|A map of the tornado paths in the Super Outbreak (April 3–4, 1974)]]
The most record-breaking tornado in recorded history was the [[Tri-State Tornado]], which roared through parts of [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]] on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length ({{convert|219|mi|km|disp=x|; }}), longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado ({{convert|73|mph|km/h|disp=x|; |abbr=on}}) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead).&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt; The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but in the years since has been surpassed by several others if population changes over time are not considered. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it ranks third today.&lt;ref name="tornado damage cost"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/damage/tdam1.html|title=Normalized Damage from Major Tornadoes in the United States: 1890–1999|journal=Weather Forecast.|volume=16|pages=168–176|accessdate=2007-02-28|author1=Harold E Brooks|author2=Charles A. Doswell III |date=2000-10-01|authorlink=Harold E. Brooks|doi=10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016&lt;0168:ndfmti&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadliest tornado in world history was the [[Daultipur-Salturia Tornado]] in [[Bangladesh]] on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh tornado"/&gt; Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes in its history kill more than 100 people, almost half of the [[List of tornadoes causing 100 or more deaths|total in the rest of the world]].

The most extensive [[tornado outbreak]] on record was the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], which spawned 360 confirmed tornadoes over the southeastern United States – 216 of them within a single 24-hour period. The previous record was the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] which spawned 148 tornadoes.

While direct measurement of the most violent tornado wind speeds is nearly impossible, since conventional [[anemometer]]s would be destroyed by the intense winds and flying debris, some tornadoes have been scanned by [[Doppler on Wheels|mobile Doppler radar units]], which can provide a good estimate of the tornado's winds. The highest wind speed ever measured in a tornado, which is also the highest wind speed ever recorded on the planet, is 301&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;mph (484&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;32&amp;nbsp;km/h) in the F5 [[1999 Bridge Creek – Moore tornado|Bridge Creek-Moore, Oklahoma]], tornado which killed 36 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsok.com/anatomy-of-may-3s-f5-tornado/article/3365909 Anatomy of May 3's F5 tornado], The Oklahoman Newspaper, May 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Though the reading was taken about {{convert|100|ft|m}} above the ground, this is a testament to the power of the strongest tornadoes.&lt;ref name="fastest wind"/&gt;

Storms that produce tornadoes can feature intense updrafts, sometimes exceeding {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Debris from a tornado can be lofted into the parent storm and carried a very long distance. A tornado which affected [[Great Bend, Kansas]], in November 1915, was an extreme case, where a "rain of debris" occurred {{convert|80|mi|km}} from the town, a sack of flour was found {{convert|110|mi|km}} away, and a cancelled check from the Great Bend bank was found in a field outside of [[Palmyra, Nebraska]], {{convert|305|mi|km}} to the northeast.&lt;ref name="tornado project oddities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/oddities/oddities.htm|title=Tornado Oddities |accessdate=2009-12-13 |author=Thomas P Grazulis |date=2005-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507004425/http://www.tornadoproject.com/oddities/oddities.htm |archivedate=2009-05-07 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterspouts and tornadoes have been advanced as an explanation for instances of [[Rain of animals|raining fish and other animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/archives-tornado-history.htm|title=Q: You've probably heard the expression, "it's raining cats and dogs."

==Safety==
{{Main|Tornado preparedness}}
[[File:Birmingham tornado 2005 damage.jpg|thumb|right|Damage from the [[Birmingham tornado of 2005]]. An unusually strong example of a tornado event in the [[United Kingdom]], the Birmingham Tornado resulted in 19 injuries, mostly from falling trees.]]
Though tornadoes can strike in an instant, there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the [[Storm Prediction Center]] advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival.&lt;ref name="tornado safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/safety.html|title=Tornado Safety|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2009-11-17|author=Roger Edwards|authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have [[storm cellar]]s on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/preparedness/brochures/storm_shelter.pdf |title=Storm Shelters|accessdate=2009-12-13|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2002-08-26|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060223072127/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/hun/preparedness/brochures/storm_shelter.pdf |archivedate = 2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado (such as [[tornado watch]]es and [[Tornado warning|warnings]] in the United States and Canada). [[Weather radio]]s provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.&lt;ref name="highway overpasses"/&gt;

==Myths and misconceptions==
{{Main|Tornado myths}}
Folklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes, and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight |first=Meredith |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-if-sky-is-green-run-for-cover-tornado-is-coming |title=Fact or Fiction?: If the Sky Is Green, Run for Cover – A Tornado Is Coming |journal=Scientific American |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in [[atmospheric pressure]] inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage.&lt;ref name="tornado project myths"/&gt; A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.&lt;ref name="tornado project myths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/safety/myths.htm|title=Myths and Misconceptions about Tornadoes|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Tim Marshall|publisher=The Tornado Project|date=2005-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tornado myths"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas P Grazulis|title=The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3258-7|chapter=Tornado Myths}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1999 Salt Lake City tornado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[1999 Salt Lake City tornado]] disproved several misconceptions, including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in cities.]]
Another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the [[April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak|1991 tornado outbreak]] near [[Andover, Kansas]], where a news crew and several other people take shelter under an overpass on the [[Kansas Turnpike]] and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by.&lt;ref name=noaa-overpass&gt;{{cite web|last=National Weather Service Forecast Office, Dodge City, Kansas|title=Overpasses and Tornado Safety: Not a Good Mix|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ddc/?n=over|work=Tornado Overpass Information|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design.&lt;ref name=noaa-overpass/&gt; Due to the [[Venturi effect]], tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadosafety.html |title=Tornado Myths, Facts, and Safety|publisher=National Climatic Data Center |date=2006-08-17|author=Climate Services and Monitoring Division|accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and at each of the three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries.&lt;ref name="highway overpass danger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/basics/tornado-underpass.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408091759/http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/basics/tornado-underpass.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-04-08|title=Overpasses are tornado death traps|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Chris Cappella|date=2005-05-17|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.&lt;ref name="highway overpasses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/?n=safety-overpass |title=Highway Overpasses as Tornado Shelters|accessdate=2007-02-28|date=2000-03-01|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000616093920/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/papers/overpass.html |archivedate = 2000-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.&lt;ref name="tornado project myths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tornado myths"/&gt;

There are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by [[supernatural]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado Myths &amp; Tornado Reality|url=http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/nebraska/tornado-myths.html|author=Kenneth F Dewey|publisher=High Plains Regional Climate Center and [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]]|date=2002-07-11|accessdate=2009-11-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611013128/http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/nebraska/tornado-myths.html |archivedate = June 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains,&lt;ref name="Tornadoes in mountains"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tornado.sfsu.edu/RockwellPassTornado/index.html|title=Tornado, Rockwell Pass, Sequoia National Park, 2004-07-07|author1=John Monteverdi |author2=Roger Edwards |author3=Greg Stumpf |author4=Daniel Gudgel |date=2006-09-13|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; affect valleys, and have damaged [[List of tornadoes striking downtown areas|several city centers]].

==Ongoing research==
[[File:Tornado with DOW.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Doppler on Wheels]] unit observing a tornado near [[Attica, Kansas]]]]
Meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery.&lt;ref name="VORTEX book"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/noaastory/book.html|title=VORTEX: Unraveling the Secrets|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2006-10-30|authorlink=National Severe Storms Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of [[thunderstorm]]s and mesocyclones,&lt;ref name="Extreme Weather"&gt;{{cite book|title=Extreme Weather|author=Michael H Mogil|year=2007|publisher=Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publisher|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57912-743-5|pages=210–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesocyclone Climatology Project |publisher=University of Oklahoma |author=Kevin McGrath |date=1998-11-05 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |url=http://mesocyclone.ou.edu/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709035137/https://mesocyclone.ou.edu/ |archivedate=2010-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from [[supercell]], or other respective formative processes, to [[tornadogenesis]] and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.&lt;ref name="LouieLouie"/&gt;

Also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the [[vortex stretching|stretching]] of low-level [[vorticity]] which tightens into a tornado,&lt;ref name="LouieLouie"/&gt; in particular, what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.&lt;ref name="Seymour 2001 32"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Seymour |first = Simon |title = Tornadoes |publisher = [[HarperCollins]] |year= 2001 |location = New York City |page = 32 | isbn = 978-0-06-443791-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the role of [[downdraft]]s, particularly the [[rear-flank downdraft]], and the role of [[baroclinic]] boundaries, are intense areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N6Tiz_7VmJoC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=intense+tornadoes+without+a+mesocyclone&amp;q=intense%20tornadoes%20without%20a%20mesocyclone|title=The tornado: nature's ultimate windstorm|author=Thomas P.

Reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem, as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis. Other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with [[:wikt:mesovortex|mesovortices]] within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="tornado forecasting"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rasmussen|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik N.

===Backup features===

A continuation of [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'' series, by [[Jim Starlin]], was featured as a backup for several issues (#37–39 and #42–47).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Wells|first = John|title = 'Lost' DC: The DC Implosion|newspaper = [[Comics Buyer's Guide]]|issue = 1249|pages = 132–133|date = October 24, 1997|location= Iola, Wisconsin|quote= The OMAC story from ''Kamandi'' #60 ended up in ''Warlord'' #37 (Sep 80).

"Dragonsword" was a backup feature by [[Paul Levitz]] and Yeates which appeared in #51–54 (Nov. 1981–Feb. 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Catron|first= Michael|title= Dragon Sword|journal= Amazing Heroes|issue= 2|page= 18|publisher= Fantagraphics Books|date= July 1981|quote= Dragon Sword, a new sword-and sorcery series created and scripted by Paul Levitz and pencilled and inked by Tom Yeates will debut as the back feature in ''Warlord'' #51, on sale in August [1981].}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arion (comics)|Arion]]'', a sword and sorcery title by writer [[Paul Kupperberg]] and artist [[Jan Duursema]], began as a six–page backup feature in ''The Warlord'' #55 (March 1982). Another backup feature was "The Barren Earth" by writer [[Gary Cohn (comics)|Gary Cohn]] and artist [[Ron Randall]], which was concluded in a four–issue limited series. A [[DC Comics Bonus Book|Bonus Book]] in issue #131 (Sept. 1988) featured artist [[Rob Liefeld]]'s first work for DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Greenberger|first= Robert|authorlink= Robert Greenberger|title= New Talent and Bonus Babies|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 71|pages= 71–73|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= April 2014|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Gcdb issue|id= 44933|title= ''The Warlord'' #131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume 2===
A six-issue miniseries ran cover-dated January to June 1992. It was written by [[Mike Grell]] and pencilled by Dameon Willich, with inks by [[Rick Hoberg]] (#1-3) and Tim Burgard (#4-6).

===Volume 3===
DC attempted to update ''The Warlord'' in 2006 with [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] writing and [[Bart Sears]] providing the art. This series restarted the concept, beginning with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue #9 finished on a cliffhanger, while the tenth and final issue had a standalone story set sometime in the future.

===Volume 4===
DC announced in July 2008 that ''The Warlord'' would return in an ongoing series written by Mike Grell in time for the original series' 35th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/631-sdcc-08-mike-grell-the-return-of-warlord.html|title= SDCC '08 - Mike Grell: The Return of Warlord|first= Chris|last= Arrant|date= July 27, 2008|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6GTb3WBGO?url=http://www.newsarama.com/631-sdcc-08-mike-grell-the-return-of-warlord.html|archivedate= May 9, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= August 16, 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series started in April 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 338 "Mike Grell was back at the helm for the return of DC's greatest sword-and-sorcery hero - Travis Morgan, the Warlord."&lt;/ref&gt; featuring art by Joe Prado and Chad Hardin. It ran for 16 issues.

[[Vietnam War]] veteran [[SR-71]] pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the Earth's crust while flying over the north pole in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Grell|Grell, Mike]]|penciller= [[Chad Hardin|Hardin, Chad]]; Grell, Mike|inker= Hardin, Chad; Grell, Mike|story= Next...|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= 10|date= March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and landed in the underground world of [[Skartaris]], a place strongly reminiscent of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Pellucidar]]. There Travis, wielding his .44 [[AutoMag (pistol)|AutoMag]] pistol and joined by Shamballah's Princess (later Queen) Tara, a scantily dressed savage, became The Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer [[Deimos (comics)|Deimos]] as well as various kings.

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Jurgens, Dan|inker= [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]; [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|McLaughlin, Frank]]|story= Siege|title= [[Green Arrow]]|volume= 2|issue= 28|date= January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is in reality based more upon his creator Mike Grell who was a former member of the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Greenberger|title = From Skartaris to Sable: A Chat with Storyteller Mike Grell|journal = Comics Scene|issue = 9|publisher = Comics World Corp|year= 1983|url = http://www.mikegrell.com/thewarlord/articles/skartaristosable.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203053837/http://www.mikegrell.com/thewarlord/articles/skartaristosable.html|archivedate= December 3, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grell is caricatured in The Warlord's first appearance, ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #8 and is clearly sporting The Warlord's signature shaggy goatee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Grell, Mike|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= Gambit|title= The Warlord|issue= 35|date= July 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grell and editor [[Jack C.

Volume 4 of the series begins with an explorer finding perfectly preserved [[dinosaur]] remains in the [[Himalayas]]. She takes the head of one to a doctor and an expedition is set up to retrieve more samples. The team is spotted by the Chinese government and flee into the caves after losing several members. They discover a portal and after walking through find themselves in [[Skartaris]] where they encounter Travis Morgan. Travis Morgan is attacked by a giant bird and kills it with the help of Shakira. Refugees enter Shamballah and Morgan discovers that a new god has taken over the Shadow Kingdom and has overrun the Kingdom of Kiro, [[Machiste]]'s homeland. One of the refugees is injured and he surprisingly carries a gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= [[Joe Prado|Prado, Joe]]|inker= [[Walden Wong|Wong, Walden]]|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= 1|date= June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machinations of Deimos' return pit Travis Morgan against Tinder. Just as Morgan realizes that Tinder is in fact his son Joshua, he becomes distracted and Tinder mortally wounds him. Travis Morgan's final words were "I thought I'd have more time." Morgan is cremated and Tinder becomes the new Warlord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Grell, Mike|inker= Grell, Mike|story= Sunset|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= 12|date= May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua Morgan becomes the new Warlord. His costume is reminiscent of Travis Morgan's black outfit when he first arrived in Skartaris. Instead of carrying a sword and a gun as Travis did, Tinder carries a sword, a dagger, a quiver of arrows and a bow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Grell, Mike|penciller= Hardin, Chad|inker= Hardin, Chad|story= Son Rise|title= The Warlord|volume= 4|issue= 13|date= June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline, The Warlord is the pirate of a fleet when he was attacked by pirate Deathstroke in battle stealing their loot. During the battle, The Warlord's crew was killed while he escaped using the hovercraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Jimmy Palmiotti|Palmiotti, Jimmy]]|penciller= [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Bennett, Joe]]|inker= Dell, John|story= Separation Anxiety|title= [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager]]|issue= 1|date= August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, The Warlord plans to attack Deathstroke and retrieve Jenny Blitz who has been in stasis since she was stolen from him. The Warlord ambushed Deathstroke and his fleet and demanded that they surrender. But in answer Deathstroke shot The Warlord's right eye using a scoped sniper rifle.  He had been aiming for his mouth. Deathstroke fired at The Warlord's ship again, and it unexpectedly blew up. Each ship in Warlord's fleet subsequently exploded. The ships were destroyed by Jenny Blitz, now released from her stasis tube due to an earlier skirmish between Ocean Master and Icicle, one of Deathstroke's crewmen. Jenny appears to be able to project explosive force from her hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Palmiotti, Jimmy|penciller= Bennett, Joe|inker= Shasteen, Tony|story= Red Tide|title= Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager|issue= 2|date= September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joukowsky-Pressure-Shock-01.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Effect of a pressure surge on a float gauge]]
'''Water hammer''' (or, more generally, '''fluid hammer''', also called '''hydraulic shock''') is a [[pressure]] surge or wave caused  when a [[fluid]], usually a liquid but sometimes also a gas, in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly, a momentum change. A water hammer commonly occurs when a valve closes suddenly at an end of a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] system, and a pressure wave propagates in the pipe.

This pressure wave can cause major problems, from noise and vibration to pipe collapse. It is possible to reduce the effects of the water hammer pulses with [[Hydraulic accumulator|accumulators]], [[expansion tank]]s, [[surge tank]]s, [[blowoff valve]]s, and other features.

Rough calculations can be made either using the [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]] (Joukowsky) equation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Practical Hydraulics |author=Kay, Melvyn |year=2008 |edition=2nd |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-35115-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0415351154&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more accurate ones using the method of characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Modelling vaporous cavitation on fluid transients | journal = International Journal of Pressure Vessels and Piping | year = 2003 | first = Jian-Jun | last = Shu | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–195 | doi = 10.1016/S0308-0161(03)00025-5 | arxiv = 1409.8042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In the 1st century B.C., [[Vitruv|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] described the effect of water hammer in lead pipes and stone tubes of the Roman public water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius Pollio with Morris Hicky Morgan, trans. ''The Ten Books on Architecture'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1914) ; Book 8, Chapter 6, sections 5-8 , [https://archive.org/stream/vitruviustenbook00vitruoft#page/n281/mode/2up pp. 245-246.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711025315/http://archive.org/stream/vitruviustenbook00vitruoft |date=2012-07-11 }}  Vitruvius states that when a water pipe crosses a wide valley, it must sometimes be constructed as an inverted siphon.  He states that cavities ("venters") must be constructed periodically along the pipe "and in the venter, water cushions must be constructed to relieve the pressure of the air." "But if there is no such venter made in the valleys, nor any substructure built on a level, but merely an elbow, the water will break out, and burst the joints of the pipes."  Swiss engineer Martin Schwarz — Martin Schwarz, "Neue Forschungsergebnisse zu Vitruvs ''colliviaria''" [New research results on Vitruvius' ''colliviaria''], pp.  353-357,  in:  Christoph Ohlig, ed., ''Cura Aquarum in Jordanien'' (Siegburg, Germany:  Deutschen Wasserhistorischen Gesellschaft, 2008) — argues that Vitruvius' phrase ''vis spiritus'' referred not to air pressure, but to pressure transients (water hammer) in the water pipes.  He found stone plugs (''colliviaria'') in Roman water pipes, which could be expelled by water hammer, allowing water in the pipe to flood the air chamber above the pipe, instead of rupturing the pipe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Andreas |last=Ismaier |title=Untersuchung der fluiddynamischen Wechselwirkung zwischen Druckstößen und Anlagenkomponenten in Kreiselpumpensystemen |language=German |trans-title=Investigation of the fluid dynamic interaction between pressure surges and system components in centrifugal pumping systems |year=2011 |publisher=Shaker |volume=11 |series=Schriftenreihe des Lehrstuhls für Prozessmaschinen und Anlagentechnik, Universität Erlangen; Nürnberg Lehrstuhl für Prozessmaschinen und Anlagentechnik |isbn=978-3-8322-9779-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water hammer was exploited before there was even a word for it; in 1772, Englishman [[John Whitehurst]] built a [[hydraulic ram]] for a home in Cheshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Whitehurst |first=John |year=1775 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Account of a machine for raising water, executed at Oulton, in Cheshire, in 1772 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=65 |issue= |pages=277–279 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0026 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328203126/https://books.google.com/books?id=nXg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-03-28 |df= }} See also plate preceding page 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In  1796, French inventor [[Joseph Michel Montgolfier]] (1740–1810) built a hydraulic ram for his paper mill in [[Voiron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Montgolfier |first=J.

==Cause and effect==
When a pipe is suddenly closed at the outlet (downstream), the mass of water before the closure is still moving, thereby building up high pressure and a resulting [[shock wave]]. In domestic [[plumbing]] this is experienced as a loud banging resembling a hammering noise. Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is high enough. Air traps or stand pipes (open at the top) are sometimes added as [[Wiktionary:damper|dampers]] to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.

In [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generating stations]], the water traveling along the tunnel or pipeline may be prevented from entering a turbine by closing a valve. For example, if there is 14&amp;nbsp;km of tunnel of 7.7 m diameter full of water travelling at 3.75&amp;nbsp;m/s,&lt;ref&gt;http://communities.bentley.com/products/hydraulics___hydrology/f/5925/p/60896/147250.aspx#147250&lt;/ref&gt; that represents approximately 8000 megajoules of kinetic energy that must be arrested. This arresting is frequently achieved by a surge shaft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/73646 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220023940/http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/73646 |archivedate=2011-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; open at the top, into which the water flows. As the water rises up the shaft its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, which causes the water in the tunnel to decelerate. At some HEP stations, such as the Saxon Falls Hydro [[List of power stations in Michigan#Hydropower|Power Plant In Michigan]], what looks like a [[water tower]] is actually one of these devices, known in these cases as a [[surge tank|surge drum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/power_plants/saxon|title=Saxon Falls Hydro Generating Station {{!}} Xcel Energy|website=www.xcelenergy.com|access-date=2017-08-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816195209/https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/power_plants/saxon|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the home, a water hammer may occur when a [[dishwasher]], [[washing machine]] or [[toilet]] shuts off water flow. The result may be heard as a loud bang, repetitive banging (as the shock wave travels back and forth in the plumbing system), or as some shuddering.

On the other hand, when an upstream [[valve]] in a pipe closes, water downstream of the valve attempts to continue flowing creating a vacuum that may cause the pipe to collapse or [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]]. This problem can be particularly acute if the pipe is on a downhill slope. To prevent this, air and vacuum [[relief valve]]s or air vents are installed just downstream of the valve to allow air to enter the line to prevent this vacuum from occurring.

Other causes of water hammer are pump failure and [[check valve]] slam (due to sudden deceleration, a check valve may slam shut rapidly, depending on the dynamic characteristic of the check valve and the mass of the water between a check valve and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam check valves as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dft-valves.com/preventing-water-hammer/|title=How To Prevent Water Hammer {{!}} DFT Valves|work=DFT Valves|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816193649/http://www.dft-valves.com/preventing-water-hammer/|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam distribution systems may also be vulnerable to a situation similar to water hammer, known as ''steam hammer''. In a steam system, a water hammer most often occurs when some of the steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the piping.  Steam picks up the water, forming a "[[slug (projectile)|slug]]", and hurls this at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe.  This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy.

Where air filled traps are used, these eventually become depleted of their trapped air over a long period through absorption into the water. This can be cured by shutting off the supply, opening taps at the highest and lowest locations to drain the system (thereby restoring air to the traps), and then closing the taps and re-opening the supply.

On [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[internal combustion engine]]s, a fluid hammer can take place when the throttle is closed while the turbocharger is forcing air into the engine. A [[pressure relief valve]] placed before the throttle prevents the air from surging against the throttle body by diverting it elsewhere, thus protecting the turbocharger from pressure damage. This valve can either recirculate the air into the turbocharger's intake (recirculation valve), or it can blow the air into the atmosphere and produce the distinctive hiss-flutter of an aftermarket turbocharger ([[blowoff valve]]).

==Water hammer from a jet of water==
If a stream of high pressure water impinges on a surface, water hammer can quickly [[erosion|erode]] and destroy it. In the [[2009 Sayano–Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station accident]], the lid to a 640 MW turbine was ejected upwards, hitting the ceiling above. During the accident, the rotor was seen flying through the air, still spinning, about 3 meters  above the floor. Unrestrained, {{convert|256|m3|gal|sigfig=3}} per second of water began to spray all over the generator hall.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/4344681 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213154304/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/4344681 |archivedate=2011-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The geyser caused the structural failure of steel ceiling joists, precipitating a roof collapse around the failed turbine.

==Water hammer during an explosion==
When an explosion happens in an enclosed space, water hammer can cause the walls of the container to deform. However, it can also impart momentum to the enclosure if it is free to move. An underwater explosion in the [[SL-1]] [[nuclear reactor]] vessel caused the water to accelerate upwards through {{convert|2.5|ft}} of air before it struck the vessel head at {{convert|160|ft/s}} with a pressure of {{convert|10000|psi}}. This pressure wave caused the {{convert|26000|lb}} steel vessel to jump 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) into the air before it dropped into its prior location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |id=IDO-19313 |title=Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion: Final Report of Progress July through October 1962 |date=November 21, 1962 |author=Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho |publisher=U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065809/http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}; also TM-62-11-707&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative to perform ongoing preventative maintenance to avoid water hammer as the results of these powerful explosions have resulted in fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/nyregion/us-blames-con-ed-error-for-fatal-plant-explosion.html|title=U.S. Blames Con Ed Error For Fatal Plant Explosion|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|date=1993-05-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194725/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/nyregion/us-blames-con-ed-error-for-fatal-plant-explosion.html|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigating measures==
Water hammer has caused accidents and fatalities, but usually damage is limited to breakage of pipes or appendages. An engineer should always assess the risk of a pipeline burst. Pipelines transporting hazardous liquids or gases warrant special care in design, construction, and operation. Hydroelectric power plants especially must be carefully designed and maintained because the water hammer can cause water pipes to fail catastrophically.

The following characteristics may reduce or eliminate water hammer:
* Reduce the pressure of the water supply to the building by fitting a regulator.
* Lower fluid velocities. To keep water hammer low, pipe-sizing charts for some applications recommend flow velocity at or below {{convert|1.5|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}
* Fit slowly closing valves. Toilet fill valves are available in a quiet fill type that closes quietly.
* High pipeline pressure rating (expensive).
* Good pipeline control (start-up and shut-down procedures).
* [[Water tower]]s (used in many [[drinking water]] systems) help maintain steady flow rates and trap large pressure fluctuations.
* Air vessels work in much the same way as water towers, but are pressurized. They typically have an air cushion above the fluid level in the vessel, which may be regulated or separated by a bladder. Sizes of air vessels may be up to hundreds of cubic meters on large pipelines. They come in many shapes, sizes and configurations. Such vessels often are called accumulators or expansion tanks.
* A [[hydropneumatic device]] similar in principle to a [[shock absorber]] called a 'Water Hammer Arrestor' can be installed between the water pipe and the machine, to absorb the shock and stop the banging.
* Air valves often remediate low pressures at high points in the pipeline. Though effective, sometimes large numbers of air valves need be installed. These valves also allow air into the system, which is often unwanted.
* Shorter branch pipe lengths.
* Shorter lengths of straight pipe, i.e. add elbows, expansion loops. Water hammer is related to the speed of sound in the fluid, and elbows reduce the influences of pressure waves.
* Arranging the larger piping in loops that supply shorter smaller run-out pipe branches. With looped piping, lower velocity flows from both sides of a loop can serve a branch.
* [[Flywheel]] on a pump.
* Pumping station bypass.

==The magnitude of the pulse==
[[Image:Water hammer pressure.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical pressure wave caused by closing a valve in a pipeline]]

One of the first to successfully investigate the water hammer problem was the Italian engineer [[Lorenzo Allievi]].

Water hammer can be analyzed by two different approaches—''rigid column theory'', which ignores compressibility of the fluid and elasticity of the walls of the pipe, or by a full analysis that includes elasticity.  When the time it takes a valve to close is long compared to the propagation time for a pressure wave to travel the  length of the pipe, then rigid column theory is appropriate; otherwise considering elasticity may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bruce |first1=S. |last2=Larock |first2=E. |last3=Jeppson |first3=R. W. |last4=Watters |first4=G. Z. |title=Hydraulics of Pipeline Systems |location= |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8493-1806-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Below are two approximations for the peak pressure, one that considers elasticity, but assumes the valve closes instantaneously, and a second that neglects elasticity but includes a finite time for the valve to close.

===Instant valve closure; compressible fluid===
The pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky]] equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Thorley |first=A. R. D. |title=Fluid Transients in Pipelines |edition=2nd |publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=0-79180210-8 |doi= }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} =\rho a \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

So for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximum magnitude of the water hammer pulse is:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =\rho a_0 \Delta v &lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''P'' is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), ''&amp;rho;'' is the density of the fluid (kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the speed of sound in the fluid (ms&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and Δ''v'' is the change in the fluid's velocity (ms&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The pulse comes about due to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's laws of motion]] and the [[continuity equation]] applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{Citation |last=Streeter |first=V. L. |last2=Wylie |first2=E. B. |title=Fluid Mechanics |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |edition=International 9th Revised |year=1998 |isbn= |doi= }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Equation for wave speed====
As the speed of sound in a fluid is &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{\frac B \rho}&lt;/math&gt;, the peak pressure depends on the fluid compressibility if the valve is closed abruptly.

::&lt;math&gt;B = \frac K {(1+V/a)[1+c(K/E)(D/t)]}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''a'' = wave speed
* ''B'' = equivalent bulk modulus of elasticity of the system fluid-pipe
* ''&amp;rho;'' = density of the fluid
* ''K'' = bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid
* ''E'' = [[elastic modulus]] of the pipe
* ''D'' = internal pipe diameter
* ''t'' = pipe wall thickness
* ''c'' = dimensionless parameter due to system pipe-constraint condition on wave speed&lt;ref name="SW"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2012}}

===Slow valve closure; incompressible fluid===
When the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of [[inertance]] or rigid column theory:
:&lt;math&gt;F = m a = P A = \rho L A {dv \over dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming constant deceleration of the water column (''dv''/''dt'' = ''v''/''t''), gives:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \rho L v/t.&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''F'' = force, N
* ''m'' = mass of the fluid column, kg
* ''a'' = acceleration, m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''P'' = pressure, Pa
* ''A'' = pipe cross section, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* &amp;rho; = fluid density, kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''L'' = pipe length, m
* ''v'' = [[flow velocity]], m/s
* ''t'' = valve closure time, s

The above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit: P = 0.0135 V L/t.
For practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:

:&lt;math&gt;P =0.07 V L/t +P_1&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the inlet pressure in psi, ''V'' is the flow velocity in ft/sec, ''t'' is the valve closing time in seconds and ''L'' is the upstream pipe length in feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plastomatic.com/water-hammer.html "Water Hammer &amp; Pulsation"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701193833/http://www.plastomatic.com/water-hammer.html |date=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression for the excess pressure due to water hammer==

When a valve with a volumetric flow rate Q is closed, an excess pressure &amp;Delta;P is created upstream of the valve, whose value is given by the [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky]] equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta P = Z \, Q&lt;/math&gt;

In this expression:&lt;ref&gt;Faisandier, J., Hydraulic and Pneumatic Mechanisms, 8th edition, Dunod, Paris, 1999 ({{ISBN|2100499483}})
&lt;/ref&gt;
* overpressurization &amp;Delta;P is expressed in Pa;
* ''Q'' is the volumetric flow in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s;
* ''Z'' is the hydraulic impedance, expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/s.
The hydraulic impedance ''Z'' of the pipeline determines the magnitude of the water hammer pulse. It is itself defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\sqrt{\rho \, B}}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

with:
* ''ρ'' the density of the liquid, expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''A'' cross sectional area of the pipe, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''B'' equivalent modulus of compressibility of the liquid in the pipe, expressed in Pa.

The latter follows from a series of hydraulic concepts: 
*compressibility of the liquid, defined by its adiabatic compressibility modulus ''B''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting from the equation of state of the liquid generally available from thermodynamic tables;
*the elasticity of the walls of the pipe, which defines an equivalent bulk modulus of compressibility for the solid ''B''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. In the case of a pipe of circular cross section whose thickness ''t'' is small compared to the diameter ''D'', the equivalent modulus of compressibility is given by the following formula: &lt;math&gt;B = \frac{t}{D} E &lt;/math&gt;; in which ''E'' is the Young's modulus (in Pa) of the material of the pipe;
*possibly compressibility ''B''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of gas dissolved in the liquid, defined by: &lt;math&gt;B_g = \frac{\gamma}{\alpha} P&lt;/math&gt;
** γ being the [[specific heat ratio]] of the gas
** α the rate of ventilation (the volume fraction of undissolved gas)
** and ''P'' the pressure (in Pa).

Thus, the equivalent elasticity is the sum of the original elasticities:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{B} = \frac{1}{B_l} + \frac{1}{B_{s}} + \frac{1}{B_g}&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by:
*increasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column;
* employing the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus);
*introducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator;
*where possible, increasing the percentage of undissolved gases in the liquid.

==Dynamic equations==
The water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}+ \frac{1}{B}\frac{dP}{dt}=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt}+ \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{f}{2D}V|V|=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the fluid velocity inside pipe, ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' is the fluid density and ''B'' is the '''equivalent''' bulk modulus, ''f'' is the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation|Darcy-Weisbach friction factor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaudhry |first1=Hanif |title=Applied Hydraulic Transients |date=1979 |publisher=New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Column separation==
Column separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water-hammer event.  If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, [[cavitation]] will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure).  This is most likely to occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope).  When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases.  This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space.  The liquid on either side of the vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference.  The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure.  This pressure rise can damage [[hydraulic machinery]], individual pipes and supporting structures.  Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.&lt;ref&gt;Bergeron, L., 1950. Du Coup de Bélier en Hydraulique - Au Coup de Foudre en Electricité. (Waterhammer in hydraulics and wave surges in electricity.) Paris: Dunod (in French). (English translation by ASME Committee, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1961.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation software==
Most water hammer [[software]] packages use the [[method of characteristics]]&lt;ref name=SW/&gt; to solve the [[differential equation]]s involved. This method works well if the wave speed does not vary in time due to either air or gas entrainment in a pipeline. The Wave Method (WM) is also used in various software packages. WM lets operators analyze large networks efficiently. Many commercial and non commercial packages are available.

Software packages vary in complexity, dependent on the processes modeled. The more sophisticated packages may have any of the following features:

:* Multiphase flow capabilities
:* An [[algorithm]] for [[cavitation]] growth and collapse
:* Unsteady friction: the pressure waves dampens as turbulence is generated and due to variations in the flow velocity distribution
:* Varying bulk modulus for higher pressures (water becomes less compressible)
:* Fluid structure interaction: the pipeline reacts on the varying pressures and causes pressure waves itself

==Applications==
* The water hammer principle can be used to create a simple water [[pump]] called a [[hydraulic ram]].
* Leaks can sometimes be detected using water hammer.
* Enclosed air pockets can be detected in pipelines.

'''Wave power''' is the capture of energy of [[wind wave]]s to do useful [[mechanical work|work]] – for example, [[electricity generation]], [[water desalination]], or [[pump]]ing water. A machine that exploits wave [[power (physics)|power]] is a '''wave energy converter''' (WEC).

Wave power is distinct from [[tidal power]], which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Waves and tides are also distinct from [[ocean currents]] which are caused by other forces including [[wave breaking|breaking waves]], [[wind]], the [[Coriolis effect]], [[cabbeling]], and differences in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]].

Wave-power generation is not a widely employed commercial technology, although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidelands.org/wave-tidal3.php|title=Wave and Tidal Energy Experiments in San Francisco and Santa Cruz|author=Christine Miller|accessdate=2008-08-16|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the world's first commercial Wave Power Device, the [[Islay LIMPET]] was installed on the coast of [[Islay]] in Scotland and connected to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edie.net/news/0/Worlds-first-commercial-wave-power-station-activated-in-Scotland/3492/&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator [[wave farm]] was opened in Portugal at the [[Aguçadoura Wave Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Joao Lima.

Waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves, there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves. Both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave [[crest (physics)|crest]], as well as friction on the water surface by the wind, making the water to go into the [[shear stress]] causes the growth of the waves.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

[[Wave height]] is determined by wind speed, the duration of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the depth and topography of the seafloor (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves. When this limit has been reached the sea is said to be "fully developed".

In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed, [[wavelength]], and water [[density]].

[[Ocean surface wave#Science of waves|Oscillatory motion]] is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for [[standing waves]] ([[clapotis]]) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing [[microseism]]s.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book| first=O.M. | last=Phillips | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1977 | edition=2nd | isbn=0-521-29801-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power.

The waves propagate on the ocean surface, and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the [[group velocity]]. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is called the wave energy [[flux]] (or wave power, which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device).

=== Wave power formula ===

In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the [[wavelength]], the wave [[energy flux]] is&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The energy flux is &lt;math&gt;P = \tfrac{1}{16} \rho g H_{m0}^2 c_g,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c_g&lt;/math&gt; the group velocity, see {{Cite book

Example: Consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline,  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds. Using the formula to solve for power, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
  P \approx 0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} (3 \cdot \text{m})^2 (8 \cdot \text{s}) \approx 36 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}},
&lt;/math&gt;

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.

In major storms, the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7&amp;nbsp;MW of power across each metre of wavefront.

An effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux. As a result, the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device.

=== Wave energy and wave-energy flux ===

In a [[sea state]], the average(mean) [[energy density]] per unit area of [[gravity wave]]s on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;{{cite book | first=Y. | last=Goda | title=Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures | year=2000 | publisher=World Scientific | isbn=978-981-02-3256-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{16}\rho g H_{m0}^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Here, the factor for random waves is {{frac|1|16}}, as opposed to {{frac|1|8}} for periodic waves – as explained hereafter. For a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \eta=a\,\cos\, 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with wave amplitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\,&lt;/math&gt; the wave energy density per unit horizontal area is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{2}\rho g a^2,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{8}\rho g H^2&lt;/math&gt; using the wave height &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H\,=\,2\,a\,&lt;/math&gt; for sinusoidal waves. In terms of the variance of the surface elevation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0=\sigma_\eta^2=\overline{(\eta-\bar\eta)^2}=\frac{1}{2}a^2,&lt;/math&gt; the energy density is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\rho g m_0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Turning to random waves, the last formulation of the wave energy equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is also valid (Holthuijsen, 2007, p. 40), due to [[Parseval's theorem]]. Further, the [[significant wave height]] is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_{m0}=4\sqrt{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to the factor {{frac|1|16}} in the wave energy density per unit horizontal area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

where ''E'' is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the sum of [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy,&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; both contributing half to the wave energy density ''E'', as can be expected from the [[Equipartition theorem#Potential energy and harmonic oscillators|equipartition theorem]]. In ocean waves, surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few [[decimetre]]s.

As the waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is the [[group velocity]].

=== Deep-water characteristics and opportunities ===

Deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength, which is the common situation in the sea and ocean. In deep water, longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster. The deep-water group velocity is half the [[phase velocity]]. In [[waves and shallow water|shallow water]], for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth, as found quite often near the coast, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity.&lt;ref name=Dean_Dalrymple&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists |author1=R.

== History ==

The first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799, and was filed in Paris by [[Pierre-Simon Girard|Girard]] and his son.&lt;ref name=cle2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clément|year=2002 |title=Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=405–431 |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00009-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to light and power his house at [[Royan]], near [[Bordeaux]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/0-Archive/EWPP%20archive/1976%20Leishman%20and%20Scobie%20NEL.pdf|format=PDF |title=The Development of Wave Power|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device.&lt;ref name=morris2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris-Thomas |year=2007 |title=An Investigation Into the Hydrodynamic Efficiency of an Oscillating Water Column |journal=Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=273–278 |doi=10.1115/1.2426992 |last2=Irvin |first2=Rohan J. |last3=Thiagarajan |first3=Krish P.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the UK alone.&lt;ref name=cle2002/&gt;

Modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by [[Yoshio Masuda]]'s experiments in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |title=Wave Energy Research and Development at JAMSTEC|accessdate=2009-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701162330/http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea, with several hundred units used to power navigation lights. Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft, which was proposed in the 1950s by Masuda.&lt;ref name=ey2006&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.iwwwfb.org/Abstracts/iwwwfb21/iwwwfb21_15.pdf |author1=Farley, F. J. M.  |author2=Rainey, R. C. T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Radical design options for wave-profiling wave energy converters |booktitle=International Workshop on Water Waves and Floating Bodies |location=Loughborough |accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]]. A number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves, among whom notably were [[Stephen Salter]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Kjell Budal]] and [[Johannes Falnes]] from [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (now merged into [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), [[Michael E. McCormick]] from [[U.S. Naval Academy]], [[David Evans (mathematician)|David Evans]] from [[Bristol University]], Michael French from [[University of Lancaster]], [[John Nicholas Newman|Nick Newman]] and [[C. C. Mei]] from [[MIT]].

Stephen Salter's [[1974 in science|1974 invention]] became known as [[Salter's duck]] or ''nodding duck'', although it was officially referred to as the Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/EWPP%20archive/duck%20efficiency%20&amp;%20survival%20notes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Edinburgh Wave Energy Project|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, as the oil price went down, wave-energy funding was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea. More recently, following the issue of climate change, there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy, including wave energy.&lt;ref name=falnes2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falnes, J. |year=2007 |title=A review of wave-energy extraction |journal=Marine Structures |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=185–201 |doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2007.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid-connected wave test site is situated at Billia Croo, on the western edge of the Orkney mainland, and is subject to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site. Wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include [http://www.aquamarinepower.com/ Aquamarine Power], [http://www.pelamiswave.com/ Pelamis Wave Power], [http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/wave-clients/scottishpower-renewables/ ScottishPower Renewables] and [http://www.wello.eu/ Wello].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern technology ==

Wave power devices are generally categorized by the '''method''' used to capture the energy of the waves, by '''location''' and by the '''power take-off system'''. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: [[hydraulic ram]], [[Peristaltic pump|elastomeric hose pump]], pump-to-shore, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric turbine]], air turbine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060523114110/http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2003/ece441/groups/g12/White_Papers/Kelly.htm Embedded Shoreline Devices and Uses as Power Generation Sources] ''Kimball, Kelly, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linear motor|linear electrical generator]]. When evaluating [[wave energy]] as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.

[[File:Wave energy concepts overview numbered.png|thumb|300px|Generic wave energy concepts: 1. Point absorber, 2. Attenuator, 3. Oscillating wave surge converter, 4. Oscillating water column, 5. Overtopping device, 6. Submerged pressure differential]]

=== Point absorber buoy ===

This device floats on the surface of the [[water]], held in place by cables connected to the seabed. The point-absorber is deﬁned as having a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength λ. A good point absorber has the same characteristics as a good wave-maker. The wave energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves. Buoys use the rise and fall of swells to generate [[electricity]] in various ways including directly via [[linear alternator|linear generators]],&lt;ref name="Seabased"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seabased AB wave energy technology|url=http://www.seabased.com/en/technology/seabased-wave-energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters&lt;ref name="PowerBuoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=PowerBuoy Technology — Ocean Power Technologies|url=http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/powerbuoy-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydraulic pumps.&lt;ref name="CETO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perth Wave Energy Project - Carnegie’s CETO Wave Energy technology|url=https://arena.gov.au/projects/perth-wave-energy-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms. The presence of the buoys may affect fish, marine mammals, and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites. Potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines. Energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline, resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface attenuator ===

These devices act similarly to [[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|point absorber buoys]], with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. Environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys, with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Oscillating wave surge converter ===

These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. [[Energy]] is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Environmental concerns include minor risk of collision, artificial reefing near the fixed point, [[Electromotive force|EMF]] effects from subsea cables, and energy removal effecting sediment transport.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt; Some of these designs incorporate [[parabolic reflector]]s as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture. These capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCormick |first1=Michael E. |first2=R. Cengiz |last2=Ertekin |title=Renewable sea power: Waves, tides, and thermals – new research funding seeks to put them to work for us |journal=Mechanical Engineering |publisher=ASME |volume=131 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the wave energy is captured at a wave source, power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the [[electrical grid]] by [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] [[submarine power cable|power cables]].&lt;ref name=nyt20100316&gt;

=== Oscillating water column ===

[[Oscillating Water Column]] devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore. With an air chamber integrated into the device, swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="“grnflea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracting Energy From Ocean Waves|url=http://grnflea.com/extracting-energy-from-ocean-waves/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines, potentially affecting [[birds]] and other [[marine organisms]] within the vicinity of the device. There is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Overtopping device ===

Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be either on shore or floating offshore. Floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting [[benthic organism]]s, organisms becoming entangled, or EMF effects produced from [[subsea cable]]s. There is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Submerged pressure differential ===
Submerged pressure differential based converters are a comparatively newer technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurniawan|first=Adi|last2=Greaves|first2=Deborah|last3=Chaplin|first3=John|date=2014-12-08|title=Wave energy devices with compressible volumes|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/470/2172/20140559|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=470|issue=2172|pages=20140559|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0559|issn=1364-5021|pmc=4241014|pmid=25484609|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47040559K}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing flexible (usually reinforced rubber) membranes to extract wave energy. These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off fluid system. This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow, which drives a turbine and electrical generator. Submerged pressure differential converters frequently use flexible membranes as the working surface between the ocean and the power take-off system. Membranes offer the advantage over rigid structures of being compliant and low mass, which can produce more direct coupling with the wave’s energy. Their compliant nature also allows for large changes in the geometry of the working surface, which can be used to tune the response of the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions.

A submerged converter may be positioned either on the sea floor or in midwater. In both cases, the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the [[free surface]]. Wave loads also diminish in [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] proportion to the distance below the free surface. This means that by optimizing the depth of submergence for such a converter, a compromise between protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be found. Submerged WECs also have the potential to reduce the impact on marine amenity and navigation, as they are not at the surface. Examples of submerged pressure differential converters include [http://www.m3wave.com/m3tech M3 Wave], [http://www.bomborawave.com Bombora Wave Power]'s mWave, and [http://calwave.energy CalWave].

== Environmental effects ==

{{further|Environmental impact of electricity generation#Wave}}

Common environmental concerns associated with [[marine energy]] developments include:

* The risk of [[marine mammal]]s and [[fish]] being struck by tidal [[turbine]] blades;
* The effects of [[electromagnetic field|EMF]] and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices;
* The physical presence of [[marine energy]] projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and [[seabird]]s with attraction or avoidance;
* The potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as [[sediment transport]] and [[water quality]].

The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|archivedate=November 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential ==

The worldwide resource of coastal wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunn |first=Kester |last2=Stock-Williams |first2=Clym |date=August 2012 |title=Quantifying the global wave power resource |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112001310 |journal=Renewable Energy |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=44 |pages=296–304 |access-date=27 February 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south [[temperate zones]] have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing [[westerlies]] in these zones blow strongest in winter.

[[File:World wave energy resource map.png|thumb|World wave energy resource map]]

== Challenges ==

There is a potential impact on the marine environment. Noise pollution, for example, could have negative impact if not monitored, although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly.&lt;ref name="ocs"/&gt; Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/mre/background.asp Marine Renewable Energy Programme], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Retrieved 2011-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Hackett]]:''Economic and Social Considerations for Wave Energy Development in California'' [http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-500-2008-083/CEC-500-2008-083.PDF CEC Report Nov 2008] Ch2, pp22-44 [[California Energy Commission]]|Retrieved 2008-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"/&gt; Since 2008, Seabased Industry AB (SIAB) has deployed several units of wave energy converters (WECs) manufactured with different designs. Offshore deployments of WECs and underswater substation are being complicated procedures. SIAB discussed these deployments in terms of economy and time efficiency, as well as safety. Certain solutions are suggested for the various problems encountered during the deployments. It is found that the offshore deployment process can be optimized in terms of cost, time efficiency and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzigiannakou|first=Maria Angeliki|last2=Dolguntseva|first2=Irina|last3=Leijon|first3=Mats|date=2017-03-25|title=Offshore Deployments of Wave Energy Converters by Seabased Industry AB|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/5/2/15|journal=Journal of Marine Science and Engineering|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=15|doi=10.3390/jmse5020015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave farms ==

{{Main|Wave farm}}A group of wave energy devices deployed in the same location is called [[wave farm]], wave power farm or wave energy park. Wave farms represent a solution to achieve larger electricity production. The devices of a park are going to interact with each other hydrodynamically and electrically, according to the number of machines, the distance among them, the geometric layout, the wave climate, the local geometry,  the control strategies. The design process of a wave energy farm is a multi-[[optimization problem]] with the aim to get a high power production and low costs and power fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giassi|first=Marianna|last2=Göteman|first2=Malin|date=April 2018|title=Layout design of wave energy parks by a genetic algorithm|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=154|pages=252–261|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wood''' is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the [[Plant stem|stems]] and roots of [[tree]]s and other [[woody plant]]s. It is an [[organic material]], a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.|date=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and [[nutrient]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]], other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.

Wood has been used for thousands of years for [[fuel]], as a [[construction material]], for making [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] and [[paper]]. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as [[cellophane]] and [[cellulose acetate#production|cellulose acetate]].

As of 2005, the growing stock of [[forest]]s worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters, 47% of which was commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/A0400E/A0400E06.pdf|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an abundant, [[carbon-neutral]] renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Horst H.

==History==

Wood can be dated by [[carbon dating]] and in some species by [[dendrochronology]] to determine when a wooden object was created.

People have used wood for thousands of years for many purposes, including as a [[fuel]] or as a [[construction]] material for making [[house]]s, [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]], [[packaging]], [[artwork]]s, and [[paper]]. Known [[construction]]s using wood date back ten thousand years. Buildings like the European Neolithic long house were made primarily of wood.

Recent use of wood has been enhanced by the addition of steel and bronze into construction.&lt;ref name="A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sarah|title=A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century|url=http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|website=EcoBUILDING|publisher=A Publication of The American Institute of Architects|accessdate=March 28, 2017|ref=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051421/http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|archivedate=March 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealized vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and [[root]]s, to form a [[growth ring]].]]

===Growth rings===
{{main article|Growth rings}}

Wood, in the strict sense, is yielded by [[tree]]s, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as [[secondary growth]]; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].

Where the differences between the four seasons are distinct, e.g. [[New Zealand]], growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. [[Singapore]]), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.

If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212121121/http://farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html |date=December 12, 2009 }} www.farmforestline.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).

===Knots===
&lt;!--[[Wood knot]] and [[Knot (wood)]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|left|A knot on a tree trunk]]

As a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base, and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular "solid" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood "flows" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.

In the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.

In grading [[lumber]] and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.

[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|upright|Wood knot in vertical section]]
{{quote|''Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than when under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.''|Samuel J. Record|The Mechanical Properties of Wood&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book
 |last = Record
 |first = Samuel J

Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber, this will depend on the size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.

In some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution ([[knotting (wood treatment)|knotting]]), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.

===Heartwood and sapwood===&lt;!-- [[Sapwood (wood)]] redirects here --&gt;
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|thumb|right|A section of a [[Taxus|Yew]] branch showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood, dark heartwood, and [[pith]] (center dark spot). The dark radial lines are small knots.]]
'''Heartwood''' (or duramen&lt;ref name=eb-duramen&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Duramen|volume=8|page=692|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay. Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.&lt;ref&gt;Shigo, Alex. (1986) ''A New Tree Biology Dictionary''. Shigo and Trees, Associates. {{ISBN|0943563127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood, and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.

Sapwood (or alburnum&lt;ref name="eb-alburnum"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum|volume=1|page=516|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,&lt;ref&gt;Capon, Brian (2005), Botany for Gardeners (2nd ed.), Portland, OR: Timber Publishing, p. 65 {{ISBN|0881926558}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.

The term ''heartwood'' derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[hickory]], [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IbjPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=The+term+heartwood+derives+solely+from+its+position+and+not+from+any+vital+importance+to+the+tree+as+a+tree+can+thrive+with+heart+completely+decayed#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20term%20heartwood%20derives%20solely%20from%20its%20position%20and%20not%20from%20any%20vital%20importance%20to%20the%20tree%20as%20a%20tree%20can%20thrive%20with%20heart%20completely%20decayed&amp;f=false|title=The Mechanical Properties of Wood: Including a Discussion of the Factors Affecting the Mechanical Properties, and Methods of Timber Testing|last=Record|first=Samuel James|date=1914|publisher=J.

No definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.

When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.

It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.

Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.

===Color===
[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] is distinctively red.]]
In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.

Some experiments on very resinous [[longleaf pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called "fat lighter". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.

Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.

Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.

===Water content===
Water occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:
* in the [[cell wall]]s,
* in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem

In heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8–16% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.

The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.

Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&amp;nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.

The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book

===Structure===

Wood is a [[heterogeneous]], [[hygroscopic]], [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] material. It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of [[cellulose]] (40–50%) and [[hemicellulose]] (15–25%) impregnated with [[lignin]] (15–30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|title=Wood Properties Growth and Structure 2015|work=treetesting.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313044617/http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coniferous or [[softwood]] species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, [[tracheid]]s, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most [[hardwood]]s. There are no vessels ("pores") in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.

The structure of hardwoods is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalvetcontent.edu.au/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/b2f0fcee-47cb-4650-b248-f533d73d5428/13_05/toolbox13_05/unit9_selecting_timber/section2_characteristics/lesson2_hardwood.htm|title=Timber Plus Toolbox, Selecting timber, Characteristics of timber, Structure of hardwoods|work=nationalvetcontent.edu.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810184152/https://nationalvetcontent.edu.au/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/b2f0fcee-47cb-4650-b248-f533d73d5428/13_05/toolbox13_05/unit9_selecting_timber/section2_characteristics/lesson2_hardwood.htm|archivedate=August 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by [[vessel element|vessels]]: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others ([[Aesculus|buckeye]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]]) too small to be seen without a hand lens. In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ''ring-porous'' and ''diffuse-porous''.&lt;ref name=sperry1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sperry|first=John S. |author2=Nichols, Kirk L. |author3=Sullivan, June E. |author4=Eastlack, Sondra E.|title=Xylem Embolism in ring-porous, diffuse-porous, and coniferous trees of Northern Utah and Interior Alaska |journal=Ecology |date=1994 |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1736–1752 |jstor=1939633 |doi=10.2307/1939633 |url=http://bioweb.biology.utah.edu/sperry/publications/Sperry%20et%20al.%201994%20Ecology.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, [[catalpa]], chestnut, [[elm]], hickory, [[mulberry]], and oak,&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; the larger vessels or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) are localized in the part of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row. Examples of this kind of wood are [[Alnus|alder]],&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; [[Tilia|basswood]],&lt;ref name="Record1914"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel James Record|title=The mechanical properties of wood, including a discussion of the factors affecting the mechanical properties, and methods of timber testing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVgDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|year=1914|publisher=J.

===Earlywood and latewood===

====In softwood====
[[File:Wood Pseudotsuga taxifolia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a softwood; radial view, growth rings closely spaced in [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]]]]
In temperate softwoods, there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.

If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pines]] there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.

It is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.

No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.

====In ring-porous woods====
[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''; tangential view, wide growth rings]]
In ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.

In the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.

In ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.

Wide-ringed wood is often called "second-growth", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such "second-growth" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:
:"The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough."&lt;ref name=USforest&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory. ''[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm The Wood Handbook: Wood as an engineering material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315214043/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm |date=March 15, 2007 }}''. General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:

:"When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter."&lt;ref name=USforest/&gt;

====In diffuse-porous woods====
In the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.

In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.

===Monocot wood===
[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|Trunks of the [[coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]
Structural material that resembles ordinary, "dicot" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.

===Specific gravity===
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986),&lt;ref name="tim"&gt;Timell, T.E. 1986. Compression wood in gymnosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 2150 p.&lt;/ref&gt; as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as ''basic specific gravity'' (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt;

===Wood density===

{{See also|Janka hardness test}}

Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “one fairly easily measured wood characteristic” (Elliott 1970).&lt;ref name="ell"&gt;Elliott, G.K. 1970. Wood density in conifers. Commonwealth For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Commun. 8. 44 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Age, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, [[silviculture|silvicultural]] treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt; Variation of specific gravity within the [[trunk (botany)|bole]] of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

==Hard and soft woods==

It is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.

There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].

==Chemistry of wood==
[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of [[lignin]], which comprises about 25% of wood dry matter and is responsible for many of its properties.]]
The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]]) by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mémotech Bois et Matériaux Associés|date=1996|publisher=Éditions Casteilla|location=Paris|isbn=978-2713516450|page=22|author= Jean-Pierre Barette|author2= Claude Hazard et Jérôme Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also contains [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other elements in small quantity.

Aside from water, wood has three main components. [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%. Next in abundance is [[hemicellulose]], which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. [[Lignin]] is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.

In chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]]. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]]. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.&lt;ref name=boerjan&gt;{{cite journal| author = W. Boerjan| author2 =  J. Ralph| author3 = M. Baucher|date=June 2003| title = Lignin biosynthesis| journal = Annu. Rev.

===Extractives===
Aside from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]], wood consists of a variety of low [[molecular weight]] [[organic compound]]s, called ''extractives''. The wood [[extract]]ives are [[fatty acid]]s, [[resin acid]]s, [[wax]]es and [[terpene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Mimms |first = Agneta |author2=Michael J. Kuckurek |author3=Jef A.

A Compilation of Notes |publisher = TAPPI Press |date = 1993 |pages = 6–7 |isbn = 978-0898523225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[rosin]] is exuded by [[Pinophyta|conifers]] as protection from [[insect]]s. The extraction of these organic materials from wood provides [[tall oil]], [[turpentine]], and rosin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a23_073 |chapter=Resins, Natural |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2000 |last1=Fiebach |first1=Klemens |last2=Grimm |first2=Dieter |isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Fuel===
{{Main article|Wood fuel}}
Wood has a long history of being used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jFvrF4DaZcgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+has+a+long+history+of+being+used+as+fuel#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20has%20a%20long%20history%20of%20being%20used%20as%20fuel&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Fuels and the Environment|last=Sterrett|first=Frances S.|date=1994-10-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0873719780|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.

===Construction===

[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&amp;nbsp;– Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=December 16, 2008 }}",''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).

Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America. Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA7-PA15&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+to+be+used+for+construction+work+is+commonly+known+as+lumber+in+North+America#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20to%20be%20used%20for%20construction%20work%20is%20commonly%20known%20as%20lumber%20in%20North%20America&amp;f=false|title=Materials for Interior Environments|last=Binggeli|first=Corky|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1118421604|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[Populus|poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].

[[File:Преображенская церковь (деревянная) (1714 г.) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]
New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.

In buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.

Wood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mold into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.

====Wood flooring====
[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]
{{Main article |Wood flooring}}A solid wood floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a single piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses moisture from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.

Solid hardwood flooring is usually cheaper than engineered timbers and damaged areas can be sanded down and refinished repeatedly, the number of times being limited only by the thickness of wood above the tongue.

Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors as well as most traditional wood blocks, [[mosaic]]s and [[parquetry]].

====Engineered wood====
{{main article |Engineered wood}}

Engineered wood products, glued building products "engineered" for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.&lt;ref name="apawood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf|title=APA – The Engineered Wood Association|work=apawood.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627045932/http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed%2FE30.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL) products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.&lt;ref name="apawood" /&gt; Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.

Wood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic materials]]. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].

===Furniture and utensils===
Wood has always been used extensively for [[furniture]], such as [[chairs]] and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]] and [[pencil]].

===Next generation wood products===
Further developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|title=FPInnovations|work=forintek.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319100903/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.&lt;ref&gt;"System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements" I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the arts===
[[File:Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion MET DP371962.jpg|thumb|''[[Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion]]'', [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]]]
Wood has long been used as an [[media (arts)|artistic medium]]. It has been used to make sculptures and [[wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'').

Other uses of wood in the arts include:
* [[Woodcut]] [[printmaking]] and [[wood engraving|engraving]]
* Wood can be a surface to paint on, such as in [[panel painting]]
* Many [[musical instrument]]s are made mostly or entirely of wood

===Sports and recreational equipment===
Many types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]]. The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA|parquetry]].

Many other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[titanium]] or [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]]. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] commonly known as the ''[[wood (golf)|woods]]'', the heads of which were traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of [[Wood (golf)#Drivers|drivers]]) carbon-fiber composites.

==Bacterial degradation==
Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose. [[Symbiotic bacteria]] in ''[[Xylophaga]]'' may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood; while bacteria such as ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', ''[[Flavobacteria]]'', ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', ''[[Clostridia]]'', and ''[[Bacteroidetes]]'' have been detected in wood submerged over a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life|author1=Christina Bienhold|author2=Petra Pop Ristova|author3=Frank Wenzhöfer|author4=Thorsten Dittmar|author5=Antje Boetius|journal=PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue=1|pages=e53590|date=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053590|pmid=23301092|pmc=3534711|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853590B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Woolly Worm Festival''' is an event held each October since 1973 in [[Banner Elk]] and [[Beech Mountain, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;[http://www.romanticasheville.com/woolly_worm_festival.htm "Woolly Worm Festival, Banner Elk "]. ''Ashville &amp; NC Mountains 2013 Travel Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival celebrates the supposed weather-predicting abilities of the woolly worm, also called "woolly bear" which is a caterpillar or larvae of the [[Isabella tiger moth]].  Events include a caterpillar race.

==The caterpillar==
The Isabella Tiger Moth belongs to the subfamily [[Arctiinae (moth)|Arctiinae]] which has 11,000 species around the world.&lt;ref name="fa"&gt;[http://www.almanac.com/content/predicting-winter-weather-woolly-bear-caterpillars "Predicting Winter Weather: Woolly Bear Caterpillars"]. ''Old Farmers' Almanac'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to settling in for winter, the woolly worm eats a variety of plants and then produces a kind of antifreeze which protects the creature from temperatures as low as -90 degrees Fahrenheit.  This caterpillar seeks safety from bitter winter weather by sheltering under logs, boulders, boards, rocks, and other dark places until emerging from its "frozen" state in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lancaster.unl.edu/feature/guess10_3.htm "A Woolly Bear Caterpillar".] ''University of Nebraska''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weather forecasting==
It's accepted by organizers of the North Carolina woolly worm festival that the color of the worm's thirteen body segments or stripes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDU9pM2RgNc Woolly Worm Festival in Banner Elk NC "Woolly Worm Festival".] ''National Geographic Traveller''.&lt;/ref&gt; can be read and interpreted as a forecaster of the severity of coming winter.&lt;ref name="wc"&gt;[http://www.weather.com/news/woolly-worm-winter-20121020 "Woolly Worm Predicts Snowy Winter in Western N.C. "] ''The Weather Channel'', 20 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not everyone recognizes the woolly worm as an accredited weather forecaster, the worm is held in esteem by festival celebrants because of its proclaimed 80-85 percent accuracy rate in predictions.&lt;ref name=wc /&gt;

==The festival==
Each year attendance at this mountain celebration averages 15,000-20-000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1698&amp;catid=1&amp;Itemid=157 "Woolly Worm Festival Draws 20,000 to Banner Elk"]. ''goBlueridge.net'', 20 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  It's been featured in the world-famous [[Farmers' Almanac]]&lt;ref name=fa /&gt; and the [[Kiwanis|Kiwanis International Magazine]].

Presiding over the yearly festival is a Master of Ceremonies.&lt;ref name=hcp&gt;Hunter, David. [http://www.highcountrypress.com/weekly/2010/10-14-10/do-you-know-mr.htm "Do You Know Mr. Woolly Worm?"]. ''High Country Press'', 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the festival's mascot Merriweather, he's responsible for ensuring festival rules are rigorously kept, in particular in regard to the caterpillar race. About 1200 worms  are entered to compete, in at least 50 heats. During each heat worms must race 42 inches up a vertical string attached to cardboard on the backboard of a flatbed trailer.  People are allowed to 'holler' and whistle to encourage their worm to race. Each heat consists of 20 worms and races continue all day until the grand final at about 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=guide /&gt;  The winning worm is announced as official forecaster, and its owner wins a monetary prize. The festival proceeds after expenses are distributed for support of community efforts and charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wataugademocrat.com/mountaintimes/woolly-worm-proceeds-benefit-local-nonprofits/article_9ac8c993-3682-5b92-9c74-e496d18d4db6.html "Woolly Worm proceeds benefit local nonprofits"].

'''Zincochromite''' is a [[zinc]] [[chromium]] [[oxide mineral]] with the formula ZnCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is the zinc analogue of [[chromite]], hence the name.  It was first described in 1987 as an occurrence in a [[uranium]] deposit near [[Lake Onega]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; It has also been reported from Dolo Hill, [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], and from the Tarkwa Mine in the Ashanti gold belt of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;
