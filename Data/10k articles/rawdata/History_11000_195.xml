The '''12 May Karachi violence''', also known as '''Black Saturday riots''', were a series of violent clashes between rival political activists in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unrest began as the recently suspended [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|chief justice]] [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] arrived at the [[Jinnah International Airport]] on 12 May 2007. Gunfights and clashes erupted across the provincial capital as [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) , [[Awami National Party]] (ANP), and [[Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party]] (PMAP) activists, who supported the judge, and the pro-government [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) activists took to the streets against each other. Government machinery was used to block all major roads. Police was accomplice and a silent spectator to the violence. News media was attacked at Guru mandir (Business Recorder Road) when MQM activists began firing at AAJ TV headquarters which was shown on live television.&lt;ref name="deserted"&gt;{{cite web

Chaudhry's supporters had announced a public rally to welcome the judge while at the same time, the MQM also announced a demonstration of their own to protest against the politicisation of the issue of judge's suspension. The MQM made plans to deliberately converge at the mausoleum of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] where the chief justice was to make an appearance to address a lawyers' convention and a bar association meeting&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news

Before the citywide riots escalated, several roads were cordoned off and all routes to the airport were blocked to avoid clashes between groups. In the carnage that ensued, armed groups did a lot of carnage, cars were burnt and buildings smashed into while the ensuing gunfights left more than 40 people killed with several hundred injured and arrested. The violence continued for several days, culminating in events that led to the historic [[Lawyers' Movement]].

Several lawmakers and analysts have since questioned the incompetence of the city's security apparatus on the day of the riots and the complicity of MQM in giving rise to the riots.&lt;ref name="accurate_fatalities"&gt;{{cite web

When the Musharraf administration asked the judge to quit, Chaudhry refused to go.&lt;ref name="chaudhry_special_aljazeera" /&gt; On 9 March 2007, Musharraf had no other choice but to suspend Chaudhry from his post for alleged and unspecified charges of misconduct and misuse of authority.&lt;ref name="judge_sacked"&gt;{{cite news|first=Isambard|last=Wilkinson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1545843/Crisis-for-Musharraf-over-justice-chiefs-sacking.html|title=Crisis for Musharraf over justice chief's sacking|date=17 March 2007|location=[[Islamabad]]|work=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacking of the head of the judiciary sparked bloody protests throughout [[Pakistan]] and "edged the country towards a constitutional crisis".&lt;ref name="judge_sacked" /&gt; The civil unrest grew with regards to the validity of the allegations as well as doubts as to whether Musharraf had the power to suspend the chief justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyindia.com/show/140656.php/Suspended-Pak-CJ-arrives-in-Karachi-amid-violence-and-tight-security|publisher=Daily India|title=Suspended Pak CJ arrives in Karachi amid violence and tight security|date=12 May 2007|accessdate=12 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201642/http://www.dailyindia.com/show/140656.php/Suspended-Pak-CJ-arrives-in-Karachi-amid-violence-and-tight-security|archive-date=27 September 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on these grounds that Chaudhry waged a legal battle in the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] seeking his reinstatement. He called his suspension a "thinly veiled assault on the independence of judiciary in Pakistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara|last=Plett|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6620000/newsid_6629200/6629227.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;ms3=6&amp;ms_javascript=true&amp;bbcws=2|title=Lahore welcomes ousted judge|type=Video|date=6 May 2007|work=BBC World News|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationwide protests and media ban===
On 5 May 2007, in showing solidarity with the former chief justice, a motorcade of Chaudhry's supporters rode with him from [[Islamabad]] to [[Lahore]] where he was expected to speak at the [[Lahore High Court|Lahore High Court Bar Association]] when this motorcade of over 2,000 vehicles was stopped by the police with [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton charges]] and [[tear gas]] shelling.&lt;ref name="support_rally_isl2lhr"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates concerning the day's events started being covered and discussed on the Pakistani news media.

The government wanted to limit the media coverage of Chaudhry's rallies and asked the Supreme Court to warn news networks that any "media coverage, discussion and analysis" that impeded legal procedures would be treated as [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/245698/it|title=It’s a purely judicial issue, says president|date=6 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court issued a statement in which it said the news media, and in particular [[Geo TV]] host [[Kamran Khan (journalist)|Kamran Khan]], had broadcast "sensational reporting aimed at scandalising and maligning the honourable judges of the Supreme Court". Khan defended his actions by saying he had no malicious intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/05/09/pakistan.judicial/index.html|title=Pakistan media ban over judge battle|date=9 May 2007|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when discussions of the Chaudhry's rallies persisted on television, the government decided to take drastic measures and abruptly pulled Geo TV and [[Aaj TV]] off air.

It wasn't until 9 May 2007 that the Pakistani government imposed a complete ban on the media from discussing the suspension of Chaudhry by Musharraf. Media outlets and journalists protested and responded to the ban saying that their goal was to cover, not contribute, to the controversy. The government, reluctantly, agreed to issue special passes for reporters and lawyers to attend the presidential reference filed against the chief justice.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; Several pro-government parties throughout Pakistan announced their own demonstrations to coincide with Chaudhry's rallies.

===Chaudhry's visit to Lahore High Court===
{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|align=right|quote="Nations and states which are based on dictatorship instead of the supremacy of the constitution, the rule of law and protection of basic rights get destroyed."|salign=right|source=— Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Lahore High Court, 6 May 2007.&lt;ref name="bbc_lhc_speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6629287.stm|title=Pakistan judge blasts 'dictators'|date=6 May 2007|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In anticipation of the former chief justice's arrival in Lahore, the Lahore High Court was thronged by political activists of several political parties in the opposition including [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP), [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] (PML-N), [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA) and [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI), who had gathered to welcome the judge. When Chaudhry did arrive at the Lahore High Court, his motorcade was swamped by supporters showering his vehicle with rose petals and chanting "Go Musharraf, Go!"&lt;ref name="bbc_lhc_speech" /&gt; Banners denouncing Musharraf were hung all around the compound.&lt;ref name="lahore"/&gt;

In his historical speech on 6 May 2007, the former chief justice made no direct references to president Musharraf but directed his rhetoric towards the government by calling it a "dictatorship".&lt;ref name="bbc_lhc_speech" /&gt; Several political commentators refer to this speech as the precursor to the [[Lawyers' Movement]] later that year. Chaudhry also accused the government of violating the basic human rights of its citizens and warned that the countries and nations that don't learn from past mistakes were bound to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="lahore"/&gt; In closing his speech, Chaudhry announced he would be attending a [[Sindh High Court|Sindh High Court Bar Association]] meeting in [[Karachi]] on 12 May 2007.

===Opposition plans to welcome Chaudhry===
After Chaudhry announced his plans for Karachi, the political parties in the opposition announced a rally to welcome the former chief justice in their city. Upon seeing Chaudhry's supporters announce a rally to welcome the chief justice, the pro-government [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) organised a [[Demonstration (protest)|protest demonstration]] of their own against the "politicisation of the issue [of the justice's suspension]".&lt;ref name="rival_protests"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246640/karachi-braces-for-show-of-strength-by-rivals|title=Karachi braces for show of strength by rivals|date=11 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing the chief justice's determination to visit Karachi, MQM MNA Nawab Mirza proclaimed in a parliamentary session that "no one [would] be allowed to do anything in Karachi." He said that "[the] country [may belong] to everyone, but Karachi [belonged] to [the MQM]". The provincial government called a meeting of the senior officials and instructed them to not let the chief justice leave the airport at any cost. Sindh chief secretary Shakil Durrani learnt of these plans and called them a "contempt of the High Court's orders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Massoud|last=Ansari|url=http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2007/06/the-day-karachi-bled/|title=The Day Karachi Bled|date=12 June 2007|work=Newsline Pakistan|accessdate=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 2007, Pakistan International Human Rights Organisation filed a petition with the Sindh High Court pointing out reports in the press about Sindh home secretary Ghulam M. Muhtaram Naqvi's letter to the chief justice that requested him to postpone his visit because of intelligence reports suggesting threat of a terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="shc_directs_authorities"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246659/shc-directs-govt-to-ensure-security|title=SHC directs govt to ensure security|date=12 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court directed the federal and provincial governments to provide fool-proof security to the chief justice and also directed authorities not to pressurise him into changing his route while also keeping him informed of any security risks.&lt;ref name="shc_directs_authorities" /&gt;

===Unrest before Chaudhry's visit===
At {{nowrap|3 am}} on 10 May 2007, the residence of the Supreme Court Bar Association president [[Munir A. Malik]] came under attack by armed men. Malik, a member of the panel of lawyers defending Chaudhry, narrowly escaped the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246493/gunmen-attack-malik|title=Gunmen attack Malik’s house|date=11 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2007, Karachi Bar Association vice president Ziauddin Sardar was reported missing by his family. Following these incidents, uncertainty and fear gripped the city as the "threat of a showdown loomed large".&lt;ref name="rival_protests" /&gt;

Karachi Police informed it had arrested 150 people under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance on apprehensions they could "create problems" on the judge's arrival. However, opposition parties disputed the number of arrests – MMA put the figure at 500, PPP at 400 and PML-N at 150.&lt;ref name="rival_protests" /&gt;

==The day of the riots==
Fearing a showdown between rival political parties, the transporters in the city decided to keep their buses and vans off the road. In a late-night announcement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246657/public-holiday|title=Public holiday|date=12 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Government of Sindh|Sindh government]] announced the closure of all educational institutions as [[Governor of Sindh|governor]] [[Ishrat-ul-Ibad Khan|Dr Ishrat-ul-Ibad Khan]] declared a public holiday for government and private schools, colleges and universities on 12 May 2007.&lt;ref name="rival_protests" /&gt; Hospitals declared emergency and ordered their doctors and staff to remain on duty, while [[Naib Nazim]]a [[Nasreen Jalil]] directed all city departments including hospitals and fire-brigade to follow "[[standard operating procedure]]" to deal with any emergency situation that arises.&lt;ref name="rival_protests" /&gt;

===City-wide blockades set up===
[[File:Karachi streets deserted on 12 May 2007.jpg|thumb|300px|Streets throughout Karachi were left deserted on the day the riots broke out bringing the provincial capital to a halt.]]
Reports started emerging from around Karachi of blockades being set up on the way toward the [[Jinnah International Airport]] in a bid to stop the chief justice from visiting [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Muhammad Ali Jinnah's]] [[Mazar-e-Quaid|mausoleum]].&lt;ref name="sh_quaideen_blocked"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246651/cj-route-decision-today-malik|title=CJ route decision today: Malik|date=12 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of Shahrah-e-Quaideen were blocked&lt;ref name="sh_quaideen_blocked" /&gt; whereas the main arterial road [[Shahrah-e-Faisal]], which was to be used by procession of the chief justice, was completely made inaccessible.&lt;ref name="20070512_events"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246766/riots-disrupt-karachi-calm|title=Riots disrupt Karachi calm: 34 killed, 140 injured; rivals trade allegations|date=13 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most of the road leading to the airport were closed, the [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA) had to delay all its flight due to the non-availability of cockpit and cabin crews who were unable to reach the airport in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/13-May-2007/pia-flights-from-karachi-disrupted|title=PIA flights from Karachi disrupted|work=Daily Times|date=13 May 2007|accessdate=30 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001432/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/13-May-2007/pia-flights-from-karachi-disrupted#|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't just air traffic that was suspended but train services between Karachi and the rest of the country were also effected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/13-May-2007/trains-suspended-for-six-hours|title=Trains suspended for six hours|work=Daily Times|date=13 May 2007|accessdate=30 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002117/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/13-May-2007/trains-suspended-for-six-hours#|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaudhry's arrival in Karachi===
At {{nowrap|10 am}}, Chaudhry left [[Benazir Bhutto International Airport|Islamabad airport]] on flight PK-301 for Karachi accompanied by Zamurad Khan and Yousuf Talpur. The flight landed at the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi airport at {{nowrap|11:50 am}}.&lt;ref name="chaudhry_flight"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246616/cj-s-plane-to-take-off-for-karachi-at-10am|title=CJ’s plane to take off for Karachi at 10am|date=13 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunfights broke out throughout the city as soon as the plane landed at the airport; several vehicles were also set ablaze. Smoke rose from at least four different areas of the city where competing rallies were organised.&lt;ref name="deserted" /&gt;

The chief justice had plans to visit Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah's mausoleum to address a gathering and then to the Sindh High Court to address lawyers at the 50th anniversary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association. Due to the sudden violence that erupted throughout the city, the chief justice was unable to leave the airport.&lt;ref name="deserted" /&gt;

===Media offices attacked===
As the violence escalated, gunfights moved toward the Guru Mandir Square in the neighbourhood of [[Jamshed Quarters]]. The offices of various media outlets, in particular the [[Business Recorder|Business Recorder House]] which housed the Aaj TV newsroom and broadcast operations, became firsthand witnesses of the carnage. With the violence continuing right at their doorstep, Aaj TV reporters began telecasting live footage of the mayhem.&lt;ref name="aaj_attacks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246780/armed-men-attack-aaj-tv-office|title=Armed men attack Aaj TV office|work=Dawn|date=12 May 2007| accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aaj TV footage showed armed men brandishing weapons that they fired indiscriminately at rivals in an adjacent neighbourhood. The footage clearly showed these gunmen hoisting MQM flags. As soon as the footage started airing on television, the gunmen became aware they were being filmed and turned their guns towards the media offices.&lt;ref name="aaj_attacks" /&gt; The armed men fired at the office building and set cars ablaze in the parking lot beside the building.

The network's chief executive Arshad Zuberi later revealed that the gunmen were certainly affiliated with the MQM.&lt;ref name="aaj_attacks" /&gt; He stated that the "gunmen started [firing] indiscriminately at [the] office [and] no security was sent [even] though the firing went on for six hours". According to Zuberi, the armed men had wanted to stop the airing of the live footage.&lt;ref name="ibn"/&gt; Nevertheless, the network remained on air uninterrupted and no one was hurt during the attacks.&lt;ref name="aaj_attacks" /&gt;

In an editorial for the [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]], freelance journalist Urooj Zia wrote an eyewitness account of the carnage outside the Business Recorder House. She observed how the [[Pakistan Rangers|Rangers]] paramilitary force had let the violence continue under their noses. She mentioned how people were being stopped at gunpoint on the street by political activists and asked for identification while the police stood by idly.&lt;ref name="urooj_zia_eyewitness"&gt;{{cite news|first=Urooj|last=Zia|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/karachi/14-May-2007/a-tt-to-my-forehead-and-a-press-pass-in-my-pocket|title=A TT to my forehead and a press pass in my pocket|date=14 May 2007|work=Daily Times|accessdate=1 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715070412/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/karachi/14-May-2007/a-tt-to-my-forehead-and-a-press-pass-in-my-pocket#|archive-date=15 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence, carnage and mayhem===
During the rampage, it was mostly the supporters of Chaudhry who lost their lives. 15 members of [[Awami National Party]] (ANP) were killed (Pashtuns make up second largest ethnic group in Karachi with 7.0 millions pashtuns live in karachi). 14 supporters of PPP were also left dead in the massacre.&lt;ref name="ibn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/world/05_2007/gunmen-open-fire-at-pak-tv-channel-40437.html |title=Gunmen open fire at Pak TV channel |publisher=CNN-IBN |date=12 May 2007 |accessdate=12 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514025022/http://www.ibnlive.com/news/world/05_2007/gunmen-open-fire-at-pak-tv-channel-40437.html |archivedate=14 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PPP"/&gt;

More than 800 political workers were arrested, majority of whom were members of labor and student organizations that had been planning to greet Chaudhry on his arrival.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

===Government offers to transport Chaudhry===
Unable to leave the airport, the chief justice took refuge at the airport. Knowing that roads leading up to the airport were blocked and that his leaving may further precipitate bloodshed, Chaudhry's advisers asked him to stay put. Amidst the chaos, the government agreed to send a helicopter to transport him out of the airport but Chaudhry refused, indicating that he wished to travel by ground.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

According to Munir A. Malik, one of the lawyers accompanying Chaudhry, Musharraf's offer to transport Chaudhry by helicopter seemed more like an attempt to "kidnap" the chief justice.&lt;ref name="assassination"/&gt;

===Notice to deport the chief justice===
After a whole day of violence in the city, the Sindh administration issued a notification in the evening ordering the deportation of the chief justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Zeeshan|last=Mujahid|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/377984/may-12-mayhem-the-day-will-continue-to-haunt-the-nation/|title=May 12 mayhem: ‘The day will continue to haunt the nation’|date=13 May 2012|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this moment that Chaudhry "abandoned plans to address [his] supporters" and returned to Islamabad on the next flight. The chief justice was adamant that he would only leave the airport if he was provided with sufficient security and the accompaniment of his cadre of lawyers. Chaudhry's flight departed the Karachi airport at around {{nowrap|9 pm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/12/welcome.htm |title=Pakistan judge abandons rally after violence |accessdate=12 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514040648/http://dawn.com/2007/05/12/welcome.htm |archivedate=14 May 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Aitzaz Ahsan]], a prominent figurehead in Chaudhry's cadre, the chief justice had waited all day for permission to go to the Sindh High Court but was rather mistreated and asked to leave. He also accused the MQM of planning the mayhem in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bakhtawar|last=Mian|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246914/karachi-violence-was-planned-by-govt-lawyers|title=Karachi violence was planned by govt: lawyers|date=14 May 2007|work=Dawn|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of contention==
[[Human Rights Watch]], a non-government affiliated human rights watch dog based in [[New York City]], recently issued a statement indicating that "This [violence] can either be due to the incompetence of the government, or its complicity."&lt;ref name="ibn"/&gt; Their statement went on, "The sequence of events leading up to this violence, including statements from the provincial authorities and the arrest of hundreds of opposition activists in the last few days, indicates that the government, acting through its coalition partners, has deliberately sought to foment violence in Karachi." &lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Khalid|last=Qayum|first2=Hariz|last2=Zamir|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=akyDC.kOwvik&amp;refer=home|title=Pakistan Clashes Kill 30 in Karachi Over Top Judge|date=12 May 2007|accessdate= 12 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documents obtained by the BBC after the event, government security measures on the day of the planned demonstrations included the instruction that "no police personnel should carry any kind of weapon during the law and order duty with the rally".&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

Of note, among police officials were deployed for security duties in Karachi, only 21 in the entire city were armed. BBC analysts have indicated that the way police were deployed indicates that they were meant to prevent people from gaining access to the airport or to the Sindh High Court.&lt;ref name="PPP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6659137.stm |title=Karachi police told to go unarmed |author=Syed Shoaib Hasan |date=15 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518114324/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6659137.stm |archivedate=18 May 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Most of the city remained calm the day following the riots as security forces in armored personnel carriers and pickup trucks with mounted machine guns patrolled mostly peaceful and deserted streets.&lt;ref name="deserted"/&gt; Tensions were still high with the government authorising paramilitary troops to shoot anyone involved in "serious" violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/05/13/pakistan.karachi/|title=Shoot-on-sight orders issued to end riots|date=13 May 2007|work=CNN|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political opponents in the parliament blamed one another for the May 12 mayhem. MQM's [[Farooq Sattar]] blamed the opposition by saying that they were a "hundred percent, 200 percent" responsible for the situation in Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Salman|last=Masood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/world/asia/13pakistan.html?fta=y|title=At Least 27 Die as Violence Flares in Pakistan|date=13 May 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, opposition senator [[Mushahid Ullah Khan]] held the MQM responsible for the attacks in Karachi. [[National Party (Pakistan)|National Party]] senator and senior vice president [[Hasil Bizenjo]] underscored the need for an inquiry into the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-147475-Mushahidullah-blames-MQM-for-May-12-violence-in-Karachi|title=Mushahidullah blames MQM for May 12 violence in Karachi|date=12 May 2014|work=The News International|accessdate=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in the Daily Times said, “the possibility of any compromise to correct [Musharraf's] original mistake [of removing the chief justice] has vanished now ... the ante has been upped by the government.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Salman|last=Masood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/world/asia/13cnd-pakistan.html?hp|title=Pakistani Leader Assailed for Deadly Clashes|date=13 May 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killing of Syed Hammad Raza===
{{main|Syed Hammad Raza}}
At around {{nowrap|4:30 pm}} on 13 May 2007, Supreme Court additional registrar [[Syed Hammad Raza]] was shot dead near his home in Islamabad. Raza was a close associate of Chaudhry and a vital witness in the case against Chaudhry's suspension. After leaving Karachi, the chief justice visited Raza's widow Shabana the same night to present his condolences. [[Reuters]] reported Shabana telling Chaudhry, "You called him to Islamabad. You should have protected him, and now my children need protection as well.”&lt;ref name="shabana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-05-14T214020Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-298136-5.xml|title=Witness for Pakistan's suspended judge shot dead|author=Reuters|publisher=Reuters India|date=14 May 2007|accessdate=14 May 2007}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chaudhry's lawyer Tariq Mehmood, Raza was a prime witness in the case as he had witnessed the removal of files from the chief justice's chambers on the day of his suspension. He said that "[Raza] was under pressure."&lt;ref name="shabana"/&gt;

===Nationwide protests===
On 13 May 2007, opposition parties observed a "black day" and called for a general strike in Punjab on 14 May 2007.&lt;ref name="opposition_strikes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/246916/opposition-observes|title=Opposition observes ‘black day’|date=14 May 2007|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of PPP, PML-N, MMA, PTI, ANP, PMAP, and the [[Khaksars|Khaksar Tehrik]] called for action against the miscreants that spread violence on May 12 calling them "killers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/247879 PMAP slams MQM, govt for carnage.] ''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjab leadership of the MMA held the Sindh government responsible for the loss of lives.&lt;ref name="opposition_strikes" /&gt; The May 14 strikes in Lahore paralysed the city as opposition activists protested against the government response to the riots. 8,000 people, including lawyers and human rights activists, chanted "Out with Musharraf!" and "Death to [[Altaf Hussain (Pakistani politician)|Altaf Hussain]]!"&lt;ref name="assassination"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/world/asia/14cnd-stan.html?_r=1&amp;hp%3Cbr%3E&amp;oref=slogin|title=Pakistani Official Killed as Strike Called in Karachi|author=Salman Masood|date=14 May 2007|work=The New York Times| accessdate= 14 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, protestors burned [[effigy|effigies]] of Musharraf and hundreds forced their way through a police barricade.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

Authorities responded by banning demonstrations and declaring a national holiday. Shops were closed and public transportation was shut down in the country’s major cities. It is the largest strike in Pakistan since Musharraf assumed his presidency in 1999, with much of the unrest stemming from news reports that government troops were in Karachi,&lt;ref name="assassination"/&gt;

===Arrest of Rana Saleemullah Khan===
At a press conference on 14 May 2007, [[List of Chief Ministers of Sindh|Sindh chief minister]] [[Arbab Ghulam Rahim|Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim]] assured that the situation in Karachi was under control and that there had been no serious incidents of violence in the days following the initial May 12 riots, despite fears to the contrary. The chief minister also indicated that opposition parties had not sought permission from the provincial government to hold their rallies on 12 May 2007. He also said the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|general elections]] would be held as scheduled in a few months and accused the opposition of showing impatience in that regard.&lt;ref name="saleemullah_khan_arrested"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aaj.tv/2007/05/situation-in-karachi-under-control-arbab/|title=Situation in Karachi under control: Arbab|date=14 May 2007|work=Aaj News|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahim also revealed that the police had arrested former [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]] Rana Saleemullah Khan on court orders.&lt;ref name="saleemullah_khan_arrested" /&gt; Khan had been a vocal advocate of the chief justice and was Chaudhry's witness with regards to the Mannu Bheel case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adeel|last=Pathan|url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jun2007-weekly/nos-10-06-2007/kol.htm#1|title="If I have to lose my life in the line of duty I will." – Former DIG Saleemullah Khan remains defiant|date=10 June 2007|work=[[The News International]]|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the two witnesses in that case, alongside the recently killed Syed Hammad Raza.

===Abduction of Iqbal Kazmi===
{{main|Iqbal Kazmi}}
On 3 June 2007, the government announced that it would impose a ban on any televised live talk show that discusses the issue of the chief justice's suspension. It threatened to take punitive action against broadcasters that displayed an anti-state or anti-national stance and cast "aspersions on the integrity of the armed forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/05-Jun-2007/amended-pemra-ordinance-intolerable-ppp|title=Amended PEMRA Ordinance intolerable: PPP|date=5 June 2007|work=Daily Times|accessdate=30 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003722/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/05-Jun-2007/amended-pemra-ordinance-intolerable-ppp#|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Musharraf's decree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/06/05/pakistan-broadcast-media-muzzled-musharraf-s-decree|title=Pakistan: Broadcast Media Muzzled by Musharraf’s Decree|date=7 June 2007|work=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government amended the [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority|PEMRA Ordinance]] to impose these new restrictions on private television channels on 4 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/06-Jun-2007/ppp-and-pml-n-reject-amended-pemra-ord-support-journalists-protest|title=PPP and PML-N reject amended PEMRA Ord, support journalists' protest|date=6 June 2007|work=Daily Times|accessdate=30 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220310/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/06-Jun-2007/ppp-and-pml-n-reject-amended-pemra-ord-support-journalists-protest#|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties and lawyers campaigned against these amendments and observed a "black day" in solidarity with the broadcasters and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the petitioners was the civil rights activist [[Iqbal Kazmi|Syed Mohammad Iqbal Kazmi]] who had recently filed a petition in the Sindh High Court on the May 12 violence.&lt;ref name="kazmi_petition"&gt;{{cite news

Kazmi was abducted by unidentified persons on 6 June 2007 after he had filed his petition against the PEMRA ordinance. He was later released by his abductors on the condition that he would leave Karachi along with his family. However upon his release, Kazmi revealed that the reason for his abduction was rather his petition on the May 12 violence. He told of his harrowing ordeal where he was quizzed about his association with Imran Khan's PTI and the reasons as to why he named MQM founder and chief Altaf Hussain in his petition.&lt;ref name="kazmi_petition" /&gt; His petition had also included the names of several other major political and government figures as respondents alongside Hussain. The named respondents included Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim, [[Pakistan Ministry of Interior|federal interior secretary]] Syed Kamal Shah, adviser to Sindh CM on home affairs Waseem Akhtar, chief secretary Shakeel Durrani, home secretary Ghulam M. Muhtaram Naqvi, provincial police officer Niaz A. Siddiqui, CCPO Azhar A. Farooqui, and the [[Station House Officer|SHO]]s of City Courts and Jamshed Quarters police stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/06/09/top11.htm |title=Ordeal of freed May 12 petitioner |author=DAWN |date=14 May 2007 |work=dawn |accessdate=18 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611202120/http://www.dawn.com/2007/06/09/top11.htm |archivedate=11 June 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal inquisition==
Alongside Kazmi's petition, the Sindh High Court initiated its own suo moto proceedings issuing contempt of court notices to the federal interior secretary, Sindh chief secretary and home secretary, AIGP (acting PPO), Town Police Officer and other officials who were responsible for maintaining law and order on 12 May 2007.

'''17th century philosophy''' is generally regarded as seeing the start of [[modern philosophy]], and the shaking off of the medieval approach, especially [[scholasticism]]. It succeeded the [[Renaissance]] and preceded the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It is often considered to be part of [[early modern philosophy]].

==History==
The period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of [[René Descartes]], who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him.  The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders &amp;mdash;  philosophers who present unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]], and often [[politics]] and the physical sciences too. [[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1 "Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics"] ([[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[early modern philosophy]] is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.

The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Building upon their English predecessors [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], the three main empiricists were [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].  The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience.  Thus the rationalists took [[mathematics]] as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the [[physical sciences]]. 

This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of [[political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes)|Leviathan]]'', and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

The seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from [[theology]].  Thus, while philosophers still talked about &amp;ndash; and even offered arguments for the existence of &amp;ndash; a [[deity]], this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought.  (In the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the "Age of Reason", [[18th-century philosophy]] was to go still further, leaving theology and [[religion]] behind altogether.)

The '''7th millennium BC''' spanned the years 7000 through 6001 BC. During this time, [[agriculture]] spread from [[Anatolia]] to the [[Balkans]].

[[World population]] begins to grow at an exponential pace due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]], reaching perhaps 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Noël Biraben, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", ''Population'' 34-1 (1979), 13-25, estimates 40 million at 5000 BC and 100 million at 1600 BC, for an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. over the Chalcolithic to Middle Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the agricultural communities of the [[Middle East]], the [[cow]] was domesticated and use of [[pottery]] became common, spreading to [[Europe]] and [[South Asia]], and the first [[metal]] (gold and copper) ornaments were made.

Adherents of the '''9/11 Truth movement''' are [[conspiracy theorists]] who dispute the mainstream account of the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.  The group disputes the commonly accepted account that [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists hijacked four airliners, crashed them into [[the Pentagon]] and New York's [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]], whereupon the crashes led to [[the collapse of the Twin Towers]].

In a 2011 article in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Bartlett and Miller do an overview and analyze the members of the 9/11 Truth movement community. The authors find that people involved in this movement, which seemingly is a disparate group with very diversified backgrounds, could be classified into three groups. They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles, and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge) and conspiratorial stance.  Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience, and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartlett|first1=Jamie|last2=Miller|first2=Carl|title=A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|volume=35.4|issue=July/August|pages=43–46|year=2011|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views===
{{Main|9/11 conspiracy theories}}
Many adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement suspect that United States government insiders played a part in the attacks, or may have known the attacks were imminent, and did nothing to alert others or stop them.&lt;ref name="CBC-Speculation"/&gt; Some within the movement who argue that insiders within the United States government were directly responsible for the September 11 attacks often allege that the attacks were planned and executed in order to provide the U.S. with a pretext for going to war in the Middle East, and, by extension, as a means of consolidating.&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

According to these allegations, this would have given the Bush administration the justification for more widespread abuses of civil liberties and to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to ensure future supplies of oil.&lt;ref name="CBC-Speculation"/&gt; In some cases, even in the mainstream media, "hawks" in the [[White House]]—especially former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], and members of the ''[[Project for the New American Century]]'', a neoconservative think tank—have been accused of involvement in, or awareness of, the alleged plot.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Will|date=September 3, 2006|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|title=Viewing 9/11 From a Grassy Knoll - You won't believe what the conspiracy theorists are claiming-or will you?|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060903/11conspiracy_2.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422134537/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060903/11conspiracy_2.htm|archivedate=April 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manjoo-Anthrax"&gt;{{cite news|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|publisher=Slate|date=August 7, 2008|title=The Anthrax Truth Movement|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2196986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the organization ''9/11 Truth'' released a statement, signed by nearly 200 people, including many relatives of people who perished on September 11, 2001, that calls for an investigation into the attacks. It also asserted that unanswered questions would suggest that people within the administration of President George W. Bush may have deliberately allowed the attacks to happen. Actor [[Edward Asner]], former presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]], former congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]], former assistant secretary of housing [[Catherine Austin Fitts]], author [[Richard Heinberg]], [[Enver Masud]], founder of The Wisdom Fund, professors [[Richard Falk]] of the University of California, [[Mark Crispin Miller]] of New York University, Douglas Sturm of Bucknell University, Burns H. Weston of the University of Iowa College of Law and others signed the statement. In 2009, [[Van Jones]], a former advisor to President Obama, said he hadn't fully reviewed the statement before he signed and that the petition did not reflect his views "now or ever."&lt;ref name="salon-petition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossmeier|first=Vincent|journal=Salon|title=Would you still sign the 9/11 Truth petition?|date=September 11, 2009|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/11/truth_petition|accessdate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keating|first1=Joshua|last2=Downie|first2=James|title=The World's Most Persistent Conspiracy Theories |journal=Foreign Policy|date=September 10, 2009|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/10/the_worlds_most_popular_conspiracy_theories |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/09/08/08greenwire-embattled-van-jones-quits-but-czar-debates-rage-9373.html|newspaper=New York Times|title=Embattled Van Jones Quits, but "Czar" Debates Rage On|first=Michael|last=Burnham|date=September 8, 2009|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===9/11 Commission Report reaction===
To the consternation of the families and adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement, many of the questions that the [[9/11 Family Steering Committee]] put to the [[9/11 Commission]], chaired by former [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Thomas Kean]], were not asked in either the hearings nor in the Commission Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lloyd|last=de Vries|title=9/11 Report: The Open Question|date=July 20, 2004|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/21/iraq/main630797.shtml|accessdate=June 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603175951/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/21/iraq/main630797.shtml| archivedate=June 3, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorie Van Auken]], one of the [[Jersey Girls]], estimates that only 30% of their questions were answered in the final 9/11 Commission Report, published July 22, 2004.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The [[9/11 Family Steering Committee]] produced a website summarizing the questions they had raised to the Commission, indicating which they believe had been answered satisfactorily, which they believe had been addressed but not answered satisfactorily, and which they believe had been generally ignored in or omitted from the Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911independentcommission.org|title=The Family Steering Committee|publisher=911independentcommission.org|accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606114246/http://911independentcommission.org/ |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 339-page book, ''The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions'', by [[David Ray Griffin]], claimed the report had either omitted information or distorted the truth, providing 115 examples of his allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harmanci|first=Reyhan|title=An inside job?|date=March 30, 2006|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/30/NSGB3HTBQ61.DTL|publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abrams |first=Joseph |publisher=Fox News |title=Critics Demand Resignation of U.N.

On May 26, 2008 adjunct religious studies professor Blair Gadsby began a protest and a hunger strike outside the offices of [[United States Senate|Senator]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee for President [[John McCain]]'s office requesting McCain meet with the principal scientists and leaders of the 9/11 Truth movement, specifically Richard Gage, Steven Jones, and David Ray Griffin. McCain had written the foreword to the book ''Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand Up to the Facts'', published by the magazine ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;

Arizona Republican State Senator Karen Johnson joined the protest in support. On June 10, Johnson with Gadsby as her guest and other 9/11 Truth movement members in the audience, spoke before the [[Arizona State Senate]] espousing the [[Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center|controlled demolition theory]] and supporting a reopening of the 9/11 investigation.&lt;ref name="eastvalleytribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0604johnson0604.html|title=Lawmaker asks McCain to talk with 9/11 theorists|publisher=Arizona Republic|date=June 3, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a question, McCain said he did not meet Gadsby, adding: ''"Because I don't take well to threats."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2008/McCain_doesnt_want_to_impeach_Bush_0626.html|title=McCain doesn't want to impeach Bush|publisher=Rawstory.com|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604002804/http://rawstory.com/news/2008/McCain_doesnt_want_to_impeach_Bush_0626.html|archivedate=June 4, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial government investigation, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Report (May 2002) NIST Report, numerous responses were written by members of the 9/11 Truth movement. Many of these responses claimed that it ignored key evidence suggesting an explosive demolition, "distorted reality" by using deceptive language and diagrams, and attacked [[straw man]] arguments, such as the 2005 article by [[Jim Hoffman]] entitled ''Building a better mirage: NIST's 3-year $20,000,000 Cover Up of the Crime of the Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/17162|title=KPFA 94.1, Guns and Butter|publisher=Kpfa.org|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=May 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614070353/http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/17162|archivedate=June 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, [[Steven E. Jones]], then a professor at [[Brigham Young University]], announced a paper criticizing the NIST Report and describing his hypothesis that the WTC towers had been intentionally demolished by explosives. This paper garnered some mainstream media attention, including an appearance by Jones on [[MSNBC]]. This was the first such programming on a major cable news station. Jones was criticized by his university for making his claims public before vetting them through the approved peer review process. He was placed on paid leave and has since retired.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMorning_pleave&gt;{{cite news|first=Tad|last=Walch|title=BYU places "9/11 truth" professor on paid leave|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645199800,00.html|publisher=Deseret Morning News|date=September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USNW_BYUtakes&gt;{{cite news|first=Will |last=Sullivan |title=BYU takes on a 9/11 conspiracy professor |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060911/11conspiracy.htm |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |date=September 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430003625/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060911/11conspiracy.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2009 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, in April 2007, some 9/11 victims' family members and some members of the new ''Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice'' submitted an additional request for correction to NIST, containing their own views on the defects in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocio.os.doc.gov/ITPolicyandPrograms/Information_Quality/ssLINK/PROD01_004108|title=Request for Correction|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST responded to this request in September 2007 supporting their original conclusions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.os.doc.gov/s/groups/public/@doc/@os/@ocio/@oitpp/documents/content/prod01_004622.pdf|title=Communication re Information Quality Request #07-06|format=PDF|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the originators of the request wrote back to them in October 2007, asking them to reconsider their response.

===Pamphlets at National September 11 Museum===
Members of the movement distributed pamphlets that they say told the "truth" about the attacks at the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] when the Museum opened in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/20/911-truthers-plan-propaganda-brochures-museum-open/ |title=9/11 truthers to distribute propaganda at museum opening |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of the official reports, a number of interconnected 9/11 Truth movement organizations have been formed.

The organization co-sponsored opinion polls conducted by the U.S. market research and opinion polling firm [[Zogby International]] that have shown [[Opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories|substantial numbers of people believing]] the government did not tell the full truth about the September 11 attacks.

===Scholars for 9/11 Truth===
The original ''Scholars for 9/11 Truth'' was founded by [[James H. Fetzer]], a former philosophy professor, and physicist Steven E. Jones, in December 2005. It was a group of people of varying backgrounds and expertise who rejected the mainstream media and government account of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="Barber"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/06/AR2006080600393.html|first=Justin|last=Pope|title=9/11 Conspiracy Theories Persist, Thrive|newspaper=Washington Post|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=September 17, 2009 |quote=[...] Barrett will teach a class on Islam at the University of Wisconsin this fall, over the protests of more than 60 state legislators. Jones is a tenured physicist at Brigham Young University [...] co-founder James Fetzer, a retired philosophy professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the group invited many ideas and hypotheses to be considered. However, leading members soon came to feel that the inclusion of some theories advocated by Fetzer — such as the use of directed energy weapons or miniature nuclear bombs to destroy the Twin Towers—were insufficiently supported by evidence and were exposing the group to ridicule. By December 2006, Jones and others set up a new scholars group, [[9/11 truth movement#Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice|Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice]], whose focus is to use scientific analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/index.html|title=Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice|publisher=Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original members took a vote on which group to join and the majority voted to move to the new group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/faq.html#quest7|title=Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice===
Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice (STJ) formed in January 2007 and is a self-described "group of scholars and supporters endeavoring to address the unanswered questions of the September 11, 2001 attack through scientific research and public education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/index.html |title=Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice |publisher=Stj911.org |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is composed of more than 900 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/members/index.html|title=STH911 Members|publisher=Stj911.org|accessdate=July 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221732/http://stj911.org/members/index.html|archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Richard Gage (architect)|Richard Gage]], Steven E. Jones, [[Jim Hoffman]], [[David Ray Griffin]], Peter Phillips, and former Congressman [[Daniel Hamburg]]. Most members support the conspiracy theory that the World Trade Center Towers and the third skyscraper, WTC 7, were destroyed through [[Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center|explosive demolition]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In 2008 and 2009, several members of the Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice published essays in science and engineering journals. In April 2008, a letter by some of its members, was published in ''The Open Civil Engineering Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bentham-open.org/pages/content.php?TOCIEJ/2008/00000002/00000001/35TOCIEJ.SGM |author=Jones, Steven E. |authorlink=Steven E.

===9/11 Commission Campaign===
Founded in 2011 by Senator [[Mike Gravel]], the 9/11 Commission Campaign's objective is to enact subpoena-capable, state-level commissions through state ballot initiatives, namely in Oregon, Alaska and California.&lt;ref name="911commissioncampaign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://9-11cc.org |title=About the 9-11 Commission Campaign |publisher=9-11cc.org |date=July 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220127/http://9-11cc.org/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These commissions are envisioned as citizen-driven, independent organizations that would form a semi-unified grassroots national presence by exercising [[joint powers authority]].

===Hispanic Victims Group===
The Hispanic Victims Group is a group created after the 9/11 attacks, founded by [[William Rodriguez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Senior|first=Jennifer|title=The Memorial Warriors|magazine=New York Magazine|url=http://nymag.com/news/articles/wtc/1year/families.htm|accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supporter of the 9/11 Truth movement. The group was one of the key forces behind the creation of the 9/11 Commission.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"/&gt; William Rodriguez, as founder of the group, was a member of the Families Advisory Council for the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC).&lt;ref name="renewnyc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=5a791121-7404-4553-92ec-19c9b64237ad|publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|date=January 31, 2002|title=Chairman Whitehead Announces LMDC Advisory Councils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===
Members of the 9/11 truth organizations, such as 911truth.org and Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice, regularly hold meetings and conferences to discuss ongoing research about 9/11 and to strategize about how best to achieve their goals. Many of these conferences are organized by 911truth.org, and some have been covered by the international media.&lt;ref name="nationalpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=2bcf9f07-6407-4b2c-9f4e-7d4a15afcb98&amp;k=46273 |title=Canada National Post: A theory that just won't die |publisher=Canada.com |date=July 28, 2006 |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212210153/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=2bcf9f07-6407-4b2c-9f4e-7d4a15afcb98&amp;k=46273 |archivedate=February 12, 2012 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opponents==
[[Matt Taibbi]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' assessed that the movement "gives supporters of [[George W. Bush|Bush]] an excuse to dismiss critics of this administration", and expressed concerns about the number of people who believe in 9/11 conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taibbi |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Taibbi |year=2006 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11818067/the_low_post_the_hopeless_stupidity_of_911_conspiracies/1 |title=The Low Post: I, Left Gatekeeper |work=Politics |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017051120/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11818067/the_low_post_the_hopeless_stupidity_of_911_conspiracies/1 |archivedate=October 17, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) engineering professor [[Thomas W. Eagar]] was at first unwilling to acknowledge the concerns of the movement, saying that "if (the argument) gets too mainstream, I'll engage in the debate". In response to Steven E. Jones' publication of a hypothesis that the World Trade Center was destroyed by controlled demolition, Eagar said that adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement would use the reverse scientific method to arrive at their conclusions, as they "determine what happened, throw out all the data that doesn't fit their conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walch|first=Tad|year=2006|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645200098,00.html|title=Controversy dogs Y.'s Jones |work=Utah news |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|accessdate=September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling conspiracy theorists "the truthers", [[Bill Moyers]] has quoted journalist Robert Parry by stating that the theorists "...threw out all the evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement, from contemporaneous calls from hijack victims on the planes to confessions from al-Qaeda leaders both in and out of captivity that they had indeed done it. Then, recycling some of the right's sophistry techniques, such as using long lists of supposed evidence to overcome the lack of any real evidence, the 'truthers' cherry-picked a few supposed 'anomalies' to build an 'inside-job' story line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moyers|first=Bill|url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/02/15-7|title=Is This a Private Fight or Can Anyone Get In It?|publisher=Common Dreams|accessdate=May 30, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628201056/http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/02/15-7|archivedate=June 28, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
A prominent author of the 9/11 Truth movement literature is theologian [[David Ray Griffin]]. His two books, ''[[The New Pearl Harbor]]: Disturbing Questions about the Bush Administration and 9/11'' (March 2004), which claimed to outline a methodical, deductive framework for researching 9/11, and ''The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions'' (October 2004), became best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reid|first=Sue|title=An explosion of disbelief - fresh doubts over 9/11|journal=Daily Mail|date=February 9, 2007|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-435265/An-explosion-disbelief--fresh-doubts-9-11.html|location=London, UK|accessdate=September 17, 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091002122051/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-435265/An-explosion-disbelief--fresh-doubts-9-11.html| archivedate=October 2, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin's ''Debunking 9/11 Debunking'' (May 2007) looks at the way magazines such as ''Popular Mechanics'' have sought to debunk the alternative 9/11 theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CMZ12AxBOh8C&amp;dq=Debunking+9/11+Debunking|title=Debunking 9/11 debunking: an answer|publisher=Interlink Books|date=December 31, 2007|accessdate=May 30, 2011 |author=David Ray Griffin|isbn=978-1566566865}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2008 book, ''The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the cover-up, and the exposé'', was written to update his original book, ''The New Pearl Harbor'', reflecting information and insights from five major developments that have occurred since his original publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=David Ray|title=The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the Cover-Up, and the Exposé|publisher=Olive Branch Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56656-729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7: Why the Final Official Report About 9/11 Is Unscientific and False'', published in 2009, examines the credibility of the official investigations into and hypotheses about the destruction of the third skyscraper, WTC 7, focusing on the final official report published in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=David Ray |title=The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7: Why the Final Official Report About 9/11 Is Unscientific and False |publisher=Olive Branch Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-56656-786-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, the interactive "Complete 9/11 Timeline" website by Paul Thompson, a collection of mainstream media reports presented chronologically, was made into the book, entitled ''[[The Terror Timeline]]''.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ngc.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/35/1_103/165.pdf|format=PDF|first=Peter|last=Knight|title=Outrageous Conspiracy Theories: Popular and Official Responses to 9/11 in Germany and the United States|journal=New German Critique|number=1 103|volume=35|year=2008|accessdate=June 9, 2009 |doi=10.1215/0094033X-2007-024|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Details====
These documentaries present a range of alternative theories about how the attacks might have been carried out:
* ''[[9/11 Press for Truth]]'' (2006) documents the struggle by the [[Jersey Widows]] to open a full investigation of the events, and their frustration while monitoring the 9/11 Commission as part of the [[9/11 Family Steering Committee|Family Steering Committee]].
* [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]], 9/11 and [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] conspiracy theorists are the subject of the documentary film [[New World Order (film)|''New World Order'']], directed by [[Luke Meyer]] and [[Andrew Neel]], that debuted on the [[Independent Film Channel]] on May 26, 2009. The documentary, while not endorsing the movement, is described as giving the movement "more sympathetic, or less critical, airing than they've yet had (except among the converted)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ridley, Jim|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-05-20/film/doc-hangs-with-conspiracy-theorists-in-new-world-order|title=Doc Hangs with Conspiracy Theorists in New World Order Village Voice May 19, 2009|publisher=Villagevoice.com|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/movies/22orde.html?ref=movies|title=Movie Review New World Order|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7383">'''Alison Adam''' is a British researcher in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]] and is particularly known for her work on gender in [[information system]]s and the history of forensic science. As of 2012 she is professor of science, technology and society at [[Sheffield Hallam University]], [[Sheffield]], UK.

==Career==
Adam was a research fellow at [[Lancaster University]], and a lecturer and senior lecturer in the Department of Computation at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=intellect /&gt; She was professor of information systems from 2003 to 2008, then professor of science, technology and society from 2008 to 2012 at the [[University of Salford]], where she worked from 2000 until 2012, heading the Information Systems Institute in 2004–6 and then directing the Information Systems, Organisations and Society Research Centre.&lt;ref name=intellect&gt;[http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/books/view-Author,a=A/view-Contact-Page,id=13599/ Intellect Ltd.: Alison Adam] (accessed 13 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; She has been professor of science, technology and society at [[Sheffield Hallam University]], [[Sheffield]] since 2012.&lt;ref name=sheffieldbio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adam|first1=Alison|title=Background|url=http://www.shu.ac.uk/research/c3ri/people/professor-alison-adam|website=Sheffield Hallam University|accessdate=9 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222100400/http://www.shu.ac.uk/research/c3ri/people/professor-alison-adam|archive-date=2015-12-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref2014 /&gt;

==Research interests==
Adam's research has primarily been within the area of [[Science and Technology Studies]], including history and sociology of science and technology. Her predominant focus was the field of [[information system]]s. Her main contribution to research in gender and technology was a study of gender in relation to artificial intelligence (AI), in particular how feminist epistemology could be used to challenge the epistemology of AI and a study of feminist ethics and how it relates to computer ethics. Notable publications in this area include the ''Artificial Knowing: Gender and the Thinking Machine''&lt;ref&gt;Hine C. (1999) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23748203  Review: Engaging New Technologies?] ''Work, Employment &amp; Society'' 13: 741–743 {{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Gender, Ethics and Information Technology''. The book ''Gender, Ethics and Information Technology'' explores the "intersection of two areas; firstly gender and information and communication technologies and secondly, computer ethics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segell|first1=Glen|title=Gender, Ethics And Information Technology – By Alison Adam|date=2007|publisher=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|pages=187–189|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 she completed a three-year [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] funded research project on online privacy, in collaboration with researchers at Salford, [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], and [[Cranfield University]].&lt;ref name=sheffieldbio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130831015047/http://www.vome.org.uk/team/ VOME: VOME team] (accessed 14 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; She has evaluated the part that gender plays in ethics in on-line behaviour evaluating the gender divide in hacking,&lt;ref name=hacking&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=A.

Since 2010 Adam has researched the history and sociology of [[forensic science]]s. Her 2015 book, ''A History of Forensic Science: British Beginnings in the Twentieth Century'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://shura.shu.ac.uk/10050/ Sheffield Hallam University: Research Archive: A history of forensic science: British beginnings in the twentieth century] (accessed 13 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; charts the history of forensic sciences in the UK, mainly England, considering the broad spectrum of factors that went into creating the discipline in Britain in the first part of the twentieth century. These influences were criminological, criminalistic, scientific, technological and even fictional.  She argues that new interest in managing crime scenes arrived on British shores, from the Continent via British India and Egypt and was channeled into the ‘scientific aids’ movement of the 1930s  which can be seen as Continental and Colonial criminalistics in British clothing. The book charts the strategies of the new forensic scientists to gain an authoritative voice in the courtroom and to forge a professional identity in the space between forensic medicine, scientific policing, and independent expert witnessing drawing on the moral voice of the forensic scientist alongside the cultural authority of the fictional scientific detective.

[[Textile]]s are another long-standing interest. She states that "there's nothing quite like making a physical artifact. The culture of sharing information about making, on-line, is fascinating."&lt;ref name=sheffieldbio /&gt; From 2012 to 2014, she was engaged in interdisciplinary research on the culture of mending clothes.&lt;ref name=sheffieldbio /&gt;

==Teaching and administration==
At the [[University of Salford]], Adam taught [[cybercrime]], digital divide, research methodology, and sociology of forensic sciences.&lt;ref name=sheffieldbio /&gt; Adam served as deputy chair of the [[Research Excellence Framework]] (REF) 2014 sub-panel on Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Library and Information Management (UoA 36)&lt;ref name=ref2014&gt;[http://www.ref.ac.uk/media/ref/content/expanel/member/Main%20Panel%20D%20-%20Final%20List%20%28Jan%202015%29.pdf REF2014 Panel D] (accessed 13 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE) 2008 sub-panel on Library and Information Management (UoA 37).&lt;ref name=sheffieldbio /&gt;

{{Calendar}}
'''April''' is the fourth month of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], the fifth in the early [[Julian calendar|Julian]], the first of four months to have a length of 30 days, and the second of five months to have a length of less than 31 days.

April is commonly associated with the season of [[autumn]] in parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and [[Spring (season)|spring]] in parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where it is the seasonal equivalent to [[October]] in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.

==History==

The Romans gave this month the [[Latin]] name ''[[Aprilis]]''&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"April" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;497.&lt;/ref&gt; but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', "to open", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to "open", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:άνοιξη#Greek|άνοιξη]] (''ánixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. "Monate"&lt;/ref&gt;

April was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt; before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&amp;nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&amp;nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&amp;nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&amp;nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''ēastre-monaþ''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''ēastre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].

[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt; In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.

In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[Škofja Loka manuscript]].&lt;ref name="KoledarDPG2007"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije občine Dobrova–Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova–Polhov Gradec &lt;!-- |issn=C505-5857 --&gt; |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The month Aprilis had 30&amp;nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&amp;nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]’s calendar reform made it again 30&amp;nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&amp;nbsp;BC.

In [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10–16), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].

The [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 – April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.

The "Days of April" (''journées d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''procès d'avril''.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.

Artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

No art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.&lt;ref&gt;jonathanjonesblog&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic revolution of style ==

[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces

== Scientific and Technological ==

Not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists.  The stylistic revolution known as [[Impressionism]],  by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

[[Eugene Chevreul]], a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works,  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics.  Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other.  The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones,  embraced Chevreul's book, "The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum.  Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Eugene-Chevreul&lt;/ref&gt;

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance,  painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out.  in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/?no-ist, May 2013, by Perry Hurt&lt;/ref&gt;   Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world,  to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment.  Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments -  chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of "impressionists" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/#P4ovFKfbRLyMIhQT.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s.  It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;"Speculating Daguerre: Art and Enterprise in the Work of L. J. M. Daguerre" by Stephen C. Pinson, Chicago, (2012) p. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The neo-classical subject matter,  limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light -  not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events.&lt;ref&gt;Review of "The Lens of Impressionism," at University of Michigan Museum of Art, October- Dec. 2009 by Simon Kelly, Volume 9, Issue 1 Spring 2010, http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring10/the-lens-of-impressionism&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

 [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]  - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter  - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.

== Faking revolution: the C.I.A. and Abstract Expressionism ==

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the  [[Abstract Expressionists]] who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war.  At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in "my four year old could do that"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's,  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood.  [[Jackson Pollock]] who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones,  abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, " said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995.  Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot."  Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/17/unpopular-front&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Movements ==

=== [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient &amp; Classical Art]] ===
Key dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE&lt;br /&gt;
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.&lt;br /&gt;
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.&lt;ref name=artmovements&gt;http://www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Gothic architecture|Medieval &amp; Gothic]]===
Key dates: 400CE&lt;br /&gt;
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Renaissance]]===
Key dates: 14th century&lt;br /&gt;
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Mannerism]]===
Key dates: 1520-1600&lt;br /&gt;
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Baroque]]===
Key dates: 17th century&lt;br /&gt;
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.&lt;br /&gt;
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Rococo]]===
Key dates: 18th century&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word "rocaille", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. &lt;br /&gt;
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]]===
Key dates: 1750-1880&lt;br /&gt;
A nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Romanticism]]===
Key dates: 1800-1880&lt;br /&gt;
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

'''Bad Homburg vor der Höhe''' is the district town of the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], on the southern slope of the [[Taunus]], bordering among others [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]]. Bad Homburg is part of the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Regional Authority|Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area]]. The town's formal name is ''Bad Homburg vor der Höhe'' (translated as "Bad Homburg in front of the height") to distinguish it from other places of the same name, abbreviated as ''Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bad-homburg.de/vv/stadtrecht/10-1_Hauptsatzung-26-05-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201739/https://www.bad-homburg.de/vv/stadtrecht/10-1_Hauptsatzung-26-05-2011.pdf |archivedate=26 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for its medically used mineral waters and spa (hence the prefix ''Bad'', "bath"), and for its [[casino]].

Today, Bad Homburg is again one of the wealthiest towns in Germany (with the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] and the [[Starnberg (district)|Landkreis Starnberg]] regularly competing for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany). {{As of|2004}}, the town's marketing slogan is ''Champagnerluft und Tradition'' (Champagne air and tradition).

== History ==

=== Middle Ages origins ===
Local tradition holds that Bad Homburg's documented history began with the mention of the ''Villa Tidenheim'' in the [[Lorsch codex]], connected with the year 782. This ''Villa Tidenheim'' was equated with the Old Town, called "Dietigheim". This connection is also reflected in street names. Local historian, Rüdiger Kurth, doubted these traditional stories based on his study of written sources and local factors. In 2002 Kurth initiated  [[Archaeology|archaeological]] digs by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] under the leadership of Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was no evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It appears that the historical record which makes mention of Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch—as Homburg's founder—as a documentary witness in Eberbach&lt;!--Is that the right way to translate "in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe"? --&gt; in about 1180 is the first concrete evidence of the town's existence.

As early as 1962, in a dig under the ''Hirschgangflügel'' ("Hart Stalking Wing") at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, Günther Binding, took as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site one after the other, but each having burnt down later.

Further digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' in April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and under Professor Henning's leadership, led to the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building—possibly a castle with towers—which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building stood in connection with Wortwin's "castle". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies waiting to be discovered underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.

Homberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.

The town's name, "Homburg", comes from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix "vor der Höhe" was probably first recorded in a document in 1399.

The Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was founded with Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680–1708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. In 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.

=== Spa town and imperial residence ===
With the coming of the spa industry in the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from the [[casino]] built in town, the town changed into an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was particularly favoured by Russian nobility for its baths.

The spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for "well") in 1834 (although the designation ''"Bad"'' was not conferred until 1912). The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built in 1841–1842 by the brothers [[François Blanc|François]] (1806–1877) and Louis Blanc (1806–1852), who later took over the [[Monte Carlo Casino]], which is why the Homburg Casino is sometimes called the "Mother of Monte Carlo". In 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.

In 1888, Bad Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche)]]  close by. His mother, too, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Friedrich]], the old emperor's widow—and [[Queen Victoria]]'s eldest daughter—lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also underwent fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.

The "Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V." in the ''Röderweisen'' in Dornholzhausen—nowadays part of Bad Homburg—is Germany's oldest [[Country club|golf club]]. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (''Kurpark''), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old [[golf course]] may still be found.

Not far away stands the Russian Chapel—actually more properly called All Hallows' Church—an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church whose first stone was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later&lt;!---Yes, this contradicts the German article, but not the link in the German article.---&gt;.

King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure.  It was erected in 1914.

[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the "Horex—Fahrzeugbau AG", founded in 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.

=== Jewish history ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]

In 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Up to 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased in the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that in 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]]. A synagogue, built in 1731, was replaced by a new one in 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally under the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis in the 19th century.

A [[Hebrew]] printing house was run in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis in 1710 until 1713 when he moved to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn Ḥabib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there in 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired in 1736 by Aaron ben Ẓevi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|Ḥoshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold in 1748 and transferred in 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) in 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 in 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported in 1942/1943.&lt;ref&gt;FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
While the spa business experienced a long-term decline in the wake of the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the "Special Money and Credit Centre" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was headed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany—West Germany—was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt für Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.

In the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the head of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It was alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been conclusively proven.

== Coat of arms ==
Bad Homburg's civic coat of arms was granted in 1903 but is said to date from the 15th century on the basis of seals known from that time, although they show a [[saltire]] rather than the two [[adze]]s seen today (the saltire might be two unclear adzes). The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]]. The colours, with silver adzes in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/bad-homb.htm NGW.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bror Emil Hildebrand''' (22{{nbsp}}February 1806 in [[Nybro Municipality|Madesjö]]{{snd}}30{{nbsp}}August 1884) was a Swedish archaeologist, [[numismatist]] and museum director. From 1837 to 1879 he was Custodian of Ancient Monuments and Secretary of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters]].&lt;ref name=bror&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hildebrand |first=Bengt|title =Bror Emil Hildebrand | encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]] | year =1971–1973|publisher =[[National Archives of Sweden]] |location =Stockholm |language=Swedish |volume=19 |page=38 |url =https://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=13581|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1847 he was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] and from 1866 a member of the [[Swedish Academy]]. In 1866, he founded the [[Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=doc&gt;{{cite web |title=Ett historiskt museum och hur det har format Sverige |trans-title=A history museum and how it has shaped Sweden |url=http://www.shmm.se/documents/forskning/etthistorisktmuseum.pdf |website=www.shmm.se |publisher=Statens historiska museer |accessdate=4 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328111351/http://www.shmm.se/documents/forskning/etthistorisktmuseum.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomsen]] in nearby Copenhagen: thus Hildebrand introduced the [[three-age system]] to Sweden. His main scholarly legacy lies within the field of Medieval Anglo-Saxon numismatics, where he produced pioneering catalogues and studies. Much of this work was indirectly due to agricultural reforms in Sweden that led to Viking Period silver coin hoards surfacing at a rate never seen before or after Hildebrand's day; the 1864 edition of Hildebrand's ''Anglo-Saxon coins in the Swedish Royal Coin Cabinet'' drew on the evidence of 64 Swedish hoards alongside other European finds to establish the basic chronology of the late Anglo-Saxon coinage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hildebrand|first1=Bror Emil|title=Anglosachsiska Mynt i Svenska Kongl.

'''Carl Lotus Becker''' (September 7, 1873 – April 10, 1945) was an [[United States|American]] historian.

==Life==
He was born in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. He enrolled at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] in 1893 as an undergraduate, and while there, he gradually gained an interest in studying history. Remaining for graduate work, Becker studied under [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], who became his doctoral adviser there.&lt;ref&gt;Carl L. Becker, "Frederick Jackson Turner," in ''Everyman His Own Historian: Essays on History and Politics''. (Quadrangle Books, 1966), pp. 191-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1907. He was John Wendell Anderson Professor of History in the [[Cornell University Department of History|Department of History]] at [[Cornell University]] from 1917 to 1941.

He was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1923.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becker died in [[Ithaca, New York]]. Cornell has recognized his work as an educator by naming one of its five new [[residential college]]s the [[Cornell West Campus|Carl Becker House]].

==Writing==
Becker is best known for ''The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers'' (1932), four lectures on [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] delivered at [[Yale University]]. His assertion that [[philosophy|philosophies]], in the "[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]," relied far more upon [[Christian]] assumptions than they cared to admit, has been influential, but has also been much attacked, notably by [[Peter Gay]]. Interest in the book is partly explained by this passage (p.&amp;nbsp;47):

{{Quote|In the thirteenth century the key words would no doubt be God, sin, grace, salvation, heaven and the like; in the nineteenth century, matter, fact, matter-of-fact, evolution, progress; in the twentieth century, relativity, process, adjustment, function, complex. In the eighteenth century the words without which no enlightened person could reach a restful conclusion were nature, natural law, first cause, reason, sentiment, humanity, perfectibility....}}

This isolation of vocabularies of the epoch chimes with much later work, even if the rest of the book is essayistic in approach. Johnson Kent Wright writes:

{{Quote|Becker wrote as a principled liberal.... Yet in some respects ''The Heavenly City'' presents an almost uncanny anticipation of the "postmodern" reading of the eighteenth century.|"The Pre-Postmodernism of Carl Becker", p. 162, in ''Postmodernism and the Enlightenment'' (2001), Daniel Gordon editor}}

==Political views==
Interviewed for the pamphlet ''Writers Take Sides: Letters about the War in Spain from 418 American Authors'' Becker supported the  [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republicans]].&lt;ref name="mj"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19380517&amp;id=OLNQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RSIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5656,5316768&amp;hl=en "400 To 1 Against Franco"] ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', May 17, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated his opposition to [[dictatorship]] in general.&lt;ref name="mj" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4331">[[File:Evelynbrent.jpg|thumb|Actress [[Evelyn Brent]]'s exaggerated lipline is characteristic of cosmetics in the 1920s.]]
'''Cosmetics in the 1920s''' were characterized by their use to create a specific look: lips painted in the shape of a [[Cupid's bow]], [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]-rimmed eyes, and bright cheeks brushed with bright red blush.&lt;ref name=p35/&gt;

==Context==
The heavily made-up look of the 1920s was a reaction to the demure, feminine [[Gibson girl]] of the pre-war period.&lt;ref name=p35&gt;De Castelbajac, p35.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s, an international beauty culture was forged, and society increasingly focused on novelty and change.&lt;ref name=p35/&gt;&lt;ref name=p36&gt;De Castelbajac, p36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fashion trends influenced theater, films, literature, and art.&lt;ref name=p35/&gt;

Women also found a new need to wear more make-up, as a skewed postwar sex ratio created a new emphasis on sexual beauty.&lt;ref name=p36/&gt;  Additionally, as women began to enter the professional world, publications such as the French ''Beauty Industry'' encouraged women to wear makeup to look their best while competing with men for employment.&lt;ref name=p36/&gt;

==Products==
===Lipstick===
[[File:Celia Gámez en 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|Argentine actress [[Celia Gámez]] in 1925.]]
Lipstick became widely popular after Maurice Levy's 1915 invention of the metal lipstick container.&lt;ref name=p55&gt;De Castelbajac, p55.&lt;/ref&gt; It was available in salve, liquid, and stick forms,&lt;ref name=p55/&gt; and long-lasting, indelible stains were the most popular.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;  Lip pomade, also called lip gloss, was later invented by [[Max Factor, Sr.]] in an effort to provide a glamorous appearance to actress' lips on film.&lt;ref name="maxfactor-international.com"&gt;http://maxfactor-international.com/heritage/the-max-factor-story&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, 'natural' lip gloss was created, which used [[bromo acid]] to create a red effect as it reacted with the wearer's skin.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;  Finally, flavored lipstick was also popular, with the most popular variety being cherry.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;

In 1916, Max Factor began selling eye shadow and eyebrow pencils. This was the first time such products were available outside of the movie industry. Max continued to be a driving force behind make-up until his death in 1938. In 1991, his company became a part of the Procter &amp; Gamble family.&lt;ref name="maxfactor-international.com"/&gt;

In the 1920s, different products were also developed that showed the decade's preoccupation with shaping the mouth.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt; Metal lip tracers, made in various sizes to satisfy the wishes of the wearer, were developed to ensure flawless lipstick application.  [[Helena Rubinstein]] created a product called "Cupid's Bow," that billed itself as a "self-shaping lipstick that forms a perfect cupid's bow as you apply it."&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;  The development of the mirrored lipstick container in the 1920s also points to the importance of shaping the lips through the application of lipstick.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;

===Rouge===
During the 1920s, the messy elixir blushes of past years were replaced by creams, powders, liquids, and rouge papers.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt; Powder blushes became more popular after the invention of spill-proof containers and the compact.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;

Indelible blushes, like indelible lipsticks, were popular.&lt;ref name=p55/&gt;

===Mascara===
In the early 1920s many women fulfilled their desire for darker fuller lashes by resorting to the use of common household products. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) was mixed with soot or coal.  The resulting solution was a dark gel that was then applied to the lashes with a fine brush.

During the middle of the decade, mascara was available in cake, tube, wax, and liquid form and applied with a brush. Surprisingly enough, there were even waterproof formulations available.

The various forms of brush-on mascara served to darken the lashes but did not provide the sculpting abilities of modern-day mascara wands.  For this, ladies used eyelash curlers such as the then popular Kurlash.

'''Dušan Bilandžić''' (20 July 1924 – 4 March 2015){{sfn|Maletić|1993|p=57}} was a [[Croatia]]n historian and politician.{{sfn|Jović|2009|p=92}}

== Early life ==

Lower classes of Franciscan gymnasium he attended in [[Sinj]], and continued his high school education in [[Osijek]]. Before [[World War II]], he joined to the [[Young Communist League of Yugoslavia]] (SKOJ). During the war, he joined [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in 1942 as political commesar in [[Slavonia]]n partisan units.  In the same year, he joined [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]. In 1955 he graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]] and from 1945 until 1960 he taught military history at Military Academy in Belgrade. After he left the army, he started to work as a journalist, but soon he was employed in a trade union and in 1965 he was named member of the Trade Union Presidency of Yugoslavia as a representative of Croatia. As he worked with in unions under self-management, Bilandžić continued his education. In 1965 he gained [[Doctorate|PhD]] from the [[University of Zagreb]] [[Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Economics]]. In 1967, after [[Franjo Tuđman]] has been arrested because of undesirable political activity, Bilandžić succeeded him as director of the Institute for History of the Workers' Movement. In following years he done various political duties and in 1974 he was one of the participants in the drafting of the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]]. He was a dean on the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Zagreb at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. He became member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (JAZU) in 1980. He became regular member of HAZU (earlier JAZU) in 1991.

== Professional work ==

Bilandžić was an enemy of centralization of Yugoslavia after [[Josip Broz Tito]] died in 1980. Since he denied validity of Yugoslav nationality during the 1981 census, he was highly criticized by Belgrade as separatist and ''[[Ustaše]]''. Bilandžić stated that category of "Yugoslav" led to disappearance more than 30,000 Croats in Vojvodina. He feared that "Yugoslav" category would continue to grow which would call into question the entire basis of Yugoslav cultural and political policies, which were predicated on a person having a single national identification.  Specifically, a loss of Croats would mean fewer people to support Croat politicians and diminution of their power base within the multinational state.{{sfn|Wachtel|1998|p=240}}

With democratic elections in Croatia in 1991, Bilandžić joined the list of [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]], but the election results were devastating. Since he was a good friend of Tuđman, Tuđman named him Croatian representative in Belgrade in 1991. His friendship with Tuđman was very complex, since Tuđman often criticized him, even calling him "a monster" on the TV after [[Operation Storm]] in 1995.

His main focus in History of former Yugoslavia and position of Croats in it. Besides writing books, he participated in writing articles for various magazines and newspapers. His greatest works are History of SFRY (1978) and Croatian Modern History (1999). Since History of SFRY was highly under political censorship, in Croatian Modern History Bilandžić used his previous book as a source, but gave different comments on the same events.

== Comments ==

In 2004, in a popular Croatian talk show, ''[[Nedjeljom u 2]]'', Bilandžić stated that Croatia had more [[sovereignty]] in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] than it would have in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2E7GiU3rKs?t=32m18s|title=Akademik i povjesničar Dušan Bilandžić u emisiji Nedjeljom u 2 (2004.g)|work=HRT, Published on Aug 4, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2015|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eduard Duller.jpg|thumb|Eduard Dulleer, lithograph by [[August Prinzhofer]], 1844]]
'''Eduard Duller''' (18 November 1809, [[Vienna]] – 24 July 1853, [[Wiesbaden]]) was a German-Austrian writer and clergyman, very active as a poet, novelist and later as a historian.

== Life ==
His biological father died before his birth and so he was brought up lovingly but strictly by his stepfather. A gifted child, he studied philosophy and law in his home town of Vienna as well as writing his first fiction, premiering his first play, titled ''Meister Pilgram'', aged 17. His advanced humanist attitudes made him unsuited to Austrian education under the [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich System]] and its [[Carlsbad Decrees]], so in 1830 he left Austria for [[Munich]], where in 1831 he premiered his play ''Die [[Wittelsbach]]er''. A year later he mover to [[Trier]], befriending and graduating alongside [[Friedrich von Sallet]]. In Trier he withdrew into himself, but gained the clergy's hatred through his play ''[[Franz von Sickingen]]''.

In 1834 he moved to [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]] and there began publishing the ''Phönix. Frühlings-Zeitung für Deutschland.'' (''Phoenix - a spring magazine for Germany''). This literary journal published fictional works by [[Georg Büchner]], [[Christian Dietrich Grabbe]] and other [[Vormärz]] writers. Duller handed the editorship over to [[Karl Gutzkow]] in summer 1835 and in 1836 moved to [[Darmstadt]], where stayed from then until 1849 and took a lively interest in the [[German Catholics (sect)|German Catholicism]] movement, which sought to remove papal influence on Catholicism in Germany. His most notable work from the modern perspective is his ''Die Jesuiten'', a populist account of the history and present activities of the [[Jesuit]]s - on page 109 of it, he wrote:
{{cquote|So I return to the work of a free Catholic church. I can do no other - I would like to stand guard, waiting, every hour of the day and night calling on every German heart - You Catholic priests and laity of Germany, join hands in a covenant, with no fear of man; God stands by brave men fighting for a fair thing, and this Germany, this land of freedom and truth will no longer be desecrated by an enslavement to Jesuits and papists... Your Protestant brothers do but form the rigid walls round this battlefield, on which the German Catholics stand, the living wall, that no Jesuit or papist can break through... So, if German Catholics become independent of Rome, a great day of peace will arise over a united Germany; and, even if it means the hardest efforts, the  free life, honour and morality of a nation are worth such efforts.}}
The work gives presents a negative view of the Order, writing of its alleged hidden criminal activities, showing its moral and social principles as harmful and the Catholic Church as misusing religion. On page 97 he writes:
{{Cquote|Nevertheless, in these things the Jesuits lie - as if only that Prince, only that state can be sure of the guardianship of the Order and even be left to it completely by the church, as so long, even to the present day, they have argued; and the weak in mind believe in it because with dull eyes the sacred and sublime nature of religion, without which there can no family and even more so no state, is only exercised in the garb of the Church (namely the Roman church) and this mixes it up completely with the priestly hierarchy.}}

He later moved again, to [[Mainz]], where in 1851 he became priest to the German Catholic denomination. His grave is in the Mainzer Hauptfriedhof.

'''Elena Aleksandrovna Osokina''' (born 1959 in [[Podolsk]], [[Soviet Union]]) is a Russian [[historian]].

==Personal==
Her mother, Octobriana (later renamed Anna), named after the Bolshevik October revolution.

==Education==
Elena Aleksandrovna Osokina earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1981, and her [[Ph.D.]] in 1987, all from [[Moscow State University]].

==Writing==
Osokina's first book, "''Hierarchy of Consumption: Life Under the Stalinist Rationing System, 1928-1935''" was released in 1993 in [[Russia]].

In 1998, ROSSPEN published her second book "''За фасадом «сталинского изобилия»: Распределение и рынок в снабжении населения в годы индустриализации, 1927-1941''". In 2001, M.E. Sharpe Publisher translated this book into English and published it under the title "''Our Daily Bread: Socialist Distribution and the Art of Survival in Stalin’s Russia, 1927-1941''". 

Elena Osokina's third book "Gold for Industrialization: Torgsin" came out in 2009 in Russia. 
The book reveals the unknown story of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[industrialization]] and everyday life by exploring the role of the state stores, [[Torgsin]] (1931–36), which during the lean years of Stalin’s industrialization sold food and goods to the Soviet people at inflated prices in exchange for foreign currency, gold, silver and diamonds. Torgsin became an important source of gold for Stalin to finance industrialization and the major strategy for survival for people during those harsh times. The study enriches understanding of Stalinism, the workings of the Soviet economy, the nature of Soviet everyday life and consumerism.

==Teaching==
Elena Aleksandrovna Osokina is currently a [[Professor]] of Russian history at the [[University of South Carolina]].

She is the great-great-niece of historian and literary scholar [[Joseph Klausner]].&lt;ref&gt;Fania Oz-Salzberger, [http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/press/news/2310salz.html Heidelberg's Hope], opening lecture of the academic year at the University of Heidelberg (19 October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Oz-Salzberger was educated in [[kibbutz]] schools and served as an officer in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].

'''Fanula Papazoglu''' ({{lang-sr|Фанула Папазоглу}}, {{lang-gr|Φανούλα Παπάζογλου/Fanoula Papazoglou}}, 1917– January 26, 2001) was a Yugoslav and Serbian classical scholar, epigrapher and academic. She was an expert in Ancient history of the Balkans. She founded the [[Centre for Ancient Epigraphy and Numismatics, University of Belgrade|Centre for Ancient Epigraphy and Numismatics]] in 1970.

==Life==
Papazoglu was born in [[Bitola]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (modern [[R. Macedonia]]), into a [[Greek language|Greek]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin J. Fox, Robin Lane Fox eds., Brill's Companion to Ancient Macedon: Studies in the Archaeology and History of Macedon, 650 BC - 300 AD,

During the [[Axis occupation of Serbia]] she supported the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] as a member of the student organization, and spent a year in the [[Banjica concentration camp]] from 1942 to 1943.

She graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy in 1946, and worked at the Department for Ancient History at the Faculty of Philosophy from 1947. Her Ph.D. thesis in 1955 was ''Macedonian towns during the Roman period''. She became a full professor in 1965.

On March 21, 1974 she was elected to the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) as a corresponding member, and became a full member on December 15, 1983.

At the Belgrade University Papazoglu met and married the prominent Yugoslav Byzantologist of Russian origin, [[George Ostrogorsky]], with whom she had a daughter - Tatyana, and a son - Alexander. Papazoglou retired in 1979. She died in Belgrade in 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4304">'''Fashionable novels''', also called '''silver-fork novels''', were a [[19th century in literature|19th-century]] [[genre]] of [[English literature]] that depicted the lives of the upper class and the aristocracy.

==Era==
The silver-fork novels dominated the English literature market from the mid-1820s to the mid-1840s.&lt;ref name="wu"&gt;{{cite book |first=Duncan |last=Wu |title=A Companion to Romanticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJCHB0tqd1kC&amp;pg=PA338 |date=29 October 1999 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-631-21877-7 |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were often indiscreet, and on occasion "[[roman à clef|keys]]" would circulate that identified the real people on which the principal characters were based.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; Their emphasis on the relations of the sexes and on marital relationships presaged later development in the novel.&lt;ref name="collection"/&gt;

==Genre and satire of the genre==
[[Theodore Hook]] was a major writer of fashionable novels, and [[Henry Colburn]] was a major publisher.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; Colburn particularly advertised fashionable novels as providing insight into aristocratic life by insiders.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt; [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Catherine Gore]] were other very popular writers of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/nineteenth-century-criticism/gore-catherine Catherine Gore 1799(?)-1861] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007144620/http://www.enotes.com/nineteenth-century-criticism/gore-catherine |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were advertised as being written by aristocrats, for aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claire |last=Harman |title=Jane's Fame: How Jane Austen Conquered the World |page=72 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8050-8258-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As more women wrote the genre, it became increasingly moralized: "middle-class morality became central, and the novels detailed the demise of the aristocracy, though the characteristically Byronic heroes of the genre remained."&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/specialcollections/collectionsa-z/novelcollection/silverforknovels/ |title=Silver Fork Novels |publisher=University of Glasgow, Special Collections |accessdate=16 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular authors of silver fork novels were women, including [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Lady Blessington]], [[Catherine Gore]] and [[Lady Charlotte Bury|Lady Bury]].&lt;ref name="collection" /&gt;

[[William Hazlitt]] coined the term "silver fork" in an article on “The Dandy School” in 1827.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tamara S. |last=Wagner |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/genre/silverfork.html |title=The Silver Fork Novel |work=Victorian Web |date=12 December 2002 |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized them as having "under-bred tone" because while they purported to tell the lives of aristocrats, they were commonly written by the middle-class.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' in critique of their minute detailing of clothing, and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] satirized them in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Pendennis]]''.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

==In modern culture==
In [[Donna Leon]]'s fourth [[Donna Leon#List of Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|Commissario Guido Brunetti novel]], ''Death and Judgment'', English professor Paola Brunetti describes silver fork novels as "books written in the eighteenth century, when all that money poured into England from the colonies, and the fat wives of Yorkshire weavers had to be taught which fork to use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leon |first=Donna |title=Death and Judgment |date=June 1995 |publisher=Harpercollins |edition=1st |isbn=978-0060177966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:geocoin usa.jpg|thumb|A 2004 USA Geocoin]]

A '''geocoin''' is a metal or wooden token minted in similar fashion to a [[medallion]], [[token coin]], military [[challenge coin]] or [[wooden nickel]], for use in [[geocaching]], specifically as form of a calling card.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outdoor Navigation with GPS|last=Hinch|first=Stephen|publisher=Wilderness Press|year=2010|isbn=9780899976501|location=Birmingham, AL|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first geocoins were developed by Jon Stanley (aka moun10bike) as a signature item to be placed in caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2015/05/the-father-of-the-geocoin-moun10bike/|title=The Father of the Geocoin: Moun10Bike|date=2015-05-25|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many of these are made to be trackable on various websites to be able to show the movement around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond-news.com/news/weekly-feature/pokemon-who-richmond-geocachers-are-the-real-life-scavenger-hunters-1.2326716|title=Pokemon who? Richmond geocachers are the real life scavenger hunters|last=News|first=Hedy Ng/Special to the|newspaper=Richmond News|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visitors to be able to leave comments when they find the coin. Each coin has a unique tracking ID, which can also be used when logging it to a designated website. 

A geocoin typically has a diameter of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} to {{convert|2|in|mm}} and a thickness between {{convert|2.5|mm|in|disp=flip}} and {{convert|4|mm|in|disp=flip}}. Coins with the size of {{convert|1|in|mm}} are called microcoins, because they fit into microcaches (e.g. film canister). The smallest geocoins with a diameter of {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} are called nanocoins, and have been sold since 2009. If the diameter is larger than {{convert|3|in|mm}} the geocoin is called macrocoin, and contains the saying of "that's not a coin it's an anchor".

==Signature items==
[[File:CWG - Czech Wood Geocoin.jpg|thumb|A wooden geocoin]]
Personal geocoins are a personal signature item that normally bears the geocacher's [[pseudonym|handle]] and personal design. For example, it was Jon Stanley's (aka moun10bike) original manufacture of a coin that started the hobby in the geocaching game.{{cn|date=June 2018}} It has a stylized mountain bike and his caching handle, and on the back the geocaching logo.

Geocoins are often minted by caching organizations and companies. Though not specifically a personal signature item they are a form of signature item for the organization that developed them. However, most are custom-made for geocachers, usually in batches of 100 pieces or less.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reviewer/Moderator/Lackey Coins are another form of signature items over the years these have their own following. Many of them have taken the time to create their own signature item.

In the first few years the number of coins that were a signature item for a geocaching group, or individuals far outnumbered the coins that were made to sell. However now they tend to be smaller percentage as the industry has a number of coins manufacturers that develop coins for events, holidays, or special coins. The cost to make a personal coin is fairly high.

==Tracking websites==
When a cache listed at geocaching.com contains a geocoin, an icon (often unique to the type of the coin) is shown on the cache page's "Inventory" section. This icon will also appear in the inventory of any cacher holding one as well as in each cacher's historical trackable item listing. Icons will also remain in the inventory of cachers who log the 'discovery' of a geocoin's number without physically removing it from a cache. "Icon collecting" –  the act of having these icons listed in one's trackables listing –  is an associated hobby. Many people bring geocoins with unique icons to geocaching events so that others may see the coins and use the tracking number to collect the icons online, and it is not uncommon for collectors to activate some or all of the coins in their collections in order to have a matching online collection of icons associated with their geocaching.com accounts.

Other websites for trackable coins have included the 2002Canadian geocoin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocoins.ca/track.php |title=Geocaching Geocoins Canada |publisher=Geocoins.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utah geocoin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahgeocachers.com/GeoCoin/GeoCoins.php |title=UTAG GeoCoin Tracker |date=May 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509082725/http://www.utahgeocachers.com/GeoCoin/GeoCoins.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon State coin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.log4.us |title=Serialized Item Tracking |publisher=Log4.Us |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sigitem.com.

Free tracking service for coins and other items is available from [[Geokrety]],&lt;ref name="geokrety1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geokrety.org |title=Home |publisher=GeoKrety |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with full service for geocaching sites such as opencaching.us,&lt;ref name="opencaching1"&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.opencaching.us/ |title=OpenCaching North America |publisher=OpenCaching |date= |accessdate=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partial service for other geocaching sites. An owner of geocoins can also set up his own website to monitor these moving mementos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geocaching: Hike and Seek with Your GPS|last=Sherman|first=Erik|publisher=Apress|year=2004|isbn=9781590591222|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft==
It is not uncommon for activated, released geocoins to go missing, whether because a cacher is unfamiliar with the logging and tracking process or due to outright theft. Some geocoin owners will purposefully attempt to destroy the resale value of the coin by drilling and tagging it with an extra tag, marker, or other item that is intended to underscore the fact that the geocoin is meant to travel, not to be kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=221656 |title=Releasing drilled coins with flips - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another somewhat controversial anti-theft measure is to create a copy of the geocoin, releasing the copy and keeping the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.Groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=210750 |title=Inventive coin "copy" ideas? - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a geocoin helped authorities return stolen items to a geocaching enthusiast in Seattle, who marked the coins as missing online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2013/07/geocaching-geocoins-help-crack-a-theft-ring/|title=Geocaching Geocoins Help Crack a Theft Ring|date=2013-07-10|work=Official Blog|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goods were found in a storage unit during a raid and the geocoins became instrumental in connecting the burglars to their crime.

==History==
{{prose|section|date=February 2010}}
*September 30, 2001: The first trackable geocoin released was the Moun10Bike Version 1 Geocoin #002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?id=29 |title=(TB1D) Moun10Bike Geocoin - Moun10Bike Geocoin #002 |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moun10Bike Version 1 Geocoins are sought-after geocoins. They are all displayed on geocaching.com as owned by Moun10Bike and he has strictly forbidden their sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=129985&amp;st=0&amp;p=2158808&amp;#entry2158808 |title=Moun10bike Coin On Ebay - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date=2006-04-17 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 2002: The first geocoin that was produced and sold to the public to collect and release was the Canadian geocoin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=37916 |title=Canadian Geocoins? - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2003: The first USAGeocoin was released for sale, making it one of the first geocoins that one can buy, release, and track online without minting an exclusive personal design. The proposed 2002 design was never made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=152386 |title=First USA Geocoin - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2005: [[Geocaching.com]] permitted any geocaching.com user to purchase tracking numbers for approved designs, fueling a sudden surge in number of coins. Minimum purchase was initially set at 1000 tracking numbers.
* [[Fall]] 2006: Groundspeak reduced the minimum purchase of tracking numbers, and the minimum number of coins minted to obtain a unique icon, to 250. The drop in the cost to create a geocoin with a unique icon fueled a 'geocoin craze' with hundreds of new personal, group and increasingly purely commercial designs minted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=116641 |title=Groundspeak's Current Coin Tracking Policy - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 17, 2007: The First Annual Geocoinfest was held in [[Temecula, California]], USA. This event brought hundreds of geocoin collectors together for the first time in a mass event, with many exclusive coins being given away or traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=46759cb2-153e-464f-a692-61bb99564da8&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt= |title=GeocoinFest 2007 |publisher=Geocaching.com |date=2007-02-17 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fall]] 2007: Geokrety.org&lt;ref name="geokrety1"/&gt; began a free tracking service, [[Geokrety]], for coins and other items, with full support for geocaching sites such as Opencaching.us&lt;ref name="opencaching1"/&gt; and partial support for other geocaching sites.
* March 4, 2009: Geocaching.com further reduced the minimum number of codes for purchase to 50, and the minimum number of coins eligible for a custom icon to 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=116641# |title=Groundspeak's Current Coin Tracking Policy - Groundspeak Forums |publisher=Forums.groundspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable Geocoins===
[[File:Groesste geocoin derwelt.jpg|thumb|upright|The second largest geocoin in the world]]
*First Geocoin: Moun10Bike Coin, September 30, 2001
*First Geocoin for sale to public: Canada Geocoin Spring 2002
*Largest Geocoin (production run): Generic Coin Ø5" (~120mm)
*Smallest Geocoin (production run, trackable): Europe Nano, 2009, Ø0.5" (~12mm), 1mm thick
*Largest Single Coin (not a production run, trackable): It was handcrafted for the 2011 Geocaching mega event Geofarm in Switzerland. It weighs about {{convert|25.9|kg|lb}} with a height of {{convert|104|cm|in}} and a width of {{convert|110|cm|in}}. This giga coin was built after the official event geocoin featuring the event’s mascot cow. The coin was auctioned on said event and is now in the hands of a geocacher in Switzerland.
*Second Largest Single Coin (not a production run): It was handcrafted for the Geocaching event "Nordseetaufe 2010" in Germany. It weighs about {{convert|40|kg|lb}} with a height of {{convert|97|cm|in}} and a width of {{convert|62|cm|in}}. This macrocoin was built after the official event geocoin that has the shape of an anchor with a red and white rope. However it was not a run of a specific coins, but a coin that was made to resemble the coins that were made. It later had a coin number assigned to it. It remains the heaviest geocoin.

===Coin finishes===
*Antique Finish: A finish applied to copper, gold, or silver to give it a darker look. This finish is used often to have the fine details in a coin stand out more clearly.
*Foggy Painting: Paint finish simulating metal applied surface. Can have gloss, shine or lustre but lacking definition (foggy details).
*Matte: see Satin Finish.
*Misty: Silver or gold finish simulating effect of unpolished areas of a proof coin.
*Proof-like: Effect attained on high quality die stuck coins by high pressure and multiple strikes producing mirror finish background with satin finish relief areas
*Satin Finish: A finish giving a matte (non-glossy) look to the metal. A misused term as traditionally (in fabric) a satin finish often has a level of gloss associated with it.
*Silver: 1. plated with silver 2. .999 solid silver 3. silver-like nickel-plated (shiny nickel).

===Collecting terms===
*AE: Artists Edition: type of SE; a version of a retail commercial geocoin only made available to the designer of the coin.
*LE: Limited Edition: Typically a different version (color, metal, etc.) than the main run of coins. Produced in a limited quantity one time only.
*RE: Regular edition not produced in a limited in number thus may be reprised according to demand as dies are held by the mint for minimum of three years.
*SE: Special Edition: Typically a different version to the main run of coins but unlike LE, XLE or XXLE no limit on the number minted, and they may be reminted at any time.
*XLE: Extra Limited Edition: Same as LE only fewer.
*XXLE: Extremely Limited Edition: Same as XLE only fewer.
*HTF: Hard to Find; refers to ease of acquiring through purchase or trade not total mint numbers
*VHTF: Very Hard to Find; refers to ease of acquiring through purchase or trade not total mint numbers
*Proof Coin: 1.the sample coins provided by the mint 2.Effect attained on high quality die stuck coins by high pressure and multiple strikes producing mirror finish background with satin finish relief areas.
*Sample Coin: The sample coins provided by the mint. Some sample geocoins do not have tracking numbers.

===Geocaching terms===
*Activated/Unactivated: Geocoins with tracking numbers that have been registered on their associated websites are said to be "activated", whereas geocoins that are still unregistered are termed "unactivated".

The '''Gupta era''' is a historical [[calendar era]] that begins from 318–319 CE. It was used by the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta emperors]], as well as their vassals and their successors in present-day northern India and Nepal. It is identical to the '''Vallabhi era''' (or Valabhi era), which was used in the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of western India, although regional differences lead to a slightly different calculation for the conversion of Vallabhi era years to [[Common Era]] (CE).

== History ==

The Gupta era is now believed to have been started by the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta kings]], although there have been several debates over its origin in the past. The 11th century Persian writer [[Al-Biruni]], who described the Guptas as "wicked", incorrectly stated that the Gupta era marked the end of the Gupta dynasty. He dated the beginning of the Gupta era to the year 241 of the [[Shaka era]], that is, 318–319 CE. Al-Biruni's claim later led to debates about the era's origin among the 19th century historians.{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|pp=99–100}}

[[John Faithfull Fleet]] analysed the Gupta inscriptions, and realised that they were dated to years of a particular calendar era. He believed that the era was founded by king Jayadeva of the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichchhavi]] dynasty (relatives of the Guptas), and was later adopted by the Guptas.{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|pp=98–99}}

Later discoveries and analysis indicate that the era was actually founded by the Guptas, and was known after them. For example:{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=98}}

* The [[Mathura]] stone pillar inscription, issued by [[Chandragupta II]], is dated to the year 61 "following the era of the Guptas" (''Gupta-kālā nuvartamāna'').{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=98}}
* The [[Sarnath]] inscriptions of [[Kumaragupta]] and [[Budhagupta]] also refer to the Gupta era.{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|pp=98–99}}
* The [[Junagadh]] rock inscription of [[Skandagupta]] mentions the phrase ''Gupta-prakāle'' or ''Guptasya-kāle''.{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=98}}
* The [[Ganjam]] copper-plate inscription from the reign of [[Shashanka]] is dated to year 300 of the Gupta-era (''Gauptabda varsha-shatatraye'').{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=99}}

[[Georg Bühler]] concluded that the Gupta era was started by [[Chandragupta I]] in 318–319 CE, to mark his coronation. This is the most prevalant theory about the era's origin now.{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|pp=100–101}} However, this cannot be said with certainty, and the era may have been started by his predecessors or his son [[Samudragupta]] as well.{{sfn|D. C. Sircar|1965|p=285}} Some other theories trace the origin of the era to 3rd century CE or earlier, but this view is now discredited: the 7th century inscription of Shashanka is dated to the 300th year of the Gupta era, and proves that the Gupta era started in the 4th century.{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=101}}

== Usage ==

The Gupta era was used in [[North India|northern India]], [[West India|western India]] and parts of [[East India|eastern India]] until the end of the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century CE.{{sfn|Richard Salomon|1998|p=186}}

Apart from the Gupta rulers, the Gupta era was also used by their vassals and successors, such as:

* the [[Maitraka|Maitraka dynasty]] of [[Vallabhi]]: this resulted in the era being called the "Vallabhi" era in the Maitraka-ruled territory.{{sfn|D. C. Sircar|1965|p=285}}{{sfn|Richard Salomon|1998|p=186}}
* [[Shashanka]]{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=99}}
* [[Parivrajaka dynasty]] of central India{{sfn|Om Prakash Misra|2003|p=8}}
* [[Uchchhakalpa dynasty]] of central India{{sfn|Om Prakash Misra|2003|p=8}}

== Conversion to CE ==

According to the calculations of [[John Faithfull Fleet]], the Gupta era began on the first day of the [[shukla paksha]] (bright fortnight) of the [[Chaitra]] month. Depending on regional conventions, the process of converting the Gupta era years to [[Common Era]] (CE) years is different:{{sfn|Richard Salomon|1998|pp=186–187}}

* The early inscriptions dated in the Gupta era followed the scheme prevalent in northern India: the first month of the year is Chaitra (''[[chaitradi]]''), and the month starts from the [[full moon day]] (''purnimanta'').
** The year mentioned in these inscriptions is generally the current year at the time of issuance. Thus, the date of these inscriptions can be converted to CE by adding 320 or 321.
** If the year mentioned in the date is the expired year (that is the preceding year at the time of issuance), the date can be converted to CE by adding 319 or 320.

* The later inscriptions from the Maitraka territory ("Vallabhi era") follow the scheme prevalent in southern and western India: the first month of the year is [[kartik (month)|kartika]] (''[[karttikadi]]''), and the month starts from the [[amavasya|new moon day]] (''amanta''). Because of this, the dates are set back by 5 months.
** For the inscriptions that mention the current year, the date can be converted to CE by adding 319 or 320.
** For the inscriptions that mention the expired year, the date can be converted to CE by adding 318 or 319.

'''Hichem Djait''' ({{lang-aeb|هشام جعيط}}), (born December 6, 1935) is a prominent historian and scholar of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fayard.fr/hichem-djait|title='Hichem Djaït'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Djait was born in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] to a conservative upper-middle-class family. His erudite father and some of his uncles and relatives were [[Islamic]] sages (or [[sheikh]]s), which made the name of the Djait family become traditionally associated with the [[Al-Zaytuna Mosque|Zeytouna Mosque]] as well as with Islamic [[Fiqh]] and [[fatwa|Iftah]] (or jurisprudence). He had his secondary education at [[Sadiki College]], where he studied French, [[world literature]], [[Western philosophy]], [[Arabic]], and [[Islamic Studies]]. His training at Sadiki College made him discover [[Enlightenment age|Enlightenment]] thinkers and the ideals of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] which were rather different from the teachings of his family's conservative milieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hebdo.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/0/5/33/27887/Hichem-Dja%C3%AFt--Je-ne-m%E2%80%99%C3%A9tais-jamais-reconnu-dans-ce.aspx|title=Hichem Djaït : Je ne m’étais jamais reconnu dans cette vision fondamentalement négative de l’orientalisme|date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Djait later travelled to France where he received the "Aggregation" diploma in History in 1962. His PhD in Arts and Humanities was defended in Paris in 1981. Today, Djait is an Emeritus Professor at the [[University of Tunis]]. He is also a visiting professor at the [[McGill University]] and the [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/19769-hichem-djait-l-historien-emerite|title='Hichem Djaït, l’historien émérite'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the numerous honorary titles and awards he received,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://realites.com.tn/2015/12/hichem-djait-est-la-personnalite-culturelle-de-lannee-2016-dans-le-monde-arabe/|title='Hichem Djaït est la personnalité culturelle de l’année 2016 dans le monde arabe'|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Djait is member of the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and was appointed president of the [[Tunisian Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts]] on February 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tunisico.tn/article/1428/decouverte/actus/hdjait-441310|title='L'historien Hichem Djaït président de l'Académie Tunisienne des des Sciences, des Lettres et des Arts'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Djait is a specialist in Medieval Islamic history, he was member of the International Scientific Institute for the ''General History of Africa'' edited by the [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alowais.com/en/winners/winner.details.aspx?generic=153|title=Hisham D'jait|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the many books he published in Tunisia and France, he mainly deals with various subjects related to Arab-Islamic culture, history and philosophy as well as to the relationship between Islam and modernity and the place of Islam in the contemporary world. Among such publications, one may mention ''The Great Fitna'' (or ''The Great Discord'') first published in 1989 and which represents a seminal study and a revolutionary reading of Islamic history following the death of [[Prophet Muhammad]]. ''The Great Fitna'' is often described by scholars and critics as the most influential reference on the subject. Other works include ''Europe and Islam'' (1978), ''The Revelation, the Quran and the Prophecy'' (1986), ''The Crisis of Islamic Culture'' (2004) and a ground-breaking study entitled ''The Life of Muhammad'' first published in French between 2001 and 2007 and released in English in 2012. The three volumes of the latter study which cover the itinerary of the Prophet and the concomitant evolution of Islam are subtitled "Revelation and Prophecy," "Predication in Mecca," and "The Prophet’s Life in Medina and the Triumph of Islam."

'''''Histoire des Miao''''' ("History of the [[Miao people|Miao]]") is a 1924 ethnographic book of the [[Hmong people]] by [[François Marie Savina]], published by the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society|Société des Missions-Etrangères de Paris]].&lt;ref name= Savina&gt;Savina, François-Marie 1924, ''Histoire des Miao.'' Hong Kong: Imprimerie de Ia Société des Missions-Etrangères, XXII-304 p. Republished in 1930; Lodwick, Kathleen L.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=S9zeSbSFIwwC&amp;pg=PA233 233].&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, of Savina's writings, it is the most well-known and the most often cited.&lt;ref name=Michaudp209&gt;Michaud, Jean. ''Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif'' (Historical Dictionaries of Peoples and Cultures). [[Scarecrow Press]], April 19, 2006. {{ISBN|0810865033}}, 9780810865037. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JG619Tq4ElkC&amp;pg=PA209 209].&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes Savina's theories and views of the Hmong. Savina argued that the Hmong had non-Asian origins because their legends had similarities to European stories.&lt;ref&gt;Cha, Dia (Learning through folklore series). ''Teaching with Folk Stories of the Hmong: An Activity Book''. Libraries Unlimited, 2000. {{ISBN|1563086689}}, 9781563086687. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qzjm2V_cx3cC&amp;pg=PA1 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Michaud, author of ''Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif'', described the book as "highly original yet controversial work of applied ethnography and largely conjectural history".&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt; [[Mark Pfeifer]] of the [[Hmong Cultural and Resource Center]] wrote that the book is "Not supported by any available empirical evidence, not given credence by contemporary scholars".&lt;ref&gt;Pfeifer, p. 3/20.&lt;/ref&gt; A statement Michaud, in a biography of Savina included to his '' 'Incidental' Ethnographers. French Catholic Missions on the Tonkin-Yunnan Frontier, 1880-1930,'' contributes to refine by showing the staggering extent of Savina's field experience and proficiency in several vernacular languages, including Hmong/Miao. Analyzing critically ''Histoire des Miao'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;186–203), Michaud shows that it is not so much Savina's ethnography that is lacking, but his critical sense as visible in unwarranted historical assumptions rendered partial by his Catholic faith.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3809">'''J.C.M. Warnsinck''' (11 November 1882, [[Hoogwoud]], [[North Holland]] - 21 July 1943, [[The Hague]]) was a Dutch naval officer and naval historian. Johan Carel Marinus Warnsinck was the son of the notary Cornelis Warnsinck and his wife, Tettje Halbertsma. He entered the Royal Naval Academy at Den Helder in 1899 and was commissioned an officer in the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] in 1903, eventually rising to the rank of captain in 1930. In 1919, he married Catarina Elisabeth Delprat and they had one son and a daughter. He saw naval service in the East and West Indies as well as in European waters. In the Royal Netherlands Navy, he was a hydrographic specialist. From about 1920, he began to be interested in naval history and began with a special interest in the three Anglo-Dutch wars (1652-1674). He retired from active service in 1932 and devoted the remainder of his life to the study of Dutch [[maritime history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn1/warnsinck ''Dictionary of Netherlands Biography'' "J.C.M. Warnsinck"] by [[J.R. Bruijn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warnsinck became a key pioneer for the academic study of maritime history in The Netherlands. In 1933, he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam and additionally at Leiden University in 1937. In 1939, he became Professor of Maritime History at the University of Utrecht. For many years, he was on the Council of the Linschoten Society and Secretary of the Commission for maritime history of the Royal Academy of Science. In 1938, he was elected an associate member of the [[Académie de Marine]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr John Bridgewater''' was an English clerical historian of the Catholic Confessors under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Yorkshire]] about 1532; died probably at [[Trier]], about 1596. He proceeded [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|M. A.]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1556, was ordained priest, and in 1563 became [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] in that university. He also held several other important preferments all of which he resigned in 1574, when with several of his students he crossed over to [[Douai]], preferring "the old form of religion" to the novelties of those whom he styled "Calvinopapists and Puritans". {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

He probably never returned to England but lived at various Catholic places on the European continent ([[Reims]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]], Trier); in 1588 and 1594 he resided at Trier. Ribadaneira, with [[Father Southwell]] and [[Brother Foley]] account him a member of the [[Society of Jesus]], though there is no proof of that (Records of English Catholics, I, pg 408).
 
==Writings==
Bridgewater  refuted (Trier 1589) a Protestant work on the pope as Antichrist and also wrote  "Account of the Six Articles usually Proposed to the Missioners that Suffered in England", and against which he voted in 1562. {{clarify|date=November 2013}} He may be best known as the earliest martyrologist of Catholic England. His work, conceived in the spirit of [[Eusebius]] as a triumphant apology for Catholicism, is entitled ''Concertatio Ecclesliae Catholicae in Angliâ adversus Calvinopapistas et Puritanos sub Elizabethâ Reginâ quorundam hominum doctrina et sanctitate illustrium renovata et recognita, etc.'', i.e. ''The Battle of the Catholic Faith in England under Queen Elizabeth'', renewed in the lives of certain men illustrious for learning and sanctity, among them more than one hundred martyrs, and a very great number of others distinguished for their (religious) deeds and sufferings; confirmed also by the retractations of apostates, by new edicts of the persecutors, and by the writings of very learned Catholics against the Anglican, or rather female, pontificate, and in defense of the authority of the Roman pontiff over Christian princes (Trier, 1588, about 850 pp. in octavo).
 
Another edition was brought out (ibid.) by [[Cardinal Allen]] in 1594; it served thenceforth as an original record of English Catholic sufferings for the Faith and Dodd, Challoner and  Lingard used extensively its reliable biographical and historical data. Its rather miscellaneous contents are described in the [[Chetham Society]]'s Remains (XLVIII, 47-50). {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''Julian day''' is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period and is used primarily by [[Astronomy|astronomers]], and in [[software]] for easily calculating elapsed days between two events (e.g. food production date and sell by date)&lt;ref&gt;"Julian date" n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Julian Day Number '''('''JDN''') is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon [[Universal time]], with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, [[4713 BC|4713&amp;nbsp;BC]], [[proleptic Julian calendar]] (November 24, 4714&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz &amp; Reingold 2008, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidelman 2013, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Astronomical Almanac Online" 2016, Glossary, s.v. Julian date. Various timescales may be used with Julian date, such as [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) or Universal Time (UT); in precise work the timescale should be specified.&lt;/ref&gt;  a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: [[Indiction]], [[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar]], and [[Metonic cycle|Lunar]] cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Both of these dates are years of the Christian or [[Common Era]] (which has no year 0 between 1 BC and AD 1). Astronomical calculations generally include a year 0, so these dates should be adjusted accordingly (i.e. the year 4713 BC becomes [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical year number]] &amp;minus;4712, etc.). In this article, dates before October 15, 1582 are in the (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar and dates on or after October 15, 1582 are in the Gregorian calendar, unless otherwise labelled.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 [[Universal Time|UT]] on January 1, 2000, was 2&amp;nbsp;451&amp;nbsp;545.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Guinot 2013, 91–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian date''' ('''JD''') of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;"Resolution B1" 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2&amp;nbsp;456&amp;nbsp;293.520&amp;nbsp;833.&lt;ref&gt;US Naval Observatory 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian Period''' is a [[Chronology|chronological]] interval of 7980 years; year 1 of the Julian Period was 4713&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomical Almanac for the year 2017'' p. B4, which states 2017 is year 6730 of the Julian Period.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by [[History|historians]] since its introduction in 1583 to convert between different [[calendar]]s. The Julian calendar year {{CURRENTYEAR}} is year {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} + 4713 }} of the  current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD&amp;nbsp;3268.

== Terminology ==
The term ''Julian date'' may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the [[ordinal date]]) in the [[Gregorian calendar]], especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry,&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;USDA c. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; or it may refer to dates in the [[Julian calendar]]. For example, if a given "Julian date" is "October 5, 1582", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar—the date it was first established).  Without an astronomical or historical context, a "Julian date" given as "36" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5.  Other possible meanings of a "Julian date" of "36" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD&amp;nbsp;36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36&amp;nbsp;astronomical [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]]).  This is why the terms "ordinal date" or "day-of-year" are preferred.  In contexts where a "Julian date" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called ''"Julian calendars"'',&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.

Historical Julian dates were recorded relative to GMT or [[Ephemeris Time]], but the [[International Astronomical Union]] now recommends that Julian dates be specified in [[Terrestrial Time]], and that when necessary to specify Julian dates using a different time scale, that the time scale used be indicated when required, such as JD(UT1). The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction.  Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. [[leap second]]s).&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt;

== Variants ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (reference date)]] --&gt;
Because the starting point or [[Epoch (reference date)|reference epoch]] is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.

In the table below, ''Epoch'' refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier.  JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of {{CURRENTDATE}} and may be cached.

* The '''Modified Julian Date''' (MJD) was introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1957 to record the orbit of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] via an [[IBM 704]] (36-bit machine) and using only 18 bits until August 7, 2576. MJD is the epoch of VAX/VMS and its successor [[OpenVMS#Timekeeping|OpenVMS]], using 63-bit date/time, which allows times to be stored up to July 31, 31086, 02:48:05.47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606064704/http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|archivedate=June 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MJD has a starting point of midnight on November 17, 1858 and is computed by MJD = JD - 2400000.5 &lt;ref&gt;Winkler n. d.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Truncated Julian Day''' (TJD) was introduced by [[NASA]]/[[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] in 1979 as part of a parallel grouped binary time code (PB-5) "designed specifically, although not exclusively, for spacecraft applications." TJD was a 4-digit day count from MJD 40000, which was May 24, 1968, represented as a 14-bit binary number.  Since this code was limited to four digits, TJD recycled to zero on MJD 50000, or October 10, 1995, "which gives a long ambiguity period of 27.4 years". (NASA codes PB-1—PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year count.) Only whole days are represented.  Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day, plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields.  Later PB-5J was introduced which increased the TJD field to 16 bits, allowing values up to 65535, which will occur in the year 2147.  There are five digits recorded after TJD 9999.&lt;ref&gt;Chi 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPD Toolkit Time Notes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DJD was defined by the International Astronomical Union at their meeting in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom c. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heliocentric Julian Day]] (HJD) is the same as the Julian day, but adjusted to the frame of reference of the [[Sun]], and thus can differ from the Julian day by as much as 8.3 minutes (498 seconds), that being the time it takes the Sun's light to reach [[Earth]].

To illustrate the ambiguity that could arise, consider the two separate astronomical measurements of an astronomical object from the earth: Assume that three objects—the Earth, the Sun, and the astronomical object targeted, that is whose distance is to be measured—happen to be in a straight line for both measures. However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.

An error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the '''Geocentric Julian Day''' (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.

== History ==
The ''Julian day number'' is based on the ''Julian Period'' proposed by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]], a classical scholar, in 1583, at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform, as it is the [[least common multiple]] of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:

: 15 ([[indiction|indiction cycle]]) × 19 ([[Metonic cycle]]) × 28 ([[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar cycle]]) = 7980 years

Its epoch falls at the last time when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together &amp;mdash; Scaliger chose this because it preceded all historical dates. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, 4713 BC, which was chosen to be before any historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since it is now certain that every possible combination of the three cyclic numbers finds its place in the Julian Period, it is evident that the first year of the Christian era, which was the 10th year of a Solar Cycle, the 2nd of a Lunar Cycle, and the 4th of a Cycle of Indiction, finds its place within this artificial era, and must answer to that particular year of the period which is characterized by the same cyclic numbers.   Hence, to refer the Christian era to the Julian Period is the same thing as to find out what year of that period it is which, when divided by 28 will leave a remainder 10, divided by 19 will leave a remainder 2, and divided by 15 will leave a remainder 4.   The solution of this problem belongs to the higher mathematics, by which it is found that the year required is the 4714th of the period in question.   Hence Jul. Per. 4714=A.D.1, and consequently Julian Period 4713=B.C.1.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Smith &amp; ben Uziel 1853, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In point of fact, finding the year is a very straightforward arithmetical  procedure.   See "Calculation" below.

Although many references say that the ''Julian'' in "Julian Period" refers to Scaliger's father, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Julius Scaliger]], in the introduction to Book V of his ''{{lang|la|Opus de Emendatione Temporum}}'' ("Work on the Emendation of Time") he states, "''{{lang|la|Iulianam vocauimus: quia ad annum Iulianum dumtaxat accomodata est}}''", which translates more or less as "We have called it Julian merely because it is accommodated to the Julian year." Thus ''Julian'' refers to [[Julius Caesar]], who introduced the Julian calendar in 46 BC.

Originally the Julian Period was used only to count years, and the Julian calendar was used to express historical dates within years.  In his book ''Outlines of Astronomy'', first published in 1849, the astronomer [[John Herschel]] added the counting of days elapsed from the beginning of the Julian Period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Ideler 1825, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;   We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year 4713 BC, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel 1858, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Astronomer]]s adopted Herschel's "days of the Julian period" in the late nineteenth century, but used the meridian of Greenwich instead of Alexandria, after the former was adopted as the [[Prime Meridian]] after the [[International Meridian Conference]] in Washington in 1884. This has now become the standard system of Julian days numbers.

The French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, ''{{lang|fr|Traité de Mécanique Céleste}}'', in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 Laplace] 1799, p.349&lt;/ref&gt; Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into [[variable star]] work by [[Edward Charles Pickering]], of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5jQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=toc#PPA206,M1 Furness] 1988, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the [[astronomical day]] began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since [[Ptolemy]] chose to begin the days in his astronomical periods at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using [[water clock]]s. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] days beginning at sunrise and [[Babylonia]]n days beginning at sunset. This would seem to imply that his choice of noon was ''not'', as is sometimes stated, made in order to allow all observations from a given night to be recorded with the same date. When this practice ended in 1925, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice.

== Julian day number calculation ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gregorian calendar]] --&gt;
The Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas ('''[[integer division]] is used exclusively''', that is, the remainders of all divisions are '''dropped'''):

''The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12. For the year, [[astronomical year numbering]] is used, thus 1 BC is 0, 2 BC is −1, and 4713 BC is −4712. ''JDN'' is the Julian Day Number. Use the previous day of the month if trying to find the JDN of an instant before midday UT.''

===Converting Gregorian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 604, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic]]) Gregorian calendar dates after November 23, &amp;minus;4713.

JDN = (1461 × (Y + 4800 + (M − 14)/12))/4 +(367 × (M − 2 − 12 × ((M − 14)/12)))/12 − (3 × ((Y + 4900 + (M - 14)/12)/100))/4 + D − 32075

===Converting Julian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 606, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Julian calendar|proleptic]]) Julian calendar years ≥ −4712, that is, for all JDN ≥ 0.

JDN = 367 × Y − (7 × (Y + 5001 + (M − 9)/7))/4 + (275 × M)/9 + D + 1729777

=== Finding Julian date given Julian day number and time of day ===
For the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following (divisions are real numbers):

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}J\!D &amp; = &amp; J\!D\!N + \frac{\text{hour} - 12}{24} + \frac{\text{minute}}{1440} + \frac{\text{second}}{86400}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So, for example, January 1, 2000, at 18:00:00 UT corresponds to ''JD'' = 2451545.25

For a point in time in a given Julian day after midnight UT and before 12:00 UT, add 1 or use the JDN of the next afternoon.

=== Finding day of week given Julian day number ===
The US day of the [[week]] '''W1''' (for an afternoon or evening UT) can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W1''' = [[Modular arithmetic|mod]](''J'' + 1, 7)&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 592, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

!'''W1'''
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
|-
!'''Day of the week'''

|}

If the moment in time is after midnight UT (and before 12:00 UT), then one is already in the next day of the week.

The ISO day of the week '''W0''' can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W0''' = mod (''J'', 7) + 1

=== Julian or Gregorian calendar from Julian day number ===
This is an algorithm by Richards to convert a Julian Day Number, '''J''',  to a date in the Gregorian calendar (proleptic, when applicable). Richards states the algorithm is valid for Julian day numbers greater than or equal to 0.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, 617–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 1998, 316&lt;/ref&gt; All variables are integer values, and the notation "''a''&amp;nbsp;div&amp;nbsp;''b''" indicates [[integer division]], and "mod(''a'',''b'')" denotes the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus operator]].

For Julian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j''
For Gregorian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j'' + (((4 × '''J''' + ''B'') div 146097) × 3) div 4 + ''C''
For Julian or Gregorian, continue:
:2. ''e'' = ''r'' × ''f'' + ''v''
:3. ''g'' = mod(''e'', ''p'') div ''r''
:4. ''h'' = ''u'' × ''g'' + ''w''
:5. '''D''' = (mod(''h, s'')) div ''u'' + 1
:6. '''M''' = mod(''h'' div ''s'' + ''m'', ''n'') + 1
:7. '''Y''' = (''e'' div ''p'') - ''y'' + (''n'' + ''m'' - '''M''') div ''n''

'''D''', '''M''', and '''Y''' are the numbers of the day, month, and year respectively for the afternoon at the beginning of the given Julian day.

=== Julian Period from indiction, Metonic and solar cycles ===

Let Y be the year BC or AD and i, m and s respectively its positions in the indiction, Metonic and solar cycles.
Divide 6916i + 4200m + 4845s by 7980 and call the remainder r.
:If r&gt;4713, Y = (r − 4713) and is a year AD.
:If r&lt;4714, Y = (4714 − r) and is a year BC.

'''Example'''

i = 8, m = 2, s = 8.   What is the year?

:(6916 × 8) = 55328; (4200 × 2) = 8400: (4845 × 8) = 38760.   55328 + 8400 + 38760 = 102488.
:102488/7980 = 12 remainder 6728.
:Y = (6728 − 4713) = AD 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1760, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julian date calculation==
As stated above, the Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive leap second contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the [[SOFA (astronomy)|Standards of Fundamental Astronomy]] (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as "quasi-JD".&lt;ref&gt;"SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools" 2016, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Koloniasokehs.jpg|thumb|Kolonia Town, looking down from Sokehs Ridge]]
[[Image:Pohnpei map.gif|thumb|Map of Pohnpei Island showing the municipalities]]
'''Kolonia''' is a coastal town and the capital of [[Pohnpei State]] in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM). It was also the former FSM capital before being replaced by [[Palikir]] in 1989, located nearby to the southwest in the municipality of [[Sokehs]]. It has about 6,000 people.

==Description==
Kolonia Town is located in the north central section of [[Pohnpei Island]]. It was formerly part of [[Nett]] municipality, but is a separate municipality since May 1965. The population of the town was 6,074 (2010 Census).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sboc.fm/dl.php?fn=Vm0weE5GWXlTWGhVV0d4VVlUSm9WVmxVU205alJsVjNWMnQwVmsxV1NsbFpNR2hMWWtaS2RHVkVRbFZpUm5CTVdXdGFZVlpXU25KWGJGcHBVakpvZVZacVJsWmxSbHB6Vkc1T1VtSkdjRTlXYkZKRFRrWmtjbFZyWkd0TlZUVklWMnRhVjFSc1NrVlJWR3M5 |title=2010 FSM Census of Population &amp; Housing: Pohnpei State |date=2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322151709/http://www.sboc.fm/dl.php?fn=Vm0weE5GWXlTWGhVV0d4VVlUSm9WVmxVU205alJsVjNWMnQwVmsxV1NsbFpNR2hMWWtaS2RHVkVRbFZpUm5CTVdXdGFZVlpXU25KWGJGcHBVakpvZVZacVJsWmxSbHB6Vkc1T1VtSkdjRTlXYkZKRFRrWmtjbFZyWkd0TlZUVklWMnRhVjFSc1NrVlJWR3M5 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest population center on Pohnpei and the commercial hub of the island. The land area of Kolonia amounts to 1.5&amp;nbsp;km², with a large number of buildings lying just outside the town limits.

==History==
Kolonia's history is deeply marked by Pohnpei's multiple foreign occupiers, and evidence of their former presence is found throughout the town and island. Traditionally, Pohnpei's power center was in [[Madolenihmw]], on the southeastern part of the island. The area now known as Kolonia was called ''Mesenieng'', which means "face of the wind" or "head wind." [[Spain]] first built the town in 1887 as an administrative and military capital and named it ''Santiago de la Ascensión''.  A fort, from which ruins known as the Spanish Wall remain, was built to protect the colonial government and garrison.

In 1899, as a consequence of the Spanish–American War, [[German Empire|Germany]] purchased Pohnpei from Spain along with the rest of the [[Caroline Islands]] and established district offices in Kolonia.  Roads and wharfs were built and buildings erected (a church bell tower and cemetery&lt;ref&gt;{{GNIS|1947851|German Cemetery}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain), but the town stayed relatively small as few German or other foreign settlers arrived to live on the island.  Kolonia and northern Pohnpei were devastated by a typhoon in 1905.

[[Japan]] occupied Pohnpei in the first weeks of [[World War I]] as well as other German islands north of the equator. Unlike previous occupiers, the Japanese brought thousands of settlers to Micronesia, who outnumbered the indigenous population on some islands. These settlers, most of whom were [[Okinawa]]ns, vastly expanded the infrastructure in addition to establishing settlements elsewhere on Pohnpei.  Visitors to Kolonia in the 1930s reported that they were able to walk the length of Namiki Street (now Kaselelhie Street) under shopkeepers' canopies without getting wet in the rain.

During [[World War II]], much of Kolonia was destroyed as some 118 tons of [[United States|American]] bombs, 600 incendiaries and naval artillery targeted the town and island installations.  Pohnpei was bypassed during the amphibious island hopping campaigns, but rusting wrecks of Japanese military equipment, downed airplanes and bunkers are still visible throughout the island.  The town was rebuilt and expanded during the US Navy and later US Department of the Interior administrations.  The [[Federated States of Micronesia]] Constitutional Referendum and the [[Compact of Free Association]] led to independence in 1986.

Today, construction in various parts of town continues and all of Kolonia's primary and secondary streets are paved and street signs erected. Kolonia Town boasts Pohnpei State government offices, public and private schools, grocery stores, restaurants, bars, hotels and houses of worship of various religious denominations.&lt;ref name=Panzholzer2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Panholzer |first1=Thomas |last2=Mauricio |first2=Rufino |title=Place Names of Pohnpei Island: Including And (Ant) and Pakin Atolls |date=2003 |publisher=Bess Press |location=Honolulu, Hawai'i |isbn=9781573061667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pohnpei International Airport]] ([[IATA]] code: PNI) is located on the small island Deketik and is connected to Kolonia via the Deketik causeway.

The United States, [[Australia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and Japan maintain embassies in Kolonia, although the Federation‘s capital is now at Palikir. A number of foreign volunteer groups operate in Kolonia, including the [[Peace Corps]], the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers ([[JOCV]] or [[JICA]]), [[WorldTeach]], the [[Red Cross]], the [[Jesuit Volunteer Corps]], the Spanish Mercedarian Missionaries of [[Berriz]], the Conservation Society of Pohnpei (CSP), and Pacific Missionary Aviation (PMA).

|[[Our Lady of Ljeviš]]
|Mother of God Ljeviška is a 14th-century [[Serbian Orthodox church]] in the town of [[Prizren]].  It was converted to a [[mosque]] during the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then back into a church in the early 20th century.[[UNESCO]]-protected 14th century Serbian Orthodox monastery. The construction of the church was commissioned in 1306–9 by Serbian King [[Stefan Milutin]].&lt;ref name="StrikerEmerick2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curcic|first=Slobodan|editor=Judson J.

| [[Monastery of the Holy Archangels]]
| Monastery of the Holy Archangels is a [[Serbian Orthodox]] [[monastery]] located in [[Prizren]], founded by the Serbian Emperor [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stefan Dušan]] (reigned 1331–1355) between 1343 and 1352 on the site of an earlier church, part of the [[Višegrad (Bistrički)|Višegrad fortress complex]]. It was the burial church for Emperor Dušan, and represented the culmination of the [[Serbian art|Serbian ecclesiastical archritectural style]], that led to the birth of the [[Morava school]] style. The complex, which ranges over 6,500 [[Square metre|m²]], includes two churches, the main one is dedicated to the Holy Archangels (where Dušan's tomb lied), and the second one is dedicated to [[St. Nicholas]], both built in the [[Rascian architecture|Rascian architectural style]], although, like the [[Visoki Dečani]] monastery, regarding time of the construction, and some architectural elements, it may belong to the [[Vardar school|Vardar architectural style]]. The monastery was looted and destroyed after the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] arrived in 1455, and in 1615 it was razed to the ground and its material was used for the construction of the [[Sinan Pasha Mosque (Prizren)|Sinan Pasha Mosque]] in Prizren.&lt;ref name=Jovanovic-Archangels&gt;{{harvnb|Jovanović|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire complex was [[Excavation (archaeology)|archeologically explored]] in 1927, and its remains were conserved after the [[Second World War]]. During the last decade of the 20th century, work on the reconstruction was continued, and in 1998 it again became an active male monastery. After the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] and retreat of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] army forces, reconstructed objects were burned and looted in June 1999, by members of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), after the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) arrived. During the [[2004 unrest in Kosovo]], the monastery was burned and looted again. The entire monastery complex is under protection of the [[Serbia|Republic of Serbia]], as a [[Monument of Culture of Great Importance]], and today in the monastery lives one priest and the monastery is under constant protection of Kosovo Police and in a special protection zone.&lt;ref name=Kosovo.net-Archangels&gt;{{harvnb|Kosovo.net|loc=Holy Archangels Monastery page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studija&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Zoran |last1=Garić |first2=Svetlana |last2=Hadžić |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/Regional/SEE/IRPPSAAH/FS/FS_KosovoUNMIK_MonasteryHolyArchangels_Prizren_APP.pdf |title=Monastery of the Holy Archangels – Prizren |publisher=Council of Europe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215201556/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/Regional/SEE/IRPPSAAH/FS/FS_KosovoUNMIK_MonasteryHolyArchangels_Prizren_APP.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikulov''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈmɪkulof}}; {{lang-de|Nikolsburg}}; {{lang-yi|ניקאלשבורג}}, ''Nikolshburg'') is a town in the [[Moravia]], [[South Moravian Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]].
[[File:Mikulov-Nicolsburg city seal.jpg|thumb|260px|upright|City Mikulov (Nicolsburg) official Seal, 1810]]

==Geography==
The town is part of the historic [[Moravia]] region, located directly on the border with [[Lower Austria]]. In the south, a road border crossing leads to the neighbouring Austrian municipality of [[Drasenhofen]]. The highway is part of the [[European route E461]] and is to be extended as the [[R52 expressway (Czech Republic)|R52 expressway]].

Mikulov is situated between the Pavlovské vrchy hilly area and the edge of the [[Mikulov Highlands]], stretching up to the [[Thaya]] river and the three [[Nové Mlýny reservoirs]]. The [[Pálava Protected Landscape Area]] begins in Mikulov, and so does the [[Moravian Karst]].

==History==
After the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] was established, the settlement of ''Nikulsburch'' was first mentioned in a 1249 deed, issued by the [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] margrave [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] who granted it, including a castle, and the surrounding area to the [[Duchy of Austria|Austrian]] noble Henry I of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]]. In 1262 the possession was confirmed by Ottokar, [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian king]] since 1253. After King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] had defeated Ottokar at the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]], he then vested Henry II of Liechtenstein with [[market rights]] ''in villa Nicolspurch''. [[German Bohemians|German]] citizens were called in and lived there until their [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expulsion]] in 1945 according to the [[Beneš decrees]].

===Bohemian Crown===
[[File:Mikulov, zámek.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Mikulov Castle]]

In 1526, the [[Anabaptists|Anabaptist]] leader [[Balthasar Hubmaier]] came from [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] to Nikolsburg, where he was captured and arrested by the forces of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] king [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in the following year. The town remained in the Liechtenstein family until 1560, and in 1572 Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] granted the fief to his ambassador to the Spanish court Adam von [[Dietrichstein]]. From 1575 until the 20th century, Nikolsburg remained the proprietary possession of the Dietrichstein noble family and its [[Mensdorff-Pouilly]] successors.

In 1621, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Cardinal [[Franz von Dietrichstein]] signed the [[Peace of Nikolsburg|Treaty of Nikolsburg]] with the Transylvanian prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]] at [[Mikulov Castle]]. Four years later, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and his [[Aulic titulature|aulic]] council met at the castle, where General [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] received his commission and was elevated to a [[Duchy of Friedland|Duke of Friedland]]. Franz von Dietrichstein also established the first [[Piarists|Piarist]] college north of the Alps in Nikolsburg.

After a fire damaged the original Nikolsburg Castle in 1719, the Dietrichstein family reconstructed the château to its present appearance. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Count [[Alajos Károlyi]] began work on a peace treaty in Nikolsburg that led to the [[Treaty of Prague (1866)|Treaty of Prague]] in 1866.

===Jewish Mikulov===
:{{See also|Familianten}}
[[File:V09p305001 Nikolsburg.jpg|260px|thumb|Jewish quarter (1900s)]]

The beginning of the Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg dates as far as 1421, when Jews were expelled from [[Vienna]] and the neighboring province of [[Lower Austria]] by the duke of Austria, [[Albert II of Germany]]. The refugees settled in the town situated close to the Austrian border, some {{convert|85|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Austria]]n capital, under the protection of the princes of Liechtenstein, and additional settlers were brought after the expulsions of the Jews from the Moravian royal boroughs by the king [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] after 1454.&lt;ref name="Nezhodová423"&gt;Nezhodová, Soňa. ''The Jewish Mikulov'' (Židovský Mikulov). 1. ed. Brno: Matice moravská, 2006, 423 p. {{ISBN|80-86488-28-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement grew in importance and in the first half of the 16th century Nikolsburg became the seat of the regional [[rabbi]] of [[Moravia]], thus becoming a cultural centre of Moravian Jewry. The famous rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (1525 &amp;ndash; 1609), who is said to have created the [[golem]] of [[Prague]], officiated here for twenty years as the second regional rabbi between 1553 and 1573.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/travel/in-the-czech-republic-moravia-and-its-castles.html?pagewanted=all Moravia and its castles]&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Franz von Dietrichstein]], son of Adam von Dietrichstein, was a special protector of the Jews, whose taxes were necessary to finance the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encycl"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, ''"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=N&amp;artid=292 Jewish Nikolsburg]"'', Retrieved 2011-01-30&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 18th century, the congregation in Nikolsburg totalled over 600 families, being the largest Jewish settlement in [[Moravia]]. The census of 1754 decreed by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] ascertained that there were some 620 families established in Nikolsburg, i.e. the Jewish population of about 3,000 comprised half of the town's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Nezhodová423"/&gt; Only a small number of Jews could make their living in the town as artisans; the rest had to become merchants. The congregation suffered severely during the [[Silesian wars]] (1740&amp;ndash;1742, 1744&amp;ndash;1745 and 1756&amp;ndash;1763), when they had to furnish the monarchy with their share in the supertaxes exacted by the government of Maria Theresa from the Jews of Moravia.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encycl"/&gt;

Quite a number of Nikolsburg Jews continued to earn their livelihood in Vienna, where they were permitted to stay for some time on special passports. The freedom of residence, which was conceded to the Jews in Austria in 1848, reduced the number of resident Jews in Nikolsburg to less than one-third of the population which it contained at the time of its highest development. In 1904, there were 749 Jewish residents in the city, out of a total population of 8,192.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encycl"/&gt; In 1938, prior to the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the city population totaled about 8,000 mostly German-speaking inhabitants. Out of these, 472 were Jewish at this time.&lt;ref name="Nezhodová423"/&gt; The Jewish settlement in Nikolsburg ceased to exist during World War II, as only 110 managed to emigrate in time, and 327 of Mikulov's Jews did not survive the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="Nezhodová423"/&gt;

Following World War II, the town's German population was brutally expelled between 1945-46 by the Czech Communist Government. In 1948, Mikulov's population was around 5,200.

'''''Miluj blížneho svojho''''' ("Love thy neighbor") (2004) is a Slovak-language documentary by filmmaker [[Dušan Hudec]] about the September 1945 [[Topoľčany pogrom]], a post-[[Holocaust]] anti-Jewish riot in which more than 40 Jews were injured.

==Background==
{{further|Topoľčany pogrom}}
Most of the Jews in [[Topoľčany]], Slovakia were killed in the Holocaust, which was perpetrated jointly by the collaborationist [[Slovak State]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. A few hundred survived and returned to the town after the war. Their efforts to regain property that had been "[[Aryanization (Nazism)|aryanized]]" increased the hostility and [[antisemitism]] of the non-Jewish Slovaks, who began to mount a campaign of intimidation to encourage the Jews to renounce their claims and leave the country. More than 40 Jews were injured in a September 1945 riot, referred to as the [[Topoľčany pogrom]], which became the best known instance of [[anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944-46|postwar anti-Jewish violence]] in Slovakia. In the years following the riot, many Jews emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Büchler |first1=Yehoshua |editor1-last=Bankier |editor1-first=David |title=The Jews are coming back: the return of the Jews to their countries of origin after World War II |date=2005 |publisher=Berghahn Books |location=Jerusalem |isbn=9781571815279 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jews_are_coming_back.html?id=KrBtAAAAMAAJ |language=en |chapter=Slovakia and Jews after World War II|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamenec&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kamenec |first1=Ivan |authorlink1=Ivan Kamenec |title=Povojnový protižidovský pogrom v Topoľčanoch nepriamo presahuje až do súčasnosti |url=https://dennikn.sk/1229891/o-jednom-neokruhlom-topolcianskom-vyroci/ |work=Denník |language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no longer a Jewish community in Topoľčany.{{r|sme}}

==Censored statement==
During the filming of the documentary, an elderly resident of Topoľčany said, "Jews and Gypsies are the worst scum under the sun. While they are in the world, there will be no order".{{r|Spectator}}{{efn|{{lang-sk|Židi, Cigáni, to je najväčšia háveď pod slnkom, pamätajte si to, pokiaľ tí budú na svete, poriadok nebude}}&lt;ref name=sme&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kúdelová |first1=Kristína |title=Miluj blížneho svojho zastavila jedna veta |url=https://www.sme.sk/c/1500132/miluj-blizneho-svojho-zastavila-jedna-veta.html |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{ill|Richard Rybníček|cs||sk}}, the director-general of [[Slovenská televízia|STV]], which had commissioned the documentary, asked Hudec to remove the statement because of concern that it violated the Broadcasting and Retransmission Act on protection of human dignity and humanity. Hudec disagreed and strongly objected, telling reporters that without the line, the film would be a study of past racism in Slovakia, but that the inclusion of the statement brought the historical issues into the present.{{r|sme}} Despite the general agreement of several lawyers that the statement did not violate the law, the station insisted on its removal.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Malý |first1=Jožo |title=Dokument o pogrome Židov vyvolal v Topoľčanoch diskusie |url=https://mytopolcany.sme.sk/c/1623226/dokument-o-pogrome-zidov-vyvolal-v-topolcanoch-diskusie.html |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=SME |language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Federation of Jewish Religious Congregations]] condemned the removal of the statement, stating that the censorship was a "warning signal about the present direction of the Slovak public TV". It raised concerns about Rybníček's connections with far-right groups. In response, a manager of STV stated that "We would not like this problem to be politicised in any way."{{r|Spectator}}

==Documentary==
The documentary was screened on Slovak television on 24 May 2004.{{r|slovo}} Its release had been delayed due to the controversy over the removed statement.&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balogová |first1=Beata |title=Jewish leaders criticise public Slovak Television |url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20022504/jewish-leaders-criticise-public-slovak-television.html |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=The Slovak Spectator |date=19 May 2004 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Slovak historian [[Ivan Kamenec]] praised the documentary for bringing the postwar Jewish history to the attention of a wider audience.{{r|Kamenec}} The Slovak newspaper {{ill|Slovo (magazine)|lt=''Slovo''|sk|Slovo (týždenník)}} said that the documentary was probably the best Slovak documentary to premiere in 2004.&lt;ref name="slovo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kodoňova |first1=Miloslava |title=Jeden za všetkých |url=https://www.noveslovo.sk/node/21562 |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=Slovo |date=15 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators accused the documentary of [[anti-Catholicism]], pointing out that the church in Topoľčany is the main visual focus, and the documentary did not mention that some Catholic Church officials opposed the Holocaust.{{r|top}} The Slovak writer [[Peter Bielik]] criticized the film, citing contemporary reports claiming that "the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres". Because of the controversy over these remarks, he withdrew from consideration for director of the [[National Memory Institute (Slovakia)|National Memory Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nedelsky |first1=Nadya |title=“The Struggle for the Memory of the Nation”: Post-Communist Slovakia and its World War II Past |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=977–978 |doi=10.1353/hrq.2016.0053|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zoot suits.jpg|thumb|340px|Pachuco culture is associated with the [[zoot suit]] and the idea of making flamboyant appearances in public]]

'''Pachuco''' refers to a [[subculture]] of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans, associated with [[zoot suit]]s, [[street gang]]s, [[nightlife]], and flamboyant public behavior. The idea of the pachuco – a zoot-suited, well-dressed, street-connected flamboyant  [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] of Hispanic/Latino heritage –  originated in [[El Paso]], [[Texas]], and [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Mexico]], had moved north, following the line of migration of Mexican railroad workers ("[[traquero]]s") into [[Los Angeles]], where it developed further.

A '''pachuca''' is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town.  Pachucas broke [[taboo]]s of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends;  at the time, a "good woman" was considered to have her place in the home. American women were not encouraged to wear pants, as it was seen as strictly masculine. Because of this, outsiders saw Pachucas as rebellious, tacky, and un-American. This created a larger gap between Mexican-Americans and the rest of the community. However, this was not the intention of the Pachuco/Pachuca style. Pachucas strove to prove that their community fits in to American culture and that they were not of lesser value socially and economically. In order to portray this, they created their suits with luxurious and expensive fabrics. Pachucas made their own clothes and created a space for self expression through fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/272303247|title=The woman in the zoot suit : gender, nationalism, and the cultural politics of memory|last=1969-|first=Ramírez, Catherine Sue,|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822342861|location=Durham|oclc=272303247}}&lt;/ref&gt; They defied male/female stereotypes and roles in Mexican-American culture in much the same way [[flapper]]s had in European-American culture in the 1920s.

==Origin==

The origin of the term "pachuco" is uncertain, but one theory connects it to the city of El Paso, Texas, which was sometimes referred to as "Chuco Town" or "El Chuco."  People migrating to El Paso would say, in Spanish, that they were going "''pa'  El  Chuco.''"  These migrants became known as pachucos.&lt;ref&gt;Zoot Suit Discovery Guide. [http://research.pomona.edu/zootsuit/en/zoot-suit-la/ L.A. in the Zoot Suit Era.] Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Pachuco" is quite possibly derived from the name of the city of [[Pachuca]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], Mexico. There have long been migrants from Hidalgo state living in Texas.

Another theory says that the word derives from ''[[pocho]]'', a derogatory term for a Mexican born in the United States who has lost touch with the [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]]. The word is also said to mean "punk" or "troublemaker".   Yet another theory is put forth by author Laura L. Cummings who postulates a possible indigenous origin of the term. The founder of the "Pachuco" subculture was a Mexican comedian and film actor named [[German Valdés]] better-known by his Artistic name "Tin-Tan". He introduced the Pachuco dress and slang throughout his Golden age-era films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=War and Military History Questions|title=Who were the pachucos|url=http://www.wikianswers.com/Q/who_were_the_pachucos|work=Answers|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections have also been found between "Pachucos" and mixed civilians who lived near the Mexican–American border during the turn of the century, and between "Pachucos" and the poor soldiers who fought in the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the armies of [[Pancho Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqp01|title=PACHUCOS|last=ARNOLDO|first=DE LEON,|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TinTanStatueDF.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of the Mexican actor [[Germán Valdés]] better known as Tin Tan]]

Pachucos called their slang [[Caló (Chicano)|Caló]] (sometimes called "pachuquismo"), a unique [[argot]] that drew on the original Spanish Gypsy Caló, Mexican Spanish, the [[New Mexican Spanish|New Mexican dialect of Spanish]], and American English, employing words and phrases creatively applied.  To a large extent, Caló went mainstream and is one of the last surviving vestige of the Pachuco, often used in the lexicon of some urban [[Latino]]s in the United States to this day. The influence of Valdés is responsible for the assimilation of several Caló terms into Mexican slang.

The Mexican [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Octavio Paz]] writes in the essay, "The ''Pachuco'' and Other Extremes" that the Pachuco phenomenon paralleled the [[zazou]] subculture in [[World War II]]-era Paris in style of clothing, music favored ([[jazz]], [[Swing (genre)|swing]], and [[jump blues]]), and attitudes. Although there was no known link between the two subcultures, they both are most certainly derivative localized blends of American pop culture in the United States.

Pachuco culture in America was at its height during [[World War II]].  The Wartime Productions Board in 1942 thought it necessary to cut back on fabric consumption, so they enacted regulations on the amount of fabric used for suits.  This enactment targeted Pachucos in particular because of the excess fabric used in their zoot suits.  Pachucos boldly chose not to follow these regulations, demonstrating rebellious attitudes and pride in their culture.  Pachucos continued to flaunt zoot suits, now attained through bootleg tailors.  As a result, these flashy zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic by other Americans.  This controversial series of events helped shape Pachuco culture, and zoot suits became a symbol of cultural pride among Mexican-Americans.  It didn't all end well, however, as this also led to rising tension between Pachucos and other Americans, playing a part in the start of the 1944 [[Zoot Suit Riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://research.pomona.edu/zootsuit/en/zoot-suit-la/|title=L.A. in the Zoot Suit Era: Zoot Suit Discovery Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=research.pomona.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pachuco subculture declined in the 1960s, evolving into the [[Chicano]] style. This style preserved some of the pachuco slang while adding a strong political element characteristic of the late 1960s American life.

In the early 1970s, a recession and the increasingly violent nature of gang life resulted in an abandonment of anything that suggested [[dandyism]]. Accordingly, Mexican-American gangs adopted a uniform of [[T-shirt]]s and [[khaki]]s derived from prison uniforms, and the pachuco style died out. However, the zoot suit remains a popular choice of formal wear for urban and rural Latino youths in heavily ethnic Mexican neighborhoods. It is typically worn at a prom, in weddings, parties or in some cases, at informal Latino university commencement ceremonies.

=== Costa Rica ===

The term "{{wiktspa|pachuco}}" is used in [[Costa Rica]] to define Costa Rican slang. It nevertheless differs from the Mexican slang.
In Costa Rica the term "pachuco" refers to someone who has common habits and who is often very rude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green Energy Network|title=Pachuco|url=http://www.ruralcostarica.com/costa-rican-spanish-word.asp?word=Pachuco|work=Costa Rican Spanish Dictionary|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Costa Rica the word pachuco refers to a person who has manners that are socially unacceptable and often uses shocking language when speaking. Pachuco is also a pejorative name given to certain colloquial words and expressions. Some consider pachuco and its pachuquísmos to be Costa Rica's second language.

== Style ==
Pachuco style was a dominating trend among Mexican-American youth in the 1930s-40s.  Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions.  Pachucos dressed in recognizable [[Zoot suit]]s, and often styled their hair into ducktails.  Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look.  The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style.  Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, [[Caló (Chicano)]] was a very popular form of speech among pachucos.  Pachucos were seen as gangsters in the eyes of other Americans, because of the activities they participated in.  They often carried concealed weapons and were involved in criminal activities such as vandalism and gang-related misdemeanors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PACHUCOS {{!}} The Handbook of Texas Online{{!}} Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqp01|website = tshaonline.org|accessdate = 2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==La Pachuca==
The "Pachuca," the female counterpart of the Pachuco, had an aesthetic sensibility as strong as the male zoot suiter. The Pachuca's hairstyle tended to be a high "coif" or [[bouffant]], with the hair put up in some way (a more pronounced version of the typical hair style of the time), sometimes using hair grease.  Their makeup was heavy, particularly using a red colored lipstick. The preferred colors of clothing were black and gray.  Some pachucas wore the traditionally male zoot suit, albeit with modifications to fit the female form. This was very subversive at the time because of long-held [[gender role]]s that dictated how a person should dress.  Sometimes, she donned the standard heavy gold pocket chain.  Another variation involved a [[sweater]] or [[coat (clothing)|coat]] - often a variant on the male zoot-suit finger-tip jacket - over knee-length [[skirts]], plus [[fishnet stockings]] or [[bobby socks]] and [[platform shoes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramírez, Catherine S., ''The Woman in the Zoot Suit: Gender, Nationalism, and the Cultural Politics of Memory.'' Durham: Duke University Press, 2009. p. xii [http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=10934]&lt;/ref&gt;  Extravagant dresses were and are also common among pachucas.   Like the entire culture, the fashion aesthetic revolved around the concept of "see and be seen".

This style was associated with gang membership and activity largely due to the [[Zoot Suit Riots]] that took place in [[Southern California]] in 1943. The negative image of the male zoot suiter as a "violent gangster" naturally extended to the Pachuca as well. The promiscuous image came from the Pachuca's high public visibility and patronage of [[nightlife]] with pachucos. This image contrasted with the traditional Latino-American image of [[femininity]] at the time which held that the "good" [[Minority group|minority]] woman stayed in the home.

The Pachuca's challenge to the dominant perception of femininity came during the period between the advent of [[women's suffrage]] in 1920 and the upsurge in [[feminism|feminist]] activism of the 1960s and 1970s.

[[File:Petrarch by Bargilla.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Petrarch]] conceived of the idea of a European "[[Dark Age]]" which later evolved into the tripartite periodization of Western history into Ancient, Middle Ages and Modern.]]
'''Periodization''' is the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time&lt;ref name="Rabinowtz"&gt;Adam Rabinowitz. ''[http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/rabinowitz It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data]''. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World Papers, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is usually done in order to facilitate the study and analysis of [[history]], understanding current and historical processes, and causality that might have linked those events. 

This results in descriptive abstractions that provide convenient terms for periods of time with relatively stable characteristics. However, determining the precise beginning and ending to any "period" is often arbitrary, since it has changed over time over the course of history.

To the extent that history is continuous and ungeneralizable, all systems of periodization are more or less arbitrary. Yet without named periods, however clumsy or imprecise, past time would be nothing more than scattered events without a framework to help us understand them. Nations, cultures, families, and even individuals, each with their different remembered histories, are constantly engaged in imposing overlapping, often unsystematized, schemes of temporal periodization; periodizing labels are continually challenged and redefined, but once established, a period "brand" is so convenient that many are "very hard" to change or shake off.

==History==
The division of history into "ages" or periods is very old, and recorded practically as early as the first development of [[writing]]. 
The [[Sumerian King List]] operates with dynastic [[regnal era]]s. 
The classical division into a [[Golden Age]], [[Silver Age]],  [[Bronze Age]], [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]] and [[Iron Age]] goes back to [[Hesiod]].
One Biblical periodization scheme commonly used in the Middle Ages was [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'s theological division of history into three ages: the first before the age of [[Moses]] (under nature); the second under Mosaic law (under law); the third in the age of Christ (under grace). But perhaps the most widely discussed periodization scheme of the Middle Ages was the [[Six Ages of the World]], where every age was a thousand years counting from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] to the present, with the present time (in the Middle Ages) being the sixth and final stage.

==Background==
Not only do periodizing blocks inevitably overlap, they often seemingly conflict with or contradict one another. Some have a cultural usage ("the [[Gilded Age]]"), others refer to prominent historical events ("the Inter-War years: 1918–1939"), yet others are defined by decimal numbering systems ("the 1960s", "the 17th century"). Other periods are named from influential or talismanic individuals ("the [[Victorian Era]]", "the [[Edwardian Era]]", "the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Era]]").

Some of these usages will also be geographically specific. This is especially true of periodizing labels derived from individuals or ruling dynasties, such as the [[Andrew Jackson|Jacksonian Era]] in America, the [[Meiji Era]] in Japan, or the [[Merovingian|Merovingian Period]] in France. Cultural terms may also have a limited reach. Thus the concept of the "[[Romantic period]]" is largely meaningless outside the [[Western world]] of Europe and European-influenced cultures. Likewise, "the 1960s", though technically applicable to anywhere in the world according to [[Common Era]] numbering, has a certain set of specific cultural connotations in certain countries. For this reason it may be possible to say such things as "The 1960s never occurred in Spain".  This would mean that the [[sexual revolution]], [[counterculture]], youth rebellion and so on never developed during that decade in Spain's conservative [[Roman Catholic]] culture and under [[Francisco Franco]]'s authoritarian regime. Likewise it is very often said, as the historian [[Arthur Marwick]] has, that "the 1960s" began in the late 1950s and ended in the early 1970s. His reason for saying this is that the cultural and economic conditions that define the meaning of the period covers more than the accidental fact of a 10-year block beginning with the number 6. This extended usage is termed the "long 1960s". This usage derives from other historians who have adopted labels such as "[[the long 19th century]]" (1789–1914) to reconcile arbitrary decimal chronology with meaningful cultural and social phases. Similarly, an Eighteenth Century may run 1714–1789. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] has also argued for what he calls "[[the short twentieth century]]", encompassing the period from the [[World War I|First World War]] through to the end of the [[Cold War]].

Similar problems attend other labels. Is it possible to use the term "[[Victorian era|Victorian]]" outside Britain, and even within, does her reign of 1837-1901 usefully constitute a historical period? It sometimes is used when it is thought that its connotations usefully describe the politics, culture and economic conditions characteristic of the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, periodizing terms often have negative or positive connotations that may affect their usage. This includes ''Victorian'', which often negatively suggests [[sexual repression]] and class conflict. Other labels such as ''[[Renaissance]]'' have strongly positive characteristics. As a result, these terms sometimes extend in meaning. Thus the ''[[English Renaissance]]'' is often used for a period largely identical to the ''Elizabethan Period'' or reign of [[Elizabeth I]], and begins some 200 years later than the [[Italian Renaissance]]. However the ''[[Carolingian Renaissance]]'' is said to have occurred during the reign of the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charlemagne]], and his immediate successors. Other examples, neither of which constituted a "rebirth" in the sense of revival, are the ''[[American Renaissance]]'' of the 1820s-60s, referring mainly to literature, and the ''[[Harlem Renaissance]]'' of the 1920s, referring mainly to literature but also to music and the visual arts.

The conception of a "rebirth" of Classical Latin learning is first credited to the Italian poet [[Petrarch]] (1304-1374), the father of [[Renaissance Humanism]], but the conception of a rebirth has been in common use since Petrarch's time. The dominant usage of the word ''Renaissance'' refers to the cultural changes that occurred in Italy that culminated in the [[High Renaissance]] around 1500-1530. This concept applies dominantly to the [[visual arts]], and the work of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Secondarily it is applied to other arts, but it is questionable whether it is useful to describe a phase in economic, social and political history. Many professional historians now refer to the historical periods commonly known as the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] as the start of the [[Early Modern Period]], which extends much later. There is a gradual change in the courses taught and books published to correspond to the change in period nomenclature, which in part reflects differences between social history and cultural history. The new nomenclature suggests a broader geographical coverage and a growing attention to the relationships between Europe and the wider world.

The term [[Middle Ages]] also derives from [[Petrarch]]. He was comparing his own period to the Ancient or [[Classics|Classical world]], seeing his time as a time of rebirth after a dark intermediate period, the Middle Ages. The idea that the Middle Ages was a "middle" phase between two other large scale periodizing concepts, Ancient and Modern, still persists. It can be sub-divided into the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]]. The term [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] is no longer in common use among modern scholars because of the difficulty of using it neutrally, though some writers have attempted to retain it and divest it of its negative connotations. The term "Middle Ages" and especially the adjective ''medieval'' can also have a negative ring in colloquial use ("the barbaric treatment of prisoners in such-and-such a prison is almost medieval") but this does not carry over into academic terminology. However, other terms, such as [[Gothic architecture]], used to refer to a style typical of the High Middle Ages have largely lost the negative connotations they initially had, acquiring new meanings over time (see [[Gothic architecture]] and [[Goth subculture]]).

The [[Goths|Gothic]] and the [[Baroque]] were both named during subsequent stylistic periods when the preceding style was unpopular. The word "Gothic" was applied as a pejorative term to all things Northern European and, hence, barbarian, probably first by [[Giorgio Vasari]]. Vasari is also credited with first using the term "Renaissance" (''rinascita'') to describe the period during which he was art historian, artist, and architect. [[Giorgio Vasari]] coined the term "Gothic" in an effort to describe, particularly architecture, that he found objectionable, supposedly saying "it is as if the Goths built it". The word ''baroque''—derived from similar words in Portuguese, Spanish, or French—literally refers to an irregular or misshapen pearl. Its first use outside the field of jewellery manufacture was in the early 18th century, as a criticism of music that was viewed as over-complicated and rough. Later, the term was also used to describe architecture and art.&lt;ref&gt;Pasiscla, Claude V., "Baroque" in Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online. Accessed Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Baroque period was first designated as such in the 19th century, and is generally considered to have begun around 1600 in all media. Music history places the end of the period in the year 1750 with the death of [[J. S. Bach]], while art historians consider the main period to have ended significantly earlier in most areas.

==Three-age system==
{{main|Three-age system}}
The usual method for periodization of the distant [[prehistoric]] past, in [[archeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains.  Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used.

==Historiography==
Some events or short periods of change have such a drastic effect on the cultures they affect that they form a natural break in history. These are often marked by the widespread use of both "pre-" and "post-" phrases centred on the event, as in "pre-Reformation" and "post-Reformation", or "pre-colonial" and "post-colonial".  Both [[wikt:pre-war|pre-war]] and [[post-war]] are still understood to refer to [[World War II]], though at some future point the phrases will need to be altered to make that clear.

==Marxian periodisation==
{{undue weight|date=May 2017}}
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims society as fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships, which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory identifies the following stages of history:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primitive communism===
'''The First Stage:''' is usually called [[primitive communism]]. It has the following characteristics.
* '''Shared property:''' there is no ownership between individual possessions. Instead, all possessions the tribe finds are shared to ensure its survival.
* '''[[Hunter-gatherer|Hunting and gathering]]:''' there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions. All is shared by the tribe to ensure its survival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* '''Proto-democracy:''' tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture, and due to this, their survival is a daily struggle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Slave society===
'''The Second Stage:''' may be called [[Slavery|slave society]], considered to be the beginning of "class society" where private property appears.
* '''[[Social class|Class]]:''' here, the idea of class appears. There is always a slave-owning [[ruling class]] and the slaves themselves.
* '''[[Statism]]:''' the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control the slaves.
* '''[[Agriculture]]:''' people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large enough scale to support large populations.
* '''[[Democracy]] and [[authoritarianism]]:''' these opposites develop at the same stage. Democracy arises first with the development of the republican city-state, followed by the totalitarian empire.
* '''[[Property|Private property]]:''' citizens now own more than personal property. Land ownership is especially important during a time of agricultural development.

===Feudalism===
'''The Third Stage:''' may be called [[feudalism]]; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European [[Middle Ages]] when society went from slavery to feudalism.
* '''[[Aristocracy]]:''' the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions, or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership.
* '''[[Theocracy]]:''' this is a time of largely religious rule. When there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life.
* '''[[Hereditary title|Hereditary classes]]:''' [[caste]]s can sometimes form and one's class is determined at birth with no form of advancement. This was the case with [[India]].
* '''[[Nation-state]]:''' nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires. Sometimes, they rebuild themselves into empires once more; this was the case with England's transition from a [[Roman province|province]] to an [[British Empire|empire]].

===Capitalism===
Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which, in western society, classically arose "red in tooth and claw" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the [[profit motive]] rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.

[[Capitalism]] may be considered '''the Fourth Stage''' in the sequence. It appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system. Capitalism is categorized by the following:
* '''[[Market economy]]:''' In capitalism, the entire economy is guided by market forces. Supporters of [[laissez faire]] economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government under capitalism. Marxists, however, such as Lenin in his ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', argue that the capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and the capitalist nation-state, particularly in the conquest of markets abroad.
* '''[[Private property]]:''' The [[means of production]] are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and its nobles, but rather they are controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists control the means of production through commercial enterprises (such as [[corporations]]), which aim to maximise profit.
* '''[[Parliamentary democracy]]:''' The capitalists tend to govern through an elected centralised parliament or congress, rather than under an autocracy. Capitalist (bourgeois) democracy, although it may be extended to the whole population, does not necessarily lead to [[universal suffrage]]. Historically it has excluded (by force, segregation, legislation or other means) sections of the population such as women, slaves, ex-slaves, people of colour or those on low income. The government acts on behalf of, and is controlled by, the capitalists through various methods.
* '''[[Wage]]s:''' In capitalism, workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services.  In reality, workers are paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer.  In this sense, all paid employment is exploitation and the worker is "alienated" from their work.  Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.
* '''[[Imperialism]]:''' Wealthy countries seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to provide captive markets for finished products. This is done directly through war, the threat of war, or the export of capital. The capitalist's control over the state can play an essential part in the development of capitalism, to the extent the state directs warfare and other foreign intervention.
* '''[[Financial institution]]s:''' [[Bank]]s and capital markets such as [[stock exchange]]s direct unused capital to where it is needed.  They reduce barriers to entry in all markets, especially to the poor; it is in this way that banks dramatically improve class mobility.
* '''[[Monopoly|Monopolistic tendencies]]:''' The natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities.

According to Marx, capitalism has critical failings — inner contradictions — which lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the "grave digger" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the "unpaid labour of the working class."  The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production.

===Socialism===
After the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, [[socialism (Marxism)|socialism]], which may be considered '''the Fifth Stage''', will be attained, if the workers are successful.

Socialism may be characterised as follows:
* '''[[Commons|Common property]]:''' the [[means of production]] are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers. This translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production.
* '''[[Council democracy]]:''' Marx, basing himself on a thorough study of [[The Civil War in France|Paris Commune]], believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes. He called this the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], which, overthrowing the dictatorship (governance) of capital, would democratically plan production and the resources of the world.

Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be "in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.

{{Campaignbox Terrorism in Egypt}}

The '''Ras Burqa massacre''' was a shooting attack in October 1985 on Israeli vacationers in [[Ras Burqa]], a beach resort area in the [[Sinai]] peninsula, in which seven, including four children, were killed by Egyptian soldier [[Suleiman Khater]].

==The attack==
On 5 October 1985, an Egyptian soldier, [[Suleiman Khater|Sulayman Khatir]], machine-gunned a group of Israelis, killing three adults and four young children, on the dunes of Ras Burqa.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The only survivor was 5-year old Tali Griffel, whose mother, Anita, shielded her with her body.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.peacenow.org/resources/publications.asp?rid=&amp;cid=228 To Honor Their Lives]&lt;/ref&gt; According to eyewitnesses, the Egyptian [[Central Security Forces]] who were nearby refused to help the wounded; furthermore, they stopped an Israeli doctor and other tourists at gunpoint from administering any aid to the victims of the shooting, and the wounded Israelis were left to bleed to death.&lt;ref name="Lewis233"&gt;Lewis 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00010090/02958/2j&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian authorities countered that the Israelis bled to death "because this crazy soldier refused to let anyone near the area that some of the victims lay".&lt;ref&gt;Israeli Officials Criticize Egyptian Reaction To Sinai Killings, ''Associated Press'', 9 October 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman killed one of the Egyptian policeman who tried to arrest him."&lt;ref name="wp7oct"&gt;Attack Threatens Israeli-Egyptian Ties Aid to Victims of Sinai Shooting Was Delayed, Some Witnesses Say. ''The Washington Post'', 7 October 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel protested the Egyptian refusal to allow the victims to be treated by Israeli doctors or transferred to hospitals in Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pYzO8zmNEmcC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=ras+burqa+egypt&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qxVEsDaiR8&amp;sig=k5AvbQfk2iIX5H6D3801Pd_Or_k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA100,M1 The Middle East: Ten years after Camp David, William B. Quandt ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khatir said the killings were not intentional. He said he could only see a group of people coming towards him in the dark, refusing his orders to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://service.nfo.ac.uk/WebZ/MyLightBoxes?next=%2FWebZ%2FQUERY%3Fsessionid%3D01-41841-1054833686%26next%3Dhtml%2Frec.html%26bad%3Dhtml%2Ferr.html%26format%3DB%26numrecs%3D10%26recno%3D1%26entitytoprecno%3D1%26entityfullrecno%3D1%26entitynewquery%3Dtrue%26sessionid%3D01-41841-1054833686%26index1%3Disan%253A%26term1%3D0019-0003-6555-0000-0-0000-0000-0%26dbname%3Dc4n%2Bc5n%2Bgbr%2Bggr%2Bicn%2Bicr%2Binr%2Bins%2Bioe%2Birs%2Birt%2Biss%2Bpab%2Bpmt%2Brep%2Breu%2Brov%2Bvis%26termA%3D?sessionid=01-41841-1054833686&amp;active=3 NewsFilm Online: Egypt: Death of Policeman Conscript who Killed Israelis leads to Anti-government Demonstrations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315052509/http://service.nfo.ac.uk/WebZ/MyLightBoxes?next=%2FWebZ%2FQUERY%3Fsessionid%3D01-41841-1054833686&amp;next=html%2Frec.html&amp;bad=html%2Ferr.html&amp;format=B&amp;numrecs=10&amp;recno=1&amp;entitytoprecno=1&amp;entityfullrecno=1&amp;entitynewquery=true&amp;sessionid=01-41841-1054833686&amp;index1=isan%3A&amp;term1=0019-0003-6555-0000-0-0000-0000-0&amp;dbname=c4n+c5n+gbr+ggr+icn+icr+inr+ins+ioe+irs+irt+iss+pab+pmt+rep+reu+rov+vis&amp;termA=%3Fsessionid%3D01-41841-1054833686&amp;active=3 |date=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Peace Now]], Tali Griffel described her memories of the attack: "For many years, I didn't think about what happened. I just blocked out everything and then slowly, slowly I sort of regained feeling. I remember as the shooting started, my mother grabbed me and lay down, putting me under her. She whispered to me, keeping me calm. I can still recall the feeling of the jolt as she got shot. Yet, she continued to hold me and talk to me as she bled to death. When I crawled out, I sat there alone for a very long time. The Egyptian police came and took me away to a dark room where they interrogated me for hours."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
===Trial and conviction===
[[File:Suleiman Khater.jpg|שמאל|thumb|250px|An Iranian stamp issued in memory of [[Suleiman Khater]]]]
After the shootings, Egyptian authorities claimed that the perpetrator Sulayman Khatir was mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Years After Camp David, New Reasons for Celebration, ''Wall Street Journal'', 29 March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial interrogations, Khatir claimed that he had been unaware of the identity or nationality of the people he had shot and that they had made no offense or provocation toward him. The only reason why he had opened fire was that, as Khatir said, they had trespassed on a prohibited territory.&lt;ref name="Lewis233"/&gt; He was tried by a closed military tribunal and on 28 December 1985 sentenced to life in prison at hard labor. Ten days later, on 8 January 1986, Khatir was found dead in his prison hospital room hanging by a strip torn from a sheet of plastic. The authorities declared his death a suicide.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;No byline. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3DF1531F93BA35752C0A960948260&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=print Egyptian Who Shot 7 is Dead]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 8 January 1986. URL accessed on 31 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties in Egypt claimed that he had been murdered.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

After Khater's death, the Iranian government of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] issued a stamp "In honour of the martyrdom of Sulayman Khater, Hero of Sinai", and named a street in [[Tehran]] for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/ras-burqa-killer-was-murdered-in-jail-didnt-commit-suicide/ ‘Ras Burqa killer was murdered, didn’t commit suicide’]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions in Egypt===
Egyptian opposition politicians hailed Khatir as "hero of Sinai" for committing the massacre of Israelis.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The glorification of Khatir as a national hero in the Egyptian opposition press was echoed in other [[Arab]] countries, and mass demonstrations were held in his support. Attempting to justify his actions, the press did not report that all but one of the victims were women or children, but instead invented miscellaneous pretexts for the shootings. The press claimed that the Israeli tourists were spies caught photographing secret military installations, that they spat upon and tore up an [[Egyptian flag]], that half-naked Israeli women offended Khatir's [[Muslim]] conscience, or that the tourists attacked him. The pro-governmental press remained silent regarding the facts of the massacre, leaving the claims unchallenged. Many Egyptian intellectuals and religious leaders joined in extolling Khatir and his act. [[Umar al-Tilimsani]], the leader of [[Muslim Brotherhood]], said that "if every Muslim would do what Sulayman did, Israel would no longer exist". Farid Abd al-Karim, one of the leaders of the [[Arab Socialist Party]], called Khatir "the conscience of this nation", whose bullets "washed away the shame" of the [[Camp David Peace Accords]] between Israel and Egypt. [[Ahmad Nasir]] of the [[Egyptian Bar Association]] claimed that history would always honor Khatir as "a living model of a noble Egyptian who refused to be led astray by the treaties of betrayal and surrender".&lt;ref name="Lewis234"&gt;Lewis 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The response of Egyptian president Mubarak was that "Unfortunately these things happen. They cannot reflect on the entire country."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Mubarak's lack of intervention until in a late stage in attempts to present Khatir as a martyred hero hampered efforts to reach an accord on Taba.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMiLBWqCsAC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=egyptians+support+ras+burqa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U7_mj8lW8M&amp;sig=DNzskgWU6GBlgbWKJPovjkzxtMU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA111,M1 Survey of Jewish Affairs, William Frankel, World Jewish Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent Egyptians expressed doubt that Khatir was insane. [[Farid Abd al-Karim]] wished that the whole Egypt "would be struck with this same mighty madness". [[Ali Hillal Dessouki]], a professor at the [[University of Cairo]], said he was astonished that such men as Khatir could be accused of madness and expressed his sadness for the "so-called sane". Nur al-Sharif, an actor, told Khatir: "You are the sanest among us, for you did what we all want."&lt;ref name="Lewis234"/&gt;

The beginning of Khatir's trial sparked a wave of protest rallies, which the Egyptian government saw as a threat to itself.&lt;ref name="Lewis234"/&gt; More than 140 people were arrested, most at [[Zagazig University]] in the [[Nile Delta]] where Khatir had been enrolled as a law student.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; For the first time, the progovernment press published the real story behind the massacre, revealing that the victims were women and children. The editor of ''[[Al-Musawar]]'' journal criticized the opposition press for its handling of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

An Egyptian newspaper published on February 2014 letters written by Khater, alongside the testimonies of his friends who visited him in prison in his last days. 
The letters suggest that Hater was mysteriously murdered in prison, and did not commit suicide, as published at the time in Egypt. Before his death Khater told his friends that prison security officials offered to let him escape, and that he suspected that they were looking for an excuse to shoot him. Khater told his friends that there was no reason to run away, because the prison is located deep in the desert. His mother testified that upon hearing this story she felt that her son was in danger. In one of the two letters, in the possession of his friends, Khater said that he was furious at Israel's treatment of Egypt, its attacks on Lebanon, and the many activities of the Israeli Air Force in the Sinai - despite the peace agreement. In a second letter he published a list of the weapons in the hands of his army unit, and in front of her{{clarify|date=November 2015}} - a description of Israel's air operations in the region. Two lists indicates a large gap in favor of the Israeli army. A friend of Khater, who visited him two days before his death, said Khater was in a good mood and uplifted and nothing indicated his intention to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glz.co.il/1064-35437-he/Galatz.aspx פרסום מצרי: רוצח הישראלים בפיגוע בראס בורקה נרצח בככלא] , [[Army Radio]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation to the victims===
In 1986, as part of the [[Taba Summit|Taba]] talks, Egypt agreed to submit a report on the murder at Ras Burka, and discuss the question of reparations to the bereaved families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1984-1988/134%20Inner%20Cabinet%20Decision%20on%20Taba-%2012%20January%20198 Inner Cabinet Decision on Taba, 12 January 1986]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1989, a special Egyptian legal committee awarded compensation to the victims. The Wall Street Journal said that the amounts were "well within the norms of established international standards" and the [[Sun-Sentinel]] wrote "Egypt agreed to pay $500,000 in compensation".&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-02-27/news/8901110576_1_taba-israel-and-egypt-valid-israeli-passport&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt also made a formal statement to the family of each victim "expressing its acceptance of responsibility, its regret, and its condolences".&lt;ref&gt;Ten Years After Camp David, New Reasons for Celebration, ''Wall Street Journal'', 29 March 1989; also US Department of State Dispatch, 1 May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recorded history''' or '''written history''' is a [[history|historical narrative]] based on a written record or other documented communication. It  contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as [[myth]]ological, [[oral history|oral]] or [[archeological record|archeological]] traditions. For broader [[world history]], recorded history begins with the accounts of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] around the [[4th millennium BC]], and coincides with the [[invention of writing]]. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals; thus, recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.

The interpretation of recorded history often relies on [[historical method]], or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of different historical methods is known as [[historiography]], which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.

== Prehistory ==
{{Further|History of writing}}

[[Prehistory]] traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of [[writing systems]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell1922"&gt;Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.

[[Protohistory]] refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of [[literacy]] in a society but before the writings of the first [[historians]]. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.

More complete writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]]. Early examples are the [[Jiahu symbols]] (c. 6600 BCE), [[Vinča signs]] (c. 5300 BCE), early [[Indus script]] (c. 3500 BCE) and [[Nsibidi]] script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became "true writing"&lt;ref&gt;Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late [[4th millennium BCE]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BCE]].

===East Asia===
In China, the earliest history was recorded in [[oracle bone script]] which was deciphered and may date back to around late 2nd millennium B.C..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = "综述", 中国考古学报第5册(Acta Archaeologica Sinica)|publisher=《考古学报》编辑部|year = 1951 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum|5th century|B.C. }}, is the earliest written of narrative history in the world and covers the period from {{annum|722 to 468|B.C. }}. The ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|B.C. }}, is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles in the world. It is traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551–479 B.C. ). ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|B.C. }}.

[[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|B.C. }}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|B.C. }}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era.

===Europe===
[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 B.C. – c. 425 B.C. )&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |date=1979 |page=5|isbn=0-88133-834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history" composing his [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] written from 450s to the 420s B.C. . However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5" /&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |date=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C. ]]According to [[John Tosh]], "From the High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history."&lt;ref name="Tosh59"&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]].

===South Asia===
In Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the [[Mahavamsa]]. Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the [[Mahanama of Anuradhapura]] while [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] was ruling the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]]. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the ''[[Atthakatha]]'', which were commentaries written in Sinhala.{{sfn|Oldenberg|1879|p=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} An earlier document known as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]''(4th century CE) "Island Chronicles" is much simpler and contains less information than the ''Mahavamsa'' and was probably compiled using the ''Atthakatha'' on the ''Mahavamsa'' as well.

A companion volume, the ''[[Culavamsa]]'' "Lesser Chronicle", compiled by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the [[British Empire|British]] takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The ''Culavamsa'' was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.

The combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Mahavamsa'', provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tripāṭhī|editor1-first=Śrīdhara|title=Encyclopaedia of Pali Literature: The Pali canon |volume=1 |date=2008|publisher=Anmol|isbn=9788126135608|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nāga]] and [[Yaksha|Yakkha people]]s, indigenous inhabitants of [[Lanka]] prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.

===Middle East===
In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

==Methods of recording history==
While recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through [[photography]], [[audio recording]]s, and [[video recording]]s. More recently, [[Web archive|Internet archives]] have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the [[Internet]]. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve [[oral history]] by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using [[analogue recording]] methods such as [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[reel-to-reel tape]]s. With the onset of new technologies, there are now [[digital recording]]s, which may be recorded to CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserving Oral History Recordings|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewArticle/1034/1302|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Colin Webb|author2=Kevin Bradley |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/21336/20080620-0137/www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cwebb4.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|deadurl=no|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.&lt;ref name=Tosh-58-59&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'' 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical method===
The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name="primary source guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=User Education Services|title=Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Sources|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries|accessdate=10 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|archivedate=3 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=12 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, "direct, un-mediated information about the object of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historians use other types of sources to understand history as well. [[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. [[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.&lt;ref name="primary source guide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | title=Glossary, Using Information Resources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | archivedate=28 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }} ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | title=Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | archivedate=12 February 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regius Professorship of Greek''' is one of the oldest [[List of Professorships at the University of Cambridge|professorships]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The [[Regius Professor]] chair was founded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1540 with a stipend of £40 per year, subsequently increased in 1848 by a canonry of [[Ely Cathedral]].

[[File:Great Pyramid Diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section diagram of the [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] shaft and chamber tomb inside the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]]]

A '''shaft and chamber tomb''' is a type of [[chamber tomb]] used by some ancient peoples for burial of the dead. They consist of a shaft dug into the outcrops of rock with a square or round chamber excavated at the bottom where the dead were placed. These chambers can consist of a single shaft and chamber like the Mexican tombs or sometimes quite elaborate as was built in [[ancient Egypt]]. 

Shaft and chamber [[tomb]]s are found at [[Xemxija]] in [[Malta]] which are [[Neolithic]] and ''Dayeh-va-dokhtar'' tombs in [[Fars Province|Fars]] province of [[Iran]]. They were also employed by the ancient Egyptians. The late [[Mesoamerican_chronology#Preclassic Era|pre-Classic]] and early [[Mesoamerican_chronology#Classic_Era|Classic]] Era cultures of west Mexico (what are now the states of [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], and [[Jalisco]]) used tombs of this kind and much of what little is known about these cultures is known from art objects found in these tombs. As a result, these early West Mexico cultures are sometimes referred to as the [[West Mexico shaft tomb culture]].{{Cn|date=May 2015}}

'''Early Egyptian Shaft and Chamber Tombs'''
The first shaft and chamber tomb known to have been used by the ancient Egyptians is the [[mastaba]] tomb. This was a simple tomb with two shafts, with a square chamber at the bottom of each shaft. Another shaft and chamber tomb is the Tomb of [[Osiris]]. Originally discovered in the 1880s, it was cursorily sketched by a Spanish-Italian unit the help of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, which excavated the tomb further. Some say that this tomb dates back to 760-525 BC. It is hard to quite put an exact date but researchers were able to narrow it down by similar tombs. The Tomb of Osiris has three major shafts and eight chambers.  

'''Western Mexico and Central American Tombs'''
The Tombs of Western Mexico and Central America have similar tombs and in part of Ecuador and Columbia these practices were used until the 20th Century. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/1-CompleteSet/MES-78-ShaftTombs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trowulan''' is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Trowulan (subdistrict)|Trowulan Subdistrict]], [[Mojokerto Regency]], in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[East Java]]. It includes approximately 100 square kilometres and has been theorized to be the site of the eponymous capital city of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]], which is described by [[Mpu Prapanca]] in the 14th-century poem [[Nagarakretagama]] and in a 15th-century Chinese source. When it was the capital of the Majapahit Empire, the city was known as '''Wilwatikta''', which is a name also synonymous with the empire's name. It was razed during the invasion of [[Girindrawardhana]] to defeat [[Kertabhumi]] in 1478. After this event Majapahit's capital was moved to Daha ([[Kediri (city)|Kediri]]). The [[Trowulan Museum]] includes a collection of artifacts.

The Nagarakretagama contains poetic descriptions of the palace of Majapahit and its surroundings, but is limited to the royal and religious sectors. Some of the details are vague, and scholars who have tried to compile a plan of the capital have come to different conclusions.

Older research at Trowulan has concentrated on monumental remains: temples, tombs, and a bathing place. Archaeological surveys and excavations have recently found the remains of industrial, commercial and religious activity, habitation areas, water supply systems and water canals all of which are evidence of dense population during the 14th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Millet | first =Didier| title =Indonesian Heritage Series: Ancient History | editor= John Miksic | publisher =Archipelago Press | date = August 2003 | location =Singapore 169641| pages = 108 | url = | doi = | isbn = 981-3018-26-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPMajapahit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracing the glory of Majapahit | author=Sita W.

==Descriptions in contemporary sources==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Candi Bajang Ratu TMnr 10028291.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Bajang Ratu in 1929, before restoration]]
According to the account of [[Mpu Prapanca|Prapanca]] in the [[Nagarakretagama]] poem, the royal compound was surrounded by a thick, high wall of [[red brick]]. Nearby was the fortified guard post. The main gate into the palace was located in the north wall, and was entered through huge doors of decorated iron. Outside the north gate was a long building where courtiers met once a year, a market place, and a sacred crossroads. Just inside the north gate was a courtyard containing religious buildings. On the western side of this courtyard were pavilions surrounded by canals where people bathed. At the south end a gate led to rows of houses set on terraces in which palace servants lived. Another gate led to a third courtyard crowded with houses and a great hall for those waiting to be admitted into the ruler's presence. The king's own quarters, which lay to the east of this courtyard, had pavilions on decorated red brick bases, ornately carved wooden pillars, and a roof decorated with clay ornaments. Outside the palace were quarters for Shiva priests, Buddhists, and other members of the nobility. Further away, and separated from the palace by open fields, were more royal compounds, including that of the chief minister [[Gajah Mada]]. Here Prapanca's descriptions end.

A 15th-century Chinese source describes the palace as clean and well kept. It was said to have been enclosed within a brick wall more than 10 metres high and with a double gate. The houses inside were built on pillars and were 10–13 metres high, with wooden floors covered with fine mats on which people sat. Roofs were made from wooden shingles and the dwellings of the common people were roofed with straw.

A book on Majapahit court etiquette defines the capital as 'All where one can go out without passing through paddy fields.' Temple reliefs from Majapahit do not depict urban scenes, but some contain sketches of settlements indicated as pavilions enclosed within walls. The word 'kuwu' in Nagarakretagama seems to refer the settlement units consisting of a group of buildings surrounded by wall, in which a large number of people lived under the control of a nobleman. This pattern characterised the 16th-century coastal cities of Java described by early European visitors, and Majapahit's capital was probably composed of such units.

==Discovery==
The ancient city ruins at Trowulan had been discovered by the 19th century. [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles]], Lieutenant-Governor of [[British Java]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stamford-Raffles|title=Sir Stamford Raffles {{!}} British colonial agent|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor-General of Bencoolen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-sir-thomas-stamford-raffles-1781-1826-british-statesman-lieutenant-92581742.html|title=Stock Photo - Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, 1781 – 1826.

Much of the region was blanketed with dense [[teak]] forest at that time, making detailed survey impossible. Nonetheless, Raffles was so impressed by what he saw that he was later to refer to Trowulan as ' ''this pride of Java'' '.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bullough | first =Nigel| title =Historic East Java: Remains in Stone, Indonesian 50th independence day commemorative edition | editor= Mujiyono PH| publisher =ADLine Communications| year =1995 | location =Jakarta| page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological sites==
[[File:Trowulan Archaeological Site.svg|right|thumb|275px|Trowulan Archaeological Site. The red square is archaeological sites, the light cyan is traces of ancient canals.]]
Most of archaeological relics discovered in Trowulan and its vicinity is stored and displayed in [[Trowulan Museum]], located on west side of Segaran pool. Excavations in and around Trowulan have shown that parts of the old settlement still lie buried under several metres of mud and volcanic debris, a result of the frequent eruptions of nearby [[Mount Kelud]], as well as frequent flooding of the [[Brantas River]]. Several archaeological ruins lie scattered around Trowulan village. Several are quite damaged, while others have undergone reconstruction. Most are constructed of [[red brick]].
[[File:Candi Tikus.jpg|left|upright|thumb|210px|Candi Tikus bathing place]]
'''Candi Tikus''' is a ritual bathing pool (''petirtaan'') which is perhaps the most exciting recent archaeological finding at Trowulan. Candi Tikus means 'rat temple', the name given to the discovery in 1914 because the site appeared during the excavation to be a rat-breeding enclosure. Restored to its present condition in 1985 and 1989, this complex of red brick takes the form of a sunken, rectangular basin, into which a flight of steps descends on the northern side. The principal structure, which projects from the southern wall of the basin, was apparently modelled on the legendary [[Mount Meru|Mount Mahameru]]. No longer complete, it consisted of terraced foundations, upon which would have rested a concentric arrangement of 'turrets' surrounding the highest peak of the building.

Not far from Candi Tikus in the Keraton hamlet stands the recently restored gateway of '''Bajang Ratu''', an elegant red brick paduraksa gate dating from the mid-14th century. The form of the structure is tall and slender, rising to a height of 16.5 metres and displaying intricate relief decoration, especially on the roof section. The gate is adorned with a bas reliefs depicting the story of [[Sri Tanjung]] and [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Candi Bajangratu | work = Perpustakaan Nasional | url = http://candi.perpusnas.go.id/temples/deskripsi-jawa_timur-candi_bajangratu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bajang Ratu'' in Javanese literally means '[[dwarfism|dwarf]] or [[wikt:defect|defect]] monarch'. Folk tradition links the gate with [[Jayanegara]], the second Majapahit king, successor to [[Kertarajasa|Kertarajasa Jayawarddhana]], founder of the Majapahit Empire. According to tradition, Jayanegara fell from the gate as a child, causing defects to his body. The name probably also means 'little monarch', as Jayanegara ascended to the throne at a young age. Historian connect this gate with Çrenggapura (Çri Ranggapura) or Kapopongan of Antawulan (Trowulan), the shrine mentioned in [[Nagarakertagama]] as the dharma place (holy compound) dedicated to King Jayanegara during his death on 1328.
[[File:Wringin Lawang, Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Wringin Lawang, the gate at Trowulan, [[Mojokerto]]]]
'''Wringin Lawang''' is located a short distance south of [[Indonesian National Route 15]] at Jatipasar village. The name in Javanese means 'The Banyan Tree Gate'. The grand gate portals are made from red brick, with a base of 13 x 11 metres and a height of 15.5 metres, and date from the 14th century. The gate is of the '[[candi bentar]]' or split gateway type, a structure which may have appeared during the Majapahit era. It is one of the oldest and the largest surviving 'Candi Bentar' dated from Majapahit era. The 'Candi Bentar' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure&amp;nbsp;– consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof&amp;nbsp;– evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the center for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound. Most historians agree that this structure is the gate of an important compound in the Majapahit capital. Speculations concerning the original function of this majestic gateway have led to various suggestions, a popular one being that it was the entrance to the residence of [[Gajah Mada]].

'''Candi Brahu''' in the Bejijong village is the sole surviving structure of what was once a cluster of historic buildings. According to popular folk belief, it was in the vicinity of Candi Brahu that the [[cremation]] ceremonies for the first four Majapahit rulers were carried out. This tradition, while difficult to prove, is supported in part by material evidence, which suggests that the monument once served as a royal [[mortuary]] [[shrine]]. The royal personage to whom the building was dedicated remains unclear. The ruin of '''Candi Gentong''' lies nearby.

The Islamic '''tomb of [[Champa]] Princess''' is believed to be the tomb of a Majapahit king's consort. According to local traditions, she is said to have married one of the last of the Majapahit kings and to have converted him to [[Islam]] before her death in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bullough | first =Nigel| title =Historic East Java: Remains in Stone, Indonesian 50th independence day commemorative edition | editor= Mujiyono PH| publisher =ADLine Communications| year =1995 | location =Jakarta| pages =106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Segaran.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Segaran pool]]
'''Segaran Pool''' is a large rectangular pool 800 x 500 metres in size. The name Segaran originated from the word 'segara' in Javanese which means 'sea', probably based on the local suggestion that the large pool is the miniature of the sea. Surrounding the water basin is a rectangular wall made of red brick. The brick pool structure was discovered in 1926 by [[Henri Maclaine Pont]]; at that time the pool was covered in dirt and mud. Reconstruction took place some years later and now Segaran pool functions as a recreational pool and fishing pond. The brick structure originated from the 14th–15th century Majapahit era. The actual function of the pool is unknown. A study suggested that the pool probably served various functions, but mainly as the city reservoir, the source of fresh water essential for high density urban area, especially during the dry season. Another popular local belief is that the pool was used as the bathing place and as a swimming pool to train Majapahit troops, and as recreational pool for Majapahit royalty to entertain envoys and guests. The 46,875-square meter pool was built slightly higher than its surroundings and is currently used to irrigate paddy fields adjacent to the pool.&lt;ref name="JPMajapahit"/&gt;

Near northeast edge of Kolam Segaran lies the ruin of '''Candi Menak Jingga'''. The structure is now ruined and stones scattered around the vicinity with the base still lies buried underground. Excavation still on the progress. The structure is made from carved andesite stone on outer layer with red brick in inner layer. The most exciting feature of this structure is the parts contained ornaments (probably roof part) identified as [[Qilin]], a Chinese mythical creature. This might suggested a strong cultural relationship with China especially during [[Ming Dynasty]]. The local tradition linked this site with the pavilion of Queen Kencana Wungu, the Majapahit queen from the tales of [[Damarwulan]] and Menak Jingga.

At '''Umpak''', stones form the base for wooden pillars, which were probably part of wooden building. The organic material has decayed and only the stone base remains.

In the '''Troloyo''' hamlet, numerous Islamic [[Headstone|tombstones]] have been discovered, the majority of which date from between 1350 and 1478. These finds confirm not only that a Muslim community was well established in Java by the mid 14th century, but also that the religion was officially acknowledged and practised within the royal capital itself. People believe that Troloyo also contains the tomb of [[Raden Wijaya]], and they use to make a pilgrim every ''Legi'' Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bayang-bayang Sebuah Kejayaan | date = 5 January 2009 | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/0815438/bayang-bayang.sebuah.kejayaan | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090112073848/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/0815438/bayang-bayang.sebuah.kejayaan | archivedate = 12 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important ruins include:
*Balong Bunder
*Pendopo Agung
*Goldworking and bronzeworking sites
*Nglinguk
*Candi Kedaton
*Sentonorejo
*Candi Sitinggil

==Houses==
Archaeological excavations have revealed brick floors and the walls of some dwellings. In some cases, two or even three layers of such buildings are superimposed. These dwellings were equipped with wells and drains. Traces of a large reservoir and wells lined with brick or clay have also been located.

==Industries==
Many pieces of gold [[Jewellery|jewelry]] from this period have been discovered in [[east Java]]. Although Java lacks significant gold resources, imports from [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], and [[Sulawesi]] made it possible for many [[goldsmith]]s to find work in Java.

One hamlet of Trowulan is still called Kemasan, from the word ''mas'', meaning 'gold'. Gold ornaments have been discovered near this area, as well as the tools that were used for working the gold. Small clay cups might have been used for melting gold for use in [[lost wax casting]]. [[Bronze]] anvils and flat circular stones with three legs may have been used as work surfaces for chiselling and hammering metals. A large number of clay crucibles for melting bronze have been excavated at Pakis village, in the southern part of the site. Some of the bronze was used to cast ''uang gobog'', large coins or [[amulet]]s, in stone moulds. Other metal objects include ornate bronze lamps, water containers, bells and other items probably used in religious ceremonies, and instruments usually called 'slit drums'. Similar objects made of wood or bamboo are still found in Javanese and Balinese villages. Many iron tools were used, but most were probably imported, as Java has little iron ore.

==Money and market==
[[File:Majapahit, Piggy Bank.jpg|thumb|right|Majapahit [[terracotta]] [[piggy bank]], 14th–15th century Trowulan, [[East Java]]. (Collection of the [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]])]]
The ''Nawanatya'' mentions a court official whose duty was to protect the markets. 'Eight thousands cash every day from the markets is the share' received by this official. The 'cash' referred to in this text is Chinese bronze [[coins]] which became Majapahit's official currency in around 1300, replacing gold and silver currency which had been in use for centuries. Chinese coins were apparently preferable because they were available in small denominations, suitable for use in markets. This change suggests that economic life in Trowulan was marked by specialized occupations, wages, and the acquisition of most daily needs by purchase. Important evidence for the 14th-century Javanese perception of money comes in the form of clay [[piggy bank]]s with slits in their backs large enough to admit a coin. The association of pig figurines and containers for saving money is obvious; in present [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the word 'celengan' means '[[piggy bank]]', '[[money box]]', or '[[saving]]', while the root word 'celeng' itself means [[boar]] or pig. Coin containers in other shapes have also been found.

==Pottery==
Significant numbers of [[Majapahit Terracotta]] artifacts were commonly discovered in Trowulan. The craft of [[pottery]] was an important activity. Most pottery was intended for domestic use in cooking and storage, with decorations limited to stripes of red paint. [[Oil lamp|Lamps]] for coconut oil are another common find. The finest pottery takes the form of vessels, such as water [[Pitcher (container)|ewers]] (''kendi''), with thin-walled bodies, graceful shapes, and a glossy red surface created by [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ing. These must have been made by full-time professional potters. Water containers were one of the Majapahit urban potter's main products and many large round water jars have been found. Square water 'boxes' were decorated with aquatic motifs or other scenery. [[Terracotta]] figurines were produced in large quantities, representing many subjects: gods, humans, animals, buildings, and scenes. Their function is unknown; they may have served multiple purposes. Some may have been used in religious shrines attached to dwellings, as in modern [[Bali]]. Examples of these terracottas in the form of miniature buildings and animals have been found at shrines on [[Mount Penanggungan]]. Others, such as humorous depictions of foreigners, may simply have been meant as toys for children.

==The Majapahit Park==
During the last half-year of 2008, the Indonesian government sponsored a massive exploration on the site that is believed to be the place where the palace of Majapahit once stood. [[Jero Wacik]], the [[Ministry of Tourism (Indonesia)|Indonesian Minister of Culture and Tourism]] stated that the Majapahit Park would be built on the site and completed as early as 2009, in order to prevent further damage caused by home-made brick industries that develop on the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Taman Majapahit Dibangun di Trowulan | date = 4 November 2008 | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/04/20305699/taman.majapahit.dibangun.di.trowulan | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081107163612/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/04/20305699/Taman.Majapahit.Dibangun.di.Trowulan | archivedate = 7 November 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Majapahit Park would expand the existing [[Trowulan Museum]] and provide a Majapahit themed education and recreation park.

Nevertheless, the project leaves a huge attention to some historians, since constructing the park's foundation in Segaran site located in south side of Trowulan Museum will inevitably damage the site itself. Ancient bricks and wells which are historically valuable were found scattered on the site. The government then argued that the method they were applying were less destructive since digging method were used instead of drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Situs Majapahit Dirusak Pemerintah | date = 5 January 2009 | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/05100324/situs.majapahit.dirusak.pemerintah | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090112012614/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/05100324/situs.majapahit.dirusak.pemerintah | archivedate = 12 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the construction of Majapahit Park has been halted, postponed for further study of the impact on the archaeological site.

'''Zwi Perez Chajes''', also '''Tzvi-Peretz Hayot''', (13 October 1876 – 13 December 1927) was a [[rabbi]], [[historian]], [[biblical scholar]] and a notable [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader.

==Biography==
Zwi Perez Chajes was born in 1876 in [[Brody]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], now in [[Ukraine]]. He was the grandson of the [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]]. Hayot learned in a [[Yeshiva]] and was ordained as a rabbi and also studied at a university.

He served as the rabbi of the Jewish community in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] from 1901 and also headed the rabbinical school in Florence. Subsequently and until 1918, Hayot served as a rabbi in the city of [[Trieste]].

From 1918 to his death, Chajes served as the chief rabbi of the Jewish community of [[Vienna]]. In addition, he was also the Chairman of the [[Zionist General Council]] from 1921 to 1925.
[[Image: Zvi Perez Haiut tomb.JPG| thumb|Grave of Zwi Perez Chajes]]
Chajes died in Vienna in 1927. His remains were later taken to [[Israel]] and he was reburied in the Trumpeldor cemetery in [[Tel Aviv]]. The main Jewish school in Vienna is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=STBPliHJ2SQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=zwi+perez+chajes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ESv0BCYTLt&amp;sig=2tl-C3pmO4Tx1ZPI7A3L9X4lNKg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO5ITgm6rXAhWIoaQKHdzGA1Q4ChDoAQhUMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=zwi%20perez%20chajes&amp;f=true Unwanted Beauty: Aesthetic Pleasure in Holocaust Representation, Brett Ashley Kaplan]&lt;/ref&gt;When it reopened in 1984, it was first Jewish high school in the post-Holocaust German-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=skMVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=writings+of+zwi+chajes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wObzTJLbFT&amp;sig=N1BSHZtypSelmc99oYaICYe32xI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_zKvunKrXAhXC66QKHepFCIUQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Contemporary Jewish Writing: Austria After Waldheim, Andrea Reiter]&lt;/ref&gt;
