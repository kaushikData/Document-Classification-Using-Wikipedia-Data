'''''A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World''''' is a work by Christian [[theologian]], [[Protestant Reformer|reformer]], [[author]], and [[pastor]] [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] that was started in the mid-1750s but not finally published until after his death in 1765.&lt;ref name="Edwards Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwards.yale.edu/research/major-works/the-end-for-which-god-created-the-world/|title=The End for Which God Created the World (1765)|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dissertation was published concurrently with ''[[The Nature of True Virtue]]'', and the two works have much in common, specifically the assertion that [[God]]'s aim in creating the world was not human happiness but his own glory.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gwinn|first=Robert P.| title = The New [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|editor=McHenry, Robert|publisher=The [[University of Chicago]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]|year=1993 | edition = Fifteenth|volume=Four|pages=381–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{calvinism}}
Edwards argues against the people of his day that claimed that human happiness was the end for which God created the world.  Edwards instead puts forth the idea that the reason for God's creation of the world was not human happiness, but the magnification of his own glory and name.&lt;ref name= "Edwards Center" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Jonathan|title= A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World | editor= Piper, John|publisher=Crossway Books|location=Wheaton, Illinois|year=1998|pages=138–41| isbn=1-58134-745-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards then continues to argue that since true happiness comes from God alone, human happiness is an extension of God's glory, and that there are "ultimate" ends and "chief" ends, but they all end at the same conclusion. Edwards, like in ''Virtue'', discusses how there is no true happiness without being happy in God.&lt;ref name="Edwards Center" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Edwards" /&gt;

==History and impact==
Modern day [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]]s such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] still use Edwards' works today in their own congregations. In his book ''God's Passion for His Glory'', which includes the complete text of ''The End for Which God Created the World'' as the second half of the book, Piper argues that the longer he lives "the more clearly I see my dependence on those who have gone before," that "Edwards's relentless God-centeredness and devotion to the Biblical contours of doctrine are profoundly needed in our day," and that Edwards is in "a class by himself in American history, perhaps in the history of Christendom."&lt;ref name="Piper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Piper|first=John|title=God's Passion for His Glory: Living the Vision of Jonathan Edwards|publisher=Crossway Books|location=Wheaton Illinois|year=1998|pages=xi–xii|chapter=Preface|isbn=1-58134-745-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Philosopher by lamplight''''' (also known as '''''A Hermit Studying Anatomy''''') is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]]. It is not known when Wright painted the picture, but it was first exhibited in 1769 in London with the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]]. This was one of the earliest of many lamplight or candlelight paintings and portraits for which Wright is famed.

== Description ==

This picture was described in the catalogue of the 1801 sale as a companion to ''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]''. Each has a main figure in the foreground with two subsidiary ones behind, both are night scenes and show old men engaged in scientific research.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: Painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|author2=Mellon, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows an old man who is thought to be a philosopher or a pilgrim,examining a collection of human bones in a lamp-lit cave. Two smaller men, or boys, dressed as pilgrims (as identified by the [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shells]] in their hats: the emblem of St James) seem to be approaching him. The size of these figures is a lot smaller than the main character in the painting. Outside the cave the dark landscape is lit by the moonlight breaking through the clouds. Shells were the sign of pilgrims but they were also the emblem of the Darwin family which included [[Erasmus Darwin]] who was a leading member of the [[Lunar Society]] and [[Derby Philosophical Society]] which linked key men in the age of enlightenment.
[[File:Demokrit, hensunken i betragtninger.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''Democritus in Meditation'' by [[Salvator Rosa]].]]
Experts believe that this painting was based on [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Democritus in Meditation''. Wright’s friend [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] was a follower of Rosa’s so it is possible that Wright would have seen Rosa's work or an engraving of it.&lt;ref name="Derby Museums page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art treasure - A Hermit |url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425222633/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureAHermit.htm |archivedate=25 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democritus was a Greek philosopher who is remembered for making fun of the foolishness of mankind.

Though the painting's subtitle is ''A Hermit Studying Anatomy'', his attitude towards the bones he is holding does not suggest particularly serious scrutiny. He is surrounded by symbols of the ephemeral nature of the human condition which include the skeleton, a lamp that will burn all its fuel, the moon which has to be reborn every four weeks and an hour glass. The moon was also the symbol of the [[Lunar Society]] which Wright was strongly associated with although he never became a member.

The preoccupation of the philosopher and trepidation of the two pilgrims may be a reflection on concerns about the new scientific understanding and [[The Enlightenment|enlightenment at the time]] Wright lived.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Alliance Graphique Internationale''' (AGI) is a club of the world’s leading [[graphic artist]]s and [[designer]]s. There are 497 members from 39 countries.  Its members have been collectively responsible for the identity design of most of the world's top corporations and institutions as well as for countless examples of globally known packaging, publications, illustration and posters. [[:fr:Bernard_Baissait|Bernard Baissait]] is the only member who left the AGI following disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bernardbaissait.fr/cv.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1951 two Swiss and three French graphic artists decided to formalise their relationship into a kind of association. In 1952 the Alliance Graphique Internationale was incorporated in [[Paris]] with 65 members. The first AGI show was in [[Paris]] in 1955. In 1969 the AGI headquarters moved to [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-g-i.org/about/about_who.php?show=3 AGI Backwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important events of the organisation are the annual AGI Congress and AGI Open that take place in a different country in each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-g-i.org/about/about_who.php?show=2 AGI Outwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Apollo Citharoedus''', or '''Apollo Citharede''', is a statue or other image of [[Apollo]] with a [[kithara|cithara]] (lyre). Among the best-known examples is the ''Apollo Citharoedus'' of the [[Vatican Museums]], a 2nd-century AD colossal marble statue by an unknown Roman sculptor. Apollo is shown crowned with [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] and wearing the long, flowing robe of the Ionic bard. The statue was found in 1774, with seven statues of the [[Muses]], in the ruins of [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]' villa  near [[Tivoli, Italy]]. The sculptures are preserved in the Hall of the Muses, in the Museo Pio-Clementino of the  [[Vatican Museums]].

A marble sculpture now identified as ''[[Pothos (sculpture)|Pothos]]'' following a lost Greek 4th-century BC original by [[Skopas]] was restored as an ''Apollo Citharoedus''; it is conserved in the Great Hall of the Palazzo Nuovo, [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome. Another marble ''Apollo Citharoedus'' (2.29m), from a Hellenistic original attributed to [[Timarchides]], of the 2nd century BC,  also stands in the Great Hall of the Palazzo Nuovo.

Other examples include the ''[[Apollo of Mantua]]'' and the ''[[Apollo Barberini]]'', possibly a copy of the cult statue of the [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus]]; it is conserved in the [[Glyptothek]], Munich.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9936">Barbara Park, an American author, wrote and published dozens of books for children. Her [[Junie B. Jones]] series encompasses 30 books and had collectively sold 55 million copies worldwide as of 2013, according to Park's publisher, [[Random House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/18/entertainment/la-et-jc-junie-b-jones-author-barbara-park-has-died-20131118|title=Junie B.

Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus''. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Junie B. Jones, the main character of the series, as "a 6-year-old dispenser of abundant opinions, [[Runyonesque]] wisecracks and dubious syntax."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/barbara-park-author-of-junie-b-jones-series-dies-at-66.html|title=Barbara Park, Author of Junie B.

Park also wrote other books for young readers, including ''[[Skinnybones]]'', published in 1982, and ''[[The Graduation of Jake Moon]]'', published in 2002.

The ''' Boyacá International Cultural Festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishincolombia.gov.co/pagina/vida-urbana_tunja_-vida-cultural&lt;/ref&gt;''' (Spanish: '''''Festival Internacional de la Cultura de Boyacá''''' or just '''''FIC''''') is one of the major international cultural events held annually in [[Colombia]]. The festival presents works in various arts such as music, theater, dance, literature, Academy, Visual Arts, Cinema - Audiovisual, Cultural Heritage cultural exchanges and meetings at various stages in the city of [[Tunja]] since 1973. Artists from different corners of the world intertwine their knowledge and their cultures into one universal feeling, through the medium of art, the best mechanism to achieve peace and brotherhood of people. The FIC gathers thousands of artists and has more than 300,000 visits to about 500 events per version. The festival is considered to be one of the most representative of music, dance, the arts, theater, cultural heritage, literature, cinema and expressions of human sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-celebrates-40th-international-culture-festival-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 44th version of the Boyacá International Cultural Festival will take place from 27 October – 5 November 2016.

==History==

The Festival was created in 1973 under the name of "International Culture Week". In 1981, name as the Boyacá International Cultural Festival, it became one of the most important cultural events in Latin America. The FIC gathers thousands of artists and has more than 300,000 visits to about 500 events per version. The Festival was conceived to meet different cultural and artistic events of international order.
In the 1990s the event was held during two weeks with concerts of symphony and chamber orchestras, choirs, soloists and equally folk and classical ballet, traditional groups and street theater and puppet shows, conferences and cinema, art exhibitions, folk art, book fair and conferences.
Over four decades, the biggest cultural event of the department has developed and grown into a design which educates and shares diverse and exciting cultures from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://colombiareports.com/colombia-celebrates-40th-international-culture-festival-video/&lt;/ref&gt;

The great receptivity of the city has been essential in the success of the event, and no doubt the cultural level that old tradition has identified the local population, year after year, increased their attendance and participation at all levels.

'''Carme Riera Guilera''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈkaɾmə riˈeɾə}}; born 12 January 1948) is a novelist and essayist. She has also written short stories, scripts for radio and television and literary criticism. She holds a doctorate in Hispanic [[Philology]] and is a professor of Spanish literature at the [[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]].

Riera was born in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]]. She attended the Sacred Heart primary school and the Joan Alcover Institute in Palma, where she met Majorcan writers and fell in love with a teacher, Francisco Llinás.

In 1965 she moved to [[Barcelona]] to study Hispanic Philology in the Department of Philosophy and Letters of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. She graduated in 1970 and the following year married Francisco Llinás and was hired by Manuel Blecua to give classes in the Department.

That year her son Ferran was born, and she began her literary career. She writes in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Her [[self-translation]]s are often published at the same time. She currently lives in Barcelona.

Her best-known work is the historical novel "Dins el darrer blau" (1994), winner of several prizes (see below) and the first novel in Catalan to win the Premio Nacional de Narrativa (National Prize for Narrative), awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture. An English translation by Kathleen McNerney, "Blue Horizons of no Return: Sephardic Journeys", is awaiting publication.

Riera was elected to Seat ''n'' of the [[Real Academia Española]] on 19 April 2012, she took up her seat on 7 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rae.es/academicos/carme-riera-guilera |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206002926/http://www.rae.es/academicos/carme-riera-guilera |title=Carme Riera Guilera |language=Spanish |publisher=Real Academia Española |date= |archive-date=6 December 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
The extensive background reader of Carme Riera, consequence of a passionate attitude towards scholarly literature, forms a vast frame of references. [[Sappho]], [[Petrarch]], [[Goethe]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] parade through its pages, but also classical Spanish writers, as [[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra|Cervantes]], [[Leopoldo Alas|Clarin]], [[Carmen Laforet|Laforet]], [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán|Valle-Inclán]], [[Gil de Biedma]] ... However, the author has placed the roots of her narrative in [[Majorcan tales]] and the work of two crucial writers in the construction of contemporary Catalan narrative: [[Caterina Albert]] and [[Mercè Rodoreda|Rodoreda]]

{{Christian culture}}
'''Christian art''' is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from [[Christianity]]. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had [[Aniconism in Christianity|strong objections to some forms of religious image]], and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
{{main|Early Christian art and architecture}}
[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century.  The largest groups of Early Christian paintings come from the tombs in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and show the evolution of the [[depiction of Jesus]], a process not complete until the 6th century, since when the conventional appearance of Jesus in art has remained remarkably consistent.

Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.  Christian art was caught up in, but did not originate, the shift in style  from the  classical tradition inherited from [[Ancient Greek art]] to a less realist and otherworldly hieratic style, the start of [[gothic art]].

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval art}}
[[File:Christ Pantocrator Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|12th-century Byzantine mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] showing the image of [[Christ Pantocrator]].]]
Much of the art surviving from [[Europe]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] is Christian art, although this in large part because the continuity of church ownership has preserved church art better than secular works.  While the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s political structure essentially collapsed after the fall of [[Rome]], its religious hierarchy, what is today the modern-day [[Roman Catholic Church]] commissioned  and funded production of religious art imagery.

The [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]], which enjoyed greater stability within the surviving [[Eastern Empire]] was key in commissioning  imagery there and glorifying Christianity. As a stable Western European society emerged during the [[Middle Ages]], the Catholic Church led the way in terms of art, using its resources to commission [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s.

During the development of Christian art in the [[Byzantine Empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people.  Realistic perspective, proportions, light and color were ignored in favor of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events.  The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|280px|[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] (1498).]]
The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 brought an end to the highest quality Byzantine art, produced in the Imperial workshops there. Orthodox art, known as [[icon]]s regardless of the medium, has otherwise continued with relatively little change in subject and style up to the present day, with Russia gradually becoming the leading centre of production.

In the West, the Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be commissioned  in great quantities by churches, clergy and by the aristocracy.  The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

Artists were commissioned more secular genres like [[portrait]]s, [[landscape painting]]s and because of  the revival of Neoplatonism,  subjects from [[classical mythology]].  In Catholic countries, production continued, and increased during the [[Counter-Reformation]], but Catholic art was brought under much tighter control by the church hierarchy than had been the case before.  From the 18th century the number of religious works produced by leading artists declined sharply, though important commissions were still placed, and some artists continued to produce large bodies of religious art on their own initiative.

===Modern period===
As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, ancient and Medieval Christian art began to be collected for art appreciation rather than worship, while contemporary Christian art was considered marginal.  Occasionally, secular artists treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]) — but only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]).  However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salvador Dali]] is an artist who had also produced notable and popular artworks with Christian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/resources/DaliandReligion.pdf |title=Dali and Religion |work=National Gallery of Victoria, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]] and [[John August Swanson]]. Some writers, such as Gregory Wolfe, see this as part of a rebirth of Christian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Gregory|title=Beauty Will Save the World: Recovering the Human in an Ideological Age|year=2011|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|isbn=978-1-933859-88-0|pages=278|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Will-Save-World-Ideological/dp/1933859881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular devotional art===
Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular [[Christian culture]]. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95&lt;/ref&gt; have been very successful.

The  '''Church of Saint Joseph the Worker''' (Alcamo) is a [[Catholic]] Church located in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Historical hints ==
On 3 February 1944 the [[Bishop of Mazara]], monsignor Salvatore Ballo, gave the permit to build this church, and they start works on 22 January 1945.

Thanks to the priest Bartolomeo Palumbo, it was founded in 1946 on a piece of land given by a lady and built after the plan of Giuseppe Russo, an engineer; it already became a [[parish]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="gui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, the parson, Father Palumbo, founded the male and female Congregation of saint Joseph the Worker;  every year, on the 23rd January, they celebrated the festivity of Saint Joseph’s  Marriage, by taking part to the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], during which the married couples were blessed. 
Later both the congregations joined  the parish Association of [[Azione Cattolica]].&lt;ref name="con"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.190, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 he founded the male and female Congregations of Maria Santissima di Fatima: the scope was that of  solemnizing the month of May and the feast of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] on May 13, moreover they had to take part to the Mass on the first Saturday each month. 
They also joined the Associations of Azione Cattolica later.&lt;ref name="con"/&gt;

Saint Joseph the Worker is celebrated on May 1, in the district of ''San Ciusippuzzu''. Besides religious ceremonies and the [[procession]], there are musical and theatrical shows and bike races.

== Father Palumbo ==
[[File:Funerale_nel_Corso_VI_Aprile,_Alcamo.jpg|thumb|Corteo funebre di Padre Palumbo]]
Father Palumbo was born in Alcamo on 29 August 1915 and became a priest in 1941; he soon had the office of  Vicar Cooperator in the parishes of the [[Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church (Alcamo)|Church of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew]], [[Church of the Holy Crucifix (or Saint Francis of Paola)]] and [[Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory (Alcamo)|Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory]]. He was also nominated as honorary [[Canon (priest)]] of the [[collegiate church]] of the [[Mother church (Alcamo)|Mother church]].

On bare feet,  with a cross on his hands and a great number of believers, on 30 April 1944 he went towards the quarter of ''Balatelle'' (a suburb at that time) on the piece of land which had been donated to him by Mrs. Annunziata Macaluso, the widow of the chemist doctor Fazio,&lt;ref name=Regi&gt;Vincenzo Regina: La chiesa parrocchiale di San Giuseppe in Alcamo; Grafiche Campo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; put down the cross there and, since then, every Sunday he celebrated the Holy Mass on a makeshift altar.&lt;ref name=Papa&gt;Tommaso Papaː Memorie storiche del clero di Alcamo; ediz.Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo, Alcamo, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;   

Until he stayed in seminary he was a great devotee of Saint Joseph: during the night he got up, kneeled and recited the [[rosary]] in honour of him, this prayer in dialect, very interesting also from the symbolical point of view:

''Scura stasira agghiorna dumani ''

''la pruvvidenza m’aviti a mannari''.&lt;ref name="sbe"&gt;http://win.lasberla.com/Cultura-trapani/2225-comunicazione-evento--della-traslazione-salma-sac-bartolomeo-palumbo-#.&lt;/ref&gt;

(It was a prayer asking for Providence from the Saint).
He asked for saint Joseph’s protection both for his family and the Church, then he put his project on the Saint’s hands.
In 1947 he succeeded in completing the basement below the Church and start celebrating Mass there.[4]

With his zeal and faith, Father Palumbo succeeded in dragging all the district and citizens to contribute to the costs for completing  the building of the Church by any type of offerings, even in kind  (wheat, eggs, legumes, flour, etc.). He used all these things, however, to help a lot of people in need  too; there are so many stories about his great goodness.&lt;ref name="sbe"/&gt;
He succeeded  also in creating a parish community very united and open to charity.

With the bishop’s bull of May 3, 1947, the Church was elevated to a parish and the following day the [[Bishop of Mazara del Vallo]], His  Excellency Monsignor Ballo, gave  father Palumbo the canonical possession.&lt;ref name=Papa/&gt;    
Father Palumbo's mother, signora Vita Rocca, had donated her dowry for the legal recognition of the Parish, which was given with the Decree of the President of Republic on 10 June 1948.&lt;ref name=Regi/&gt;

On 30 May he died, leaving his parish community and the whole town in anguish for his  untimely end: there were thousands of people at his [[funeral]].

He was buried in the old cemetery ''Cappuccini'' in Alcamo and, after the approval by His Excellency Mons. Alessandro Plotti, on 22 October 2013, by  popular demand of believers, his mortal remains were moved to his Church.&lt;ref name="sbe"/&gt;

== Description and works ==
The façade is elegant and in [[Romanesque style]]; the interior is with one nave and a coffered ceiling.&lt;ref name="gui"/&gt;

There are these works: :

*Wooden statue of saint Joseph with the [[Infant Jesus]] in his arms made by Giuseppe Di Caro, a sculptor from Palermo, in 1952. The mantle of the saint is covered with pure gold, and their clothes with silver.&lt;ref name="gui"/&gt;
*An Angel trumpet player and the Angel musician: both chromium-plated by [[Gino Patti]], the [[surrealist painter]] from Alcamo,&lt;ref name=Regi/&gt; on the walls behind the high altar
*Wooden statue of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], right altar, realized by Giuseppe Stuflesser from [[Ortisei]] ([[Bolzano]]) in 1949
*Statue of [[Christ the King]], left altar, realized by Luigi Santifaller in 1954. Below it there is the [[sarcophagus]] with the mortal remains of the [[Reverend]] Father Palumbo.

According to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from  [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of [[colonialism]]: cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name="Houska"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houska|first1=Tara|title='I Didn't Know' Doesn't Cut It Anymore|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051|website=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132337/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}

==Overview==

Cultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas, symbols, artifacts, or other aspects of human-made visual or non-visual culture.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, Arnd (2003) ''[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187627 On ‘appropriation’. A critical reappraisal of the concept and its application in global art practices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231455/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=187627 |date=March 3, 2016 }}'', published in Social Anthropology (2003), 11:2:215–229 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concept that is controversial in its applications, the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the dominant culture&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt;&lt;ref name=KJohnson/&gt; or when there are other issues involved, such as a history of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] conflict.&lt;ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation"/&gt; This is often seen in cultural outsiders' use of an oppressed culture's symbols or other cultural elements, such as music, dance, spiritual ceremonies, modes of dress, speech, and social behaviour,&lt;ref name=Alcoff/&gt; notably when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion, rather than respected within their original cultural context. Opponents view the issues of colonialism, context, and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. They argue that mutual exchange happens on an "even playing field", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.&lt;ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundaresh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Owns Culture?: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law (Rutgers Series: The Public Life of the Arts)|last=Scafidi|first=Susan|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It is most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view of cultural appropriation characterizes critics of the practice as "engaged in a deeply conservative project: one which first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture."&lt;ref name=Bogeyman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/berg-cultural-appropriation-is-bad/7047004|title=Is cultural appropriation the bogeyman it's made out to be?|last=Berg|first=Chris|work=The Drum|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of cultural appropriation view it as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy as among its benefits.&lt;ref name=Noah&gt;{{cite web|work=Noahpinion|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/cultural-appropriation-is-great.html?m=1|title=Cultural appropriation is great!|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=December 19, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' appropriated elements from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', which itself appropriated elements from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as [[American Chinese cuisine]], modern Japanese [[sushi]], and [[bánh mì]], each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.&lt;ref name=Bogeyman /&gt;

==Academic study==
Cultural appropriation is a relatively recent subject of academic study. 
The term emerged in the 1980s, in discussions of post-colonial critiques of Western expansionism,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652789|title=Cultural appropriation - Oxford Reference|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the concept had been explored earlier, such as in "Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism" by Kenneth Coutts‐Smith in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=John |last2=Hiller |first2=Susan |date=1992 |title=The Myth of Primitivism|journal=Circa|issue=61|pages=49|doi=10.2307/25557703|issn=0263-9475|jstor=25557703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural and racial theorist [[George Lipsitz]] has used the term "strategic anti-essentialism" to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of one's own, to define oneself or one's group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures, and is not confined only to the use of the other. However, Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture, it must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technoliteracy, Discourse, and Social Practice: Frameworks and Applications in the Digital Age| editor=Darren Lee Pullen| publisher=IGI Global| date=2009| isbn=978-1605668437| pages=312| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TqJ3mKb41UsC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=strategic+anti+essentialism+lipsitz#v=onepage&amp;q=strategic%20anti%20essentialism%20lipsitz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Art, literature, iconography, and adornment===
A common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the [[iconography]] of another culture, and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture's [[mores]]. Examples include sports teams using [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribal names or images as mascots; wearing jewelry or fashion with religious symbols such as the [[war bonnet]],&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt; [[medicine wheel]], or cross without any belief in those religions; and copying iconography from another culture's history such as [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] tribal tattoos, [[Chinese characters]], or [[Celtic art]] worn without regard to their original cultural significance. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as [[kitsch]] risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions.&lt;ref name=Keene1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sundaresh/&gt;&lt;ref name=MTV1&gt;Ehrlich, Brenna (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Wear A Native American Headdress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117151650/http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ |date=November 17, 2016 }}" for [[MTV]] News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOnline1"&gt;Freda, Elizabeth (Jul. 28, 2014) "[http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses Music Festival Is Banning Cultural Appropriation, aka Hipsters Wearing Native American Headdresses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507210844/http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses |date=May 7, 2016 }}" for ''EOnline''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Zimmerman, Amy (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html Pharrell, Harry Styles, and Native American Appropriation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409140437/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html |date=April 9, 2016 }}" for [[The Daily Beast]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe and North America a common example of cultural appropriation is the misrepresentation of East Indian symbols, mythology and religious ideas as typified in Rudyard Kipling's stories and Talbot Mundy's [[Jimgrim]] book series including the highly discussed [[Nine Unknown]] and [[King of the Khyber Rifles]]. Movements to undo the biases, misrepresentations, and cultural inaccuracies made popular by authors like Kipling and Mundy have gained significant momentum since Kipling's poem "[[If—]]" was scrubbed off Manchester University walls by student leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/07/18/rudyard-kiplings-poem-scrubbed-wall-students-claim-hewas-racist/|title=Rudyard Kipling's 'If' poem scrubbed off wall by students who claim he was a 'racist'|last=Turner|first=Camilla|date=2018-07-18|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAJA, a watchdog organization for fair and respectful cultural representation, works to point out and prevent these cultural inaccuracies in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aaja.org/about|title=About AAJA|work=Asian American Journalists Association|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. Some scholars of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[ancient Egypt]] argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab.&lt;ref&gt;Ousterhout, Robert. [http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=8983 "Ethnic Identity and Cultural Appropriation in Early Ottoman Architecture."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613015818/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=8983 |date=June 13, 2006 }} Muqarnas Volume XII: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture.

===Religion and spirituality===
Among critics, the misuse and misrepresentation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism, and one step in the destruction of indigenous cultures.&lt;ref name="Wernitznig2"&gt;Wernitznig, Dagmar, ''Europe's Indians, Indians in Europe: European Perceptions and Appropriations of Native American Cultures from Pocahontas to the Present''. University Press of America, 2007: p.132. "What happens further in the [[Plastic Shaman]]'s [fictitious] story is highly irritating from a perspective of cultural hegemony. The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones. The messianic element, which Plastic Shamanism financially draws on, is installed in the Yoda-like elder themselves. They are the ones – while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot – who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones. Licensed by the authority of an Indian elder, they now have every right to spread their wisdom, and if they make (quite more than) a buck with it, then so be it.—The neocolonial ideology attached to this scenario leaves less room for cynicism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of this use of indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, and the [[United Nations General Assembly]], to issue several declarations on the subject. The ''Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality'' includes the passage:
{{quote|We assert a posture of zero-tolerance for any "white man's shaman" who rises from within our own communities to "authorize" the expropriation of our ceremonial ways by non-Indians; all such "[[Plastic shaman|plastic medicine men]]" are enemies of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;|}}Article 31 1 of the United Nations ''[[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]'' states:{{quote|Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.&lt;ref name="UNDRIP"/&gt;|}}

Many Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be cultural appropriation of their [[sweat lodge]] and [[vision quest]] ceremonies by non-Natives, and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They also contend that there are higher safety risks when the ceremonies are conducted by non-Natives, pointing to [[Sweat lodge#Risks|deaths or injuries]] in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile deaths in 2009.&lt;ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death"&gt;{{cite news|first=RW|last=Byard|work=Forensic Science SA|title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16121078&amp;dopt=Abstract|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taliman2"&gt;{{citation | first = Valerie |last = Taliman | title = Selling the sacred | publisher = Indian Country Today | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob |last = Goulais | title = Editorial: Dying to experience native ceremonies | newspaper = North Bay Nugget | date = 2009-10-24 | url =http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hocker, Lindsay.

In 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the [[Rainbow Family]] members whose acts of "cultural exploitation... dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking."&lt;ref name="HeSapa"&gt;Estes, Nick; et al "[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/protect-he-sapa-stop-cultural-exploitation Protect He Sapa, Stop Cultural Exploitation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303091719/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/protect-he-sapa-stop-cultural-exploitation |date=March 3, 2016 }}" at ''[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]''. 14 July 2015.

===Fashion===
[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|[[George IV of the United Kingdom]] wearing [[highland dress]], 1822.]]

Cultural appropriation is controversial in the [[fashion industry]] due to the belief that some trends commercialise and cheapen the ancient heritage of indigenous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/11/is-cultural-appropriation-in-fashion-offensive-part-ii/|title=Is Cultural Appropriation in Fashion Offensive?

====17th century to Victorian era====
During the 17th century, the forerunner to the [[three piece suit]] was appropriated from the [[traditional dress]] of diverse Eastern European and Islamic countries. The [[Justacorps]] [[frock coat]] was copied from the long [[zupan (clothing)|zupan]]s worn in Poland and the Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world4.eu/french-fashion-reign-louis-xiv/|title=Reign Louis XIV. French fashion history.|website=world4.eu|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[necktie]] or [[cravat]] was derived from a scarf worn by Croatian mercenaries fighting for [[Louis XIII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;lpg=PA457&amp;pg=PA457#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture|first=Richard C.|last=Frucht|date=27 June 2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the brightly colored silk [[waistcoat]]s popularised by [[Charles II of England]] were inspired by exotic Turkish, Indian and Persian attire acquired by wealthy English travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Q4NAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=eastern+vest+waistcoat&amp;pg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Clothing: A Global History|first=Robert|last=Ross|date=2 May 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Highland Clearances]], the British aristocracy appropriated traditional [[Scottish clothing]]. [[Tartan]] was given spurious association with specific [[Highland clan]]s after publications such as [[James Logan (writer)|James Logan]]'s romanticised work ''The Scottish Gael'' (1831) led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans &lt;ref name="BanksdelaChapelle--106-108"&gt;[[#B|Banks: de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; and tartan became a desirable material for dresses, waistcoats and cravats. In America, plaid flannel had become [[workwear]] by the time of [[Westward expansion]], and was widely worn by [[Old West]] [[American pioneer|pioneers]] and [[cowboy]]s who were not of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=plaid+shirts+old+west&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|first=Jeremy|last=Agnew|date=25 October 2012|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2000s in fashion|21st century]], tartan remains ubiquitous in mainstream fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/1907/highland-fling|title=Highland fling - New Humanist|website=newhumanist.org.uk|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century the fascination had shifted to Asian culture. English [[Regency era]] [[dandies]] adapted the Indian [[churidar]]s into [[skinny jeans|slim fitting]] [[Trousers#Europe before the 1900s|pantaloons]], and frequently wore [[turban]]s within their own houses. Later, [[Victorian era|Victorian]] gentlemen wore [[smoking cap]]s based on the Islamic [[fez]], and fashionable [[turn of the century]] ladies wore [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/07/18/books/underneath-orientalist-kimono/#.WO11OoWcHIU|title=Underneath the 'Orientalist' kimono - The Japan Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese inspired [[kimono]] dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUhUmviJQFAC&amp;pg=PT255&amp;dq=smoking+cap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Cigars, 2nd Edition|first=Tad|last=Gage|date=1 September 1997|publisher=Penguin|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7G6xDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202|title=The Social Life of Kimono: Japanese Fashion Past and Present|first=Sheila|last=Cliffe|date=23 March 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[tiki culture]] fad of the 1950s, white women frequently donned the [[qipao]] to give the impression that they had visited [[Hong Kong]], although the dresses were frequently made by seamstresses in America using [[rayon]] rather than genuine silk. At the same time, teenage British Teddy Girls wore Chinese [[coolie hat]]s due to their exotic connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subcultureslist.com/teddy-girls/|title=Teddy girls - Teddy girl a member of youth subculture in 1950s|website=subcultureslist.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, the [[sombrero]] associated with the [[mestizo]] peasant class was appropriated from an earlier hat introduced by the Spanish colonials during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUz1xhAZcKQC&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=cowboy+hat+sombrero&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Cowboy at Work: All about His Job and how He Does it|first=Fay E.|last=Ward|date=27 June 1987|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, was adapted into the [[cowboy hat]] worn by American cowboys after the [[US Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/berg-cultural-appropriation-is-bad/7047004|title=Is cultural appropriation the bogeyman it's made out to be?|last=|first=|date=|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[University of East Anglia]] prohibited the wearing of sombreros to parties on campus, in the belief that these could offend Mexican students.&lt;ref name=Shriver /&gt;

American [[Western wear]] was copied from the work attire of 19th century Mexican [[Vaquero]]s, especially the pointed [[cowboy boot]]s and the [[guayabera]] which was adapted into the embroidered [[Western shirt]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Cowboys," from Time Life The Old West series. (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China poblana]] dress associated with Mexican women was appropriated from the [[choli]] and [[lehenga]] worn by [[India]]n maidservants like [[Catarina de San Juan]] who arrived from Asia from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analesiie.unam.mx/pdf/71_37-73.pdf A Mughal princess in New Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 during the annual [[Victoria's Secret]] fashion show, model [[Karlie Kloss]] was scrutinized for wearing a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] headdress during her walk on the runway.  There was a mixed public response.  People of mixed heritage were the most sensitive to headdress. ''[[USA Today]]'' ran a feature where they interviewed a woman of mixed heritage who said that the headdress is a symbol of leadership and honour, and also has a [[religious]] meaning behind it. This cultural meaning was not considered in Victoria’s Secret’s use of the headdress as an accessory. Victoria's Secret issued an apology stating that they had no intentions of offending anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2012/11/12/victorias-secret-apologizes-for-use-of-headdress/1701413/|title=Victoria's Secret apologizes for using headdress|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac1394dbdcca6a36cbf486633b129cd813095ac3/r=x404&amp;c=534x401/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2012/11/12/ap-victoria-secret-headdress-4_3.jpg|title=(This is a link to the photo of Karlie Kloss wearing a Native American headdress during the Victoria's Secret Fashion show.)|website=gannett-cdn.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairstyles, makeup and body modifications===
*The leaders of [[ancient Israel]] strongly condemned the adoption of Egyptian and Canaanite practises, especially cutting the hair short or shaving the beard. At the same time, the Old Testament distinguishes the religious [[circumcision]] of the [[Hebrew]]s, from cultures such as the Egyptians where the practise had aesthetic or practical purposes.
*During the early 16th century, European men imitated the short [[regular haircut]]s and beards on rediscovered [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman statues. The curled hair favoured by the [[Regency era]] [[dandy]] [[Beau Brummel]] was also inspired by the classical era.
*During the 17th century, [[Louis XIV]] began wearing [[wig]]s to conceal his baldness. Like many other French fashions, these were quickly appropriated by [[baroque era]] courtiers in England and the rest of Europe to the extent that men often [[head shaving|shaved their head]]s to ensure their wig fitted properly.
*American soldiers during [[World War II]] appropriated the [[Mohawk hairstyle]] of the Native American tribe of the same name to intimidate their enemies. These were later worn by 1950s [[jazz]] musicians like [[Sonny Rollins]], and the [[1980s fashion|1980s]] [[punk subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atane.tumblr.com/post/2897620329/sonny-rollins-wore-a-mohawk-hairstyle-long-before|title=Audiophile Life|website=Audiophile Life|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{see also|Native American mascot controversy|List of sports team names and mascots derived from indigenous peoples}}
[[File:FedExField - Redskins Jaguars pregame field.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Redskins]] logo in Maryland]]

While the history of colonization and [[marginalization]] is not unique to the Americas, the practice of non-Native sports teams deriving team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada, and has persisted to some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups. Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at [[Portland State University]], cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="Pewewardy.1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0710-1481| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 176–189| last = Pewewardy| first = Cornel| title = From enemy to mascot: The deculturation of Indian mascots in sports culture| journal = Canadian Journal of Native Education| accessdate = 2014-11-22| date = 1999| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/230304174}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0027-6014| volume = 40| issue = 3| pages = 1–12| last = Longwell-Grice| first = Robert|author2=Hope Longwell-Grice| title = Chiefs, Braves, and Tomahawks: The Use of American Indians as University Mascots| journal = NASPA Journal (National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, Inc.)| accessdate = 2014-10-29| year = 2003 | url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ehh&amp;AN=32547562&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site| doi=10.2202/0027-6014.1255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such practices may be seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities which have a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion.&lt;ref name="usccr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aistm.org/fr.usccr.htm |title=Statement of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on the Use of Native American Images and Nicknames as Sports Symbols |publisher=The United States Commission on Civil Rights |date=April 13, 2001 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that create a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] initiated [[NCAA Native American mascot decision|a policy]] against "hostile and abusive" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).&lt;ref name="NCAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the leadership of nearly all Native American tribes object to their depictions as sports mascots&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncai.org/proudtobe&lt;/ref&gt;, only one tribe explicitly approves of such representations.

In other former colonies in Asia, Africa, and South America, the adoption of indigenous names for majority indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnicity-related team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area, such as the [[Boston Celtics]], the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], and the [[History of the Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Vikings]].

The [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] to be held on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in Australia from 4 April 2018 has named its mascot [https://shop.gc2018.com/collections/mascot-1 Borobi], the local [[Yugambeh people|Yugambeh]] word for "koala," and has sought to trademark the word through [https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/1762487?q=borobi IP Australia]. The application is being opposed by a Yugambeh cultural heritage organisation, which argues that the Games organising committee used the word without proper consultation with the Yugambeh people.

===African-American culture===
[[File:Paul Wall.jpg|thumb|Example of hip hop fashion]]
The term [[wigger]] (common spelling "wigga") is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms, [[African American Vernacular English|language]], and [[Hip hop fashion|fashions]] associated with [[African-American culture]], particularly [[hip hop]], and, in Britain, the [[Grime (music)|grime]] scene, often implying the imitation is being done badly, although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nell: ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'', 5th ed. 607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/wigger |title=Wigger &amp;#124; Define Wigger at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wigger |title=wigger - definition of wigger by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wigger is a [[portmanteau]] of ''white'' and ''[[nigger]]'' or ''[[nigga]],'' and the related term wangsta is a mashup of ''wannabe'' or ''white'', and ''[[gangsta rap|gangsta]]''. Among black hip-hop fans, the word "nigga" can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting, but when used by whites, it is usually viewed as offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.09.98/cover/nigger-9814.html|title=Metroactive News &amp; Issues - The Word 'Nigger'|website=www.metroactive.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wigger" may be derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, [[black British]], and white culture (when used as synonym of [[white trash]]). The term is sometimes used in a racist manner, by other white people to belittle the person perceived as "acting black", but it is also widely used by African Americans like [[50 Cent]] offended by the wigga or [[chav|wanksta]]'s demeaning of black people and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xmmNfoefAAC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=LvbpzvmxIs&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America|first=Bakari|last=Kitwana|date=30 May 2006|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=27 June 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since [[slavery]] was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in the [[Western world]]. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the ''white negro'' in the [[jazz]] and [[swing music]] scenes of the 1920s and 1930s, as examined in the 1957 [[Norman Mailer]] essay "[[The White Negro]]". It was later seen in the [[zoot suit]]er of the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] of the 1940s, the [[beatnik]] of the 1950s–1960s, the [[blue-eyed soul]] of the 1970s, and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were "wannabe Blacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/wiggers-just-wannabe-black-white-middleclass-kids-are-adopting-black-street-style-and-chilling-out-to-rap-music-david-usborne-reports-from-washington-1462591.html|title=Wiggers just wannabe black: White middle-class kids are adopting black street style and chilling out to rap music.|date=1993-08-22|publisher=Independent.co.uk|author=|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2005 saw the publication of ''Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wangstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America'' by Bakari Kitwana, "a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years"''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitwana |first=Bakari |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4773208 |title='Why White Kids Love Hip Hop' |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Clift's documentary ''Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity'' questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. Clift's documentary examines "racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of [[Stephen Foster]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Rolling Stones]] -- all the way up to [[Vanilla Ice]] (popular music's ur-wigger...) and [[Eminem]]."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;Hank Stuever, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150706043444/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/29/AR2010012904040.html "'Blacking Up' documentary questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 30 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as "white [[poseur]]s", and states that the term ''wigger'' "is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture".&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Language===
Use of [[minority languages]] is also cited as cultural appropriated, such as when non-speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]] or [[Irish language|Irish]] get tattoos in that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McEwan|first1=Emily|title=The Scottish Gaelic Tattoo Handbook|publisher=Bradan Press|isbn=9780995099807|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHb0jwEACAAJ&amp;dq=the%20scottish%20tattoo%20handbook|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2017}} Likewise, the use of incorrect [[Scottish Gaelic]] in a tokenistic fashion aimed at non-Gaelic speakers on signage and announcements has been criticized{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} as disrespectful to fluent speakers of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Richard A.

Since the early 2000s, it has become increasingly popular for people not of Asian descent, to get [[tattoo]]s of Indian [[devanagari]], [[Hangeul|Korean letters]] or [[Han character]]s ([[Traditional Chinese|traditional]], [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]] or [[Kanji|Japanese]]), often without knowing the actual meaning of the symbols being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.port.ac.uk/1135/|title=Cultural appropriation of Japanese tattoos, 2008|website=port.ac.uk|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/04/13/lost-in-translation-tattoos-and-cultural-appropriation/|title=Lost in Translation: Tattoos and Cultural Appropriation - Sociological Images|first=The Society|last=Pages|website=thesocietypages.org|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to last US Census (2010), Asian-Americans make up 4.8 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf|title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010|last=Humes|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Ramirez|first3=Roberto R.|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2016, only one out of 20 (which corresponds to 5 percent) speaking roles go to Asian-Americans, and they are given only one percent of lead roles in film. White actors account for 76.2 percent of lead roles, while representing 72.4 percent of the population according to the last US census.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentprintz.com/whitewashing-film-industry-erases-identity/|title=Whitewashing: Film industry erases identity|last1=Bass|first1=Alyssa|website=The Student Printz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424145256/http://www.studentprintz.com/whitewashing-film-industry-erases-identity/|archive-date=April 24, 2018|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2017, ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', which is based on the [[seinen manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]], provoked disputes over whitewashing.

In chapter four of his book ''[[Playing Indian]]'', Native American historian [[Philip J.

In some cases, a culture usually viewed as the target of cultural appropriation can be accused of appropriation, particularly after colonization and an extensive period re-organization of that culture under the [[nation-state]] system. For example, the government of [[Ghana]] has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean [[Emancipation Day]] and marketing it to African American tourists as an "African festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hasty| first=J | title=Rites of Passage, Routes of Redemption: Emancipation Tourism and the Wealth of Culture| journal=Africa Today| volume=49| issue=3, Fall 2002| pages=47–76| publisher=Indiana University Press| url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043196408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show|Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012]], former [[Victoria's Secret]] model [[Karlie Kloss]] donned a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-style [[War bonnet|feathered headdress]] with leather bra and panties and high-heeled [[moccasin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/11/karlie-kloss-really-sorry-about-that-headdress.html|title=Karlie Kloss, Victoria's Secret Really Sorry About That Headdress|website=The Cut|accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was said to be an example of cultural appropriation because the fashion show is showcasing the company's lingerie and image as a global fashion giant. The outfit was supposed to represent November, and thus "Thanksgiving", in the "Calendar Girls" segment. The outfit met with backlash and criticism as an appropriation of Native American culture and tradition. Victoria's Secret pulled it from the broadcast and apologized for its use. Kloss also commented on the decision by tweeting "I am deeply sorry if what I wore during the VS Show offended anyone.

When [[Selena Gomez]] wore the [[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]] during a performance, there was debate on her reasoning behind wearing the culture specific piece. Some viewed this as "casting her vote for Team India" but it was also viewed as misuse of the symbol as Selena was seen as not supporting or relating the Bindi to its origin of Hinduism, but furthering her own self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cultural Appropriation — Is It Ever Okay?|url = http://www.refinery29.com/cultural-appropriation#page-4|website = Refinery29|date = June 15, 2014|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Pharrell Williams]] posed in a Native American war bonnet on the cover of [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']] UK magazine, after much controversy and media surrounding the photo Williams apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pharrell Apologizes for Wearing Headdress on Magazine Cover|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pharrell-apologizes-for-wearing-headdress-on-magazine-cover-20140605|website = Rolling Stone|date = June 5, 2014|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Amandla Stenberg]] made a school-related video called "Don't Cash Crop on My Cornrows" about the use of black hairstyles and black culture by non-black people, acussing like [[Katy Perry]] and [[Iggy Azalea]] of using "black culture as a way of being edgy and gaining attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=Sharifa|title=‘Hunger Games’ Amandla Stenberg Talks Cornrows &amp; Cultural Appropriation|url=http://www.hypehair.com/46876/amandla-stenberg-addresses-black-hairstyles-discussing-cultural-appropriation/|website=www.hypehair.com|publisher=HypeHair|date = April 15, 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenberg later criticized  [[Kylie Jenner]] for allegedly embracing African-American aesthetic values without addressing the issues that affect the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eleftheriou-Smith|first1=Loulla-Mae|title=Kylie Jenner criticised by Hunger Games actress Amandla Stenberg for 'appropriating black culture' with cornrows selfie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kylie-jenner-criticised-by-hunger-games-actress-amandla-stenberg-for-appropriating-black-culture-10384632.html|accessdate=18 December 2015|agency=Independent|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The African-American hip hop artist [[Azealia Banks]] has also criticized [[Iggy Azalea]] "for failing to comment on 'black issues' despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/05/azealia-bankss-beef-with-wigger-iggy-azalea-over-us-race-issues-misses-point |title=Azealia Banks's Twitter beef with Iggy Azalea over US race issues misses point &amp;#124; Monica Tan &amp;#124; Music |publisher=Theguardian.com |date=2014-12-04 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks has called Azalea a "wigger" and there have been "accusations of racism against Azalea" focused on her alleged "insensitivity to the complexities of [[race relations]] and cultural appropriation."&lt;ref name="theguardian1" /&gt;

In 2011, a group of students at [[Ohio University]] started a poster campaign denouncing the use of cultural stereotypes as costumes. The campaign features people of color alongside their respective stereotypes with slogans such as "This is not who I am and this is not okay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poster Campaign|url=https://www.ohio.edu/orgs/stars/Poster_Campaign.html|website=Students Teaching About Racism in Society|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the movement was to raise awareness around racism during Halloween in the university and the surrounding community, but the images also circulated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grinberg|first1=Emanuella|title='We're a culture, not a costume' this Halloween|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/26/living/halloween-ethnic-costumes/|website=www.cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Reclaim the [[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]]" has become a [[hashtag]] used by some people of South Asian descent who wear traditional garb, and object to its use by people not of their culture.

==Criticism of the concept==

[[John McWhorter]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], has criticized the concept, arguing that cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization is a generally positive thing, and is something which is usually done out of admiration, and with no intent to harm, the cultures being imitated; he also argued that the specific term "appropriation," which can mean theft, is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource: unlike appropriating a physical object, others imitating an idea taken from one group's culture don't inherently deprive that originating group of its use.&lt;ref name=McWhorter&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[John McWhorter|McWhorter]]|first1=John|title=You Can't 'Steal' A Culture: In Defense of Cultural Appropriation|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/you-can-t-steal-a-culture-in-defense-of-cultural-appropriation.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, author [[Lionel Shriver]] gave a speech&lt;ref name=Shriver&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad |title=Lionel Shriver's full speech: 'I hope the concept of cultural appropriation is a passing fad' |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2016-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126050319/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad |archivedate=2016-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Brisbane Writers Festival, asserting the right of authors to write from any point of view, including that of characters from cultural backgrounds other than their own&amp;nbsp;– as writers "should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth. If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us." She also asserted the right of authors from a cultural majority to write in the voice of someone from a cultural minority, attacking the idea that this constitutes unethical "cultural appropriation". Referring to a case in which U.S. college students were facing disciplinary action for wearing [[sombrero]]s to a 'tequila party', she said "The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: ''you're not supposed to try on other people's hats''. Yet that's what we’re paid to do, isn't it? Step into other people's shoes, and try on their hats." Sudanese-Australian social activist [[Yassmin Abdel-Magied]] walked out on Shriver's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Convery |first1=Stephanie |title=We need to talk about cultural appropriation: why Lionel Shriver's speech touched a nerve |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve |work=The Guardian |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123152039/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/we-need-to-talk-about-cultural-appropriation-why-lionel-shrivers-speech-touched-a-nerve |archivedate=2016-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel-Magied later wrote a dissenting opinion piece, published in ''[[The Guardian]]''; which has run a series of articles covering the debate over ''cultural appropriation'' matters.  In it, she called the speech "a poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension". She reiterated the basic premises and arguments which form the ideological basis of ''cultural appropriation'', as stated in the above sections, regarding majority/minority, group identity, oppression, colonialism, etc.; but did not address Shriver's arguments about the merits of imagination and intellectual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abdel-Magied |first1=Yassmin |title=As Lionel Shriver made light of identity, I had no choice but to walk out on her|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/as-lionel-shriver-made-light-of-identity-i-had-no-choice-but-to-walk-out-on-her |work=The Guardian |date=2016-09-10|accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126050313/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/as-lionel-shriver-made-light-of-identity-i-had-no-choice-but-to-walk-out-on-her |archivedate=2016-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dance in the Country''''' (French: ''Danse à la campagne'') is an 1883 oil painting by French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. It is currently kept at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pierre Auguste Renoir, ''Danse à la campagne'' |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/peinture.html |publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]] |language=French |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
This painting was commissioned in 1882 by the merchant [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] who wanted works on the theme of the [[Ball (dance)|ball]]. He bought it in 1886, exhibited it for the first time in April 1883, and kept it until Renoir's death in 1919. A complementary painting on the same theme, named ''[[Dance in the City]]'', was also painted by Renoir the same year.&lt;ref name="Orsay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite book |title=Musée d'Orsay, art et architecture |first=Peter J |last=Gartner |publisher=Ullmann |place=China |year=2010 |pages=244, 245 |language=French |isbn=978-3-8331-5443-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting, influenced by the artist's trip in [[Italy]] in 1881 where he found inspiration from [[Raphael]], marked an evolution of the painter who tried then to break away from [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a couple dancing under a chestnut tree: the man is Paul Lhôte, a friend of the painter, and the woman is [[Aline Charigot]], who later became the wife of the painter. Both figures are painted life-size and occupy almost the entire painting. However, a table in the background on the right, and a hat on the ground,  and a pair of faces below the level of the dance floor, can be seen. The woman who holds a fan in her right hand, displays a smiling face and looks towards the viewer. The scene is bathed in a bright and cheerful atmosphere, and the women's clothes use warm colors (yellow gloves, red hat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Renoir - Les classiques de l'art |publisher=Flammarion |year=2005 |place=Paris |page=130 |language=French |isbn=2-08-011445-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
In 1592, [[Bir Hambir]] became king of Bishnupur. He had a great relationship with Akbar, so, a lot of times he went to Akbar's court. Seeing the playing of cards he was surprised. Coming to his kingdom, he thought of creating a new card in God-goddess of uniqueness. According to his directive, artist from Bishnupur, Kartik Faujdar, made the Dashabatar Cards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dashavatar-cardmaking-faces-extinction-in-bengal/article6858196.ece|title=Dashavatar card-making faces extinction in Bengal|last=Das|first=Soumya|date=2015-02-05|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-01-24|last2=Das|first2=Soumya|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; kings of [[Mallabhum]] play this card at leisure for entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mallabhum Bishnupur|last=Manaranjan Chandra|first=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chitrolekha.com/lost-game-dashabatar-taas-of-bishnupur/|title=Lost Game: Dashabatar Taas of Bishnupur - The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|date=2013-03-01|work=The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Indian scholar Haraprasad Shastri said that this game first originated in the 8th century. In 1895 he said in the Asiatic society's journal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...I fully believe that the game was invented about eleven or twelve hundred years before the present date.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because the placement of [[Jagannath]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) is in the 5th position in Dashabatar card, but in common belief, Jagannath is in the 9th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bandyopadhyaya.blogspot.in/2015/11/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html|title=দশাবতার তাস –  এক বিলুপ্তপ্রায় শিল্প ও এক বিলুপ্তপ্রায় খেলা|website=bandyopadhyaya.blogspot.in|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prabhat Kumar Saha, an expert on Dashavatar cards, said: "Malla dynasty ruled from about 12th century AD to 1622". He confirmed that the Foujdars were the only makers of these cards in Bengal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Method ==
The artists from the Faujdar family of Bishnupur specialise in making these cards. At first, a piece of cloth is folded a number of times. Then glue is pasted, made from tamarind seeds. After drying this, a layer of chalk dust is applied on the cards. Both sides are evened out with a smooth stone. The cards are then cut into round shapes of a 4.5-inch radius. Various deities and their symbols are painted on these using various colours. On the reverse part, a layer of lac and vermillion is applied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cards ==
Dashavatar cards are the 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu - Matsya, Kurma, Baraha, Nrisingha, Buddha(Jagannath), Baaman, Ram, Balaram, Parshuram and Kalki are drawn on these cards. 

The Dashavatar card game is a complicated one. It is played using 120 cards with numerous rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Drafter at work.jpg|thumb|Upright|Traditional drafter at work]]
[[File:Man at drafting table.jpg|thumb|A drafter in Portugal in the 1970s, using a [[drafting machine]] ]]
A '''drafter''', '''draughtsman''' ([[British English]]) or '''draftsman''', '''drafting technician''' ([[American English]] and [[Canadian English]]) is a person who makes detailed [[Technical_drawing|technical drawings]] or plans for machinery, buildings, electronics, infrastructure, sections, etc. Drafters use computer software and manual sketches to convert the designs, plans, and layouts of engineers and architects into a set of technical drawings. Drafters operate as the supporting developers and sketch engineering designs and drawings from preliminary design concepts.

== Overview ==
In the past, drafters sat at drawing boards and used pencils, pens, compasses, protractors, triangles, and other drafting devices to prepare a drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released and was able to produce technical drawings at a faster pace. 

Many modern drafters now use computer software such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Revit]], and [[SolidWorks]]  to flesh out the designs of engineers or architects into technical drawings and blueprints but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Many of these drawings are utilized to create structures, tools or machines. In addition, the drawings also include design specifications like dimensions, materials and procedures.&lt;ref name="AC 2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scan2cad.com/cad/autocad-careers|title=AutoCAD Careers – Everything You Need To Know |date=December 19, 2016 |website=Scan2CAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, drafters may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians.&lt;ref name="BLC07"&gt;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (2008) ''[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos111.htm ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–09 Edition:  Drafters]'' dated: 18 December 2007.  accessed: 24 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With CAD systems, drafters can create and store drawings electronically so that they can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into automated manufacturing systems. CAD systems also permit drafters to quickly prepare variations of a design. Although drafters use CAD extensively, it is only a tool. Drafters still need knowledge of traditional drafting techniques, in addition to CAD skills. Despite the near global use of CAD systems, manual drafting and sketching are used in certain applications.&lt;ref name="BLC07" /&gt;

Drafters' drawings provide visual guidelines and show how to construct a product or structure. Drawings include technical details and specify dimensions, materials, and procedures. Drafters fill in technical details using drawings, rough sketches, specifications, and calculations made by engineers, surveyors, architects, or scientists. For example, drafters use their knowledge of standardized building techniques to draw in the details of a structure. Some use their understanding of engineering and manufacturing theory and standards to draw the parts of a machine; they determine design elements, such as the numbers and kinds of fasteners needed to assemble the machine. Drafters use technical handbooks, tables, calculators, and computers to complete their work.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;

== Specialities ==
Drafting work has many specialities such as:&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC 2016"/&gt;

* '''Aeronautical drafters''' prepare engineering drawings detailing plans and specifications used in the manufacture of aircraft, missiles, and related parts.
* [[Architectural drafting|'''Architectural drafters''']] draw architectural and structural features of buildings and other structures. These designs are used in the construction or remodeling of homes, commercial buildings and power stations. These workers may specialize in a type of structure, such as residential or commercial, or in a kind of building material used, such as [[reinforced concrete]], [[masonry]], [[steel]], or [[timber]].
* '''Civil drafters''' prepare drawings and topographical and relief maps used in major construction or [[civil engineering]] projects such as buildings, highways, bridges, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, flood-control projects, and water and sewage systems.
* '''[[Electrical drafters]]''' prepare [[Wiring diagram|wiring]] and layout diagrams used by workers who erect, install, and repair electrical equipment and wiring in communication centers, [[power plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, electrical distribution systems, and buildings.
* '''Electronics drafters''' draw wiring diagrams, [[circuit board]] assembly diagrams, [[schematics]], and layout drawings used in the manufacture, installation, and repair of electronic devices and components.
* '''Mechanical drafters''' prepare drawings showing the detail and assembly of a wide variety of machinery and mechanical devices, indicating dimensions, [[fastening]] methods, manufacturing equipment, and mechanical installation infrastructure.
* '''Process piping '''or''' pipeline drafters '''prepare drawings used in the layout, construction, and operation of [[Oil field|oil]] and [[gas field]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[refineries]], [[chemical plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and process [[piping]] systems.
* '''Photovoltaic drafters''' prepare drawings showing inverter Pad location drawings and slab construction drawings, also prepare specific [[PV system|photovoltaic system]] assembly details and some [[wiring diagram]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

== Employment and work environment ==
Drafters work in architectural offices, manufacturing companies, engineering firms, CAD-specific work-groups, construction companies, engineering consultancy firms, the government, natural resource companies or are independently self-employed. Drafting technologists and technicians often work as part of a broader multidisciplinary engineering team in support of engineers, architects or industrial designers or they may work on their own. The position of a drafter is one of a skilled assistant to architects and engineers. Drafters usually work in offices, seated at adjustable drawing boards or drafting tables when doing manual drawings, although modern drafters work at computer terminals much of the time. They usually work in an office environment, but some may have to travel and spend time on manufacturing plants or construction sites. As drafters spend long periods in front of computers doing detailed technical work, they may be susceptible to [[eyestrain]], back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems. Most drafters work standard 40-hour weeks; only a small number work part-time.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;

== Education and training ==
High school courses in English, mathematics, science, electronics, computer technology, [[Technical drawing|drafting]] and [[design]], visual arts, and [[computer graphics]] are useful for people considering a drafting career. Attributes required by drafters include technical writing skills, problem-solving skills, the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional drawings as well as drawing the relationships between parts in machinery and various pieces of infrastructure. Other skills include an in-depth knowledge of the qualities of metals, plastics, wood and other materials used in the overall manufacturing processes and of construction methods and standards. Technical expertise, a strong understanding of construction and the manufacturing process, and a solid knowledge of drafting and design principles are also important assets in becoming a drafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalschool.ca/3-essential-skills-you-need-to-become-a-successful-cad-technician/ |title=3 Essential Skills You Need to Become a Successful CAD Technician}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern job marketplace, in addition to technical skills enabling CAD drafters to draw up plans, soft skills are also crucial as CADD drafter have to communicate with clients and articulating their drawing plans in an effective way with fellow team members in a real-world setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalschool.ca/3-essential-skills-you-need-to-become-a-successful-cad-technician/ |title=3 Essential Skills You Need to Become a Successful CAD Technician}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers prefer applicants who have also completed training after high school at a trade or technical school. Prospective drafters will also need to have a strong background knowledge and experience with CADD software. Though licenses aren’t a prerequisite for becoming drafters, the American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) does offer certification and licensing. Licensing and certification highlights one's core competence and knowledge of a specific drafting specialty.Drafting and design certificates and diplomas are generally offered by career training schools, trade and technical schools and non-university higher education institutions like community colleges or industrial training institutes.&lt;ref name="AC 2016"/&gt; 

Apprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training and experience with in-class instruction. People interested in becoming drafters can get qualified as either drafting technologists or drafting technicians. Drafting technologists usually have a 2 to 3-year diploma in engineering design or drafting technology from a community college or technical school.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt; Drafters starting out tend to move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. A more senior drafter often moves up into a management position where they become able to supervise entire projects as they gain more experience or they can start their own business and become self-employed. It is also possible for experienced drafters to enter related fields such as [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[exhibit design]], [[landscape design]], [[set design]], and [[animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rileyguide.com/careers/mechanical-drafting-technicians.shtml | title=Mechanical Drafters | publisher=Riley Guide | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://learn.org/articles/Aeronautical_Drafter_Jobs_Career_and_Salary_FAQs.html | title=Aeronautical Drafter: Career and Salary Facts | publisher=Learn.org | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frédéric Soulacroix - Elegance Of The Epoque.jpg|thumb|''Elegance of the Epoque'' by [[Frédéric Soulacroix]]]]
[[Image:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|200px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Elegance''' is [[beauty]] that shows unusual [[effectiveness]] and [[simplicity]]. It is frequently used as a standard of [[Taste (sociology)|tastefulness]] particularly in the areas of [[visual design]], [[decorative arts|decoration]], the sciences, and [[Mathematical beauty|the aesthetics of mathematics]]. Elegant things exhibit refined [[wiktionary:grace|grace]] and suggest maturity.

==General concept==
Essential components of the concept include [[simplicity]] and [[consistency]] of [[design]], focusing on the [[Essence|essential]] features of an object. In art of any kind one might also require dignified grace, or restrained beauty of style.

Visual stimuli are frequently considered elegant if a small number of [[color]]s and stimuli are used, emphasizing the remainder.

==In philosophy of science==
In the [[philosophy of science]], there are two concepts referring to two aspects of simplicity. Elegance ([[syntactic simplicity]]) means the number and complexity of hypotheses. [[Occam's razor|Parsimony]] ([[ontological simplicity]]) is the number and complexity of things postulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==

The [[mathematical proof|proof]] of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]] exhibits [[mathematical elegance]] if it is [[Surprise (emotion)|surprisingly]] simple yet effective and constructive; similarly, a [[computer program]] or [[computer algorithm|algorithm]] is elegant if it uses a small amount of code to great effect.&lt;ref name="programming1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=113 |title=ITLOG Import: Elegance |last1= Perrin |first1=Chad |date=16 August 2006 |publisher=Chad Perrin: SOB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="programming2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/15.html |title=Elegance |last1=Spolsky |first1=Joel |date=15 December 2006 |publisher=Joel on Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In engineering==

In [[engineering]], a solution may be considered elegant if it uses a non-obvious method to produce a solution which is highly effective and simple. An elegant solution may solve multiple problems at once, especially problems not thought to be inter-related.&lt;ref name="engineering1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzeldes.com/Miscellany/Elegance.htm |title=Ingenious simplicity |last1=Zeldes |first1=Nathan |year=2007 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |publisher=Nathan's Possibly Interesting Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In chemistry==

In [[chemistry]], chemists might look for ''elegance'' in theory and method, in technique and procedure. For example: elegance might comprise creative parsimony and versatility in the utilization of resources, in the manipulation of materials, and in effectiveness in syntheses and analysis.

==In pharmacy==

In [[pharmacy]], elegance in [[formulation]] is important for quality as well as effectiveness in [[dosage form design]], a major component of pharmaceutics.

The '''inker''' (sometimes credited as the '''finisher''' or '''embellisher''')&lt;ref&gt;"Bullpen Bulletins," ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #52 (Marvel Comics, June 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the two line artists in traditional [[comic book]] production.

The [[penciller]] creates the initial drawing or sketch. Using 
a [[nib (pen)|pen]] or a brush, the inker adds depth and shading to give the image more definition. Only then does the image take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ANguyenCHS522|title=Chasing Amy - Tracer|date=2006-08-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMwhZryRUr4|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inking was necessary in the traditional printing process as presses could not reproduce pencilled drawings. "Inking" of text is usually handled by another specialist, the [[letterer]],
the application of colors by the [[colorist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox, Margalit]] (April 5, 2013). [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/carmine-infantino-who-revamped-batman-and-the-flash-dies-at-87.html?_r=1&amp; "Carmine Infantino, Reviver of Batman and Flash, Dies at 87"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the last hand in the production chain before the colorist, the inker has the final word on the look of the page, and can help control a story's mood, pace, and readability. A good inker can salvage shaky pencils, while a bad one can obliterate great draftsmanship and/or muddy good storytelling.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Workflow ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
While inking can involve tracing pencil lines in a literal sense, it also requires interpreting the pencils, giving proper weight to the lines, correcting mistakes, and making other creative choices. The look of a penciler's final art can vary enormously depending on the inker. A pencil drawing can have an infinite number of shades of grey, depending on the hardness of the graphite and the pressure applied by the artist. By contrast, an ink line generally can be only solid black. Accordingly, the inker has to translate pencil shading into patterns of ink, as for example by using closely spaced parallel lines, feathering, or [[Hatching|cross-hatching]].

Some inkers will often do more than simply interpreting the pencil markings into pen and brush strokes; depending on how much detail the penciler puts into the pencil drawings, the inker might add [[shading]] or be responsible for the placement of black spaces and shadows in the final drawing. An experienced inker paired with a novice penciler might be responsible for correcting anatomical or other mistakes, modifying facial expressions, or changing or improving the artwork in a variety of other ways. Alternatively, an inker may do the basic layout of the page, give the work to another artist to do more detailed pencil work, and then ink the page himself (as [[Joe Simon]] often did when inking [[Jack Kirby]],&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; or when [[Michael T. Gilbert]] collaborated with penciller [[P. Craig Russell]] on the [[Elric of Melniboné#Adaptations|Elric of Melniboné series]]).

The division between penciller and inker described here is most frequently found where the penciler and inker are hired independently of each other by the publisher. Where an artist instead hires his own assistants, the roles are less structured; an artist might, for example, ink all the faces of the characters while leaving the assistant to ink in the backgrounds, or work with the inker in a more collaborative fashion. Neal Adams' [[Crusty Bunkers]] worked like this, with say one inker responsible for the characters' heads, another doing bodies, and a third embellishing backgrounds.&lt;ref name="netzer"&gt;[[Michael Netzer]]. [http://michaelnetzer.com/rEvolution/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=233&amp;Itemid=1 "The Lives and Time of Crusty Bunker," Michael Netzer Online, September 17, 2007]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DmHeoI0Y?url=http://michaelnetzer.com/rEvolution/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=233&amp;Itemid=1 |date=January 19, 2013 }}. Retrieved July 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The inking duo [[Ian Akin|Akin]] &amp; [[Brian Garvey (comics)|Garvey]] had a similar arrangement, with one inking the figures and the other the backgrounds.

=== Digital inking ===
One can [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|ink digitally]] using computers, a practice that has started to become more common as inkers learn to use powerful drawing and editing tools such as [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]] and [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]], [[Inkscape]], [[Corel Painter]], and [[Manga Studio]]. A [[graphics tablet]] is the most common tool used to accurately ink digitally, and use of [[vector graphics|vector-based]] programs precludes [[Dots per inch#DPI in digital image files|pixelization]] due to changes in resolution. However, many{{quantify|date=June 2015}} regard the process as more time-consuming.

{{As of | 2015}} some companies put scanned pencils on an [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP site]]. The inker downloads them, prints them in blue, inks the pages, scans them in and loads the finished pages back on the FTP site for the company to download. While this procedure saves a company time and shipping costs, it requires artists to spend money for computer equipment.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
For a long time, inking was considered a minor part of the comics industry, only marginally above [[letterer|lettering]] in the pecking order. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired "packagers" to produce entire books. Although some "star" creators' names (such as [[Joe Simon|Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby|Kirby]] or [[Bob Kane]]) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally didn't care which artists worked on the book. Packagers instituted an [[assembly line]] style method of creating books, using top talents like Kirby to create the look and pace of the story and then handing off the inking, lettering, and coloring to largely anonymous — and low-paid — creators to finish it.

Deadline pressures and a desire for consistency in the look of a feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. At [[Marvel Comics]], where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books he could do by leaving the inking to others. By contrast, at other companies where the writer did the frame-by-frame breakdown in script form, more artists inked or even lettered their own work. [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Jim Aparo]] would usually pencil, ink and letter, considering the placing of word balloons as an integral part of the page, and artists such as [[Bill Everett]], [[Steve Ditko]], [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], and [[Nick Cardy]] almost always inked their own work (and sometimes the work of other pencilers as well). Most artists, however — even experienced inkers of their own work like [[Lou Fine]], [[Reed Crandall]], [[Will Eisner]], and [[Alex Toth]] — at times hired or allowed other artists to ink their drawings. Some artists could make more money by pencilling more pages and leaving the inking to others; different artists with different working methods might find it more profitable to both pencil and ink, as they could place less information and detail in the pencil drawings if they were inking it themselves and could put that detail in at the inking stage.

Due to the absence of credits on most Golden Age comic books, many inkers of that period are largely forgotten. For those whose names are known, it is difficult to compile résumés. Inkers like [[Chic Stone]], [[George Papp]], and [[Marvin Stein]] embellished thousands of pages during that era, most of which are still unidentified.

In the early 1960s, Marvel Comics began giving the inker credit in each of their publications. This allowed finishers like [[Dick Ayers]], [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]], [[John Severin]], [[Syd Shores]], and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] to earn a reputation as inkers as well as pencillers. In addition, penciller-inker teams like Kirby and Sinnott, [[Curt Swan]] and [[Murphy Anderson]], [[Gene Colan]] and Palmer, and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] captured the attentions of comic book fandom.

In 2008 Marvel and DC inker [[Bob Almond]] founded the [[Inkwell Awards]], which is an award established to celebrate the craft of inking and to lift the profile of the art in general. The [[Inkwell Awards]] has gained much publicity and counts notable inkers such as Joe Sinnott, [[Nathan Massengill]] and [[Tim Townsend]] as members and associates.

[[Image:Knapp-First Symphony-angled-2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Stephen Knapp]]'s installation ''First Symphony'' (2006) at [[Ball State University]] in Muncie, Indiana, is an example of the lightpainting medium, which the artist developed.]]
'''Lightpainting''' is an art form developed by artist [[Stephen Knapp]] and introduced in 2002. Lightpainting (one word) is not to be confused with [[light painting]] (two words), the latter of which is a photographic process recording traces of light on film or digital media to create images that must be reproduced in printed or transparency form. Lightpainting uses white light projected in space through specially coated glass that breaks the light into bands of color, producing optically complex virtual 3D images that sit at the intersection of painting and sculpture. Lightpaintings can take the form of moveable wall-mounted panels but the most spectacular effects are achieved in large-scale architectural installations. Layers of metallic coating are applied to glass pieces to refract and reflect colors, which becomes the palette to be used as pure chroma or mixed into a wide spectrum of colors. Glass is cut into various sizes and shapes that determine planes of color and other elements that can be used much as in traditional painting or sculpture.

Art critic Vince Carducci states:

“The lightpaintings can and should be situated within the lineage of recent art. The optical tour-de-force of much of the work establishes its affinity with the eye-bending paintings of Op Artists such as [[Bridget Riley]] and [[Victor Vasarely]]. And yet the more serene passages, in which translucent color washes over veils of other translucent color, evoke the lyrical abstractions of less-hyperactive modernist masters such as [[Morris Louis]] and [[Helen Frankenthaler]]. Perhaps the most appropriate forebears are the examples of Zen-like perceptual presence achieved by California Light and Space artists such as [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[James Turrell]], and Eric Orr. But [lightpaintings] can be distinguished from all of these...in [the] use of light purely in and of itself not as a collateral effect of pigment or architectural structure.”

This is a list of [[Royal Doulton]] [[Bunnykins]] figurines.  Doulton &amp; Co. (Royal Doulton) introduced the Bunnykins figurines in 1939 with six original Bunnykins figurines designed by [[Charles Noke]] based on illustrations by [[Mary Barbara Bailey|Sister Mary Barbara Bailey]].  Shortly thereafter, and prior to World War II, Doulton &amp; Co. discontinued their manufacture.  After Royal Doulton purchased the [[Beswick Pottery]] factory in 1969, Royal Doulton reintroduced the Bunnykins figurines.&lt;ref name=Irvine1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Louise|title=Royal Doulton Bunnykins Figures|date=1991|publisher=UK International Ceramics|location=England|isbn=0951777254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the closure of Royal Doulton factory in England in 2005, Bunnykins figurines are produced in Asia.  The Bunnykins figurines are in ascending order and include the name of the figurine, designer/modeler, date introduced, and the date discontinued.

[[File:Banned Books Week 2007 (1420101916).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A display of formerly banned books at a US library]]
'''Banned books''' are books or other printed works such as essays or plays which are prohibited by law or to which free access is not permitted by other means. The practice of banning books is a form of censorship, from political, legal, religious, moral, or (less often) commercial motives. This article lists notable banned books and works, giving a brief context for the reason that each book was prohibited. Banned books include fictional works such as novels, poems and plays and non-fiction works such as biographies and dictionaries.

Since there are a large number of banned books, some publishers have specialized in them. The best-known examples are the Parisian [[Obelisk Press]], which published [[Henry Miller]]'s sexually frank novel ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', and [[Olympia Press]], which published [[William Burroughs]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.  Both of these, the work of father [[Jack Kahane]] and son [[Maurice Girodias]], specialized in English-language books which were prohibited, at the time, in Great Britain and the United States. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ruedo ibérico|es}}, also located in Paris, specialized in books prohibited in Spain during the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]]. Russian literature prohibited during the Soviet period was published outside of Russia.

Books are still banned throughout the world. Nowhere in the world can everything be published, although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another: [[hate speech]], for example, is prohibited in a number of countries, such as [[Censorship in Sweden|Sweden]], though the same books may be legal in the United States or United Kingdom, where the only prohibition is on [[child pornography]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Statement doesn't match with the current list|date=January 2018}}

In the United States, books have been and still are banned by school and public libraries, despite the opposition of the American Library Association to book bans. This is usually the result of complaints from parents, who find particular books not appropriate for their children (e.g., books about sexual orientation such as ''[[And Tango Makes Three]]''). In many libraries, including the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]], erotic books are housed in separate collections in restricted access reading rooms. In some libraries, a special application may be needed to read certain books.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fryer, ''Private Case, Public Scandal'', London, Secker &amp; Warburg, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries sometimes avoid purchasing controversial books, and the personal opinions of librarians have at times impacted book selection.

In January 2017, Luxottica announced a merger with [[Essilor]]&lt;ref&gt;Chad Bray and Elizabeth Paton, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/business/dealbook/luxottica-essilor-merger.html Luxottica, Owner of Ray-Ban, in $49 Billion Merger With Essilor]  ''[[The New York Times]]'' 2017/01/16&lt;/ref&gt; The combined entity will command more than one quarter of global value sales of eyewear.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.euromonitor.com/2017/07/eyewear-2018-edition-key-research-highlights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grdn2018"/&gt; In March 2018, the European Commission unconditionally approved the merger of Essilor and Luxottica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-essilor-m-a-luxottica-group-eu/eu-clears-merger-of-essilor-luxottica-without-conditions-idUSKCN1GD4NX|title=EU clears merger of Essilor, Luxottica without conditions|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On October 1st 2018 the new holding company [[EssilorLuxottica]] was born, resulting in combined [[market capitalization]] of approximately €57&amp;nbsp;billion.

== History ==
[[Leonardo Del Vecchio]] started the company in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/leonardo-del-vecchio |title= World's Billionaires Leonardo Del Vecchio |publisher=Forbes March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Agordo]] north of [[Belluno]], Italy; today the company is headquartered in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="Grdn2018"/&gt;

Del Vecchio began his career as the apprentice to a tool and die maker in Milan, but decided to turn his metalworking skills to making spectacle parts. So in 1961, he moved to Agordo in the [[province of Belluno]], which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxottica.com/en/company/history|title=Luxottica Past and Present|publisher=Luxottica Group S.p.A.|accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership with Del Vecchio as one of the founding partners.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1967, he started selling complete eyeglass frames under the Luxottica brand, which proved successful enough that by 1971 he ended the contract manufacturing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borsaitaliana.it/mediasource/star/db/pdf/17895.pdf |title= Santander research |publisher= Borsa Italiana 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced of the need for [[vertical integration]], in 1974, he acquired Scarrone, a distribution company.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In 1981, the company set up its first international subsidiary, in Germany, the first in a rapid period of international expansion.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The first of many licensing deals with a designer was struck with Armani, in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambianconews.com/The-Armani-Group-and-the-Luxottica-Group-announce-expiration-of-licence-agreement/ |title= The Armani Group and the Luxottica Group announce expiration of licence agreement |work=in Pambianco News November 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company listed in New York in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nyse.com/listed/lux.html |title=Luxottica Group S.p.A. |publisher=NYSE, New York Stock Exchange |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226202920/http://www.nyse.com/listed/lux.html |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Milan in December 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borsaitaliana.it/borsa/azioni/ipo/ultime-societa-ammesse-dettaglio.html?ndg=491&amp;lang=en |title= Luxottica|publisher= Borsa Italiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the MIB-30 (now [[FTSE MIB]]) index in September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syndication.teleborsa.it/Nis/NisViewer.ashx?file=0491-56-2003.pdf&amp;year=2003&amp;filetype=comunicati |title= Luxottica Group Added to MIB 30 Index |publisher=Syndication Teleborsa 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing raised money for the company and allowed it to use its shares to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue Eyewear in 1990, [[Persol]] and the [[United States Shoe Corporation]] (LensCrafters) in 1995, Ray-Ban in 1999 and Sunglass Hut, Inc. in 2001.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Luxottica later increased its presence in the retail sector by acquiring [[Sydney]]-based [[OPSM]] in 2003, [[Pearle Vision]] and Cole National in 2004.&lt;ref name="facts and figures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxottica.com/en/retail/facts_figures/ |title=Luxottica Facts and Figures |publisher=Luxottica Group S.p.A.|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxottica acquired [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] in November 2007 for US$2.1 billion. Oakley had tried to dispute their prices because of Luxottica's large marketshare, and Luxottica responded by dropping Oakley from their stores, causing their stock price to drop, followed by Luxottica's hostile take over of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syndication.teleborsa.it/Nis/NisViewer.ashx?file=0491-117-2007.pdf&amp;year=2007&amp;filetype=comunicati |title=Luxottica Group and Oakley complete merger |publisher=Syndication Teleborsa, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Luxottica acquired Erroca for €20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000671153&amp;fid=1725 |title= Luxottica buys Erroca sunglasses chain for €20m |work=in Globes September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, it was announced that Luxottica would partner with Google on the development of [[Google Glass]] and its integration into Luxottica's eyewear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-25/google-to-de-dorkify-glass-in-partnership-with-ray-ban-maker-luxottica Google to De-Dorkify Glass in Partnership With Ray-Ban Maker Luxottica], ''Businessweek'', 25 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2014, a new organizational structure was announced, composed of two co-CEOs, one focusing on market development and the other overseeing corporate functions. After the exit of former CEO [[Andrea Guerra (business manager)|Andrea Guerra]], Enrico Cavatorta was appointed CEO of Corporate Function and Interim CEO of Market (until new and permanent appointment to this role).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionmonday.com/latest-news/article/luxottica-announces-new-governance-structure-for-coceo-model-guerra-to-leave-group-cavatorta-named-ceo-corporate-and-interim-ceo-markets-del-vecchio-moves-to-executive-chairman-1 |title= Luxottica sets new co-CEO model, Guerra to leave, Cavatorta named CEO Corporate, interim CEO Markets |publisher= Vision Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/business/a-management-shake-up-at-luxottica-ray-ban-maker.html?_r=1 |title= A management shake-up at Luxottica, Ray-Ban maker |publisher= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxottica.com/en/luxottica-announces-implementation-new-governance-structure-based-co-ceo-model|title= Luxottica announces the implementation of a new governance structure based on a co-CEO model |publisher= Luxottica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrico Cavatorta left the company 40 days after being appointed CEO. In 2016, it was reported that Luxottica had lost its third chief executive in a year and a half as Adil Mehboob-Khan stepped down a year after he replaced Cavatorta.

In January 2017, the company agreed on a merger with [[Essilor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Luxottica also owns [[EyeMed Vision Care]], a managed vision care organization in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyemedvisioncare.com/about/position.html |title=Our Position in the Industry |publisher=EyeMed Vision Care|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, it is the second largest vision benefits company in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxottica.com/en/activities/managed_vision_care/ "Activities: Managed Vision Care"], Luxottica website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIXTYMINUTES2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sticker shock: Why are glasses so expensive?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57527151/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive/|newspaper=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=7 October 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/agoodman/2014/07/16/theres-more-to-ray-ban-and-oakley-than-meets-the-eye/ |title=Forbes: There's More To Ray-Ban And Oakley Than Meets The Eye|accessdate= 31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Monopolistic pricing practices ===
The company has been criticised for the high price of its brand-name glasses, such as [[Ray-Ban]], [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]], and several others. A 2012 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment focused on whether the company's extensive holdings in the industry were used to keep prices high. Luxottica owns not only a large portfolio of brands (over a dozen&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anaswanson/2014/09/10/meet-the-four-eyed-eight-tentacled-monopoly-that-is-making-your-glasses-so-expensive/#1d0205726b66|title=Meet the Four-Eyed, Eight-Tentacled Monopoly That is Making Your Glasses So Expensive|first=Ana|last=Swanson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) such as [[Ray-Ban]] and [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] but also retailers such as [[Sunglass Hut International|Sunglass Hut]] and [[Oliver Peoples]], the optical departments at [[Target (store)|Target]] and [[Sears]], as well as key eye insurance groups including the second largest glasses insurance firm in the US. It has been accused of operating a complete monopoly on the optical industry and overcharging for its products — for example, temporarily dropping competitor Oakley from its frame design list, then, when the company stock crashed, purchasing the company, then increasing the prices of its Ray-Ban sunglasses. In addition, it has been argued that, by owning the vision insurance company EyeMed, it also controls part of the buyers' market as well.&lt;ref name=SIXTYMINUTES2012 /&gt;

The company says that the market is highly competitive, and their frames account for ~10% of sales worldwide and ~20% in the United States.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/does-luxottica-own-80-of-the-eyeglass-industry/|title=FACT CHECK: Does Luxottica Own 80% of the Eyeglass Industry?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; [[Euromonitor International]] estimates that Luxottica's market share is 14% worldwide, and the second-largest company in the industry, [[Essilor]], has a 13% market share. The third-largest player is [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], with a 3.9% market share. As of October 2018, Luxottica and Essilor have merged into a single company, EssilorLuxottica, representing almost a billion pairs of lenses and frames sold annually.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/10/the-invisible-power-of-big-glasses-eyewear-industry-essilor-luxottica&lt;/ref&gt;

The HBO series [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]] has also criticized the company in the show’s feature on corporate consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=00wQYmvfhn4

== About the director ==
Among the contemporary artists who became filmmakers, [[Ihor Podolchak]]is a figure odious. Unlike [[Matthew Barney]] and [[Marina Abramović]] he does not balance on the verge of conceptual [[video art]] but he is engaged in cinematography in its pure form&lt;ref name="АЛИК ШПИЛЮК"&gt;Шпилюк, Алик.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6797">[[File:Mottledskin.JPG|thumb|This [[Appaloosa horse]] shows mottling around its mouth and nostrils. In this particular case, it is a normal hereditary trait linked to a spotted [[equine coat color|coat color pattern]] and not a sign of disease]]

'''Mottle''' is a pattern of irregular marks, spots, streaks, [[blotch]]es or patches of different [[shade (color)|shade]]s or [[colour]]s.  It is commonly used to describe the surface of [[plant]]s or the [[skin]] of [[animal]]s.  In plants, mottling usually consists of yellowish spots on [[plant]]s, and is usually a sign of disease or malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;ICTVdB Management (2006). 00.057.0.01.068. Tobacco vein mottling virus. In: ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database, version 4. Büchen-Osmond, C. (Ed), Columbia University, New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Many plant viruses cause mottling, some examples being:
* [[Tobacco vein mottling virus]]
* [[Bean pod mottle virus]]

Mottling is sometimes used to describe uneven discolored patches on the skin of humans as a result of [[Ischemia#Variations|cutaneous ischemia]] (lowered blood flow to the surfaces of the skin) or [[Herpes zoster]] infections.&lt;ref&gt;Def. of Anesthesia and IC - www.aic.cuhk.edu.hk/web8/Skin%20mottling.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical term for mottled skin is [[dyschromia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pathophysiology; Concepts of Altered Health States|last = Porth|first = C.|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is not always the case, mottling can occur in the dying patient and commonly indicates that the end of life is near. Mottling usually occurs in the extremities (lower first) and progresses up as cardiac function declines and circulation throughout the body is poor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In animals, mottling may be a sign of disease, but may also be a hereditary trait, such as seen with the [[champagne gene|champagne]] and [[leopard complex]] genes in [[horse]]s.

Mottles can also refer to discoloration in processed food, such as butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(20)94253-4 | last= Hunziker | first=O F | authorlink = Otto Frederick Hunziker |author2=D. Fay Hosman | title = Mottles in Butter—Their Causes and Prevention | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–106 | publisher = American Dairy Science Association | date=  March 1, 1920 | url=http://jds.fass.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/77 | format=PDF | accessdate = 2008-06-28 | quote=Mottles refer to uneven color in butter, causing the appearance in the body of the butter, of deep yellow, translucent blotches interspersed by whitish, opaque dapples. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]], mottled refers to a patchy/blotch texture of alteration or interbedding, commonly found in [[limestone]] and commonly caused by [[bioturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/sgmc-unit.php?unit=CTOse%3B0 |title=Units e and d [of Stockbridge Marble&amp;#93; (CTOse;0) |publisher=Tin.er.usgs.gov |date=2003-09-18 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mottling can also refer to an undesirable defect which can occur with effect coatings, most obvious on light metallic finishes. The total color impression shows irregular areas of lightness variations. These "patches" are usually visually evaluated, described as a mottling effect. Some also feel that it reminds them of clouds. This effect is especially noticeable on large body panels. It can be caused by the coating formulation, as well as variations in the application process. For example, disorientation of the metallic flakes or film thickness variations of the basecoat can lead to various mottle sizes resulting in a non-uniform appearance. The visual perception of mottling is dependent on the viewing distance: Large mottles can be seen in far distance evaluation, while small mottles are more noticeable in close up evaluation. The visual evaluation of mottling is very subjective, as it depends
on the illumination conditions, the observing distance and the viewing angle.

In graphics printing mottling refers to an uneven coloration resulting from letterpressed printing of textured papers, mainly in larger colored surfaces. Due to the uneven surface, not all fibers of the paper are evenly saturated with color unlike offset printing.

== Measurement ==

The irregular lightness variations caused by mottling can be objectively measured with specially made instruments. These instruments simulate visual evaluation under different observing angles and characterize clouds / mottles by their size and visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Koleske, Paint and Coating Testing Manual, p. 370, {{ISBN|0-8031-2060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small to large mottles are measured under three observing angles, in which the scan length can usually be varied from 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;cm. The measurement results are independent of color and curvature of the surface and thus can be considered objective.

The specific measurement process for one such instrument is as follows.
It first optically scans the surface and measures the lightness variations. The specimen is illuminated with a white light LeD at a 15° angle and the lightness is detected under three
viewing angles to simulate visual evaluation under different observing conditions: 15°, 45° and 60° measured from the specular reflection. The mottling meter is rolled across the surface for a defined distance of 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;cm and measures the lightness variations point by point. The measurement signal is divided via mathematical filter functions into 6 different size ranges and a rating value is calculated for each angle and mottle size. The higher the value is, the
more visible the mottling effect. The measured values are displayed in a graph showing the mottle size on the X-axis and the rating value on the Y-axis. Thus, target values for small and large mottle sizes can be established for paint batch approval as well as process control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altana.com/fileadmin/BYK/downloads/instruments/Cat-Pages10-11_E/02_Appearance/Mottling/Intro_Mottling.pdf |title=Mottling |publisher= |accessdate=2012-09-10 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mythologies''''' is a 1957 book by [[Roland Barthes]]. It is a collection of essays taken from ''Les Lettres nouvelles'', examining the tendency of contemporary social value systems to create modern [[mythology|myth]]s. Barthes also looks at the [[semiology]] of the process of myth creation, updating [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s system of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] analysis by adding a second level where signs are elevated to the level of myth.

==Format==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
''Mythologies'' is split into two: Mythologies and Myth Today, the first section consisting of a collection of essays on selected modern myths and the second further and general analysis of the concept.

==Mythologies==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
The first section of ''Mythologies'' describes a selection of modern cultural phenomena, chosen for their status as modern myths and for the added meaning that has been conferred upon them. Each short chapter analyses one such myth, ranging from ''Einstein's Brain'' to ''Soap Powders and Detergents''. They were originally written as a series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles''.

In a typical example, Barthes describes the image that has been built up around red wine and how it has been adopted as a French national drink, how it is seen as a social equaliser and the drink of the [[proletariat]], partly because it is seen as blood-like (as in [[Holy Communion]]) and points out that very little attention is paid to red wine's [[Wine#Health effects|harmful effects to health]], but that it is instead viewed as life-giving and refreshing — 'in cold weather, it is associated with all the myths of becoming warm, and at the height of summer, with all the images of shade, with all things cool and sparkling.'&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In another chapter, Barthes explores the myth of [[professional wrestling]]. He describes how, unlike in the sport of [[boxing]], the aim of theatrical stunt fighting is not to discover who will win or 'a demonstration of excellence',&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; it is a staged [[spectacle]] acting out society's basic concepts of good and evil, of 'Suffering, Defeat and Justice'.&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The actors pretending to be wrestlers, like characters in a [[pantomime]], portray grossly-exaggerated stereotypes of human weakness: the traitor, the conceited, the 'effeminate teddy-boy'. The audience expects to watch them suffer and be punished for their own transgressions of wrestling's rules in a theatrical version of society's ideology of [[justice]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In an interview Barthes once mentioned working on an essay on [[hidden track]]s in recorded music. This essay, however, has never been published.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Myth today==
In the second half of the book Barthes addresses the question of "What is a myth, today?" with the analysis of ideas such as: [[myth]] as a type of speech, and myth on the wings of politics.

[[File:Paris Match - child soldier cover.jpg|thumb|left|The front cover of the ''[[Paris Match]]'' magazine that Barthes analyzes]]
Following on from the first section, Barthes justifies and explains his choices and analysis. He calls upon  the concepts of [[semiology]] developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who described the connections between an object (the [[Sign (linguistics)|signified]]) and its linguistic representation (such as a word, the signifier) and how the two are connected.&lt;ref name="Sanders2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Sanders|title=The Cambridge Companion to Saussure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRy-xWG1MvIC&amp;pg=PA162|date=2 December 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80486-8|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with this structure Barthes continues to show his idea of a myth as a further sign, with its roots in language, but to which something has been added. So with a [[word]] (or other linguistic unit) the meaning (apprehended content) and the sound come together to make a sign. To make a myth, the sign itself is used as a ''signifier'', and a new meaning is added, which is the ''signified''. But according to Barthes, this is ''not'' added arbitrarily.&lt;ref name="Adams2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie Schneider Adams|title=The Methodologies of Art: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnhQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172|date=9 March 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-429-97407-6|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the [[ruling class]] and its [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="WagonerWagoner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor of Psychology Brady Wagoner|author2=Brady Wagoner|title=Symbolic Transformation: The Mind in Movement Through Culture and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWeMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-15090-7|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from ''[[Paris Match]]'' edition no. 326, of July 1955,&lt;ref name="EvansHall1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jessica Evans|author2=Stuart Hall|title=Visual Culture: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l209XFHIzrIC&amp;pg=PA55|date=6 July 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6248-9|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a young black soldier in French uniform [[Salute|saluting]]. The ''signifier'': a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the young man's life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the young man; the picture, in combination with the ''signifieds'' of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about France and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate 'that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,' etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.116&lt;/ref&gt; but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus; a property of 'significance' for the picture.

{{Cquote|I am at the barber’s, and copy of Paris-Match is offered to me. On the cover, a young Negro in a French uniform is saluting, with his eyes uplifted, probably fixed on a fold of the tricolour. All this is the meaning  of the picture. But whether naively or not, I see very well what it signifies to me: that France is a great Empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under the flag, and that there is no better answer to the detractors of an alleged colonialism than the zeal shown by this Negro in serving his so-called oppressors ...&lt;ref name="Rosello2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mireille Rosello|title=The Reparative in Narratives: Works of Mourning in Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Avc88FBCJVMC&amp;pg=PT61|year=2010|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-84631-220-5|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Myth and power ===
Exploring the concept of myth, Barthes seeks to grasp the relations between language and power. He assumes that myth helps to naturalize particular worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/
| title = International Encyclopedia of Communication

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barthes, myth is based on humans’ history, and myth cannot naturally occur. There are always some communicative intentions in myth. Created by people, myth can easily be changed or destroyed. Also, myth depends on the context where it exists. By changing the context, one can change the effects of myth. At the same time, myth itself participates in the creation of an [[ideology]]. According to Barthes, myth doesn’t seek to show or to hide the truth when creating an ideology, it seeks to deviate from the reality. The major function of myth is to naturalize a concept, a belief. Myth purifies signs and fills them with a new meaning which is relevant to the communicative intentions of those who are creating the myth. In the new sign, there are no contradictions that could raise any doubts regarding the myth. Myth is not deep enough to have these contradictions; it simplifies the world by making people believe that signs have inherent meaning. Myth “abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences…”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Mythologies
| last = Barthes
| first = 
| publisher = 
| year = 
| isbn = 
| location = 
| pages = 143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Why do people believe in myth? The power of myth is in its impressive character. It seeks to surprise the audience. This impression is way more powerful than any rational explanations which can disprove the myth. So, myth works not because it hides its intentions, but because the intentions of myth have been naturalized. Through the usage of myths, one can naturalize “the Empire, [the] taste for [[Basque culture|Basque]] things, the Government.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Mythologies
| last = Barthes
| first = 
| publisher = 
| year = 
| isbn = 
| location = 
| pages = 131
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of myth and power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. He uses the term {{anchor|exnomination}}'''ex-nomination''' (or '''exnomination'''), by which he "means 'outside of naming'. Barthes' point was that dominant groups or ideas in society become so obvious or common sense that they don't have to draw attention to themselves by giving themselves a name. They're just the 'normality', against which everything else can be judged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McKee | first = Alan | chapter = How do I know what's a likely interpretation? | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H2Rn0Wpq5uQC&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Textual analysis: a beginner's guide | page = 106 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761949930 }} ''See also'': {{cite journal | last = Wasson | first = Richard | title = Myth and the ex-nomination of class in ''The Time Machine'' | journal = [[The Minnesota Review]] | volume = 15 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Fall 1980 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/article/427124 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example he says, "[the bourgeoisie] makes its status undergo a real ''ex-nominating operation'': the bourgeoisie is defined as ''the social class which does not want to be named''" (italics in original).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = Robin Tolmach | author-link = Robin Lakoff | chapter = The neutrality of the status quo | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xmr3ZBHFbVwC&amp;pg=PA53 | title = The language war | page = 53 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780520928077 }}{{Cite book| title = Mythologies| last = Barthes| first = Roland | page = 138| publisher = Cape| year = 1972| location = London | oclc = 222874772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth removes our understanding of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon [[Karl Marx]], Barthes states that even the most natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (''des mythes forts et des mythes faibles'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Mythologies| last = Barthes| first = Roland| publisher = Éditions du Seuil| year = 1957| isbn = | location = Paris| pages = 218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political character. However, this character can be brought back by “the slightest thing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mythologies | last = Barthes | pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:The model of semiosis.png|thumb|348x348px|The model of semiosis suggested by Barthes.]]

Barthes also provides a list of rhetorical figures in [[bourgeoisie]] myths:
* The inoculation. The government admits the harm brought by one of the institutes. Focusing on one institute, myth hides the inconsistency of the system.&lt;ref name="Sandoval2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chela Sandoval|title=Methodology of the Oppressed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ-uoDNV7IcC&amp;pg=PT137|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2736-3|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The privation of History. A history standing behind a myth gets removed. People don’t wonder where the myth comes from; they simply believe it.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Identification. The ideology of bourgeoisie seeks for sameness. It denies all the concepts that don’t fit into the system. The bourgeoisie either ignores subjects that differ from them, or they put the efforts to make this subject the same as the bourgeoisie.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Tautology. The myths of the bourgeoisie define the concepts through the same concepts (Barthes provides an example of theatre, “Drama is drama”)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mythologies| last = Barthes | pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither-Norism (''le ninisme)''. Two concepts are defined by each other, and both of the concepts are considered inconsistent.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The quantification of quality. Myth measures reality by numbers, not by quality. This way, myth simplifies reality.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The statement of fact. Myth doesn’t explain the reality. Myth asserts a certain picture of the world without explanation just like a [[proverb]] does.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The model of [[semiosis]] suggested by Barthes seeks to link signs with the social myths or ideologies that they articulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/ | title = International Encyclopedia of Communication | website = International Encyclopedia of Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythologisation and cultural studies==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In writing about the mythologisation process, Barthes refers to the tendency of [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] notions, narratives, and assumptions to become "naturalised" in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes finishes ''Mythologies'' by looking at how and why myths are built up by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works including ''The Fashion System''.

==History==

The National Sporting Library was founded in 1954 in the personal library of [[George L. Ohrstrom, Sr.]]&lt;ref name=History1&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Sporting Library|journal=The Chronicle of the Horse|date=December 28, 1956|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of the National Sporting Library focused their new organization on accessibility of research materials on horse and field sports, finding other libraries on these topics to be insufficiently accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=History1/&gt; The first President of the National Sporting Library was Fletcher Harper, long-time Master of the [[Orange County Hunt]] in [[The Plains, Virginia]]. Additional founders included Lester Karow, and Alexander Mackay-Smith, Editor of ''[[The Chronicle of the Horse]]''.&lt;ref name=History1/&gt; When Ohrstrom, Jr. died in 1955, his son, [[George L. Ohrstrom, Jr.]], became an officer of the library.&lt;ref name=History1/&gt;

The National Sporting Library was originally housed in the Duffy House, located on Washington Street in Middleburg. An emblem with a [[fox]] mask, horseshoe, rifle, and fishing rod was designed to serve as the library's logo.&lt;ref name=History2&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Sporting Library|journal=The Chronicle of the Horse|date=December 28, 1956|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library grew its collections through donations, and when the collection outgrew the space in the library's building, the National Sporting Library moved to Vine Hill, built in 1804. During these years, the library shared space with the offices of ''The Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=History3&gt;{{cite journal|title=The National Sporting Library: A Research Center for Turf and Field Sports, Their History, and Social Significance|journal=The Chronicle of the Horse|date=February 26, 1971|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An underground, fire-proof vault with capacity for 6,000 volumes was installed in Vine Hill to house the library's rare titles.&lt;ref name=History3/&gt;

The library was housed in Vine Hill from 1969 to 1999, when it moved to its current location, a new building resembling an English carriage house.&lt;ref name=History5&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aryanpur|first1=Arianne|title=Sporting Art Finds a New Home|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/01/AR2008030100058.html|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was necessitated to house the library's growing collection, which included 16,000 volumes dating to the 17th Century and over 100 sporting art prints.&lt;ref name=History5/&gt; Construction of the building took 18 months, and was completed in July 1999. The library moved its collections into the building in August 1999 and a grand opening was held on September 18, 1999.&lt;ref name="History6"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Down the Homestretch|journal=National Sporting Library Newsletter|date=Spring 1999|issue= 58|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the library's new building came from many of the library's members, including a $1 million donation from Paul Mellon,&lt;ref name="History8"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swenson|first1=Ben|title=The Mellon Legacy|url=http://www.virginialiving.com/culture/the-mellon-legacy/|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=Virginia Living|date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also donated a weather vane to be installed atop the building's cupola.&lt;ref name="History7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Down the Homestretch|journal=National Sporting Library Newsletter|date=Spring 1999|issue= 58|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VineHill.jpg|thumb|"Vine Hill," built in 1804, was expanded in 2009 to be the museum building of the National Sporting Library &amp; Museum.]]
In 2009, the National Sporting Library re-branded as National Sporting Library &amp; Museum (NSLM) and began expansion of Vine Hill to include 13,000 feet of art gallery space.&lt;ref name=Museum1&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Sporting Library Unveils New Museum in October with Historic Coaching Drive, Gala, and Exhibit|journal=The National Sporting Library &amp; Museum Newsletter|date=Summer 2011|issue= 100|pages=1–4|url=https://issuu.com/nationalsportinglibrarymuseum/docs/2011-summer|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new museum opened on October 7, 2011 with the inaugural exhibition ''Afield in America: 400 Years of Animal &amp; Sporting Art''.&lt;ref name=Museum1/&gt;

==Collections==

===Library Collection===
The NSLM's library collections include over 20,000 books, periodicals, archives, and ephemera objects. Overall, the collection dates to the 16th century, with rare and antiquarian titles housed in the library's [[F. Ambrose Clark]] Rare Book Room.&lt;ref name="collections1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Library Collections|url=http://www.nationalsporting.org/nslm/library_collections|website=National Sporting Library &amp; Museum Website|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the library received a gift of 5,000 rare and antiquarian books from [[John H. Daniels]], CEO of [[Archer Daniels Midland]] and member of the library's board of directors. The gift included the library's earliest-printed book (published in 1523) and was a major factor in the move to a new library building.&lt;ref name="collections2"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Sporting Library Launches Fellowship for Researchers|url=https://thehorse.com/124517/national-sporting-library-launches-fellowship-for-researchers/|website=The Horse|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daniels collection is stored among the library's rare books and is one of several other named collections maintained at NSLM.&lt;ref name="collections3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Library Book Collections|url=http://www.nationalsporting.org/nslm/library_book_collections|website=NSLM Website|accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Orleans Airlift''' is an artist-driven arts nonprofit, located in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. [http://www.neworleansairlift.org New Orleans Airlift] is dedicated to producing innovative projects for New Orleans-based artists to collaborate and engage with diverse communities locally and internationally. Airlift projects are identified by collaboration, experimentation and a belief in the artist’s role in creating a just, equitable and joyous future.

Airlift's programming highlights New Orleans’ underground art and experimental artists. Through networks, friendships, and close connections to New Orleans' street life, Airlift is able to cultivate and foster long-standing relationships with artists locally and globally. The organization understands how important a dynamic street culture, living culture and a thriving contemporary arts scene are to the neighborhoods within New Orleans. By transporting that which is unique to New Orleans to workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects, Airlift is able to bring recognition to New Orleans as well as provide inspiration and creative collaboration around the globe.

__TOC__

==History==
 
Airlift was founded in 2008 by Delaney Martin and Jay Pennington. Pennington and Martin began to collaborate just after [[Hurricane Katrina]].  As they witnessed the particular devastation of the Storm on the New Orleans artistic community, Pennington and Martin saw collaborative creativity as a way of coming together and mending their community.

Together they organized an event called The New Orleans Airlift, which brought New Orleans artists to [[Berlin, Germany]] in 2009. Jay and Delaney named this project, thought to be a one-time-event, after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Soon after returning from Berlin, though, Jay and Delaney decided to continue the cultivation of unique artistic collaborations, and kept the organization under the name New Orleans Airlift.

==Projects==
Airlift projects are hallmarked by creative collaboration, and artistic experimentation. One of the most successful projects to date has been [http://www.musicboxvillage.com The Music Box], a multi-disciplinary project dedicated to the exploration and performance of musical architecture. This project was inspired by the twin pillars of New Orleans culture, music and architecture.

From 2011 through 2012 the first ever installation of The Music Box called "A Shantytown Sound Laboratory"  presented groundbreaking musical performances and hosted free public hours in its inaugural location, the historic [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]] neighborhood. Constructed from the remains of a blighted house, invented instruments were embedded into the walls, ceilings and floors of structures created by 25 collaborating artists. The Music Box captured the hearts of New Orleans community and the attention of international press including [[NPR]] who said: “High concept and nontraditional as it may be, The Music Box has found a place in the long history of New Orleans music."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Ann. "A Night Out In New Orleans' New Bohemia." National Public Radio. NPR. Web. 28 Sept. 2015. https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2012/06/11/154776190/a-night-out-in-new-orleans-new-bohemia&lt;/ref&gt;

New Orleans Airlift continues to pair New Orleans artists with influential institutions, individuals and community members to collaborate to create artistic productions that are participatory, multifaceted and high quality. In the spring of 2015, New Orleans Airlift completed their installment of the Roving Village Residencies, an ambitious project where the musical houses travel to different neighborhoods around New Orleans. The first residency took place in City Park. Over the course of six weeks (April to May 2015) over 10,000 audience members explored the installation through night time orchestral concerts, free public hours on weekends, educational workshops and artist talks. Over 700 children participated in the Music Box Roving Village: City Park through school field trips and after school partnerships. The Village also hosted musicians from all musical backgrounds and locations such as Bruce “Sunpie” Barnes, [[Solange Knowles]], [[Wilco]], influential Jazz musicians [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]] and [[Cooper-Moore|Cooper Moore]], Lost Bayou Ramblers, and [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]], to name a few. Having proved to be a great success, a permanent Music Box Village and headquarters for New Orleans Airlift has been erected in the [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]], neighborhood of New Orleans.

[[File:Ormside bowl british museum right.JPG|thumb|Another view]]

The '''Ormside Bowl''' is an [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] double-bowl in [[gilding|gilded]] silver and bronze, with glass, perhaps [[Northumbria]]n,  dating from the mid-8th century which was found in 1823, possibly buried next to a [[Viking]] warrior in [[Great Ormside]], [[Cumbria]], though the circumstances of the find were not well recorded. If so, the bowl was probably looted from [[York]] by the warrior before being buried with him on his death. The bowl is one of the finest pieces of Anglo-Saxon silverwork found in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yorkmuseumstrust.org.uk/collections/search/item/?id=538&amp;search_query=c2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9b3Jtc2lkZStib3ds |title=Ormside Bowl |publisher=[[York Museums Trust]] |accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bowl is a double-shelled cup made from 2 pieces [[rivet]]ed together with dome-headed rivets and beaded collars. The surface of the bowl is decorated with a [[Repoussé and chasing|chased repousse technique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search_item/index.php?service=RCAHMS&amp;id=84867 |title='dumfriesshire' |author=L E Webster and J Backhouse |date=1991 |work=ScotlandsPlaces |publisher= |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometime after it was originally made the bowl was converted into a drinking vessel.&lt;ref name="PostHole"/&gt;

===Inner bowl===
The inner cup is made from [[gilt-bronze]]&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt; and is riveted with studs of blue glass and silver.&lt;ref name="PostHole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theposthole.org/read/article/28 |title="A Private Audience with the Cawood Sword and other Viking Treasures": A review of the talk at the Yorkshire Museum |author=Katie Marsden |date=23 February 2009 |work=The Post Hole (Issue 4) |publisher= |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base plate of the internal bowl features 16 circular pieces of glass within a ring of [[cloisonné|cloisons]] and five further rivets, of which the central is missing. The gilding on the bowl was added after the other decoration.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt; The inner bowl could have been made in [[York]] as a blue-glass stud matching the bowl's was found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba59/feat2.shtml |title=The glory that was York |author=Dominic Tweddle |authorlink=Dominic Tweddle |date=June 2001 |work= ''[[Council for British Archaeology|British Archaeology]]'' (Issue 59) |publisher=[[Council for British Archaeology]] |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outer bowl===
The outer shell is made from [[silver-gilt]], the rim once had a U-sectioned strip of ungilded silver although this has now mostly been lost. This strip was originally attached using 4 clips in the shape of animal heads although 2 of these have also been lost.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;
The bowl's gilt-silver exterior is decorated with [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon style]] [[interlace (art)|interlaced]] fabulous creatures amid Continental style vines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/england/AD410-1066/continent |title=Anglo-Saxon  England and the Continent |author= |date=2006 |work=worldtimelines.org.uk |publisher=The British Museum |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the frontal gaze of some of the creatures on the bowl is a common occurrence in carvings of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Treasure Annual Report 2001 |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |location= |isbn= |page=43 |chapter=Early Medieval Artefacts |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Catalogpp041068.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512161923/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Catalogpp041068.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decorations show plants, grapes, fruit, animals and birds in both naturalistic and grotesque style.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;
Another beaded band is riveted on in four places outside the rim. These rivets have square mountings, in one of which a piece of blue glass survives. The external base plate features five domed rivets. The interlaced [[cruciform]] decoration between these rivets has been made using a [[repoussé]] technique. The bowl may also once have had a footring made from gilded wire.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;

===Comparisons===
The Ormside bowl is similar in aspects of its style to several bowls from the [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]] but is closer in style to the [[Witham bowl]], a lost early eighth century hanging-bowl found in the [[River Witham]]. The decoration on the bowl has been compared to the [[St Petersburg Bede]], [[Barberini Gospels]], [[Gandersheim Casket]] and [[Rupertus Cross]].&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;
The conical bosses on the base of the bowl resemble features of the [[Kildalton Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/251204/details/islay+kildalton+chapel+burial+ground+kildalton+great+cross/ |title=Islay, Kildalton Chapel Burial Ground, Kildalton Great Cross |author= |date=1 August 2007  |work=Scotland's national collection of buildings, archaeology and industry |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embossed and fine-lined filigreed designs on the bowl have been compared to those of the [[Wye Down pendant]] and the [[Book of Durrow]] leading to it being dated in 1958 by G. Haseloff to 650–700,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=G. HASELOFF |year=1958 |title=Fragments of a bowl Hanging-Bowl from Bekesbourne, Kent and Some Ornamental Problems |journal=Med.

The bowl was found buried in 1823 in what is now [[St James' Church, Great Ormside|St James' Churchyard in Great Ormside]].&lt;ref name="ILN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Master Works Revealed: The Ormside Bowl and Sutton Hoo Standard |url=http://www.iln.org.uk/iln_years/year/images/1952/1952ormbowl.jpg |format=jpg |newspaper=The Illustrated London News |date=26 January 1952 |page=148|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bowl was amongst the first objects donated to the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]] in 1823, before the construction of the Yorkshire Museum in 1829-30. It latterly formed part of the permanent collection of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Donations to the Museum |date=1824 |journal=Report of the Council of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for 1823 |publisher=Yorkshire Philosophical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=COLLECTION ITEM: ORMSIDE BOWL |url=https://www.yorkmuseumstrust.org.uk/collections/search/item/?id=538&amp;search_query=bGltaXQ9MTYmc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9b3Jtc2lkZStib3dsJkdzJTVCb3BlcmF0b3IlNUQ9JTNFJTNEJkdzJTVCdmFsdWUlNUQ9JkdlJTVCb3BlcmF0b3IlNUQ9JTNDJTNEJkdlJTVCdmFsdWUlNUQ9JkZOPQ%3D%3D |publisher=[[York Museums Trust]] |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 the burial of a Viking warrior was found in the same churchyard. This burial, including a sword, is now in the [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Carlisle]] where it forms an important part of their early medieval collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/node/504 |title=Vikings in Cumbria |author= |date= |work=Tullie House website |publisher= |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/ormside-st-james/ |title=St James, Ormside |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Church of England |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David M. Wilson]] does not consider the bowl to have actually been buried with the Viking warrior, and instead assumes it was really found inside the church, as he considers the bowl to be too fragile to have survived burying.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;

==Public display==
In 1951 the bowl was cleaned and treated in the laboratory of the [[British Museum]], including the removal of a silver patch so that all of the metalworking detail could be seen. It was then exhibited at the York Festival before returning briefly for exhibition in the British Museum in 1952.&lt;ref name="ILN"/&gt;

It was on display in the 1980s as the centerpiece of the Anglo-Saxon gallery, surrounded by swords and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report: The Yorkshire Museum |journal=British Archaeology Monthly |date=September 1987 |volume=3 |pages=24-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bowl was temporarily displayed again in the British Museum in 2010. This was the first time a regional museum has shown its collection at the British Museum and [[Margaret Hodge]] the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] encouraged everybody to view the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100301/debtext/100301-0003.htm|title=Topical Questions|house=House of Commons|date=1 March 2010|column=652}}&lt;/ref&gt; It returned to the Yorkshire Museum for its reopening on [[Yorkshire Day]] of the same year after a £2m refurbishment of the galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/5022865.A_heritage_to_treasure/ |title=A heritage to treasure |author=Steve Pratt |date=23 February 2010 |work=The Northern Echo |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |accessdate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228133708/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/5022865.A_heritage_to_treasure/ |archivedate=28 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017 the bowl formed part of a touring exhibition titled 'Viking: Rediscover the Legend' and is displayed alongside the [[Bedale Hoard]], the [[Vale of York hoard]] and the [[Cuerdale hoard]], with the tour starting at the Yorkshire Museum in May 2017 with subsequent displays at the [[Atkinson Art Gallery and Library]] in Southport, [[Aberdeen Art Gallery]], [[Norwich Castle Museum]], and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/15282835.Face_to_face_with_the_Vikings/ |author1=Lewis, S. |title=Face to face with the Vikings |date=12 May 2017 |publisher=[[York Press]] |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.minsterfm.com/news/local/2291242/a-new-understanding-of-the-vikings/ |title=A new understanding of the Vikings |publisher=[[Minster FM]] News |date=18 May 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is painting? ==
Painting can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the word "painting".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation. A painting is a work of art expressed in paint.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, painting is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Painting is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
*** One of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.

== Essence of painting ==
* [[Emotions]]
** [[Love]]
* [[Knowledge]]
* [[Perception]]
* [[Creativity]]
* [[Imagination]]
* [[Artistic inspiration]]
** [[Muse]]
** [[Afflatus]]

== Styles of painting ==

=== Styles of painting by movement ===
* [[Abstract Expressionism]] &amp;ndash; movement in painting, originating in New York City in the 1940s. It emphasized spontaneous personal expression, freedom from accepted artistic values, surface qualities of paint, and the act of painting itself. Pollock, de Kooning, Motherwell, and Kline, are important abstract expressionists.
* [[Academic art]] &amp;ndash; a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies or universities. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des beaux-arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles.
* [[Action Painting]] &amp;ndash; connected to the Abstract Expressionist movement, but more precise in its meaning, Action Painting believes in the expressive power held in the actual act of painting as much as in the finished product. Rosenberg defined the notion of the canvas as seen by the artists in this movement as being 'not a picture but an event'.
* [[Art Deco]] &amp;ndash; design style prevalent during the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by a sleek use of straight lines and slender form.
* [[Art Nouveau]] &amp;ndash; decorative art movement that emerged in the late nineteenth century. Characterized by dense asymmetrical ornamentation in sinuous forms, it is often symbolic and of an erotic nature. Klimt worked in an art nouveau style.
* [[Baroque]] &amp;ndash; movement in European painting in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, characterized by violent movement, strong emotion, and dramatic lighting and coloring. Bernini, Caravaggio and Rubens were among important baroque artists.
* [[Bauhaus]] &amp;ndash; school of art, design and architecture founded in Germany in 1919. Bauhaus style is characterized by its severely economic, geometric design and by its respect for materials. The Bauhaus school was created by Walter Gropius.
* [[Byzantine]] &amp;ndash; style of the Byzantine Empire and its provinces, c. 330-1450. Appearing mostly in religious mosaics, manuscript illuminations, and panel paintings, it is characterized by rigid, monumental, stylized forms with gold backgrounds.
* [[Classicism]] &amp;ndash; based on Greek and Roman art of antiquity with emphasis on harmony, proportion, balance, and simplicity.
* [[Color field painting]] &amp;ndash; technique in abstract painting developed in the 1950s. It focuses on the lyrical effects of large areas of color, often poured or stained onto the canvas. Newman, Rothko, and Frankenthaler painted in this manner.
* [[Conceptual Art]] &amp;ndash; movement of the 1960s and 1970s that emphasized the artistic idea over the art object. It attempted to free art from the confines of the gallery and the pedestal.
* [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] &amp;ndash; Russian abstract movement founded by Tatlin, Gabo, and Antoine Pevsner, c. 1915. It focused on art for the industrial age. Tatlin believed in art with a utilitarian purpose.
* [[Cubism]] &amp;ndash; revolutionary movement begun by Picasso and Braque in the early twentieth century. It employs an analytic vision based on fragmentation and multiple viewpoints.
* [[Empire Style]] &amp;ndash; sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early-19th-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts.
* [[Dadaism]] &amp;ndash; movement, c. 1915-23, that rejected accepted aesthetic standards. It aimed to create antiart and nonart, often employing a sense of the absurd.
* [[Der Blaue Reiter]] &amp;ndash; name derived from a drawing by Wassily Kandinsky that appeared on the cover of the Almanac featuring a blue horseman. Established in December 1911 by Kandinsky, Marc and Gabriele Münter their first show was entitled 'First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of the Blue Rider' and was launched to coincide with the last show by the NKV in the same gallery in Munich.
* [[Die Neue Sachlichkeit]] (The New Objectivity) &amp;ndash; Expressionist movement founded in Germany in the aftermath of World War I by George Grosz and Otto Dix. Its artwork is characterized by a realistic style combined with a cynical and socially critical philosophical stance. Other artists associated with the movement included Christian Schad and Max Beckmann.
* [[Ashcan School|The Eight]] &amp;ndash; group of American painters who united out of opposition to academic standards in the early twentieth century. Members of the group were Robert Henri, Arthur Davies, Maurice Prendergast, William James Glackens, Ernest Lawson, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, and George Luks.
* [[Expressionism]] &amp;ndash; art that uses emphasis and distortion to communicate emotion. More specifically, it refers to early twentieth century northern European art, especially in Germany c. 1905-25. Artists such as Rouault, Kokoschka, and Schiele painted in this manner.
* [[Fauvism]] &amp;ndash; style adopted by artists associated with Matisse, c. 1905-08. They painted in a spontaneous manner, using bold colors. From the French word fauve, meaning "wild beast .
* [[Flemish School]] &amp;ndash; characterised by idealism and experimentation with perspective, Flemish Art thrived in the 15th century with artists such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Dirk Bouts. They specialised in portrait painting with religious themes and complicated iconography.
* [[Fluxus]] &amp;ndash; movement encompassed a new aesthetic, a reductive gesturality, part Dada, part Bauhaus and part Zen, and presumes that all media and all artistic disciplines are fair game for combination and fusion. Fluxus presaged avant-garde developments over the last 40 years. Fluxus objects and performances are characterized by minimalist but often expansive gestures based in scientific, philosophical, sociological, or other extra-artistic ideas and leavened with burlesque.
* [[Folk art]] &amp;ndash; works of a culturally homogeneous people without formal training, generally according to regional traditions and involving crafts.
* [[Futurism]] &amp;ndash; Italian movement c. 1909-19. It attempted to integrate the dynamism of the machine age into art. Boccioni was a futurist artist.
* [[Gothic art|Gothic]] &amp;ndash; European movement beginning in France. Gothic sculpture emerged c. 1200, Gothic painting later in the thirteenth century. The artworks are characterized by a linear, graceful, elegant style more naturalistic than that which had existed previously in Europe.
* [[Graffiti Art]] &amp;ndash; movement which achieved an enormous amount of success in New York in the 1980s. It was named after the spray-can vandalism common in most cities and most associated with the New York subway system. The two most successful figures of this movement were Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. The New York art scene embraced Graffiti Art, with several galleries specialising in the genre and a Museum of American Graffiti opening in 1989.
* [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] &amp;ndash; began in the early 1900s when several Canadian Artists began noticing a similarity in style. Canadian Painters Tom Thomson, J.E.H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael were often believed to have socialised together through common interests and mutual employment.
* [[Harlem Renaissance]] &amp;ndash; from 1920 until about 1930 African-American cultural movement became known as "The New Negro Movement" and later as the Harlem Renaissance. More than a literary movement and more than a social revolt against racism, the Harlem Renaissance exalted the unique culture of African-Americans and redefined African-American expression.
* [[Impressionism]] &amp;ndash; late-nineteenth-century French school of painting. It focused on transitory visual impressions, often painted directly from nature, with an emphasis on the changing effects of light and color. Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro were important impressionists.
* [[Kitsch]] &amp;ndash; German and Yiddish word denoting art that is considered an inferior, tasteless copy of an extant style of art.
* [[Lyrical Abstraction]] &amp;ndash; Post-War style of abstract painting emanating out of Europe in the late 1940s and a style of American painting emanating out of New York City and Los Angeles in the mid-1960s.

* [[Minimalism]] &amp;ndash; movement in American painting and sculpture that originated in the late 1950s. It emphasized pure, reduced forms and strict, systematic compositions.
* [[Les Nabis]] &amp;ndash; group of French painters active in the 1890s who worked in a subjective, sometimes mystical style, stressing flat areas of color and pattern. Bonnard and Vuillard were members. From the Hebrew word for "prophet."
* [[Naive Art]] &amp;ndash; artwork, usually paintings, characterized by a simplified style, nonscientific perspective, and bold colors. The artists are generally not professionally trained. Henri Rousseau and Grandma Moses worked in this style.
* [[Neoclassicism]] or [[Neo-Classicism]] &amp;ndash; European style of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that drew inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. Its elegant, balanced works revived the order and harmony of ancient Greek and Roman art. David and Canova are examples of neoclassicists.
* [[Op Art]] &amp;ndash; abstract movement in Europe and the United States, begun in the mid-1950s, based on the effects of optical patterns. Albers worked in this style.
* [[Photorealism]] &amp;ndash; figurative movement that emerged in the United States and Britain in the late 1960s and 1970s. The subject matter, usually everyday scenes, is portrayed in an extremely detailed, exacting style. It is also called superrealism, especially when referring to sculpture.
* [[Pointilism]] &amp;ndash; method of painting developed by Seurat and Paul Signac in the 1880s. It used dabs of pure color that were intended to mix in the eyes of viewers rather than on the canvas. It is also called divisionism or neoimpressionism.
* [[Pop Art]] &amp;ndash; movement that began in Britain and the United States in the 1950s. It used the images and techniques of mass media, advertising, and popular culture, often in an ironic way. Works of Warhol, Lichtenstein, and Oldenburg exemplify this style.
* [[Postimpressionism]] &amp;ndash; term coined by British art critic Roger Fry to refer to a group of nineteenth-century painters, including Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin, who were dissatisfied with the limitations of expressionism. It has since been used to refer to various reactions against impressionism, such as fauvism and expressionism.
* [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] &amp;ndash; group of English painters formed in 1848. These artists attempted to recapture the style of painting preceding Raphael. They rejected industrialized England and focused on painting from nature, producing detailed, colorful works. Rossetti was a founding member.
* [[Realist movement]] &amp;ndash; nineteenth century movement, especially in France, that rejected idealized academic styles in favor of everyday subjects. Daumier, Millet, and Courbet were realists. In a general sense, refers to objective representation.
* [[Renaissance]] &amp;ndash; Refers to Europe c. 1400-1600. Renaissance art which began in Italy, stressed the forms of classical antiquity, a realistic representation of space based on scientific perspective, and secular subjects. The works of Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael exemplify the balance and harmony of the High Renaissance (c. 1495-1520). Means "rebirth" in French.
* [[Rococo]] &amp;ndash; eighteenth-century European style, originating in France. In reaction to the grandeur and massiveness of the baroque, rococo employed refined, elegant, highly decorative forms. Fragonard worked in this style.
* [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] &amp;ndash; European style developed in France in the late eleventh century. Its sculpture is ornamental, stylized and complex. Some Romanesque frescoes survive, painted in a monumental, active manner.
* [[Romanticism]] &amp;ndash; European movement of the late eighteenth to mid nineteenth century. In reaction to neoclassicism, it focused on emotion over reason, and on spontaneous expression. The subject matter was invested with drama and usually painted energetically in brilliant colors. Delacroix, Géricault, Turner, and Blake were Romantic artists.
* [[Situationist International|Situationism]] &amp;ndash; influenced by Dada, Surrealism and Lettrism. The post-war Lettrist International, which sought to fuse poetry and music and transform the urban landscape, was a direct forerunner of the group who founded the magazine 'Situationiste Internationale' in 1957. At first, they were principally concerned with the "suppression of art", that is to say, they wished like the Dadaists and the Surrealists before them to supersede the categorization of art and culture as separate activities and to transform them into part of everyday life.
* [[De Stijl]] &amp;ndash; art movement advocating pure abstraction and simplicity—form reduced to the rectangle and other geometric shapes, and colour to the primary colours, along with black and white. Piet Mondrian was the group's leading figure. He published a manifesto titled Neo-Plasticism in 1920. Another member, painter Theo van Doesburg had started a journal named De Stijl, spreading the theories of the group. Their work exerted tremendous influence on the Bauhaus and the International Style.
* [[Suprematism]] &amp;ndash; Russian abstract movement originated by Malevich c. 1913. It was characterized by flat geometric shapes on plain backgrounds and emphasized the spiritual qualities of pure form.
* [[Surrealism]] &amp;ndash; movement of the 1920s and 1930s that began in France. It explored the unconscious, often using images from dreams. It used spontaneous techniques and featured unexpected juxtapositions of objects. Magritte, Dalí, Miró, and Ernst painted surrealist works.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] &amp;ndash; painting movement that flourished in France in the 1880s and 1890s in which subject matter was suggested rather than directly presented. It featured decorative, stylized, and evocative images.

'''Phallic architecture''' consciously or unconsciously creates a symbolic representation of the [[phallus]].&lt;ref name="AmbroseHarris2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambrose|first1=Gavin|last2=Harris|first2=Paul|last3=Stone|first3=Sally|title=The Visual Dictionary of Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aml4RjvWaB4C&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=1 February 2008 |location=Lausanne, Switzerland New York, N.Y |publisher=AVA Publishing SA Distributed in the USA &amp; Canada by Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=978-2-940373-54-3|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings intentionally or unintentionally resembling the human penis are a source of amusement to locals and tourists in various places around the world. Deliberate phallic imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] celebrated phallic festivals and built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods. Those figures may be related to the [[ancient Egypt]]ian deity [[Min (god)|Min]] who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and [[Yugoslavia]]. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient [[Babylon]]. The [[Romans]], who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the [[Far East]], including [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.

Scholars of [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[feminism]] have pointed out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large [[skyscrapers]] which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that can be interpreted as phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.

==History and background==

===Antiquity===
[[File:Phallic Pre-History items at Auberge de Provence 01.jpg|thumb|Phallic [[Pre-History|Temple period]] (4,000 - 25,000 B.C.) items at the [[National Museum of Archaeology, Malta|National Museum of Archaeology]], Malta&lt;ref&gt;Sagina, Claudia (2015), [https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 The Archeology of Malta], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|9781107006690}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The worship of the phallus has existed since the [[Stone Age]], and was particularly prevalent during the [[Neolithic]] period and the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="Patrick2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=John|title=Huge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pdREL8ufWpgC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=17 September 2012|date=30 May 2008|publisher=STARbooks Press|isbn=978-1-934187-29-6|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phallic architecture became prominent in [[ancient Egypt]] and Greece, where genitalia and human sexuality received a high degree of attention. The ancient Greeks honored the phallus and celebrated phallic festivals.&lt;ref name="GretherKramer2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grether|first1=Bruce P.|last2=Kramer|first2=Joseph|last3=Johnson|first3=Toby|title=The Secret of the Golden Phallus: Male Erotic Alchemy for the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KF7zviQJwOAC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=30 March 2012|publisher=[[Lethe Press]]|isbn=978-1-59021-118-2|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Roman deity [[Priapus]] was worshiped as a god of fertility, depicted with a giant phallus in numerous public architectural pieces.&lt;ref name="Patrick2008"/&gt;

The Greeks regularly built a shrine which they called "Herm" at the entrance of major public buildings, homes and along roads to honor [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods.&lt;ref name="Westmoreland2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Westmoreland|first=Perry L.|title=Ancient Greek Beliefs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8AvHMepO8wC&amp;pg=PA627|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=30 June 2007|publisher=Lee And Vance Publishing Co|isbn=978-0-9793248-1-9|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shrines typically "took the form of a vertical pillar topped by the bearded head of a man and from the surface of the pillar below the head, an erect phallus protruded".&lt;ref name="GretherKramer2012"/&gt; It is believed that they sought their inspiration from the ancient Egyptians and their phallic image of [[Min (god)|Min]], the valley god, who was similarly "depicted as a standing bearded king with simplified body, one arm raised, the other hand holding his erect phallus."&lt;ref name="GretherKramer2012"/&gt;

[[Herodotus]], the ancient Greek historian, documented women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments the size of a human body in villages in ancient [[Dionysia]].&lt;ref name="Bloch2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Iwan|title=Anthropological Studies in the Strange Sexual Practices of All Races in All Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PEqvj5MJ7AC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-3382-2|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of [[Delos]] a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of [[Dionysus]]. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil.&lt;ref name="GlazebrookHenry2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glazebrook|first1=Allison|last2=Henry|first2=Madeleine M.|title=Greek Prostitutes in the ancient Mediterranean, 800 BCE–200 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XXabZhMMhsC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=6 January 2011|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-23564-2|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as [[Nea Nikomedeia]] in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.&lt;ref name="Gimbutas1974"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gimbutas|first=Marija Alseikaitė|title=The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe: 7000 to 3500 BC Myths, Legends and Cult Images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLACTsmH4aYC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=16 September 2012|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01995-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar figurines of women with phallus heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast majority of the figurines of the [[Hamangia culture]] have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the [[Aegean culture]], had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes.&lt;ref name="Gimbutas1974"/&gt; In these parts of the ancient world, [[obelisk]] like structures resembling the [[human penis]] were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm.&lt;ref name="AmbroseHarris2008"/&gt; Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of the masculine earth.&lt;ref name="Hannay1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannay|first=James Ballantyne|title=Sex Symbolism in Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90VzHRzJm7sC&amp;pg=PA522|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=1 August 1991|publisher=Health Research Books|isbn=978-0-7873-0367-9|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKenzie|first=Kenneth R.

Although phallic architecture as individual pieces was not prevalent in [[ancient Rome]] as it was in ancient Greece or Egypt, the Romans were deeply superstitious and often introduced phallus-related components as architectural pieces and domestic items. Archaeologists unearthing a site in [[Pompei]] discovered many vases, ornaments and sculptures unearthed revealing the preoccupation with the phallus,&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; also unearthing an 18-inch [[terracotta]] phallus protruding from what was believed to have been a bakery with the inscription, "Hie habitat felicitas" (here dwells happiness), and many Romans wore phallus [[amulet]]s to ward off the evil-eye.&lt;ref name="Harris2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Judith|title=Pompeii Awakened: A Story of Rediscovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cmm4bvaVVYC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=15 June 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-241-7|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiley2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary|title=The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDdcVt9-jnMC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2684-5|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapic worship amongst the women of Sicily continued into the 18th century; worshiping phallic votive objects and kissing such offerings before placing them upon the altar in the churches.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; Fetishism with the phallus architecturally and in smaller implements was also exhibited by certain Christian sects in medieval times, such as the [[Manichaean]]s, and was connected with [[Sadomasochism|masochism]] and [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]], a form of religious flagellantism.&lt;ref name="Bloch2003"/&gt; Smaller phallic shaped monuments in the form of idols, even vases, rings, drinking vessels and jewellery have been well-documented and could be found within medieval churches of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Bloch2003"/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the [[Hindu]] [[trimurthi]] represents [[Brahma]], the creator, [[Vishnu]], the preserver and [[Shiva]], the destroyer. Shiva, the main deity in India, is both destroyer and is stated to also include his role of creation; this creation role is represented by the phallic symbol, known as ''[[lingam]]'' in which form he is worshiped or in the form of male trinity of penis and two testicles.&lt;ref name=" Wall 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last= Wall |first= Otto Augustus |title=Sex and Sex Worship (phallic Worship): A Scientific Treatise on Sex, Its Nature and Function, and Its Influence on Art, Science, Architecture, and Religion-with Special Reference to Sex Worship and Symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sfMaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=Phallic+architecture+in+India#v=onepage&amp;q=Phallic%20architecture%20in%20India&amp;f=false|year=1920|publisher= C.V. Mosby Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''linga'', or phallus, is a common feature of Hindu temples across India, engrained as reliefs or other forms. The [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Tanjore]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], built during the [[Chola Dynasty]], is dedicated to Shiva, and features ''lingam'' between the cells; it is especially renowned for its "Hall of One Thousand Lingas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=William A. |title=The Architecture and Organization of Kerala Style Hindu Temples |journal=Anthropos |date=1981 |volume=76 |issue=1/2 |pages=1–24 |jstor=40460291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], the phallic [[lingam|''lingga'']] and feminine ''[[yoni]]'', remain common symbols of harmony.  The [[Keraton Kasepuhan|Sultan's Palace of Kasepuhan]], in [[West Java]], has a number of ''lingga-yoni'' carvings along its walls. According to the Indonesian chronicles of the [[Babad Tanah Jawi]], Prince Puger gained the kingly power from [[God]], by ingesting sperm from the phallus of the already-dead [[Amangkurat II of Mataram|Sultan Amangkurat II of Mataram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moertono|first=Soemarsaid|title=State and Statecraft in Old Java: A Study of the Later Mataram Period, 16th to 19th Century|year=2009|publisher=Equinoc Publishing|isbn=9786028397438|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darmaputera|first=Eka|title=Pancasila and the search for identity and modernity in Indonesian society: a cultural and ethical analysis|year=1988|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004084223|pages=108–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Candi Sukuh]] temple of Ngancar, [[East Java]], was built in the 10th century and is dedicated to Shiva. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina.&lt;ref name="KinneyKlokke2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinney|first1=Ann R.|last2=Klokke|first2=Marijke J.|last3=Kieven|first3=Lydia|title=Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=29 September 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2779-3|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three [[tortoise]]s with flattened shells.&lt;ref name="KinneyKlokke2003"/&gt; The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) representation of ''lingga'' with four testicles; this is now housed in the [[National Museum of Indonesia]]. Phallic references were also made in [[Khmer architecture]] in [[Cambodia]], and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.

In Africa, Ancient [[Mali]]ans, particularly the royals of [[Djenne]], decorated their palaces with phallus like piers and columns at the entrance of their palaces and decorated the walls with phallus motifs.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture: Three-volume set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=23 March 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar features can be seen on the pillars of many temples across Africa, often interpreted by western scholars to be phallic symbols, but may often be more subtle and subject to varying interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prussin |first1=Labelle |title=An Introduction to Indigenous African Architecture |journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians |date=1974 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=183–205 |doi=10.2307/988854 |jstor=988854 |url=http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/sijpkes/arch528/fall2001/lecture3/african-architecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ancient Egyptian pharaohs, [[Aksum]]ite kings built temples with phallic pillars in ancient Ethiopian cities such as [[Konsu]], and monolithic pillars with phallic representation have also been discovered in [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gensheimer |first1=Thomas R. |title=''Research Notes:'' Monumental Tomb Architecture of the Medieval Swahili Coast |journal=Buildings &amp; Landscapes: Journal of the Vernacular Architecture Forum |date=2012 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=107–114 |doi=10.1353/bdl.2012.0002 |jstor=988854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]], phallic architecture was rare but [[Uxmal]] in particular has a considerable number of phallus-like architectural pieces.

[[Claude Nicholas Ledoux]] was a major exponent of architectural development in the 17th century which "articulated across the tensions of form and ornament, symbol, and allegory, dogma, and fantasy", at a time when western society was oppressive and particularly sensitive to public displays of sexuality; blatant and graphic phallic architecture would have been considered an embarrassment and a shameful act.&lt;ref name="Singley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singley |first1=Paulette |title=The Anamorphic Phallus within Ledoux's Dismembered Plan of Chaux |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |date=1993 |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=176–188 |doi=10.2307/1425159 |jstor=1425159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his initial draft for the House of Pleasure in Chaux (a proposed ideal city, near the [[Forest of Chaux]]), Ledoux drew upon allegorical ideas in his design with the union of man and woman, a physiological interpretation of intercourse and penetration. Private bedrooms were designed to "thrust out from the circular ring of the building, metaphorically representing penetration, the circular ring representing the vaginal passage and womb of the female.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt;

The second revised design is said to "subliminate both elevated site and female gender" with a "lonely phallus", without the original planned animated circular ring representing the female reproductive organs.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; Ledoux drew upon phallic and sexually charged inspiration in other buildings which he designed. His design of Besançon Theatre for instance was fueled by the exigencies of prostitution and ancient sexual ritual.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; However, in comparison to the likes of [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]], who gained notoriety for his pornographic architectural concoctions, Ledoux's architectural inspiration was relatively mild, and he is said to have omitted towers from his designs on occasion as he was aware that they would be frowned upon shamefully by general society as a too obvious representation of the phallus; Ledoux's "missing erection" is explained to this effect in Jacques Lecan's ''Significance of the Missing Phalus''.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt;

According to [[Oscar Reutersvärd]], the interest in neoclassical architecture in the 18th century was synonymous with and motivated by a similar interest in masculine virility.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; Works such as [[Francesco Colonna]]'s ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' (1467) and [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]]'s ''[[Campo Marzio]]'' (1762) show profoundly the ancient influence of phallic architecture in design and worship, and contain numerous illustrations of Priapic temples and architecture.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; Piranesi in particular is said to have offered a "prototype for the mysterious architecture of phallic worship that more closely resembles the houses of pleasure" in his etchings.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt;

He located two designs for the Bustum Caesaris Augusti, concluding that they were based upon sexual ritual, with "two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula".  Piranesi believed that the purpose of the phallic designs were to celebrate virility and male regenerative power.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; Other commentators such as [[Carl August Ehrensvärd]] also provided illustrations and analysis of Priapic temples and the meaning of phallic architecture.&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt; A work of note to this effect is ''Neoclassical Temple of Virility and the Buildings with a Phallic Shaped Plan'' (1977) of the Institute for Art History of the [[University of Lund]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Singley"/&gt;

In America, especially in [[Chicago]] and [[New York City|New York]], and numerous other global cities, high rise skyscrapers of phallic shape grew up in the 20th century. [[Le Corbusier]], the famous architect, propagated it in Europe in place of traditional decorative architecture. Similar futuristic developments took place in Italy with the initiative of Sant’Elia, symbolizing the triumph of man. Yet unlike those of ancient times which were blatant architectural representations of the phallus, in the West in modern times "shrines to the phallus" are more subtle, and may often be subject to interpretation as such; very few architects have specifically admitted the human phallus as a source for their architectural creation.&lt;ref name="Bakos2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakos|first=Susan Crain|title=Daily Sex Bible: Inspirations and Techniques for the Best Year of Sex Ever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyDbDGsmqlAC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Quiver|isbn=978-1-59233-447-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] were cited as having an obsession with phallic architecture which was rigid and impermeable.&lt;ref name="Mississippi1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Mississippi|title=Faulkner and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CcQZ26PM-g8C&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=12 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=Univ.

China fuels billions of dollars annually into high-rise office and residential buildings with the aim of increasing GDP, at a rate far greater than they can be occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/global/20ghost.html?pagewanted=all | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | first=David | last=Barboza | title=A New Chinese City, With Everything but People |date=20 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

Lefebvre conducted considerable research into the meaning of high-rise buildings.&lt;ref name="Lin2010"/&gt; He said "The arrogant verticality of skyscrapers, and especially of public and state buildings, introduces a phallic or more precisely a phallocratic element into the visual realm; the purpose of this display, of this need to impress, is to convey an impression of authority to each spectator. Verticality and great height have ever been the spatial expression of potentially violent power."&lt;ref name="Lin2010"/&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] metaphorically drew a comparison between "high achievement and the acquisition of wealth as building monuments to our penises."&lt;ref name="Publishing1995"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Advocate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=22 August 1995|publisher=Here Publishing|page=56|issn=0001-8996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Mical]] argues that surrealists "capitalized on the phallic symbolism of monuments such as the ancient Egyptian obelisk from Luxor in the [[Place de la Concorde]] or the [[Vendome Column]]" by "supplementing these phallic structures with female counterparts".&lt;ref name="Mical2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mical|first=Thomas|title=Surrealism and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AR6bNi55BgUC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=17 December 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-32520-2|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Breton]] for example suggested moving the obelisk to [[La Villette abattoir]] and designing a large gloved hand of a woman holding the obelisk in a suggestive manner, and adapting the Vendome into a factory chimney with a nude woman climbing it.&lt;ref name="Mical2004"/&gt;
[[Auguste Bartholdi]]'s 1870 monument ''Defense of Paris'' for instance, a commemoration of [[Leon Gambetta]]'s escape from Paris in balloon during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], was also subject to debate amongst Parisian artists of the late 19th century as they believed it resembled a testicle.&lt;ref name="Mical2004"/&gt; [[Arthur Harfaux]] proposed turning the monument into "an enormous sex, the balloon forming a testicle and the phallus being horizontal", while Breton proposed turning it into copulating genitals, adding a twin balloon to form two testicles.&lt;ref name="Mical2004"/&gt;

===Symbols and shrines===
[[File:Mara-kannnon2017-05.jpg|thumb|[[:ja:麻羅観音|Marakannnon(JAPAN)]]]]
During the modern era, many sculptors have created some public phallic works of art, with varying degrees of subtlety. One of these examples may be the statue in honor to the [[Carnation Revolution]] on the top of a hill in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] by the sculptor [[João Cutileiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Teixeira, José | title=Escultura pública em Portugal : monumentos, heróis e mitos (séc. XX) | publisher=UTL |url=http://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps the greatest example of a phallic cemetery is the [[Khalid Nabi Cemetery]] in hills of northeastern [[Iran]] near the border with [[Turkmenistan]], roughly {{convert|40|miles}} northeast of [[Gonbad-e Kavous]].&lt;ref name="IGP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/middle-east/101111/iran-tourism-penis-tombstones|title=In Iran, tombstones shaped like penises delight tourists|publisher=''Iran GlobalPost''|date=12 November 2010|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a popular belief, the cemetery house the tomb of a pre-Islamic [[prophet]], Khalid Nabi, who was born 40 years prior to the birth of [[Muhammad]], in c. 530.&lt;ref name="IGP"/&gt; The ancient graveyard contains some 600 tombstones of unknown origin, many of which are clear representations of the phallus; from a distance they resemble stone pegs.&lt;ref name="IGP"/&gt;

Phallic shrines are common in Far East Asia, especially in Buddhist parts of Korea and Japan where they are seen as symbols of fertility or prowess.&lt;ref name="Nemeth1987"/&gt; In [[Dragon Pool Temple]] in  [[Jeju City]], there is a phallic shrine which is visited by female pilgrims who come to worship it for its perceived fertility blessings. The phallic stone is made from granite, quite small in size and white and was reportedly found in a field nearby by a farmer.&lt;ref name="Nemeth1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemeth|first=David J.|title=The Architecture of Ideology: Neo-Confucian Imprinting on Cheju Island, Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za4my8EshDEC&amp;pg=PA197|accessdate=12 September 2012|date=4 September 1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-09713-1|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, the phallus is also considered to be a symbol of good luck and representative of fertility. There are numerous shrines in the country featuring phallic architecture. [[Chao Mae Tuptim]] shrine in [[Bangkok]], behind the [[Swissôtel Bangkok]] hotel has over a hundred colored circumcised wooden penis statues of all shapes and sizes which are said to possess special cosmic powers and endow good fortune and fertility on anybody coming into contact with them.&lt;ref name="Guelden1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guelden|first=Marlane|title=Thailand into the Spirit World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orTXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 September 2012|year=1995|publisher=Times Editions|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HoskinInvernizzi1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoskin|first1=John|last2=Invernizzi|first2=Luca|title=Bangkok|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyMKAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 September 2012|year=1990|publisher=Times Editions|isbn=978-1-55650-271-2|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near [[Erdene Zuu Monastery]] in [[Övörkhangai Province]] of [[Mongolia]] is [[Kharkhorin Rock]] which contains a massive statue of a penis raised on a platform on the steppe.

[[Haesindang Park]] (also known as "Penis Park") in [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]] of [[South Korea]], located about {{convert|20|km}} south of [[Samcheok]], is a nature park which contains a number of erect statues. A tragic legend shrouds them in that a virgin was once swept out to sea and drowned, unable to be saved by her lover. The townspeople were devastated and helpless, and a curse appeared to have been cast over them, ruining the local fishing industry. One day, a local fisherman relieved himself in the sea and miraculously the fishing industry revived. He discovered that her restless spirit could be appeased in such a manner, so the townsfolk compensated for the woman's inability to consummate beyond the grave by placing sexually potent phallic statues in view of the shore.&lt;ref name="BalasingamchowRichmond2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balasingamchow|first1=Yu-Mei|last2=Richmond|first2=Simon|last3=Soriano|first3=Cesar G.|author4=Whyte, Rob |title=Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9-DOFiUI5oC&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=17 September 2012|date=1 May 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-831-5|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statues range in size and styles; some have faces on them and are more animated in appearance and more colorful, but others are exact depictions of the human penis.

In some Asian countries such as [[Bhutan]], many have a belief that a phallus brings good luck and drives away evil spirits. [[Phallus paintings in Bhutan|Phallus symbols are routinely painted outside walls of the new houses]] and carved wooden phalluses are hung (sometimes crossed by a design of sword or dagger) outside, on the eves of the new homes, at the four corners.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lindsey |first2=Bradley |last2=Mayhew |first3=Stan |last3=Armington |first4=Richard |last4=Whitecross |title=Bhutan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=12 September 2012 |publisher=Penguin |year=2009 |isbn=1-74059-529-7 |pages=13, 78, 79, 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a road drive from [[Paro airport]] to [[Thimphu]] explicit paintings of phalluses are a common sight on the white-washed walls of homes, shops and eateries.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; In the [[Chimi Lhakhang]] monastery, the shrine dedicated to Drupka Kinley, several wooden penises are used to bless people who visit the monastery on pilgrimage seeking blessings to bear a child or for welfare of their children. The glaringly displayed phallus in the monastery is a brown wooden piece with a silver handle, a religious relic considered to possess divine powers and hence used for blessing the spiritually oriented people. It is also said to prevent quarrels among family members in the houses which are painted with these symbols.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

===Empire State Building===
The 102-story [[Empire State Building]], located in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]], at the intersection of [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|West 34th Street]], is one of the world's most famous landmarks, and is generally thought of as an American [[cultural icon]].

===Leaning Tower of Pisa===
The [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] in [[Pisa]], [[Italy]], dating from around 1173, has long suffered from structural problems. The tower is eight stories high at {{Convert|55.86|m|ft}} and before restoration work from 1990 leaned 5.5 degrees. It currently leans about 4 degrees but due to foundation problems it continues to sink about 1mm annually.

The Catholic Church denounced the promotion of the tower in such a manner as showing "a complete lack of respect" and a "disgrace"  and retailers can now be fined up to €500 for selling items promoting the tower as a penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

[[Colonna Mediterranea]] is a monumental column in [[Luqa]], [[Malta]]. It has been described by its artist Paul Vella Critien as an "Egyptian symbol".

===Obelisk of Luxor===
The [[Obelisk of Luxor]], which stands in the [[Place de la Concorde]] of [[Paris]], France, was given to the French by the Egyptians in the 1800s. The 23-meter (75-foot) obelisk originally stood at the front of [[Luxor Temple]], honoring [[Ramses II]], pharaoh of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]. According to [[Michael D. Garval]], the French perceived the obelisk as "prodigiously phallic" from the moment it arrived.&lt;ref name="Garval2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garval|first=Michael D.|title="A Dream of Stone": Fame, Vision, and Monumentality in Nineteenth-Century French Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jadTA5yudTcC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=16 September 2012|year=2004|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-862-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Torre Agbar]] is a 38-story  skyscraper located in the [[Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes]] of the [[Poblenou]] neighborhood of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. Designed by [[Jean Nouvel]], it is named after its owners, the [[Grupo Agbar|Agbar Group]], a holding company whose interests include the Barcelona water company [[Aigües de Barcelona]]. An example of [[high-tech architecture]] in the city, its design combines a number of different architectural concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with [[reinforced concrete]], covered with a [[facade]] of [[glass]], and over 4,500 [[window]] openings cut out of the structural concrete. The building stands out on the skyline of Barcelona; it is the third tallest building in the city, standing at 144.44&amp;nbsp;m (473.88&amp;nbsp;ft), with an area of over 50,000 square metres, of which 30,000 are offices. 2,500 LED bulbs cause the tower to change color at night.&lt;ref name="Whittaker2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Whittaker|title=Spain: Be Fluent in Spanish Life and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZS8SWMroUC&amp;pg=PT173|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=30 July 2008|publisher=Thorogood Publishing|isbn=978-1-85418-605-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially opened by the King of Spain on 16 September 2005.

'''Pop art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] during the mid- to late-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/pop-art ''Pop Art: A Brief History'', MoMA Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;Livingstone, M., ''Pop Art: A Continuing History'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The movement presented a challenge to traditions of [[fine art]] by including imagery from [[popular culture|popular]] and [[mass culture]], such as [[advertising]], [[comic books]] and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of ''popular'' (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or [[kitsch]]y elements of any culture, most often through the use of [[irony]].&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ages"&gt;de la Croix, H.; Tansey, R., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in [[UK|Britain]], and [[Larry Rivers]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] among others in the [[United States]]. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of [[abstract expressionism]], as well as an expansion of those ideas.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Due to its utilization of [[found objects]] and images, it is similar to [[Dada]]. Pop art and [[minimalism]] are considered to be art movements that precede [[postmodern art]], or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Harrison| first=Sylvia |title=Pop Art and the Origins of Post-Modernism| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=2001-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'', by [[Andy Warhol]]. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by [[Andy Warhol|Warhol's]] ''Campbell's Tomato Juice Box,'' 1964 (pictured).

==Origins==
The origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain.&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to [[Hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] composition and [[Representation (arts)|representational art]]. They used impersonal, mundane reality, [[irony]], and [[parody]] to "defuse" the personal symbolism and "[[painterly]] looseness" of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high"&gt;Gopnik, A.; Varnedoe, K., ''High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture'', New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., some artwork by [[Larry Rivers]], [[Alex Katz]] and [[Man Ray]] anticipated pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/alex-katz-is-cooler-than-ever-34462293/ |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the origins of pop art in [[Post-war|post-War]] Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American [[popular culture|pop culture]] as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by [[American popular culture]] ''when viewed from afar''.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;  Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of [[Dadaism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]].

===Proto-pop===
[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Charles Demuth]], ''[[I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold]]'' 1928,  collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]] ]]
Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others in Europe like [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Man Ray]] predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American ''proto-pop'' origins which utilized "as found" cultural objects.&lt;ref name="iha"&gt;Piper, David. ''The Illustrated History of Art'', {{ISBN|0-7537-0179-0}}, p486-487.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, American artists [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost "prefiguring" the pop art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=Modern Love |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and .'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom: the Independent Group==
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]'s collage ''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' (1956) is one of the earliest works to be considered "pop art".|alt=A collage of many different styles shows a mostly naked man and woman in a house.]]

The [[Independent Group]] (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;Arnason, H., ''History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] presented a lecture using a series of [[collage]]s titled ''Bunk!'' that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; This material of "found objects" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented ''American'' popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947), which includes the first use of the word "pop", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-i-was-a-rich-mans-plaything-t01462 |title='I was a Rich Man's Plaything', Sir Eduardo Paolozzi |publisher=Tate |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;

According to the son of [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], the term "pop art" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with [[Frank Cordell]],&lt;ref name="Warholstars.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/articles/johnmchale/johnmchale.html |title=John McHale |website=Warholstars.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources credit its origin to British critic [[Lawrence Alloway]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art'', Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Michael Clarke, Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (Both versions agree that the term was used in [[Independent Group]] discussions by mid-1955.)

"Pop art" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term "pop art" first appeared in published print in the article "But Today We Collect Ads" by IG members [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] in Ark magazine in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Alison and Peter Smithson, "But Today We Collect Ads", reprinted on page 54 in ''Modern Dreams The Rise and Fall of Pop'', published by ICA and MIT, {{ISBN|0-262-73081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often credited to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[art critic]]/[[curator]] [[Lawrence Alloway]] for his 1958 essay titled ''The Arts and the Mass Media'', even though the precise language he uses is "popular mass culture".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "The Arts and the Mass Media," Architectural Design &amp; Construction, February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; "Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954-55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation..."&lt;ref name="Honnef"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KRtCl1nFSV8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22term+pop+art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi44ePWpubWAhVEYlAKHe-2AtEQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22term%20pop%20art%22&amp;f=false Klaus Honnef, ''Pop Art'', Taschen, 2004], p. 6, {{ISBN|3822822183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art.&lt;ref name="Honnef" /&gt;

In London, the annual [[Royal Society of British Artists|Royal Society of British Artists (RBA)]] exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-''Young Contemporaries'' of all put [[David Hockney]], the American [[R B Kitaj]], New Zealander [[Billy Apple]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]], [[Derek Boshier]], [[Joe Tilson]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]] and [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Christina|title=Billy Apple: British and American Works 1960-69|year=2010|publisher=The Mayor Gallery|location=London|isbn=978-0-9558367-3-2|pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21" /&gt;

==United States==
Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term "pop art" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a "Symposium on Pop Art" organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="SchermanTony"&gt;Scherman, Tony. "When Pop Turned the Art World Upside Down." ''American Heritage'' 52.1 (February 2001), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements and inflections of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein Drowning Girl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roy Lichtenstein]], ''[[Drowning Girl]]'', 1963, on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]].|alt=A woman's crying face is overwhelmed by waves as she thinks, "I don't care! I'd rather sink than call Brad for help!"]]
Two important painters in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; While the paintings of Rauschenberg have relationships to the earlier work of [[Kurt Schwitters]] and other [[Dada]] artists, his concern was for the social issues of the moment. His approach was to create art out of ephemeral materials. By using topical events in the life of everyday America, he gave his work a unique quality.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Sandler|Sandler, Irving H.]] ''The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties,'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978. {{ISBN|0-06-438505-1}} pp. 174–195, ''Rauschenberg and Johns''; pp. 103–111, ''Rivers and the gestural realists''.&lt;/ref&gt; Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is classified as [[Neo-Dada]], and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Jasper Johns" ''Art International'' (September 1960): 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood,  Susan, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958-62''. New York: Universe Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheddar Cheese crop from Campbells Soup Cans MOMA.jpg|thumb|The ''Cheddar Cheese'' canvas from [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''Campbell's Soup Cans'', 1962.]]
[[Roy Lichtenstein]] is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of [[parody]], probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' is part of the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].)&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Janis|title=Roy Lichtenstein|year=1988|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|location=Cologne, Germany|isbn=3-8228-0281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work features thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, "[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix.

The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, [[Tom Wesselmann]] and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; 

Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol "the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;  Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Michelson, Annette, Buchloh, B. H. D. (eds) ''Andy Warhol'' (October Files), MIT Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warhol, Andy. ''The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, from A to B and back again''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early U.S. exhibitions===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] had their first shows in the [[Judson Memorial Church#Sponsorship of the arts|Judson Gallery]] in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] and others at the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed [[Installation art|installations]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]], ''New Media - New Forms'' featured [[Hans Arp]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Jasper Johns]], Claes Oldenburg, [[Robert Rauschenberg]], Jim Dine and [[May Wilson]]. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, ''Environments, Situations, Spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O:AD:E:4397&amp;page_number=12&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection |website=MoMA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/newsm1/n1m651.htm |title=The Great American Pop Art Store: Multiples of the Sixties |website=Tfaoi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at [[Ferus Gallery|Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery]], where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;

Donald Factor, the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]], and an art collector and co-editor of [[avant-garde]] [[literary magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']], wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, ''Nomad/New York''. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, "Four Artists", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name="Diggory"&gt;Diggory (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many ''[[happening]]s'', which were [[performance art]]-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was "Ray Gun Theater". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists [[Lucas Samaras]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]] and [[Richard Artschwager]]; dealer Annina Nosei; [[art critic]] [[Barbara Rose]]; and screenwriter [[Rudy Wurlitzer]].&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Kristine McKenna (July 2, 1995), [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-02/entertainment/ca-19310_1_claes-oldenburg When Bigger Is Better: Claes Oldenburg has spent the past 35 years blowing up and redefining everyday objects, all in the name of getting art off its pedestal] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with "profound" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]] to house ''The Store'', a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;

Opening in 1962, [[Willem de Kooning]]'s New York art dealer, the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery, organized the groundbreaking ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian ''[[New Realism]]'', and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting [[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, [[Robert Indiana]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (''The Love Wall'' from 1961), [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Christo]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]]. The show was seen by Europeans [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Jean Tinguely]] in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were [[Marisol Escobar|Marisol]], [[Mario Schifano]], [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Öyvind Fahlström]]. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when [[Mark Rothko]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Philip Guston]] quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLgyznMrORsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=New+Realism+at+Sidney+Janis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2CQXoBBdiS&amp;sig=HBQNsOqvkZvHEEFnWhnhTls-EH4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=07IbS67CA4TBlAeTt63vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Realism%20at%20Sidney%20Janis&amp;f=false |title=Andy Warhol, Poetry, and Gossip in the 1960s |author=Reva Wolf |page=83 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: "at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt; Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York.

A bit earlier, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; [[Phillip Hefferton]] and [[Robert Dowd (artist)|Robert Dowd]] from Detroit; [[Edward Ruscha]] and [[Joe Goode]] from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortonsimon.org/about/history.aspx |title=Museum History » Norton Simon Museum |website=Nortonsimon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] exhibited ''Six Painters and the Object'', curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/360205683 |title=Six painters and the object.

The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the [[Tate Gallery]]'s ''Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayford|first=Martin|title=Still life at the check-out|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3587307/Still-life-at-the-check-out.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=2002-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The [[Ferus Gallery]] presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1963). In New York, the [[Green Gallery]] showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The [[Stable Gallery]] showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;''Pop Artists: Andy Warhol, Pop Art, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Peter Max, Erró, David Hockney, Wally Hedrick, Michael Leavitt'' (May 20, 2010) Reprinted: 2010, General Books, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, {{ISBN|978-1-155-48349-8}}, {{ISBN|1-155-48349-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the ''[[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967]]'' featured the "Who's Who" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the ''classical phase'' of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were [[Edward Hopper]], [[James Gill (artist)|James Gill]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Edwards, William Emboden, David McCarthy: ''Uncommonplaces: The Art of James Francis Gill'', 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
''[[Nouveau réalisme]]'' refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American Pop Art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the "new figurative", which arose from the roots of the crisis of [[informalism]]. [[Eduardo Arroyo]] could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both [[mass media]] communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of "pop" art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.

Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the "Chronicle Team" (''El Equipo Crónica''), which existed in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists [[Manolo Valdés]] and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as "pop" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. [[Film]]maker [[Pedro Almodóvar]] emerged from Madrid's "La Movida" subculture of the 1970s making low budget [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book ''Almodovar on Almodovar'', he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film "Funny Face" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.

==Japan==
In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent [[avant-garde]] scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by [[Harue Koga]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.&lt;ref name="eskolahk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskola|first=Jack|title=Harue Koga: David Bowie of the Early 20th Century Japanese Art Avant-garde|year=2015|publisher=Kindle, e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Yayoi Kusama]] contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2175/interview-yayoi-kusama |title=Yayoi Kusama interview – Yayoi Kusama exhibition |website=Timeout.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101110936/http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, graphic designer [[Tadanori Yokoo]] became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from [[The Beatles]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2000/?id=205 |title=Tadanori Yokoo : ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club |website=Adcglobal.org |date=1936-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another leading pop artist at that time was [[Keiichi Tanaami]]. Iconic characters from Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] have also become symbols for pop art, such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Astro Boy]]. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and his [[superflat]] movement.

==Italy==
In Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the "Scuola di Piazza del Popolo" in Rome, with pop artists such as [[Mario Schifano]], [[Franco Angeli]], [[Giosetta Fioroni]], [[Tano Festa]], [[Claudio Cintoli]], and some artworks by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Del Pezzo]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Valerio Adami]].

Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]] to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a ''non-representational genre'', despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary ''kitsch'', which turned out to be a "gold mine" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.

The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside "domestic walls" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the "new world", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including [[Gianni Ruffi]], [[Roberto Barni]], [[Silvio Pasotti]], [[Umberto Bignardi]], and [[Claudio Cintoli]], who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of "let me have fun" à la [[Aldo Palazzeschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.modena.it/galleria/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2005/pop-art-italia-1958-1968-1 |title=Pop Art Italia 1958-1968 — Galleria Civica |website=Comune.modena.it |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], pop art was represented by [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]], whose sculpture ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' was left on the moon during one of the moon missions. Internationally recognized artists such as [[Marcel Broodthaers]] ('' 'vous êtes doll? "'') and [[Panamarenko]] are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was [[George Segal]].  Another well-known artist, [[Roger Raveel]], mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the [[Vietnam War]]'s increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day.

==Netherlands==
While there was no formal pop art movement in the [[Netherlands]], there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include [[Daan van Golden]], [[Gustave Asselbergs]], [[Jacques Frenken]], [[Jan Cremer]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], and [[Woody van Amen]]. They opposed the Dutch [[petit bourgeois]] mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include ''Sex O'Clock,'' by Woody van Amen, and ''Crucifix / Target'', by Jacques Frenken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/2701/ |title=Dutch Pop Art &amp; The Sixties - Weg met de vertrutting! |website=8weekly.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
[[Russia]] was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s. Russia was a communist country at that point and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was [[Soviet]]-themed and was referred to as ''[[Sots Art]]''. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power and the Russian revolution was beginning, and with it came a freedom to express. That is when pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] with his painting titled ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' in 1990. One might argue that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canofart.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022802/http://www.canofart.com/|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called '''portrait of Paquius Proculus''' is a [[fresco]] currently preserved at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] that was found in [[Pompeii]].

The fresco depicts a pair of middle-class Pompeians, almost certainly husband and wife.  They are commonly referred to as "Paquius Proculus and his wife", due to an inscription found on the outside of the house,{{citation needed|reason=reference inscription|date=November 2018}} although a graffito inside the house later revealed the man to be Terentius Neo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/pompeii/regio-i/reg-i-ins-7/house-of-paquius-proculus | title=House of Paquius Proculus | publisher=AD79 | accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The external inscription turned out to be an election advertisement for Paquius Proculus, who had been elected [[duumviri|duovir]] some time prior to the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD|eruption]].&lt;ref name="pompeisepolta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pompeisepolta.com/paquio.htm|title=Casa di Paquio Proculo|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Pompei Sepolta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305143007/http://pompeisepolta.com/paquio.htm|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man in the fresco wears a toga, the mark of a Roman citizen, and holds a [[rotulus]], suggesting he is involved in local public and/or cultural events.  The woman holds a [[stylus]] and [[wax tablet]], emphasizing that she is educated and literate, and is managing the bakery.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA106?set_language=en|title=Paquius Proculus an wife|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222104832/http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA106?set_language=en|archive-date=2017-12-22|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is suspected, based on the physical features of the couple, that they are [[Samnites]], which may explain the desire to show off the status they have reached in Roman society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Progress Theatre was established in 1946 with the aim of presenting new and challenging work.

Its first production was staged in 1947 in Palmer Hall, West Street, Reading. It moved to its present location, The Mildmay Hall, The Mount (near [[Reading University]]) in 1951.

In 1964, after a fund raising campaign, the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building was bought. After modernisation, the theatre now seats 97 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Kenneth Branagh]], who was a member of the theatre in the late 1970s (http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/kenneth-branaghs-latest-role-progress-4211832) became Progress Theatre [[patron]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="BBCBranagh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-14261163|title=Kenneth Branagh becomes Reading Progress Theatre patron|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 July 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational role==
In the 1950s a Student Group for 14- to 18-year-olds was set up. A charitable organisation, "The Progress Theatre" was established in 1962 with the object of promoting education in performing arts in Reading and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="charity"&gt;{{Cite web

 |publisher=Charity Commission
 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2009, the Progress Youth Theatre consists of two groups for 15- to 18-year-olds and groups for school years 4 to 6 (ages 8 to 11), 7 to 8 (ages 11 to 13) and 9 to 10 (ages 13 to 15).&lt;ref name="pyt"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups give a public performance each year.&lt;ref name="pyt" /&gt;

==Present day==
The theatre has a membership of around 150 people and puts on a regular menu of classic and contemporary theatre. All of these productions are managed by volunteers.

The theatre also stages a summer open-air event, predominantly a Shakespeare play, at the historic and newly-revovated ruins of [[Reading Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/06/28/winters_tale_abbey_ruins_feature.shtml

 |publisher=[[BBC]]
 |accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These productions are managed in partnership with [[Reading Borough Council]]. In 2007, the event was expanded to form the Reading Abbey Ruins Open Air Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ongoing restoration of the abbey, in 2011 the event temporarily moved to the gardens of [[Caversham Court]], the site of a Tudor manor house on the banks of the River Thames.

==Past productions==
Progress has presented contemporary plays since its founding and the first performances in England of ''[[The Good Person of Sezuan|The Good Woman of Setzuan]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' by [[Seán O'Casey]] were produced at the theatre&lt;ref name="branagh"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Rushnyk, Rushnik''' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:рушник|рушник]]}}, {{lang-be|[[:be:ручнік|ручнік]], ručnik}}, {{lang-ru|рушник, ручник}}) is a ritual cloth embroidered with symbols and [[cryptogram]]s of the ancient world. They have been used in sacred [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] rituals, religious services and ceremonial events such as weddings and funerals. Each region has its own designs and patterns with hidden meaning, passed down from generation to generation and studied by [[ethnographers]]. 

There are many rushnyk collections in ethnographic museums. In Ukraine, the Rushnyk Museum is located in [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi]], [[Ukraine]] as part of The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central [[Naddnipryanshchyna]].  A Russian rushnyk collection is housed at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

== Meaning ==
[[File:Белгородские рушники.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|[[Belgorod Oblast|Belgorod]] rushniks, [[Central Russia]]]]
The rectangular shape of the fabric indicates a life's journey and the ornamentation captures the cultural [[ancestral memory]] of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrainianmuseumdetroit.org/textiles/rushnyky.html Rushnyky: Ukrainian Ritual Cloths]&lt;/ref&gt; The material used is either [[linen]] or [[hemp]]. The act of spinning thread and the process of weaving linen embodies spiritual power dating back to the ancient [[deity]] [[Mokosh]] who is often represented in embroidery. The needle has its own energy, an idea similar to [[acupuncture]], and the color of the thread has [[sacred]] meaning. Red represents life and is the main color used. A rushnyk is given to a baby at birth, it follows the person throughout life and used in the funeral service after death.

== Uses ==
[[File:Flag of Belarus.svg|thumb|''Ručnik'' pattern on the [[flag of Belarus]]]]
A Rushnyk has many uses. The very basic rushnik is colloquially called the ''utyralnyk'' or wiper and serves as a [[towel]]. The utyralnyk either has no designs on it or it has very narrow strip on the edges. In contrast, a ''nabozhnyk'' is a highly decorated Rushnyk composing of [[embroidery]] and of [[lace]]. ''Nabozhnyks'', also called ''nabraznyks'' or ''nakutnyks'' are used to decorate [[icons]] and [[icon corner]]s in homes. 

== Wedding rushnyks ==
[[File:Large_1_441.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Rushnyk]]
Colour plays a very important symbolic role in traditional Slavic [[embroidery]]. Red is the colour of life, the [[sun]], fertility and [[health]]. The majority of rushnyks are embroidered with red threads. The very word "red" means "beautiful" and "splendid" in [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]]: a red girl, a red sun or a red spring. The phrase ''Krasnaya devitsa'' in Old Russian language for example is an old idiomatic expression which means beautiful girl, the word ''Krasnaya'' translates in Russian language also into red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2017/01/red.html|title=Is red beautiful?|date=2017-01-02|work=Grammarphobia|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diamond-shaped design of the rushnyk is an ancient agricultural symbol, which means a sown field, or the sun, and expresses the idea of fertility and protection against evil. [[Duck]]s, in the centre of the rushnyk, symbolize the element of life-giving water. In wedding [[folklore]] a duck and a drake symbolize a bride and a groom, in other words a pair of ducks is a symbol of family life.

During a wedding ceremony, the [[bride]] and [[Bridegroom|groom]] are standing on a Rushnyk called a ''pidnozhnyk,'' which translates as step-on towel. What happens to the pidnozhnyk is that the bride will drag the towel behind her, and her [[bridesmaid]]s follow behind her. Tradition has it that when the bridesmaids follow behind the pidnozhnyk, they are following the path of the bride and hopefully be married.

==Etymology==
The words are created with the common suffix "[[-nik|-nyk]]" ("-nik") that indicates a general association of the new word with the base one.

*Rushnyk: from ''ruka'', [[hand]]
*Na-: a prefix meaning "on", i.e., the thing is supposed to be put onto something
**Nabozhnyk: from ''Boh'', [[God]]
**Naobraznyk: from ''obraz'', literally "[[image]]", meaning "God's image", i.e., [[icon]]
**Nakutnyk: from ''kut'', [[Corner angle|corner]], meaning the corner where an icon is hung (by East Slavic traditions).
*Pidnozhnyk: from  ''pid-''= under and ''nohy'' = feet

[[File:Snow Globe girl.jpg|thumb|A girl holding a snow globe]]
A '''snow globe''' (also called a '''waterglobe''', '''snowstorm''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=snow-storm, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183531|website=OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=28 August 2014}} (subscription required for online version)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''snowdome''') is a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] sphere, traditionally made of glass, enclosing a miniaturized scene of some sort, often together with a model of a town, landscape or figure. The sphere also encloses the water in the globe; the water serves as the medium through which the "snow" falls. To activate the snow, the globe is shaken to churn up the white particles. The globe is then placed back in its position and the flakes fall down slowly through the water. Snow globes sometimes have a built-in [[music box]] that plays a song. Some snow globes  have a design around the outerbase for decoration.

== History ==
When exactly the first snow globes became well-known remains uncertain, but the popularity seemingly dates to the early 19th century in [[France]]. They may have appeared for glass blowers as adjuncts to [[paperweight]], which had become popular a few years earlier. Snow globes were exhibited at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1878|Paris Universal Expo of 1878]], and by 1879 at least five or more companies were producing and selling snow globes throughout [[Europe]].

In 1889, a snow globe containing a model of the newly built [[Eiffel Tower]] was produced to commemorate the [[International exposition|International Exposition]] in [[Paris]], which marked the centenary of the [[French Revolution]]. Snow globes became popular in [[England]] during the [[Victorian era]] and, in the early 1920s, crossed the Atlantic to the [[United States of America]] where they became a popular [[collectors item]]. Many of these globes were produced by [[Atlas Crystal Works]], which had factories in [[Germany]] and America.

At the end of the 19th century the Austrian Erwin Perzy, a producer of surgical instruments, invented the so-called ''Schneekugel'' (snow globe) and got the first patent for it. Originally his goal was to develop an extra bright lightsource for use as a [[surgical lamp]]. As he tried to intensify the candlepower of a so-called ''Schusterkugel'' (a water filled flask used to focus light since the Middle Ages) with particles made out of different materials for reflection purpose,
the effect reminded him of snowfall and it's said that by this he got the idea for a snow globe. He then built his first actual globe with the basilica of [[Mariazell]] as a model in it. Because of the great request for his snow globes, Perzy, along with his brother Ludwig opened a shop in [[Vienna]], where the production continues until today as a family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The family company that invented the snow globe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25298507|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://volksgruppen.orf.at/radio1476/stories/59668/ a unicum from vienna] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731114549/http://volksgruppen.orf.at/radio1476/stories/59668/ |date=2012-07-31 }} broadcast on [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]-Volksgruppen from 8. December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Today the globes get exported throughout the world; the material out of which the "snow" is made is handed down from generation to generation as a production secret (it should float as long as possible in the water before sinking down).

In the United States, the first snow globe-related patent was granted in 1927 to Joseph Garaja of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1929, Garaja convinced Novelty Pool Ornaments to manufacture a fish version underwater.

In America, during the 1940s, snow globes were often used for advertising. In Europe, during the 1940s and 1950s, religious snow globes were common gifts for [[Catholic]] children. Snow globes have appeared in a number of film scenes, the most famous of which is the opening of the 1941 classic ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.
[[File:Australian Souvenir Snow Globes.jpg|thumb|Plastic Australian Souvenir Snow Globes.]]
In the 1950s, the globes, which were previously made of glass, became available in plastic. Currently, there are many different types of snow globes available. These globes are produced by a number of countries and range from the mass-produced versions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[China]] to the finely crafted types still produced in [[Austria]]. Snow globes feature diverse scenes, ranging from the typical holiday souvenirs to more eclectic collectibles featuring [[Christmas]] scenes, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, popular icons, animals, military figures, historical scenes, etc. Snow globes have even been used for election campaigns. Since 2000 fashion and luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Ladurée, Sonia Rykiel, or Martin Margiela, got hold of the trend and grew particularly fond of snow globes as collectible totems and emblems of their brand image. Such enthusiasm was reinforced by presence in numerous art collections of contemporary artists  Walter Martin &amp; Paloma Muñoz (also known as [[Martin &amp; Muñoz]]) who use snow globes as a medium, or museums who paid tribute to famous artists such as French sculptor Auguste Rodin in creating high quality numbered glass dome snow globes.
&lt;!-- A history of snowdomes can be found in "Snowdomes" by Nancy McMichael. This book provided much of the material in this entry. --&gt;

== Contents ==

Initially snow globes consisted of a heavy [[lead glass]] dome which was placed over a [[ceramic]] figure or tableau on a black cast ceramic base, filled with water and then sealed. The snow or "flitter" was created by use of bone chips or pieces of [[porcelain]], sand or even sawdust. As they became more sophisticated, the glass became thinner, the bases were lighter ([[Bakelite]] was popular during the Art Deco period) and the snow was made out of particles of gold foil or non-soluble soap flakes. For health and safety reasons, white plastic has become more common in the construction of modern snow globes. The liquid has evolved to light oil and then a mixture of water and [[antifreeze]] (glycerin or glycol). An added benefit was that glycerin and glycol slowed the descent of the snow. Caution should be taken if a snow globe is broken because the liquid, which can contain antifreeze, can be deadly to cats and dogs if ingested or licked off their fur.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/2011/02/antifreeze-poisoning-in-dogs-cats-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embellishments==
Today's snow globes can include music boxes, moving parts, internal lights, and even electric motors that make the "snow" move so that it is no longer necessary to shake the globe. Some also have central slots for positioning items such as photographs.

==Forced-air globes==
In 2005, many U.S. stores started to sell inflatable snow globes as part of their Christmas décor. These have a base with a blower, forcing air which carries [[polystyrene]] pellets from the bottom and through a tube up the back to the top, where they are blown out and fall down inside the front, which is made of transparent vinyl. The rest of the globe, including the characters inside, are made of colorful [[nylon]] fabric. These globes are typically large decorations for the front yard, and are lighted internally with a few C7 ([[nightlight]]-type) [[incandescent light bulb]]s (which are enclosed in plastic spheres to prevent heat damage to the fabric).

A variation on this is the "tornado globe", where small foam objects spin around inside a globe. This is more common for [[Halloween]], where foam bats or sometimes ghosts may fly around the Halloween figures in the middle. These were most common in 2006, and come in both large inflatables, and smaller tabletop versions with rigid plastic globes about 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches or 20 to 30 centimeters in diameter. As with the snow globes, [[static cling]] often causes the foam to stick to the plastic (especially vinyl) when humidity is low, while condensation will do the same thing on outdoor inflatables when humidity is high, or rainwater has seeped in while it is deflated.

==Cultural references==
In modern culture, snow globes often symbolize childhood, innocence, or so-called "happy days". However, they are also sometimes used, with dark humor, to evoke more gruesome scenes.

===Film ===
* The film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) starts with Charles Foster Kane in a bed holding a snow globe, uttering, "Rosebud ..."; the globe slips from his dying hand and smashes. The film historian Paul Malcolm noted the scattered content of the snow globe parallels the scattered or "dispersed" story of Kane to come in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clayton, Alex  |author2=Klevan, Andrew |lastauthoramp=yes |title=  The Language and Style of Film Criticism|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|date= 2011| page= 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The special edition VHS release of ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996) included a snow globe which, when shaken, stirred up both snow and "blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/movies/summer-films-synergy-a-few-words-in-defense-of-swag.html|title=Summer Films: Synergy, A Few Words in Defense of Swag|date=May 2, 1999|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'' (2002), Edward Sumner ([[Richard Gere]]) uses the snow globe he gave as a present to his wife Connie ([[Diane Lane]]) as a weapon to kill her lover Paul Martel ([[Olivier Martinez]]).
* The film ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', based on a novel by [[Neil Gaiman]], had the child Coraline's parents being imprisoned in a souvenir snow globe of the [[Detroit Zoo]].
* [[Pixar]]'s early [[short film]] ''[[Knick Knack]]'' (1989) is about a snow globe snowman trying to break out of his globe.

===Publications===
* In [[Libba Bray]]'s book ''[[Going Bovine]]'' (2009), snow globes are used periodically as metaphors for the constraints of reality and life as we know it. At the end of the book, the main characters smash them, claiming that they are "freeing the snow globes".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
*In [[Erica Rand]]'s ''The Ellis Island Snow Globe'' (2005), a snow globe from the [[Ellis Island]] gift shop is one of the objects that "demonstrate how some narratives are promoted while others are repressed to represent a particular version of United States history and citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|year=2006|title=Rev. of Rand, ''The Ellis Island Snow Globe''|journal=[[Journal of American Ethnic History]]|volume=26|issue=1|pages=96–97|jstor=27501787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sendzikas|first=Aldona|year=2006|title=Rev. of Rand, ''The Ellis Island Snow Globe''|journal=[[Australasian Journal of American Studies]]|volume=25|issue=2|pages=122–24|jstor=41054040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* The series finale of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' famously ends with the implication that the events of the whole series were nothing more than a mere fantasy imagined by Tommy Westphall, an autistic boy whose most treasured possession is a snow globe containing a small model of a building resembling the hospital in which the series is set.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*In [[Sons of Anarchy (season 5)|''Sons of Anarchy'', Season 5, Episode 6]] ("Small World"), [[Jax Teller|Jax]] forms an alliance with [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Damon Pope|Damon Pope]] and détente among [[SAMCRO]], "black" (the One-Niners), "brown" (the Mayans), and "yellow" (the Triad). Jax then tasks [[Tig Trager|Tig]] with finding a pipe with which to kill the prison guard who had facilitated the fatal beating by other prisoners of Jax's childhood friend [[Opie Winston|Opie]], at Stockton, and who had said the guards were betting on how long it would take Opie to die. Tig can't find a pipe, and instead hands Jax a hammer and a musical "[[It's a Small World]]" snow globe. Jax  chooses the globe and winds it up; he, Tig, and [[Chibs Telford|Chibs]] slowly circle round the guard as in the ride, [[Ring a Ring o' Roses]], and then Jax beats the guard to death with the globe, all while the globe tinkles the song "[[It's a Small World (After All)]]".
* In 2014, in the final seconds of the last episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', a snow globe is shown on his bedside table, accompanied by [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s song "[[Don't Stop Believin']]". The custom snow globe used was specially created for the CBS production, including the host's likeness in the middle, with his sidekicks Geoff the robot skeleton and Secretariat the pantomime horse.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Image:Silk picture of the London and York royal mail coach.JPG|thumb|Stevengraph showing the London and York Royal Mail Coach, [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]].]] '''Stevengraphs''' are pictures woven from [[silk]], originally created by [[Thomas Steven (weaver)|Thomas Stevens]] in the 19th century. They were popular collectable items during the revival of interest in [[Victoriana]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt; Thorncroft, Antony. ''Memories are made of this'' FT.com 29 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==
[[File:Thomas Stevens HAGAM.tif|thumb|Thomas Stevens senior]]In the mid-19th century the town of [[Coventry]], [[England]], was the centre of a [[ribbon]] weaving industry. In 1860 the [[Cobden–Chevalier Treaty]] was signed; this [[free trade]] treaty introduced new competition into the industry, leading to a collapse in the local economy.

Thomas Stevens, a local weaver, responded by adapting the [[Jacquard loom]]s used in Coventry to weave colourful pictures from silk. By 1862, Stevens could produce four different designs and by the late 1880s this had to over 900; they became known as "Stevengraphs", after their maker. Many of these designs were used to produce [[bookmark]]s, while others were used to make [[greeting card]]s and other silk objects.&lt;ref name=Association1&gt;''[http://www.stevengraphcollectors.com/page2.htm Stevengraphs - What are they?]'', Stevengraph Collectors Association, accessed 4 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, Stevengraphs were considered collectable items, but the hobby was considered eccentric and mainly confined to female collectors. During the [[Second World War]] Coventry was attacked by [[Germany|German]] bombers; on 14 November 1940 the [[Coventry Blitz]] occurred, destroying the Stevens factory and apparently all records of the Stevengraphs.

In the late 1950s it emerged that Henry Stephens, a descendent of Thomas, had saved one of the pattern books the night before the attack and kept it in safe storage; Henry donated it to the [[Coventry City Council]], who in turn entrusted it with the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]]. Stevengraphs became valuable, with more male collectors entering the hobby.&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, pp.68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Prices rose, particularly for unusual or rarer images less popular during the Victorian period.&lt;ref name=Association1/&gt;

Stevengraphs normally measured 140mm x 64mm (5½ x 2½ inch) and were often mounted on cardboard. A printed label on the reverse would indicate that the design was registered and could not be copied. Several other Coventry firms also produced silk-work pictures including ''W H Grant'' and ''Welch &amp; Lambton''.&lt;ref&gt;Godden (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sumgayit State Musical Drama Theater''' is a professional theater operating in [[Sumgayit]]. It is named after [[Huseyn Arablinski]].

==History==

The Sumgayit State Drama Theater, named after the [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] theater figure and director Huseyn Arablinski, was created in September 1968. In 1969, the Azerbaijani government made a decision to perpetuate the memory of [[Huseyn Arablinski]] by naming the theater after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.az/down/he_serencamlar.pdf Decision 1969 about perpetuating the memory of Huseyn Arablinski] www.anl.az&lt;/ref&gt; This was enacted as a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR and by the order of the Ministry of Culture.

The theater opened its curtain on March 14, 1969 with [[Mirza Fatali Akhundzadeh]]'s "Monsieur Jordan, the Botanist, and Dervish Mastali-shah", directed by Jannat Salimova. On the following day, the British poet [[John Patrick (poet)|John Patrick]]'s work was performed, produced by Nasir Sadigzade. 
In 1974 the theater was given the status of "Sumgayit State Drama Theater" by the decision of the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name=OfficialSite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sumqayitdram.az/teatrin-tarixi/ |title=Sumqayıt Dövlət Dram Teatrı |website=sumqayitdram.az |language=az |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094302/http://sumqayitdram.az/teatrin-tarixi/ |archivedate=April 29, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repertoire==
The repertoire of the theater includes the plays of classic and contemporary [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]], Russian and foreign playwrights.&lt;ref name=OfficialSite/&gt;

[[File:Tetrahedral group 2.svg|thumb|right|300px|A [[tetrahedron]] is invariant under 12 distinct [[rotation]]s, reflections excluded. These are illustrated here in the [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle graph]] format, along with the 180° edge (blue arrows) and 120° vertex (reddish arrows) [[rotation]]s that [[permutation|permute]] the tetrahedron through the positions. The 12 rotations form the '''rotation (symmetry) group''' of the figure.]]

In [[group theory]], the '''symmetry group''' of an object ([[image]], [[Signal (information theory)|signal]], etc.) is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]]s under which the object is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] with [[Function composition|composition]] as the group operation. For a space with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of the space concerned. If not stated otherwise, this article considers [[symmetry]] groups in [[Euclidean geometry]], but the concept may also be studied in more general contexts as expanded below.

==Introduction==
The "objects" may be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern, e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also want to take their physical composition into account. The group of isometries of space induces a [[group action]] on objects in it.

The symmetry group is sometimes also called '''full symmetry group''' in order to emphasize that it includes the orientation-reversing isometries (like reflections, [[glide reflection]]s and [[improper rotation]]s) under which the figure is invariant. The [[subgroup]] of orientation-preserving isometries (i.e. translations, rotations, and compositions of these) that leave the figure invariant is called its '''proper symmetry group'''.  The proper symmetry group of an object is equal to its full symmetry group [[if and only if]] the object is [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] (and thus there are no [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-reversing isometries under which it is invariant).

Any symmetry group whose elements have a common [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], which is true for all finite symmetry groups and also for the symmetry groups of bounded figures, can be represented as a [[subgroup]] of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(''n''), and is therefore also called '''rotation group''' of the figure.

A '''discrete symmetry group''' is a symmetry group such that for every point of the space the set of images of the point under the isometries in the symmetry group is a [[discrete set]]. The number of elements in the group may be either finite or infinite.

Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite '''[[point groups]]''', which include only rotations, reflections, inversion and rotoinversion – they are just the finite subgroups of O(''n''), (2) infinite '''[[Lattice (group)|lattice]] groups''', which include only translations, and (3) infinite '''[[space groups]]''' which combines elements of both previous types, and may also include extra transformations like [[screw displacement]]s and [[glide reflection]]s. There are also ''continuous'' symmetry groups, which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances.  The group of all symmetries of a sphere [[orthogonal group|O(3)]] is an example of this, and in general such [[continuous symmetry]] groups are studied as [[Lie group]]s. With a  [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|categorization of subgroups of the Euclidean group]] corresponds a categorization of symmetry groups.

Two geometric figures are considered to be of the same symmetry type if their symmetry groups are conjugate subgroups of the [[Euclidean group]] E(''n'') (the isometry group of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), where two subgroups ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a group ''G'' are ''[[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugate]]'', if there exists {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''}}. For example:
*two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes.
*two 3D figures have 3-fold [[rotational symmetry]], but with respect to different axes.
*two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction.

When considering isometry groups, one may restrict oneself to those where for all points the set of images under the isometries is [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]]. This includes all discrete isometry groups and also those involved in continuous symmetries, but excludes for example in 1D the group of translations by a rational number. A "figure" with this symmetry group is non-drawable and up to arbitrarily fine detail homogeneous, without being really homogeneous.

==One dimension==
The isometry groups in one dimension where for all points the set of images under the isometries is [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]] are:
*the trivial group C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
*the groups of two elements generated by a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with Z, the additive group of the integers
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of Z,  Dih(Z), also denoted by D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a [[semidirect product]] of Z and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). 
*the group generated by all translations (isomorphic with the additive group of the real numbers '''R'''); this group cannot be the symmetry group of a "pattern": it would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a uniform one-dimensional vector field has this symmetry group.
*the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of '''R''',  Dih('''R''').

See also [[symmetry groups in one dimension]].

==Two dimensions==

[[Up to]] conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:

*[[cyclic group]]s C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... where C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/''n''
*[[dihedral group]]s D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Dihedral group of order 6|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Examples of groups#A symmetry group|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], ..., where D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (of order 2''n'') consists of the rotations in C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; together with reflections in ''n'' axes that pass through the fixed point.

C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[trivial group]] containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure has no symmetry at all, for example the letter '''F'''. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetry group of the letter '''Z''', C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that of a [[triskelion]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a [[swastika]], and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.

D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of [[reflection symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], for example the letter '''A'''.

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]], is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.

D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; etc. are the symmetry groups of the [[regular polygon]]s.

The actual symmetry groups in each of these cases have two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.

The remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are:
*the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called  the [[circle group]] S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the multiplicative group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1. It is the ''proper'' symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no geometric figure that has as ''full'' symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply (see the three-dimensional case below). 
*the orthogonal group O(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called Dih(S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as it is the [[dihedral group|generalized dihedral group]] of S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

For non-bounded figures, the additional isometry groups can include translations; the closed ones are:
*the 7 [[frieze group]]s 
*the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s
*for each of the symmetry groups in one dimension, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction
*ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction.

==Three dimensions==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bipyramid]] --&gt;
{{see also|Point groups in three dimensions}}

[[Up to]] conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 separate ones. In crystallography they are restricted to be compatible with the discrete translation symmetries of a crystal lattice. This [[crystallographic restriction theorem|crystallographic restriction]] of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 from the 7 infinite series, and 5 of the 7 others).

The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:
*cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis, this applies for example often for a [[bottle]]
*cylindrical symmetry with a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis
*spherical symmetry

For objects and [[scalar field]]s the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical planes of reflection. However, for [[vector field]]s it does not: in [[cylindrical coordinates]] with respect to some axis,  
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_\rho\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\phi\boldsymbol{\hat \phi} + A_z\boldsymbol{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt; has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A_\rho, A_\phi,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A_z&lt;/math&gt; have this symmetry, i.e., they do not depend on &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally there is reflectional symmetry if and only if &lt;math&gt;A_\phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For spherical symmetry there is no such distinction, it implies planes of reflection.

The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a [[screw axis]], such as an infinite [[helix]]. See also [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|subgroups of the Euclidean group]].

==Symmetry groups in general==
{{see also|Automorphism}}
In wider contexts, a '''symmetry group''' may be any kind of '''transformation group''', or [[automorphism]] group. Once we know what kind of [[mathematical structure]] we are concerned with, we should be able to pinpoint what [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry can define the structure, or at least clarify what we mean by an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], geometric language in which to discuss it; this is one way of looking at the [[Erlangen programme]].

For example, automorphism groups of certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]] are not "symmetry groups" in the usual sense, although they preserve symmetry.  They do this by preserving ''families'' of point-sets rather than point-sets (or "objects") themselves.

Like above, the group of automorphisms of space induces a [[group action]] on objects in it.

For a given geometric figure in a given geometric space, consider the following equivalence relation: two automorphisms of space are equivalent [[if and only if]] the two images of the figure are the same (here "the same" does not mean something like e.g. "the same up to translation and rotation", but it means "exactly the same"). Then the equivalence class of the identity is the symmetry group of the figure, and every equivalence class corresponds to one isomorphic version of the figure.

There is a bijection between every pair of equivalence classes: the inverse of a representative of the first equivalence class, composed with a representative of the second.

In the case of a finite automorphism group of the whole space, its order is the order of the symmetry group of the figure multiplied by the number of isomorphic versions of the figure.

Examples:
*Isometries of the Euclidean plane, the figure is a rectangle: there are infinitely many equivalence classes; each contains 4 isometries.
*The space is a [[cube]] with Euclidean metric; the figures include cubes of the same size as the space, with colors or patterns on the faces; the automorphisms of the space are the 48 isometries; the figure is a cube of which one face has a different color; the figure has a symmetry group of 8 isometries, there are 6 equivalence classes of 8 isometries, for 6 isomorphic versions of the figure.

Compare [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)]] and its proof.

The '''''Durham Proverbs''''' is a collection of 46 mediaeval proverbs from various sources.  They were written down as a collection, in the eleventh century, on some pages (pages 43 [[recto and verso|verso]] to 45 verso, between a [[hymnal]] and a collection of [[canticle]]s) of a manuscript that were originally left blank.  The manuscript is currently in the collection of [[Durham Cathedral]], to which it was donated in the eighteenth century.  The ''Proverbs'' form the first part of the manuscript.  The second part, to which it is bound, is a copy of [[Ælfric]]'s ''Grammar'' (minus its glossary).{{sfn|Milfull|1996|pp=34}}{{sfn|Hollis|Wright|1992|pp=34}}{{sfn|Springer|1995|pp=129}}  Each proverb is written in both [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Old English language|Old English]], with the former preceding the latter.{{sfn|Hollis|Wright|1992|pp=35}}  Olof Arngart's opinion is that the Proverbs were originally in Old English and translated to Latin, but this has since been disputed in a conference paper by [[T. A. Shippey]] {{harv|Shippey|1989}}.{{sfn|Milfull|1996|pp=34}}

==Origin==
While Richard Marsden's introduction in ''The Cambridge Old English Reader'' discusses the essentials of the Durham Proverbs, there is still more to be learned.{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}} The Durham Proverbs are held in a manuscript that is kept in the library of Durham Cathedral, which is why they are named the "Durham" Proverbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302}}  The original home of the manuscript is thought most likely to have been in [[Canterbury]].{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=288}} The original manuscript of the Durham Proverbs contains copies of [[Ælfric]]'s own work.{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=288}}{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302}}  Several of the proverbs also appear in later works of the thirteenth-century. Considering the repetition of their use, during later times and in future works, stresses their importance from the eleventh-century society. For every one of the Durham Proverbs, there is a Latin version. The commonalities between the Latin version of the proverbs and the Old English version, in more than one manuscript, suggest that there was a common source from which the Durham Proverbs were created in Old English from Latin.{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=289&amp;ndash;290}}

==Background and history==
The Durham Proverbs are considered to have been used to document everyday business of the people of Anglo-Saxon England. The proverbs were used in monastic schools to teach text along with other manuscripts such as the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' (also known as the "Dicts of Cato") and a Middle English collection titled the [[Proverbs of Hendyng]]. Several of the proverbs have parallels within other proverbs listed below, as well as the Old English Disticha Catonis and the Proverbs of Hendyng. Despite their use, the source of these proverbs is largely debated and still considered unknown.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Olof Arngart's notes on the Durham Proverbs say that some of the proverbs have a biblical reference. The book of Proverbs in the Bible resembles the Durham Proverbs by providing teachings on morals for a society of its time. The "Dicts of Cato" were also influenced by the Durham Proverbs, which in turn, influenced Christianity.{{sfn|Treharne|2003|pp=470&amp;ndash;471}}  The first of the Durham Proverbs can even be seen in the Dict of Cato 23.{{sfn|Treharne|2003|pp=468}}

==Purpose==
The Durham Proverbs comprise a mixture of true proverbs and maxims, and are clearer in this regard, according to linguist and Anglo-Saxon anthropologist Nigel Barley {{harv|Barley|1972}}, than the collection of Old English poems entitled the ''[[Maxims (Old English poems)|Maxims]]'' are &amp;mdash; the latter's status being comparatively unclear.{{sfn|Poole|1998|pp=207}} According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'' a maxim is a short statement that (as Laingui puts it) "sets out a general principle", that briefly expounds a liturgical, legal, moral, or political rule as a short [[mnemonic]] device.{{sfn|Laingui|1997|pp=929}}  The Durham Proverbs are called proverbs because the collection has what Marsden calls "transferability" to man.{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}}

The Durham Proverbs are not as serious as some of the Old English maxims and can even be considered humorous in some areas. The proverbs are similar to fables or parables seen in Modern English. Each proverb has a lesson to teach, as do the fables and parables. It is important to note the proverbs' resemblance to Old English poetry. Using alliteration and rhythm, the proverbs show some of the earliest uses of words and phrases, such as "cwæþ se (þe)" which translates to "quoth he who", and is later seen in more Middle English sources.{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=289}}   In addition to their importance of gaining knowledge of the Old English history, the proverbs include many words that are not seen anywhere else in Old English writings. Arngart suggests that the study of the proverbs "furnishes insights into contemporary folklore and social life".{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=290}}

==The proverbs themselves==
The proverbs have their roots in [[gnomic poetry]], and show a relationship in some places to the ''Disticha Catonis'' and other works of the surviving Anglo-Saxon corpus.  The Old English versions are sometimes (but not always) alliterative, or in verse form, and employ the same formulae with "[[wikt:sceal#Old English|sceal]]" and "[[wikt:byþ#Old English|byþ]]" as other works do.  However, they have a distinctive flavour of their own, one outstanding characteristic of which is the humorous expression that they embody (as in number 11, for example) &amp;mdash; a quality that is lacking in the gnomes.{{sfn|Greenfield|Calder|Lapidge|1996|pp=100}}{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}  A yet more distinctive feature is how often the proverbs echo the verse of other works, such as the echo of ''[[The Wanderer (poem)|The Wanderer]]'' in number 23.{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}

Below are the first 25 Durham Proverbs:

'''Weser Renaissance''' is a form of [[Renaissance (architecture)|Renaissance]] architectural style that is found in the area around the River [[Weser]] in central [[Germany]] and which has been well preserved in the towns and cities of the region.

== Background ==

Between the start of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Thirty Years War]] the Weser region experienced a construction boom, in which the Weser, playing a significant role in the communication of both trade and ideas, merely defined the north-south extent of a cultural region that stretched westwards to the city of [[Osnabrück]] and eastwards as far as [[Wolfsburg]]. Castles, manor houses, town halls, residential dwellings and religious buildings of the Renaissance period have been preserved in unusually high density, because the economy of the region recovered only slowly from the consequences of the Thirty Years War and the means were not available for a [[baroque]] transformation such as that which occurred to a degree in South Germany.

== Origin of the term ==

The term, coined around 1912 by Richard Klapheck, suggested that the Renaissance along the Weser independently developed its own distinct style. Max Sonnen, who used the newly coined term in 1918 in his book ''Die Weserrenaissance'', classified buildings, without regard for the circumstances of their historical background, but from a purely formal perspective in order to derive a history of the development of the style. The notion of a regional renaissance in the sense of an autonomous cultural phenomenon was based on a nationalistic mindset that had arisen since the end of the 19th century, in which things provincial also had their place in establishing identity (other examples include German [[Sondergotik]], Rhenish or Saxon [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architecture).&lt;ref&gt;Sonnen (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1964 Jürgen Soenke and the photographer, Herbert Kreft, presented an inventory of Renaissance buildings, which also went under the title of ''Die Weserrenaissance''. In its closing remarks it said: ''This architecture is rooted in the landscape in which it stands. It is folksy because those who created it […] came from the people. The Weser Renaissance is, simply, folk art.'' For Soenke an [[wiktionary:autochthon|autochthonous]] (indigenous) evolution of architectural style lay hidden behind its common features. His work, that appeared in six editions up to 1986, helped to give this art-historical concept a level of popularity that went far beyond the realm of the specialist and became a kind of popular trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Kreft and Soenke (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Weser Renaissance gained international recognition thanks to Henry-Russel Hitchcock, who used it in his ''German Renaissance Architecture'' of 1981, although he stressed its distinctive regional features rather less and pointed out its more significant linkages with the overall historical development of Renaissance architecture. In more recent times the idea of a regional cultural identity, that did not exist in the [[Early Modern Period]], was criticised in research by the [[Weser Renaissance Museum]] at Brake Castle, which had been founded in 1986. This research highlighted the carriers of cultural transference, such as the architectural drawing business, non-local architects, pan-regional builders and the obligatory, Europe-wide requirements of court fashion.

== History ==

The hallmark of aristocratic building activity in the 16th century was the transformation of a medieval castle, the ''Burg'', into a royal residence or ''Schloss''. Initially these were often built with two wings, but later the enclosed courtyard, with its wings joined in the corners by imposing towers with flights of stairs, became the preferred layout for the homes of the aristocracy in the Weser region during the course of the 16th century, a form of building that was soon also adopted by its lesser noblemen. The characteristic ''Zwerchhaus'' ([[Middle High German]]: ''twerh'' = ''quer'' i.e. across or lateral) with so-called ''welsch'' (i.e. Italian) gables was particularly well suited as a symbol of power, because on castles like those at [[Detmold]], [[Celle Castle|Celle]] or [[Bückeburg]], which were surrounded by high ramparts, they could be seen from a long way off. In addition to four-sided castles, there were also castles with three wings, either geometrically fully enclosed, like the [[Wewelsburg]], or opening onto the castle farmyard as at [[Schwöbber]]. Even double-winged and single-winged buildings were included in the repertoire of castle architecture along the Weser.

These aristocratic designs were not only embraced by the lesser nobles; middle-class builders also copied the new forms of building in order to show off their growing social influence. Town halls, like those in [[Celle]] and [[Lemgo]], were designed with gables along the sides and sometimes faced with an entire renaissance façade, as occurred in Bremen. From [[Nienburg/Weser|Nienburg]], to [[Minden]], [[Hamelin]] and [[Höxter]], [[Hannoversch Münden]] and [[Einbeck]] magnificent townhouses appeared, that were often distinguished by their great gateway into the inner hall. Other important architectural features of the Weser Renaissance style are the ornately decorated gables, the use so-called ''Bossenquader'' or [[bossage]] stone, the alcoves (''Standerker'', ''Ausluchten'' or ''Utluchten'') and double windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weserbergland.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=60 ''Die Weserrenaissance'' at www.weserbergland.com, accessed on 16 Sep 09.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Church builders were also eager to explore new architectural designs. By elevating the position of the pulpit and placing it immediately opposite to and facing the pews, the importance of the spoken word within the Christian faith was also visible from the layout of the church interior. The castle chapels of [[Celle]] and [[Bückeburg]] are also clear examples of this arrangement as are the important parish churches of [[Wolfenbüttel]] and Bückeburg. Protestant art experienced a high point in the Weser region under the Schaumburg prince, Ernest, who at the beginning of the 17th century, had the [[Mausoleum of Prince Ernst|Stadthagen Mausoleum]] and tomb built by [[Adriaen de Vries]], which recalled the Florentine Renaissance. At the same time the goldsmith, [[Anton Eisenhoit]] created the altar decorations for the Catholic prince-bishop, Dietrich von Fürstenberg, and the sculptor Heinrich Gröninger, whose monumental tomb lies in [[Paderborn Cathedral]].

'''''Yoni Ki Baat''''' (roughly translated from [[Hindi]] as "Talks of the Vagina," and sometimes abbreviated '''''YKB&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;''''') is a project featuring the live performance of monologues by women of [[South Asian diaspora|South Asian origin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasiansisters.org/|title=South Asian Sisters|author=|date=|work=southasiansisters.org|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; loosely inspired by [[Eve Ensler|Eve Ensler's]] ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sapnamagazine.com/2005/our-vaginas-have-monolugues-too-breaking-the-silence-one-yoni-at-a-time/|title=Our Vaginas Have Monolugues, Too: Breaking the Silence, One Yoni at a Time|author=|first=|date=|work=Sapna Magazine: South Asian American Women|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503033334/http://sapnamagazine.com/2005/our-vaginas-have-monolugues-too-breaking-the-silence-one-yoni-at-a-time/|archive-date=2016-05-03|dead-url=|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Yoni_Ki_Baat:_South_Asian_Queer_and_Feminist_Organizing|title=Yoni Ki Baat: South Asian Queer and Feminist Organizing|last=Bharat|first=Omsri|date=2015|website=FoundSF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces can be performed by the writer, or by another performer, sometimes anonymously.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makker|first=Vandana|date=May 29, 2004|title=If My Vagina Could Speak...|url=http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/articles/157|journal=SAMAR|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch, ''YKB'' has been continuously performed across the United States.

''Yoni Ki Baat'' was developed in 2003 by South Asian Sisters, a non-profit collective of South Asian women based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=7417|title=South Asian Women in America Talk Sex, Break Myths  by Vandana Makker|author=|first=|date=|work=Boloji|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723213231/http://cms.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&amp;sd=Articles&amp;ArticleID=7417|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founders Maulie Dass, Sapna Shahani, and Vandana Makker sent out a call in February 2003, and described receiving an outpouring of submissions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theaerogram.com/yoni-ki-baat-vagina-monologues-inspired-celebration-south-asian-women/|title=‘Yoni Ki Baat’: A ‘Vagina Monologues’-Inspired Celebration of South Asian Women|last=Luhar|first=Monica|date=2014-03-17|work=The Aerogram|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=120306062833|title=‘Yoni Ki Baat’ Spotlights Desi Diaspora Women's Sexuality|last=Assisi|first=Francis C.|date=2007-01-02|website=IndoLink|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102142008/http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=120306062833|archive-date=2007-01-02|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public performances in July 2003 at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] included monologues dealing with abuse, menstruation, masturbation, orgasms, marriage, religious faith, and political protest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to co-founder Vandana Makker:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Yoni Ki Baat'' allows individuals who identify as women of South Asian ancestry the space to share their stories around issues that are often 'taboo' (and therefore not discussed) in our communities. Stories around sex, body image, abuse, violence. Stories around sex, body image, abuse, violence, pleasure, hair, relationships, bodily functions, strong emotions—pleasure, hair, relationships, bodily functions, strong emotions—those things we often can’t even admit to ourselves. These are the stories that we seek out and then perform on stage. Sometimes the writers perform their own pieces and sometimes we have other women perform them. In the spirit of ''The Vagina Monologues'', a portion of the proceeds from each show are donated to organizations that support survivors of domestic violence."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Yoni Ki Baat'' performances and spinoffs have been performed in various parts of the United States by campus organizations and local South Asian organizations, sometimes borrowing scripts from South Asian Sisters, holding calls for submissions, or a combination of the two. The majority of proceeds are donated to organizations supporting survivors of domestic violence in the South Asian community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to South Asian Sisters' regular performances in the San Francisco Bay Area, ''YKB'' has been staged in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yonikiraat.wixsite.com/yonikiraat|title=Yoni Ki Raat|work=Yoni Ki Raat|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2017/03/16/yoni-ki-baat-vagina-monologues-seattle-2017/63560|title=Yoni Ki Baat: Where skeptics learn to trust|date=2017-03-16|work=The Seattle Globalist|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://events.sulekha.com/yoni-ki-baat-2018_event-in_naperville-il_330589|title=Yoni Ki Baat - 2018  at North Central College Meiley Swallow Hal, Naperville, IL|last=|first=|date=|website=events.sulekha.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://union.wisc.edu/events-and-activities/event-calendar/event/yoni-ki-baat-intersectional-stories-from-womyn-of-color/197/|title=Yoni Ki Baat|last=|first=|date=|website=union.wisc.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/2018/04/south-asian-sisters-bring-yoni-ki-baat-to-harvard/|title=South Asian Sisters Bring Yoni Ki Baat to Harvard|last=|first=|date=2018-04-12|work=The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/yonikibaat|title=Yoni Ki Baat|last=|first=|date=|website=maizepages.umich.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thescarlet.org/15716/larts/yoni-ki-baat-south-asian-vagina-monologues/|title=Yoni Ki Baat: South Asian Vagina Monologues|last=Bilimoria|first=Drashhti|work=The Scarlet|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grinnell, Iowa|Grinnell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesandb.com/article/yoni-ki-baat-vulnerable-and-empowering.html|title=Yoni Ki Baat: Vulnerable and Empowering|last=Bohlke|first=Lily|date=October 27, 2017|work=The Scarlet and Black|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shc.stanford.edu/events/yoni-ki-baat-performance-rangmanch|title="Yoni ki Baat"- A Performance by Rangmanch|last=|first=|date=2014-03-03|work=Stanford Humanities|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Züschen tomb''' ({{lang-de|Steinkammergrab von Züschen}}, sometimes also ''Lohne-Züschen'') is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near [[Fritzlar]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. Classified as a [[gallery grave]] or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (''hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in [[Central Europe]]. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]]. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric [[rock art]] elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Züschen and from tomb I at [[Warburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

== Discovery and excavation ==
The tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of [[sandstone]] blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a [[basalt]] outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the [[Chatti]], a local [[Iron Age]] tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the [[antiquarian]] Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]], still in 1894, by [[Johannes Boehlau]], former director of the State Museum at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Story of discovery from Boehlau &amp; von Gilsa 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of [[Marburg]].&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"&gt;Kappel 1990, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomb architecture ==
The rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 3; Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

A terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5&amp;nbsp;m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called ''Seelenloch'' (German for "soul hole"), of 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some [[ritual]], perhaps an [[Sacrifice|offering]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"/&gt; Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in [[France]], is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial [[tumulus]]. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human remains ==
The earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an [[Urnfield]] period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grave offerings ==
Most finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related [[Lohra (megalithic tomb)|Lohra tomb]] and collared bottles connected with the northern [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture]]. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called ''Giant Urn'' belongs to the later burial.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373; Kappel 1990, 6; W. Schwelnuß 1979: ''Wartberg-Gruppe und hessische Megalithik; ein Beitrag zum späten Neolithikum des Hessischen Berglandes'', Materialien zur Vor- und Frühgeschichte von Hessen, Bd. 4, Wiesbaden: Landesamt für Denkmalpflege, p. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock carvings ==
[[File:Züschen tomb2.JPG|thumb|300px|Carvings inside the tomb.]]
One of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373-5, Kappel 1990, 6-7; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-9&lt;/ref&gt; Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent ([[Bronze Age|Bronze]] or [[Iron Age]]) carvings at [[Valcamonica]] near [[Capo di Ponte]], [[Northern Italy]] and at [[Mont Bégo]] in the [[France|French]] part of the [[Ligurian Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;I. 1978: ''Steinkammergräber und Menhire in Nordhessen.'', ed. Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Kassel; 6-8, 11-23, also: E. Anati, 1983: Züschen (Kassel) e Anderlingen (Hannover), Germania: Rilievamento e studio dei monumenti megalitici; ''Bolletino del Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici'' 20; 132-135..&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols are normally assumed to reflect [[Neolithic]] [[ideology|ideological]] or [[religion|religious]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
A reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (''Hessisches Landesmuseum'') in [[Kassel]].

==Relationships with other sites==
Like any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150&amp;nbsp;m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent [[basalt]] dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4&amp;nbsp;km to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 375-7&lt;/ref&gt;
