Lee. "Introduction. Script". "A Walk in the Woods: A Play in Two Acts", Dramatists Play Service, Inc., 1988, {{ISBN|082221220X}}, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Walk in the Woods'' premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Booth Theatre]] on February 10, 1988 in previews, officially on February 28, 1988, and closed on June 26, 1988 after 21 previews and 137 performances. Directed by Des McAnuff, the cast starred [[Robert Prosky]] as Andrey Botvinnik and [[Sam Waterston]] as John Honeyman.&lt;ref name=vault&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/1685/A-Walk-in-the-Woods "'A Walk in the Woods' Broadway"]  playbillvault.com, accessed December 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was presented at the [[Westport Country Playhouse]], Connecticut, in September 1988. Directed by Maureen F. Gibson, the cast starred Lawrence Pressman (as John Honeyman) and Michael Constantin] (as Andrey Botvinnik).&lt;ref name=klein&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/nyregion/theater-walk-in-the-woods-in-westport.html|title=THEATER; 'Walk in the Woods' in Westport|first=Alvin|last=Klein|date=September 4, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]] at the Comedy Theater in November 1988. The cast starred [[Alec Guinness]] (Andrey Botvinnik) and [[Edward Herrmann]] (John Honeyman), directed by Ronald Eyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/24/reviews/guinness-challenges.html|title=Back on Stage, Challenges for Mr. Guinness|first=Herbert|last=Mitgang|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Matt.

The play was produced [[Off-Broadway]] by the Keen Company at The Clurman Theatre at Theatre Row in September 2014. The cast starred Paul Niebanck (John Honeyman) and [[Kathleen Chalfant]] (as Irina Botvinnik), directed by Jonathan Silverstein.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, Carey.

In each case I gave it....I think the gender change can wake us up a bit more to a play that discusses issues that haven’t been on the front burner (in quite this way at least) for decades. It reminds us that more and more women are finding their way into our society’s biggest socio-political discussions.' "&lt;ref&gt;McCall, Tulis. [http://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/reviews/walkinthewoods14.htm "reviews. 'A Walk in the Woods'"] newyorktheatreguide.com, October 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The character of the Soviet diplomat had previously been played by a woman, in the production at the [[Northern Stage]] in [[Vermont]], which transferred to London at the [[Tricycle Theatre]] in October 2011. Press materials for this production stated "the director's decision to cast a woman in the role keeps the production topical, reflecting the more recent appointments of women such as Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton to positions of diplomatic global power."&lt;ref&gt;Stenton, Mark. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/vermont-production-of-a-walk-in-the-woods-to-visit-londons-tricycle-theatre-181373# Vermont Production of 'A Walk in the Woods' to Visit London's Tricycle Theatre"] playbill.com, August 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Two arms negotiators stroll in the woods above [[Geneva, Switzerland]], in the late summer, away from the glare of the negotiating table. They are a Soviet diplomat, Andrey Botvinnik age 57, and John Honeyman age 45, an American negotiator. The two men eventually develop a relationship, although their personalities differ. Botvinnik is friendly and enjoys American culture, Honeyman is formal and idealistic.&lt;ref name=script/&gt;

Note: the play is suggested by a real-life incident, which occurred in 1982. "Negotiators Paul H. Nitze and Yuli A. Kvitsinsky left the official Geneva sessions for an unofficial "walk in the woods" and achieved a breakthrough, soon rejected by their Governments."&lt;ref name=rich&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/29/theater/stage-a-walk-in-the-woods.html|title=Stage: 'A Walk in the Woods'|first=Frank|last=Rich|authorlink=Frank Rich|date=February 29, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
[[Frank Rich]], in his review of the Broadway production for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: "...as a piece of theater, 'A Walk in the Woods' is the esthetic equivalent of Switzerland, and not only because its setting is 'a pleasant woods on the outskirts of Geneva.' The play at the Booth fudges the distinctions of actual international politics and arms negotiations, choosing instead to telescope the messy, life-or-death conflict into a sentimental relationship between two likable envoys."&lt;ref name=rich/&gt;

Alvin Klein, in reviewing the Westport Country Plahouse production for ''The New York Times'', wrote: "Mr. Blessing's play is a [c]one of ideas, intelligence and some semblance of wit. The dramatic action and character exposition he has provided is negligible. It remains for the actors to establish complete characters and this Mr. Constantine and Mr. Pressman do with immense skill."&lt;ref name=klein/&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
The play was nominated for the 1988 [[Tony Award]] , Play and Actor in a Play (Prosky). Prosky won the 1988 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play.&lt;ref name=vault/&gt;

The play was a finalist for the 1987 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama "Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Winners and Finalists"] pulitzer.org, accessed December 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Alec Guinness was nominated for the 1988 [[Olivier Award]], Actor of the Year in a New Play, and the play was nominated as the BBC Award for the Play of the Year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivierawards.com/winners/ "Olivier Awards"] olivierawards.com, accessed December 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
The play was adapted into a 1988 television film, written by Blessing and directed by [[Kirk Browning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461713/ |title=A Walk in the Woods (1988) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2822">'''Advance-deposit wagering''' (ADW) is a form of [[gambling]] on the outcome of [[horse racing|horse races]] in which bettors must [[Prepayment for service|fund their account]] before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a share of ADW revenues.

It typically involves betting on horse or [[greyhound racing]]. Wagering may take place through [[parimutuel betting|parimutuel]] pools.

==Legality==

===Illinois===
Illinois has allowed its adult residents to participate in ADW since 1999 under the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975; Illinois receives a cut of ADW revenues. 

==Impact==
Chapter 58 of the New York State Laws of 2012 added a new Section 911 to the New York State
Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law (Racing Law). Section 911 requires the New
York State Racing and Wagering Board (Board) to assess the impact of advanced deposit
wagering (ADW) in New York State including, but not limited to:
* The impact of out-of-state account wagering providers (OSAWP) accepting wagers from New York State residents;
* The annual dollar amount wagered by New York State residents through OSAWPs;
* The number of OSAWP accounts held by New York State residents;
* Information concerning New York State residents who utilize OSAWPs including residency.

Section 911 of the Racing Law required that the study, along with any recommendations, be submitted to the Governor and the Legislature by September 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Impact of Account Wagering Providers|url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/09191215442609.14.12.adwreport.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the survey revealed that New York residents bet $165,567,707 in 2010 and $142,246,859 YTD 9/30/11 through the responding OSAWPs. This includes wagering on the New York racing product and on out-of-state racetracks. Table 1 provides detail of the handle by New York racetracks and out-of-state racetracks. The Board estimates this handle will exceed $200,000,000 in 2012.

The survey also showed that OSAWPs listed 18,769 accounts in 2010 and 21,310 accounts in YTD 9/30 2011 as New York resident accounts. All 62 New York State counties are represented. Table 2 lists the number of accounts by the county in which the zip code originated. Table 2-A lists the number of accounts by statutorily defined Off-Track Betting Regions. NJ Account Wagering, Sol Mutuel, Global Wagering Solutions and Elite Turf Club reported having no New York accounts.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=March 2018}}
The film begins with Rob entering his bedroom, and attempting to masturbate with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (similar to the apple pie scenario in the first film). While he is doing this his dog, Frizzie, tries to eat the sandwich, and Rob's little brother Cody takes a video of the ordeal. Later, Rob meets with his friends, Nathan and Marshall Lube, at school. Nathan reveals that his girlfriend, Dana, has pledged to abstain from sex until marriage despite the fact that she has already slept with six other people. Rob talks to Heidi, a girl he is attracted to, and Stifler. Stifler states that if Rob doesn't make a move on Heidi, he will. In class, Lube has a vivid fantasy about a group of cheerleaders, particularly one named Ashley Lawrence. Rob and Heidi meet later in the school library where she discloses that she is a virgin, and wishes to just "get it [sex] over with". At the school dance, Nathan tries to get to second base with Dana, but only manages to offend her due to her abstinence pledge. Rob attempts to tell Heidi how he feels about her but is interrupted by Nathan and Lube. He eventually finds her in the library about to have sex with another student, and drops a lit candle in a bin in shock. This sets the library on fire, which sets off the water sprinklers.
 
The next day, when Rob and Heidi are cleaning the library, Rob finds a secret compartment containing 'The Bible' (The Book of Love). He shows the book to Nathan and Lube and explains that it is a sex manual that has been compiled over forty years by the students who found it. The book is regarded as legendary, but unfortunately has been damaged by the water.
 
Later in the local mall, Rob attempts to test a tip in the book; 'Simple Flattery'. He approaches Ashley in a lingerie store and complements her. Ashley leads him into a changing room, takes off her bra and top, and makes him steal a bra for her. Unfortunately Rob is caught and forced to pay with his mom's credit card. Meanwhile, Nathan goes to Dana's church service to talk to her, but accidentally broadcasts the explicit and highly personal conversation to the entire congregation on the church's PA system. Dana's father then bans her from seeing Nathan. When she receives her credit card bill, Rob's mom tries to talk to him about it, prompting Rob to sarcastically say that he likes wearing women's underwear. He is again filmed by his little brother, who again posts the footage on the internet for the whole school to see.
 
The next day, Heidi, Imogen, and Dana are at a school basketball game in which Rob and Stifler are playing. A girl called Katie tries to talk to Stifler, but he brushes her off. Rob again attempts to tell Heidi how he feels, but is unable to. Lube discovers a page in The Bible which tells of a brothel in Canada and a prostitute, Monique, who is very experienced. The entry was written in 1975, but Lube misreads the date as 1995, and they decide to visit. When they meet Monique the boys are disgusted, but Nathan states that they should go for it anyway. Nathan and Lube make Rob go first, but Monique dies while performing oral sex on him. They panic and drive back to the USA.
 
Rob and Heidi are once again in the library where Rob finally tells her he is attracted to her. Heidi feels the same, and they agree to meet at Stifler's party later. At the party Heidi hears Rob shout "Tonight, I'm getting laid!", and runs upstairs. Stifler again brushes off Katie when she tries to talk to him. Lube tells Ashley how he feels about her and guarantees sexual satisfaction, but she still turns him down. Ashley's friend is impressed with his promise and tells Lube to meet her upstairs, but when she finds an offensive text on his phone she storms out. Nathan attempts to reconcile with Dana but offends her, making her leave once again. Rob finds Heidi in bed with Stifler and leaves the room. Heidi follows him downstairs, but Rob refuses to talk to her and begins to drink heavily. He declares "only assholes get laid!" and then behaves crudely to a random girl, who promptly goes to bed with him. She asks him to have sex with her from behind, but he hallucinates and sees Heidi saying; "You aren't seriously going to stick your dick in that, are you?". Rob then throws up on the girl's back. The next morning his mother asks him if he drove home drunk, and shows him a film she received on her phone of Rob throwing up on the girl the night before.
 
In an attempt to restore The Bible, Rob and his friends resolve to find all of the people who originally wrote it in order to recreate it, starting with the original creator, Noah Levenstein. They eventually succeed in recreating the book.
 
Rob and his friends then go on the school ski trip. In a log cabin where a few students are playing strip poker, Katie again attempts to talk to Stifler, who again brushes her off. She bets Stifler that if she wins at poker he has to apologise to her and run naked in the snow. Stifler loses and is forced to apologise and go outside naked, where he is humped by a moose. Due to last night's ordeal, Imogen keeps him company and the two form a bond. The other students are riding up the mountain in gondola ski lifts, but Nathan has sex with Dana in the lift control room and accidentally shut off the lifts' power. In one lift, Rob and Heidi reconcile and kiss. Ashley and Lube are in another lift, where Lube falls out when trying to go for help. When Ashley climbs down to him, Lube tells her how he really feels about her, moving her to tears. Heidi and Rob return to the cabin and have sex. Lube and Ashley do the same.
 
The story ends with Rob, Nathan, and Lube returning the newly restored Bible to where Rob found it, after Rob has added his signature to it. As a finale, Rob's brother, Cody, enters his bedroom to find an online film of him putting a vacuum cleaner on his penis. To his horror it has been viewed almost 10 million times. Rob ends the film with the words "Gotcha, ha ha".

'''Television frequency allocation''' has evolved since the start of television in Australia in 1956, and later in New Zealand in 1960. There was no coordination between the national spectrum management authorities in either country to establish the frequency allocations. The management of the spectrum in both countries is largely the product of their economical and political situation. New Zealand didn't start to develop television service until 1965 due to World War 2 and its economic harm in the country's economy.

The demand and planning for television in Australia intensified after WW2, with the Chifley government first favouring the existing British model (state monopoly) in 1948, and New Zealand used a similar model during the introduction of television in the 1960s. Private broadcasting did not come to the country until the 1980s, but there was no spectrum expansion to cope with the new arrangement.

== History==
===Australia ===
Australian television broadcasting commenced in 1956 in Melbourne and Sydney to coincide with the 1956 Summer Olympics.

Three stations commenced operations on a ten channel spectrum arrangement: the ABC operating in the VHF low band (VHF Ch 2), and the commercial stations operating in the VHF high band (VHF Ch 7 &amp; 9). At the outset, commercial stations were independently owned, but due to economic forces network affiliations were soon established.

This pattern of television spectrum allocation was replicated in most of the state capital cities over the subsequent decade, with the exception of Hobart (one commercial service on VHF 6) and eventually Darwin (both the ABC and the commercial service were allocated in the VHF high band).

Geographical conditions differed in Melbourne and Sydney. The Melbourne transmission towers were located on the nearby Mount Dandenong, and their elevation and broadcasting power on an otherwise relatively flat terrain meant that the broadcasting signal could be reached for some considerable distance, although there were some areas that experienced reception difficulties due to hills or buildings.

In the Sydney "basin" (formed by the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]) the broadcast towers were collocated on the original studio sites, and given the undulating geography of Sydney there were many areas that experienced reception difficulties. The Blue Mountain terrain in the West of Sydney meant that capital city broadcasting did not penetrate into the hinterland of NSW, unlike that of Melbourne. It is possible that the penetration of weak signals into the Victorian hinterlands hastened the demand for the establishment of regional television stations, which commenced in 1961.

The Australian Government restricted regional television broadcasting to one commercial service and a repeater station of the national broadcaster from the capital city ABC station. Regional television stations tended to be allocated to VHF 6, 8 or in some cases 10.

=== New Zealand ===
In popular culture, there is a TV series "50 Years of New Zealand Television" that covers in Episode 1 some of the early difficulties of getting TV broadcasting started in NZ, but with no coverage at all with respect to Frequency Allocation.

New Zealand for all practical purposes did not get television broadcasting of any kind until around 1960, when a Pay TV system was allowed to operate in Auckland.

The existing documentaries on TV development in NZ don't cover Frequency Allocation

=== FM allocation artifacts ===
The United Kingdom and New Zealand until recently shared an FM broadcasting allocation of 88.0&amp;nbsp;MHz to 105.0&amp;nbsp;MHz. Since the early 2000s both nations have full use of the standard FM Stereo region due to reallocation activities related to their separate implementation strategies for digital television.

This smaller FM Band allocation (less than 20&amp;nbsp;MHz : 88&amp;nbsp;MHz to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz—typical of FM in the rest of the world) can be traced to the 405 line system's VHF allocation block. The UK adopted the 405 line system but NZ did not. The slightly smaller allocation only posed problems for the UK for its densely populated metropolitan regions, but NZ had few problems with the smaller allocation.

NZ's allocation for FM remained smaller as if NZ had adopted the 405 line system. New Zealand considered adopting the 405 line system in the late 1950s to early 1960s but adopted PAL instead. This impacted the frequency allocation block for FM broadcasting making it smaller. New Zealand's FM frequency allocation issue was not fixed until the late 1990s, when the FM band was expanded to the standard full 20&amp;nbsp;MHz block. As of the mid-2010s NZ totally abandoned its VHF band for UHF channels above 25.

==Differences in frequencies ==
There is a frequency offset for many DTV channels between Australia and NZ, because of historical reasons relating to the introduction of PAL.

* Both Australia and New Zealand use 7&amp;nbsp;MHz channel spacing (for PAL B) on VHF, but the frequencies and channel numbers differ substantially because of Australia revising its VHF TV band usage.
* Australia adopted [[Zweiton]] for stereophonic audio broadcasting, whilst NZ adopted [[NICAM]].
* For PAL, the only difference is the placement of the [[NICAM]] carrier vs the [[Zweiton]] carrier, for broadcasters using [[NICAM]]. NZ used 5.824&amp;nbsp;MHz NICAM carrier offset, as used in mainland Europe. 
* Australia's Zweiton offset was not changed with respect to the European standard.
* Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have the same UHF band allocation for TV broadcasting.

===Obsolete channels===
* With the introduction of [[digital terrestrial television]] in Australia in 2001, channels 10 and 11 were moved up by 1&amp;nbsp;MHz.
** This allocation change allowed a full 7&amp;nbsp;MHz for a new channel (9A).
** VHF channel 12 was added following the new channel 11 to compensate for the change.
* channels 0-2 and 5A ceased to be used for television when analogue television broadcasting was discontinued.
* Television broadcasts on channels 3, 4, and 5 were previously discontinued in most regional areas in 1991 and 1992. Since the frequencies for these channels overlapped the range used for FM radio, any television broadcasts on these channels prevented the allocation of new FM radio licences, predominantly in regional areas.
* VHF Low Band DX using ITU TV Band (I) and part of Band (III) from NZ may disappear with the transition to DVB-T.

==Frequency allocation table==
DVB-T channel allocation note
* The allocation for terrestrial television must be seen in terms of uniform system G 8&amp;nbsp;MHz blocks (for bands IV and V in NZ) and system B 7&amp;nbsp;MHz blocks (for bands I to V in Australia) after the cessation of analogue television.
* DVB-T,  analogue systems B and G utilize the same 250&amp;nbsp;kHz guard-band.
* After analogue television transmissions have ceased, only the preferred main carrier wave centre frequency should be listed as [[QAM (television)|QAM]] modulates all AV channels and other data into a single [[H.222]] data stream.
* Digital services on channels above Ch 51 are going to change channel after the analog services are switched off. The ACMA has published the pre-stack and post-stack channel in a spreadsheet on its website.
* Australian channel 12 was discontinued decades ago but is being reintroduced with digital television, generally for the [[ABC Television|ABC]] in the major metropolitan areas.
* A common problem (for metropolitan areas in particular) of difficulty receiving digital 10 (on channel 11) and digital ABC (on channel 12) is because older antennas were not designed to receive channels 11 and 12. Many VHF Band III antennas were only designed to receive channels 6 to 10 for analog television transmissions.&lt;ref name="ch 11 and 12"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital television services on Channel 12 |url=http://www.digitalready.gov.au/Content/Documents/Brochure-and-info-sheets/National/Digital-television-services-on-Channel-12.aspx |publisher=Australian Government |date=August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018105327/http://www.digitalready.gov.au/Content/Documents/Brochure-and-info-sheets/National/Digital-television-services-on-Channel-12.aspx |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Australia and New Zealand analog sub-carriers use the standard B/G offsets from the vision carrier.
** [[PAL]] color difference at +4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz
** FM monaural full mixed down channel audio at +5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz
** New Zealand (B/G version) [[NICAM]] stereo or dual monaural at +5.824&amp;nbsp;MHz
** Australian [[A2 Stereo]] right or second monaural channel at +5.742&amp;nbsp;MHz (AM signalling at +5.46875&amp;nbsp;MHz)

===Private networks===

Some commercial broadcasters have a call sign that operates over multiple areas, whereas others may only serve a single area.  This is due to historical ownership of regional stations. Nevertheless, most regional stations are now affiliated with the major metropolitan networks.

'''''Bacdafucup: Part II''''' is the fourth album from rap group [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], released on July 9, 2002 by [[Koch Records]]. The album was produced by Davinci, DR Period, [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]], Self, Ant Boogie, Co-Stars, [[Scott Storch]]. The album features appearances by American rappers X1, Still Livin', Versatile, Platinum Plus, Felisa Marisol.

''Bacdafucup: Part II'' debuted at number 46 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], number 11 on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums]] and number 2 on the [[Top Independent Albums]] chart.

== Background ==
''Bacdafucup: Part II'' is the first album released by Onyx after the group left [[Def Jam]]. Onyx returns after [[Sticky Fingaz]], [[Fredro Starr]] and [[Sonny Seeza]] took time off to do solo albums and become film stars. Onyx made a deal with [[Koch Records]] to release one album and came back with the sequel to their very successful debut LP ''[[Bacdafucup]]''. Onyx reunited for ''Bacdafucup: Part II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.laweekly.com/music/black-metal-yoga-and-black-metal-brunch-bring-the-genre-into-the-lifestyle-events-arena-9720335|title=The Top 20 Rap Album Sequels of All Time| website=laweekly.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album cover even echoes that of the debut, although only the three remaining members of Onyx are featured on the new album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://hiphopisntdead.blogspot.com/2014/07/onyx-bacdafucup-part-ii-july-2-2002.html|title=Onyx - Bacdafucup: Part II (July 22, 2002)| website=hiphopisntdead.blogspot.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album consisting of 12 new tracks and included a return to their biggest hit with "Slam Harder", DR Period track uses a clever sample of the theme song from the TV show "[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]" to introduce the song and provide melody throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2002_07_bacup2.html|title=Onyx :: Bacdafucup Part II (Review by  Steve 'Flash' Juon)| website=rapreviews.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "Slam Harder" is censored on the album when the rest of the LP is explicit. The song "Feel Me" was recorded on the night of [[September 11, 2001]] and dedicated to the events that happened that day in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/stickyfingaz.shtml|title=Sticky Fingaz (Onyx) - conducted by Todd E. Jones| website=mvremix.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singles ==
Four singles from this album were released: "Hold Up", "Big Trucks/Bring 'Em Out Dead", "Slam Harder/Hold Up" and "Slam Harder/Bring 'Em Out Dead"

''Bacdafucup: Part II'' came a decade later, and the passion and energy behind it wasn't nearly as believeable as it was back in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/rap-album-sequels/onyx-bacdafucup|title=A History of Rap Album Sequels (by Chris Yuscavage)| website=complex.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onyx claims they're back, but not in the form we expected them to be in. They should have thought about what they were naming this LP before it was released, because with this title, many had high expectations, it's nowhere near being a complete travesty. Is this album commercial? More than one may expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/onyx/bacdafucup-part-ii-3/|title=Bacdafucup Part II| website=rateyourmusic.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This LP has gotten horrible reviews by critics as well as die hard Onyx fans. After the incredible Sticky Fingaz solo album or the last very dense Onyx LP ("[[Shut 'Em Down (album)|Shut 'Em Down]]"), this album does seem somewhat lazy and sloppy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.mvremix.com/urban/reviews/2002/onyx2.shtml|title=Onyx - Bacdafucup Part II (review by NewJeruPoet)| website=mvremix.com |access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15263">In '''[[Israel]]''', [[baseball]] is a sport that is not extremely popular, although many initiatives are in place to help develop and grow the sport in Israel. There are approximately 1,000 baseball players in Israel in 16 cities across the country. Volunteer coaches and donors are instrumental to the growth and development of the sport as baseball resources are very limited within the country. Israel is currently ranked 19th in the world in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbsc.org/rankings WBSC Rankings NOV. 2018] - Retrieved 28 NOV., 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of baseball outside the United States#Israel|l1=History of baseball outside the United States}}
Baseball was first played in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] on July 4, 1927.&lt;ref name=rechist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713064314/http://www.israelbaseballleague.com/baseballinisrael/recenthistory/|title=israelbaseballleague.com: Recent History|publisher=www.israelbaseballleague.com|accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first field in Israel was built in Kibbutz Gezer in 1979, and the country now has a baseball field at the [[Yarkon Sports Complex]] in [[Petah Tikva|Petach Tikva]].  Israel sends national teams of various age groups to international baseball tournaments each year. The best recent showing to date in International Play (Pool A) was a 1st place by the Israeli Juvenile (ages 10–12) in the 2009 European Championships (CEB). Between 500 and 1,000 Israelis regularly play baseball in amateur league play. Baseball is growing at an accelerated pace, with much greater baseball identity associated with the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelemb.org/US-Israel-Relations/sports.html Embassy of Israel].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel Association of Baseball==
The Israel Association of Baseball (IAB), established in 1986, is a non-profit organization in Israel. Their goal is to promote and develop baseball in Israel. In order to accomplish this they teach baseball to youth, organize national tournaments as well as aid in assisting Israeli teams to compete internationally, and procuring the required equipment. Additionally they will help organize the league, ensure they have a proper field, train the coaches, umpires and player.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibaf.org/en/nation/ebcc9784-ed5b-4471-8b1b-42fb474e9511&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAB is a member of The [[Olympic Committee of Israel]], The [[Confederation of European Baseball]] and The International Baseball Association. The above organization in addition to the Israel Sports Authority, recognizes the IAB as the sole governing body for baseball in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball.org.il/|title=IAB - Israel Association of Baseball  - Home|website=www.baseball.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable players to play in the IAB include [[Alon Leichman]] and [[Dean Kremer]].

The following clubs are registered to participate in the IAB; these are mostly youth clubs (Senior teams have a star next to their name:)
* Bet Shemesh Blue Sox 
* Bet Shemesh Comets 
* Bet Shemesh Mavericks
* Gezer Bats
* Ginot Shomron Wild Boars
* Hashmonaim Aztec Flames 
* Jerusalem Lions*
* Lev Hasharon Nationals
* Modiin Miracles*
* Ra'anana Raiders* 
* Rehovot Raptors
* Tel Aviv Comrades*
* Zofit Warriors

==Israel Baseball Academy==
Under the authority of the IAB the Israel Baseball Academy launched in October 2014.&lt;ref name=jpbb&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Sports/First-Israel-baseball-academy-could-be-a-real-game-changer-380221 First Israel baseball academy could be a real game-changer] - Retrieved 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The first year's program started in mid-October at [[Yarkon Sports Complex]] in [[Petah Tikva]].&lt;ref name=jpbb /&gt;

Academy players will partake in weekly training. This will give them the opportunities to play in the Israel National Team Program, to be recognized as Elite Athletes in the IDF. The program is also recognized by [[Major League Baseball]] and will give them access to programs designed for the best young players in Europe.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;[http://www.baseball.org.il/en/cat-heb-2/264-the-first-israel-baseball-academy-has-begun The First Israel Baseball Academy has Begun] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182454/http://www.baseball.org.il/en/cat-heb-2/264-the-first-israel-baseball-academy-has-begun |date=2015-09-23 }} - Retrieved 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Former IAB National Director Nate Fish and National Team Coach David Schenker were the first coaches for the academy. [[Dan Rothem]], a former college pitcher and Israel National Team player will be the pitching coach.&lt;ref name=bb /&gt; Each year the program plans to include 10 kids age 14-21.&lt;ref name=bb /&gt; In addition to the first year's participants there are 20 kids which are being scouted for year two.&lt;ref name=bb /&gt;

There are currently 24 players aged 14-18 in the Israel Baseball Academy. National Coach, Ryan Willen, a former catcher at division 3 Washinton &amp; Jefferson College runs the Academy. Additionally, former Japanese professional coach and player by the nickname of "KAZ" assists in operating and maintaining the high-level product offered to the nations best players.

==Israel Baseball League==
{{See also|Israel Baseball League}}
In 2007, the Israel Baseball League played its one and only season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Israel_Baseball_League|title=Israel Baseball League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six league teams were the [[Tel Aviv Lightning]], [[Netanya Tigers]], [[Bet Shemesh Blue Sox]], [[Petach Tikva Pioneers]], [[Modi'in Miracle]], and [[Ra'anana Express]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1164881960205 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813162101/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1164881960205 |date=2011-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the leagues games were played at three [[ballpark]]s.

[[File:WATCHMEN 2012 OZY Cvr.jpg|thumb|''Before Watchmen: Ozymandias'' artwork by [[Jae Lee]]]]
'''''Before Watchmen''''' is a series of [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]] in 2012. Acting as a [[prequel]] to the 1986 12-issue ''[[Watchmen]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], the project consists of eight limited series and one [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] (though two were initially planned) for a total of 37 issues.

==Publication history==
Moore stated in 1985 that if the ''Watchmen'' limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12-issue prequel series called ''Minutemen'' featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story.&lt;ref name="TCJ106"&gt;Heintjes, Tom (March 1986). "Alan Moore On (Just About) Everything". ''[[The Comics Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as ''Rorschach's Journal'' or ''The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary'', as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because ''[[The 'Nam]]'' was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a "Nite Owl/Rorschach team" (in the manner of ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'', and also in the sense that the original Charlton characters Blue Beetle and The Question had worked together as a team from time-to-time). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals.&lt;ref name="CI65p61"&gt;"Watchmen Round Table: Moore &amp; Gibbons". ''[[David Anthony Kraft]]'s [[Comics Interview]]''. Issue 65, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a ''Minutemen'' series, because it would have "[paid] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see how we got to the conclusion."&lt;ref name="Comics Bulletin"&gt;Young, Thom. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523081714/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/12289382257709.htm Watching the Watchmen with Dave Gibbons: An Interview]". ''[[Comics Bulletin]]''. 2008. Retrieved on December 12, 2008. Archived from the [http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/12289382257709.htm original] on February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Moore told ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' that DC offered him the rights to ''Watchmen'' back earlier that week, if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects. Moore said that "if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked ... But these days I don't want ''Watchmen'' back. Certainly, I don't want it back under those kinds of terms." DC Comics co-publishers [[Dan DiDio]] and [[Jim Lee]] responded, "DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Thill, Scott. (July 21, 2010). [https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/07/alan-moore-watchmen "Alan Moore: 'I Don't Want Watchmen Back'"]. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. Retrieved on February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following months of rumors about a potential ''Watchmen'' follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced seven prequel limited series under the "Before Watchmen" banner: ''Rorschach'', ''Minutemen'', ''Dr. Manhattan'', ''Comedian'', ''Silk Spectre'', ''Nite Owl'', and ''Ozymandias''. The books were written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], [[Brian Azzarello]], [[Darwyn Cooke]], and [[Len Wein]], and drawn by [[Lee Bermejo]], [[J. G. Jones]], [[Adam Hughes]], [[Andy Kubert]], [[Joe Kubert]], and [[Amanda Conner]]. Every issue featured a two-page installment of the backup series "Curse of the Crimson Corsair" written by Len Wein and drawn by original ''Watchmen'' colorist [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]. The backup was inspired by the ''Tales of the Black Freighter'' [[story within a story]] from the original ''Watchmen''. A ''Before Watchmen: Epilogue'' one-shot was announced but never published.

Gibbons stated, {{quote|The original series of ''Watchmen'' is the complete story that Alan Moore and I wanted to tell. However, I appreciate DC's reasons for this initiative and the wish of the artists and writers involved to pay tribute to our work. May these new additions have the success they desire.&lt;ref&gt;Phegley, Kiel (February 1, 2012).

Moore criticized the project, calling it "completely shameless", and stated he was not interested in monetary compensation, but rather “What I want is for this not to happen.”&lt;ref&gt;Itzkoff, Dave. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/books/dc-comics-plans-prequels-to-watchmen-series.html?_r=1 DC Plans Prequels to Watchmen Series]". ''The New York Times''. February 1, 2012. Retrieved on February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore elaborated,
{{quote|What the comics industry has effectively said is, 'Yes, this was the only book that made us briefly special and that was because it wasn't like all the other books.'  ''Watchmen'' was something that stood on its own and it had the integrity of a literary work.  What they've decided now is, 'So, let's change it to a regular comic that can run indefinitely and have spin-offs.' and 'Let's make it as unexceptional as possible.'  Like I say, they're doing this because they haven't got any other choices left, evidently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seraphemera.org/seraphemera_books/AlanMoore_Page4.html "Interview with Alan Moore"].

The '''Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company''' is an American dance company based out of [[Harlem]] in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1983 by [[Bill T.

The '''Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum''' is a [[research library]] of American [[cartoon]]s and comic art affiliated with the [[Ohio State University]] library system in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Formerly known as the '''Cartoon Research Library''' and the '''Cartoon Library &amp; Museum''', it holds the world's largest and most comprehensive academic research facility documenting and displaying original and printed [[comic strip]]s, [[editorial cartoon]]s, and cartoon art. The museum is named after the Ohio cartoonist [[Billy Ireland]].&lt;ref name=toon&gt;[http://cartoons.osu.edu/ Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6230905 NPR: Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering [[comic book]]s, [[daily strip]]s, [[Sunday strip]]s, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, magazine [[cartoon]]s, and sports cartoons, the collection includes 450,000 original cartoons, 36,000 books, 51,000 serial titles, and {{convert|3000|ft|m}} of manuscript materials, plus 2.5 million comic strip clippings and tear sheets.

== History ==
[[File:Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum - early newspaper and magazine collections, in the stacks.jpg|thumb|left|Early newspaper and magazine collections]]
The Cartoon Library began in 1977 when the [[Milton Caniff|Milton Caniff Collection]] was donated to Ohio State and delivered to the School of Journalism, which was headed by Lucy Shelton Caswell, who became the Milton Caniff Reading Room first curator. Interviewed by Matt Tauber, Caswell detailed the museum's origins and how she became involved:

{{cquote|Caniff loved his university very much and truly believed that without the education he got here, he would not have achieved the things that he did. So, his sense of gratitude to the university was palpable... Somebody had to be responsible to make sure it was all there, and all the boxes had my name on it. When funding was made available to work on Caniff, I was offered a six-month appointment. I’ve been here ever since. The original collection was housed in the Journalism building. When I started working with it, we were in two classrooms that had been converted, a door cut between them, so that one was a reading room and one was a storage area... At the time that I started, there weren’t really the kinds of resources to teach and learn about comics that we have now. So, I basically had to make it up as we went along. There just wasn’t anything else out there. As a good librarian and scholar, I started writing around to other places that said they had cartoon collections to see how they did things, because you don’t want to reinvent the wheel if somebody’s already figured it out. It turned out that nobody had the kind of thing that we had in the Caniff collection, i.e. so extensive, and the combination of art and manuscript materials. And nobody else was trying to grow it the way we were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matttauber.blogspot.com/2009/01/lucy-shelton-caswell-interview-part-1.html Tauber, Matt. "Lucy Shelton Caswell Interview - part 1", January 30, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From two classrooms off the back hallway of the Journalism Building in 1977, the collection expanded to three classrooms and became part of the University Libraries. By 1989, the three classrooms were filled, and the library moved into a larger space, eventually requiring the use of off-site storage as the collection continued to expand. (At that point, the facility was named the Cartoon Research Library.)

In 1992, [[United Media]] donated the Robert Roy Metz Collection of 83,034 original cartoons by 113 cartoonists.

In 1998, the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art Collection was acquired from its director, [[Bill Blackbeard]], giving the library the largest collection of newspaper comic-strip tear sheets and clippings in the world.&lt;ref name=toon/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; Six semitrailer trucks transported this collection from California to Ohio.

In 2007, [[King Features Syndicate]] donated its [[Comic strip#Newspapers|proof-sheet]] collection, consisting of over two million strips (a duplicate set was donated to [[Michigan State University Libraries#Comic Art Collection|Michigan State University's Comic Art Collection]]).&lt;ref&gt;Randy Scott. "The King Features Proof Sheet Collection." ''Insight''. [Fall 2009?] p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the collection of the [[National Cartoon Museum|International Museum of Cartoon Art]] (more than 200,000 originals with an estimated value of $20 million) was transferred to the Cartoon Library &amp; Museum. Founded in 1973 by cartoonist [[Mort Walker]], the IMCA collection includes a wide variety of original cartoon art (comic strips, comic books, animation, editorial, advertising, sport, caricature, greeting cards, graphic novels, and illustrations), display figures, toys, and collectibles, plus works on film and tape, CDs, and DVDs.&lt;ref name=toon/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121615221992855615 |title=Beetle Bailey's Long March: Classic Cartoons Search for a Home |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' |author=Mary Pilon |authorlink=Mary Pilon |date=July 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2008/05/16/addition_to_make_schools_comic_art_collection_really_super/ Whiteman, Doug.

In September 2009, it was announced that the Ohio State University Board of Trustees approved a new name, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum, in recognition of a $7 million gift from an anonymous donor to support the renovation of Sullivant Hall. The museum was named in honor of [[William Addison Ireland]] (1880 – May 29, 1935), a self-taught cartoonist (and native of [[Chillicothe, Ohio]]) well known throughout Ohio as Billy Ireland. A native of Chillicothe, Ohio, Billy Ireland was a self-taught cartoonist who was hired by ''The Columbus Dispatch'' shortly after his 1898 high school graduation. Until his death, Ireland worked in Columbus for the ''Dispatch'', drawing both editorial cartoons and his Sunday feature, ''The Passing Show''. His work was exhibited by the museum in 2003.

Jenny E. Robb became the museum's new curator on January 1, 2011, following the December 31, 2010, retirement of Caswell, who returned as curator of special projects in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2010/11/12/lucy-shelton-caswell-retires-from-cartoon-library/ Gardner, Alan.

She has master's degrees in history and museum studies from Syracuse University. Wendy Pflug joined the staff as associate curator in December 2011.&lt;ref name=whoruns/&gt; Associate Curator and Assistant Professor Caitlin McGurk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Erica

==Books and publications==
In May 2010, the Ohio State University Press announced Studies in Comics and Cartoons, a series of books edited by Caswell and Jared Gardner, associate professor in the Department of English. Books published in this series will focus on comics and graphic literature with monographs and edited collections covering the history of comics and cartoons from the editorial cartoon and early sequential comics of the 19th century through contemporary international comics and online comics.

In 2017, the Ohio State University Press began publishing ''Inks'', a new journal for the Comics Studies Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=INKS: The Journal of The Comics Studies Society |url=http://inks.comicssociety.org/ |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This journal is published triannually, and "features scholarly research on sequential art, graphic narrative, and cartooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society |url=https://ohiostatepress.org/Inks.html |website=The Ohio State University Press |publisher=The Ohio State University Press |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sullivant Hall Location==
Expansion for the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum included the renovation of historic Sullivant Hall located on High Street adjacent to the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. The facility increased the library’s space from {{convert|6808|sqft|m2}} to more than {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}}. It features a reading room for researchers, three museum-quality galleries, and expanded storage space with state-of-the-art environmental and security controls.

In May 2009, Jean Schulz, widow of [[Charles M. Schulz]], made a donation of $1 million with a promise of a matching grant if more funds were raised for the renovations. Her challenge was that she would provide an additional gift of $2.5 million if Ohio State raised the same amount from other sources to reach a $6 million total. Cartoonist [[Bil Keane]] and his family answered the Schulz Challenge with a $50,000 gift.

The $20.6 million project was completed in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McGirk |first1=Caitlin |title=...And we're back! |url=https://library.osu.edu/blogs/cartoons/2013/09/11/and-were-back/ |website=Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum Blog |accessdate=13 August 2018 |date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sullivant Hall housing both the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum and Ohio State's Department of Dance.

Cemetery records give his middle initial as S., but his birth year as 1879.|group="note"}} sometimes referred to as '''"Ragtime" Bob Roberts''',&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt; was an American [[Novelty song|novelty]] singer in the early years of the 20th century.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the son of Nicholas (Nick) Roberts, a well-known [[clown]] who became the proprietor of one of the country's leading touring [[pantomime]] companies. Bob Roberts is assumed to have traveled widely with his father's shows in his youth. He made his recording debut for [[Columbia Records]] in 1902, and initially recorded remakes of other artists' records before starting to make recordings of new songs.&lt;ref name=sutton&gt;[http://www.mainspringpress.com/bobroberts.html  Allan Sutton, ''American Recording Pioneers - Bob Roberts]. Retrieved 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the most successful of his early recordings for Columbia were "Hurrah For Baffin's Bay" and "By The Sycamore Tree", both in 1903.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 371| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts also recorded for [[Edison Records|Edison]], [[Victor Records|Victor]], and other companies. He recorded prolifically, recording some songs for several different labels.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  One of his biggest comedy successes was with "The Woodchuck Song", written by [[Theodore Morse]], with a chorus of "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?",&lt;ref name=gracyk&gt;[http://www.gracyk.com/bobroberts.shtml  Tim Gracyk, ''Bob Roberts - Tenor'']. Retrieved 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which he recorded in 1904 for Edison, Columbia, Victor, and [[Zon-O-Phone Records]].&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  He also recorded for both Edison and Columbia as part of a duo with [[Albert Campbell (singer)|Albert Campbell]].&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt;

He was at the peak of his recording career between 1903 and 1907, when he rivaled [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]] for popularity, and received a similar payment of $30 for each recording.&lt;ref name=sutton/&gt;  He and Murray occasionally recorded together, as on "Oh! Oh! Sallie", in 1905.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  Roberts was a leading exponent of the comedic "[[coon song]]", such as "Wouldn't It Make You Hungry", written by [[Harry Von Tilzer]], and "I'm Satisfied", many of them recorded for Zon-o-phone, a subsidiary of Victor.&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt;&lt;ref name=sutton/&gt;

The number of his recordings started to diminish around 1908, perhaps because he devoted more of his time to stage performances. Roberts spent long periods touring in [[vaudeville]], where he became a popular [[monologist]], and was a leading attraction at the Regal Theater in [[Los Angeles]]. However, he also continued to record for Edison, Columbia, Victor, and other labels such as [[Indestructible Records|Indestructible]].&lt;ref name=sutton/&gt;

He had further popular success in 1911 with his recording of "Woodman, Woodman, Spare That Tree", from the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1911]]'', and in 1912 with the earliest recording of "[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]", for Victor Records.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  He did not record for any of the major companies after 1913 but, between 1914 and 1917, recorded for the Rex Talking Machine Company as Robert Roberts, including a duet with fellow vaudevillian [[Elida Morris]].&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt;

By the 1920s, Roberts had given up touring and returned to live in Cincinnati. According to [[Jim Walsh (columnist)|Jim Walsh]], he ran a [[pool hall]] there, and in the late 1920s appeared on radio station [[WCKY (AM)|WCKY]] in a show called "Adolph and Otto".&lt;ref name=gracyk/&gt;&lt;ref name=sutton/&gt;

He died in 1930.

==Gameplay==

Due to a lack of [[license|licensing]] from [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the game features no MLB team names, stadiums, or artwork, and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] himself is the only non-fictitious player in the game.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

The graphics and sound of the SNES version were seen as a "step up" from its [[Sega Genesis]] counterpart.

'''Chinese comedy''' has a long history that dates back to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1100&amp;nbsp;BC to 221&amp;nbsp;BC) when the aristocracy kept jesters in their homes.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time people in higher society were profoundly influenced by the teachings of [[Confucius]]. Therefore, comic shows were usually looked down upon in feudal China. During the late [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911)&lt;ref name = "AA" /&gt; and Republic of China period, different styles of comedy flourished in big cities and the genre of [[xiangsheng]], comic drama began to emerge. Since the 1980s, with the rapid development of media throughout the country, different kinds of comedy have arisen. They became the favorite form of entertainment for the populace. Currently, the most popular genres of Chinese comedy are Chinese skit and [[Xiangsheng]].

==xiangsheng==
{{main|xiangsheng (comedy)}}
'''Xiangsheng''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:相聲|相聲]]|s=[[wikt:相声|相声]]|p=xiàngsheng|l=face and voice}}), also known as crosstalk, is a traditional Chinese comedic performance in different forms of dialogue. Xiangsheng is a language art combining four basic techniques: speaking, imitating, teasing, and singing. It can be conducted by one or two performers. It is one of the most popular forms of entertainment because its language is rich in puns and allusions.&lt;ref name ="A"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 12 August 2010
| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; New developments have been applied to this traditional art in order to keep pace with the times. Xiangsheng is a very contemporary performance. Comedians place emphasis on creating new works and injecting new elements into traditional works making them more relevant to current affairs. It is performed in the form of a [[dialogue]] between two performers, or, much less often, a solo [[monologue]] or, even less frequently, a multi-person dialogue.

==Chinese skit==
'''Chinese [[Sketch comedy|skit]]''' is a form of performance about small things in people's daily lives. Chinese skit is generally regarded as originating in 1980s. It has inherited qualities, and developed from other forms of comedy, such as stage play, xiangsheng, [[Er ren zhuan|errenzhuan]] and comic drama. A skit revolves around just one topic, but with a lot of action and lively language. Through promotion by the [[CCTV New Year's Gala|Spring Festival Gala Evening]] over 20 years, Chinese skit became a very popular artistic form in China. The first skit in China was “eating noodles” (in 1984) which was performed by [[Chen Peisi]].

==Shanghai style stand-up comedy==
The typical form of Shanghai-style stand-up comedy is the style known as "Shanghai Qing Kou", which was created by [[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]] — a most famous stand-up comedian in China. "Shanghai Qing Kou" originated from different forms of local stand-up comedy in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. It is a style of comedy in which the performer speaks directly to the audience on socially popular topics. In the performances the performer will include his or her personal experiences.

'''Commedus Interruptus''' is an American theater troupe operating from the US state of California.

==Origin==
Commedus Interruptus originated as a short and long-form [[improvisational theatre]] troupe at the [[University of Southern California]]. The oldest of USC's five currently performing improv troupes, Commedus was created in 1989 by then-senior [[Don Friesen]]. The group is best known for performing a free hour-long lawn show every Friday at 1 p.m. in front of [[Tommy Trojan]]. In addition to their weekly shows, the troupe writes and produces a full-length [[sketch comedy]] show every semester.

Commedus quickly established itself as a fixture within the USC theater community, and has served as a stepping-stone in the careers of many USC alumni.

==Sketch show==
Twice a year, Commedus puts on an original [[sketch comedy]] show for the student body, shortly before [[Final examination|finals]] week, showcasing original material written and performed by the Commedus cast (commonly known as the "Commedes"). The show is widely acclaimed by the USC theater community, and performances are regularly sold out. Commedus is currently in the process of filming sketches, which will be released on the troupe's [http://www.justinbettman.com/commedus/?page_id=38 website]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

==Annual Improv-a-thon==
Every [[Spring (season)|spring]], Commedus performs 24 straight hours of improv as a [[fundraiser]]. The event begins at 2 p.m. Thursday and ends with Commedus' regular lawn show, from 1-2 p.m. Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailytrojan.com/2012/03/22/long-running-joke/ |title=Long-running joke |publisher=Daily Trojan |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has become a staple of the Commedus calendar, and is well-attended throughout its twenty-four-hour span.

==Audition process==
Commedus Interruptus holds auditions each [[Fall]], open to [[undergraduates]] of all [[Academic major|majors]]. The primary [[audition]]s are administered jointly with three other USC improv troupes: [[Second Nature Improv|Second Nature]], The Merry Men, and Spoiler Alert, after which each troupe will offer callbacks on an individual basis. Commedus is unique, however, in that it requires an additional workshop phase: eight candidates are selected to be mentored by the troupe over a six-week period, after which 1-4 will be invited onto the troupe proper. This unusual process is designed to assess the candidates' ability to display talent consistently, take direction and improve over time, and work collaboratively with the rest of the group.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The group originally consisted of Frankie Manning dancing with Ann Johnson and Russell Williams dancing with Willamae Ricker.  Later Helen Daniels joined the group and partnered Frankie Manning.  The group performed [[Lindy Hop]], [[Conga (dance)|Conga]], [[jazz dance]], [[tap dance]], [[Latin dance]]s, and comedy with musicians and vocalists such as [[Alvino Rey]], [[Lucky Millinder]], [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Count Basie]], [[Erskine Hawkins]], [[Andy Kirk (musician)|Andy Kirk]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], and [[Cab Calloway]].

The group disbanded in 1955.  For their final performance at a benefit in [[Philadelphia]], [[Lionel Hampton]] refused to play the music for their act.  Consequently, the Congaroos did not get a chance to rehearse and were forced to improvise their entire act to music that Lionel Hampton chose.

'''''Country''''' was the first book published by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine critic [[Nick Tosches]]. Released in 1977 under the title '''''Country: The Biggest Music in America''''', it was retitled in later editions as '''''Country: Living Legends and Dying Metaphors in America's Biggest Music''''' and '''''Country: The Twisted Roots of Rock and Roll'''''.

Rather than a detailed, chronological study of country music, the book is arranged like a fan's scrapbook, leaping across time and subject. Throughout ''Country'', Tosches makes a point of paying tribute to pivotal but undersung figures in country, hillbilly, and blues music, including [[Emmett Miller]], [[Cliff Carlisle]], and [[Val and Pete]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puremusic.com/tosches.html Review of Country: The Twisted Roots of Rock 'n' Roll from Puremusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He also pays tribute to early music writers, such as [[Emma Bell Miles]], whose 1904 essay "Some Real American Music" Tosches called "the most beautiful prose written of country music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/30/some-real-american-music-reexamined/ Some Real American Music -- Reexamined]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cracked After Hours''' was a comedy [[web series]] hosted on the website [[Cracked.com]], and produced by Cracked and its parent company [[The E. W. Scripps Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digiday.com/video/demand-medias-unlikely-success-story/ "Demand Media's Unlikely Success Story"].

''Comedy Spot Nation'' On April 18, 2013 In Featured Reviews&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

== Overview ==
The scripted comedy follows four friends/co-workers of Cracked.com who meet after work at their local diner.&lt;ref name=dead&gt;[http://comedytvisdead.com/2013/03/10/cracked-after-hours-or-how-to-do-internet-comedy-right/ "Cracked After Hours; Or, How to do Internet Comedy Right "].

By Shannon M. Houston  |  December 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was launched on July 19, 2010 with an episode centered around the 1985 film ''[[Back to the Future]]'', and grew to become the most viewed web series on Cracked.com.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt; The show's first 13 episodes reached 15 million views by April 2012 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/04/16/exclusive-how-comedian-daniel-obrien-turned-one-joke-into-a-major-book-deal/ "How Comedian Daniel O'Brien Turned One Joke Into a Major Book Deal"].

''Stated Magazine'',&lt;/ref&gt;

The series integrates crudely [[Animation|animated]] segments created by artists Winston Roundtree, Brett Herholz, Anthony Clark, and Matt Barrs. Characters' thoughts are illustrated by thought-bubbles or full-screen display. The first 22 episodes were directed by Justin Viar. Subsequent episodes have been directed by Abe Epperson and Adam Ganser.

In 2013 ''After Hours'' was nominated for a Webby Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevideoink.com/breaking-news/nominees-18th-annual-webby-awards/#.VB9KFRYQZco "And the Nominees for the 18th Annual Webby Awards Are…"].

'''''Dead Silence''''' is a 2007 American [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[James Wan]] and written by [[Leigh Whannell]], the creators of ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]''. The film stars [[Ryan Kwanten]], [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Roberts]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]], and [[Amber Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 10 Killer Toy Movies for the Holidays!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/18495/the-top-10-killer-toy-movies-for-the-holidays/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=BLOODY DISGUSTING LLC|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=Chris Eggertsen|date=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the movie did receive negative reviews at its release, it has since gathered a cult following.

==Plot==
Jamie Ashen and his wife, Lisa, receive an anonymous gift of a [[ventriloquist]] doll called "Billy". While Lisa is playing with Billy, a figure approaches her, causing her to scream. Jamie finds her dead with her tongue cut out. After Jamie is released from custody by Detective Jim Lipton due to lack of evidence, he spots inside Billy's box a mysterious message about "Mary Shaw", a deceased ventriloquist from his hometown, Raven's Fair.

At Raven's Fair, Jamie visits his estranged and wealthy father, Edward (who uses a wheelchair), and his much-younger wife, Ella, for information regarding Mary Shaw. Dismissing them as superstitions, Jamie arranges for Lisa's funeral with the help of a local mortician, Henry Walker. Jamie meets Henry's senile wife, Marion, who tells him of the danger of Mary and her puppet, Billy. After burying Billy, Jamie is confronted by Detective Lipton in his motel room, the latter still doubting Jamie, and digs up Billy, after Jamie leaves the cemetery where Mary Shaw and the rest of her dummies are buried. 

Henry tells Jamie that Mary Shaw was a famous ventriloquist who was publicly humiliated when a young boy named Michael rudely claimed that he could see her lips moving during one of her performances. Michael disappeared some weeks later, and his family blamed it on Shaw and lynched her. Mary's last wish was to have her body turned into a dummy and buried with her 101 dolls. Henry, then the young son of the local mortician, saw Shaw (after she was turned to a dummy) rise up, but Henry was spared thanks to his having kept his mouth shut. This is because Shaw takes her revenge by killing only those who scream. Jamie finds out that Michael, the first victim, was his great uncle; the Ashen family were the ones who killed Shaw by cutting out her tongue, and she has been seeking revenge against their entire bloodline by killing them in the same way.

While crawling under the house after discovering Marion with the Billy puppet, Henry is killed by Shaw, who steals his tongue. Detective Lipton discovers that all of Shaw's dolls have been dug up. He informs Jamie, who receives a call from "Henry," asking him to go to Shaw's theatre. There, both Jamie and Detective Lipton discover 100 of the dolls lined up with Michael's body, which has been turned into a marionette. Through a clown doll, Shaw reveals to Jamie that she killed his wife because she was pregnant with his son, thus killing any potential newborn of the Ashen family. Jamie and Lipton burn the theatre and all of Shaw's dolls, though in the process, Shaw successfully makes Detective Lipton scream and kills him.

Back at his father's residence, Jamie is confronted by Mary Shaw, but he repels her by throwing Billy (the 101st and last of the remaining dummies) into the fireplace. He is horrified to learn that his father had already died long ago; the current "Edward" is a doll converted from his corpse and controlled by Ella, who is the "perfect doll" for Shaw, created just before her death. He screams as Ella, possessed by Mary Shaw, lunges at him.

The film ends with Jamie reciting a nursery rhyme about Shaw and a photo album with human puppets is shown: Lisa, Henry, Detective Lipton, Edward, Ella, and Jamie himself.

==Alternate footage==
Many alternate scenes were released on the unrated DVD and HD DVD and are listed below: 

* Detective Lipton has a conversation with his colleague before interrogating Jamie on Lisa's death.
* Mary Shaw's performance at the theatre is extended.
* Jamie walking through Mary Shaw's property is slightly extended.
* The unrated version depicts Detective Lipton rowing the boat towards the dilapidated theatre to chase Jamie.
* Mary Shaw is depicted several times throughout the unrated version with a long, slimy tongue, made of the numerous tongues from her victims. In the scenes, she uses her tongue to frighten her victims, making it slither from her mouth (and licks Jamie's cheek in one scene). Along with the tongues of her victims, Mary acquires their voices as well.
* Jamie attempting to swim out of the theatre is slightly extended.
* In an alternate ending, Ella simply knocks Jamie out after he discovers his father was a puppet all along. Then, she explains that the original Ella was a human being with Edward as an abusive husband. Edward knocked her down the stairs and killed their unborn child. Ella dug up the grave where the puppet Billy was buried and became possessed by Mary Shaw. Afterwards, Ella makes a family photograph, and then, dressed as Mary Shaw, tells a bedtime story to a child by candlelight, later revealed to be Jamie with his tongue ripped out (or would have been had they added the visual effect planned). This story is the poem. Ella also reveals that only silence can save you from Mary Shaw. Then she blows out the candle, ending the movie.
* [[Billy the Puppet|The Billy puppet]], from the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], makes a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]; it can be seen sitting on the floor as Jamie starts to walk towards the clown doll.

==Post-release commentary==
In his personal [[blog]], screenwriter Whannell reveals the origins of the film within the context of the [[Film industry#Hollywood|"Hollywood" film industry]]. In a candid post entitled "Dud Silence: The Hellish Experience of Making a Bad Horror Film", Whannell explains that the film was conceived following the advice of his [[Talent agent|agent]] at the time and that a "[[script doctor]]" was eventually employed by the [[Film studio|production studio]]. Whannell concludes the post with a description of the key lessons that were learned following the ''Dead Silence'' experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After everything is said and done, I'm almost glad ''Dead Silence'' happened, because it gave me an extreme, coal-face lesson in what not to do. It was like learning to swim by leaping off Niagara Falls. I only write scripts on spec now, which means that I write them in my own time without getting paid and then take them out into the world to see if anyone's interested. Never again will I enter the arranged marriage of selling a pitch. I have also become very gun-shy about working with studios. In the world of independent film, what you write ends up on screen. Plus, they don't have the money to bring in script doctors! Works fine for me. Who knows, maybe one day I will work with a studio again...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dud Silence: The Hellish Experience Of Making A Bad Horror Film|url=http://thewordinthestone.com/#!111|work=Word In The Stone|publisher=Leigh Whannell|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=Leigh Whannell|date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">'''Euphorium''' was a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] theater installation produced by [[Antenna Theater]] that ran from 2000 to 2002 in [[San Francisco, California]], [[London, England]], and [[Black Rock City, Nevada]].  

The piece is based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem, [[Kubla Khan]].  It was one of a series of installations Antenna Theater's director, Chris Hardman, describes as "walkmanology", in which audience members are guided through a set wearing headphone devices.  For Euphorium, the audience members were given specially-designed helmets that included not only stereo speakers, but also a periscope-like device by which they would view a diorama created on a room's ceiling as they walked slowly through the performance.  Infrared triggers would initiate various [[mp3]]-encoded audio segments as they passed.&lt;ref name=sfg/&gt;  The result was alternately described as an immersive [[multimedia]] performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Editing Environments: The Architecture of Electronic Texts|author=Neil Fraistat|url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/fqn032v1|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Gothic aesthetics|gothic]] theater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4fnEHOuZ6UC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=euphorium+coleridge|title=The Routledge Companion to Gothic|author=Catherine Spooner, Emma McEvoy|publisher=Routledge|date=2007|isbn=978-0-415-39843-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardman had founded a successful company, [[Antenna Audio]], by applying the innovation to self-guided museum tours, beginning with [[Alcatraz Island]].&lt;ref name=sfg&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=You're Dreaming: A psychedelic journey awaits all who find their way to Antenna Theater's "Euphorium'|author=Robert Hurwitt|date=2001-02-17|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/02/17/DD148057.DTL&amp;hw=KUBLA&amp;sn=003&amp;sc=823}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The production also made use of a 19th-century optical technique known as "[[Pepper's Ghost]]", and various puppetry techniques, which Hardman learned in the 1970s as a member of [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] at [[Coney Island]].&lt;ref name=sfg/&gt;&lt;ref name=hm&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Hardman does it with smoke, mirrors and a tape player|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/11/09/NB40913.DTL|author=Alex Horvath|date=2001-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial production ran from 2000 to 2001 in an old army building in the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name=sfg/&gt; that also included a mock [[opium den]].&lt;ref name=hm/&gt;  In 2002-2003 Antenna partnered with Soho Theatre Company for a run in the cave-like basement of [[The Roundhouse]] in [[Camden Town]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=British Broadcasting Company|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/theatre/euphorium.shtml|title=The Euphor!um experience:From Xanadu to Camden |author=Mark Shenton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/euphorium-the-stately-pleasuredome-camdenstyle-639683.html|title=Euphorium: The stately pleasure-dome, Camden-style; Coleridge's opium poetry fragment 'Kubla Khan' comes to life in a London undercroft|author=Phil Tinline|date=2002-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response was mixed, with some complaining that the show's technology and effects were unrefined.&lt;ref name=sfg/&gt;  The production was also criticized as being confusing, and showing a misunderstanding of the meaning of Coleridge's poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Curtain Up|date=2002|author=Brian Glover|url=http://www.curtainup.com/euphorium.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features include the ability to build relationships between the characters to improve their abilities, adjustable difficulty levels, a mode that disables the [[permanent death]] of characters, and multiple camera perspectives in battle.

The story of ''Awakening'' takes place 2000 years after the events of the [[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|original ''Fire Emblem'']] and ''[[Fire Emblem Gaiden]]'', focusing on a group of soldiers from the kingdom of Ylisse. The player controls a customizable Avatar character, (known widely by Fire Emblem fans as Robin, his/her default name) who suffers from amnesia. The Avatar is taken in by Chrom, the prince of Ylisse, and his personal army known as the "shepherds" of Ylisse. Over the course of the story, the Avatar aids Chrom's army in defending Ylisse from monsters dubbed the Risen, and attacks from the hostile nation of Plegia.

Development of ''Fire Emblem Awakening'' began in 2010, with multiple veterans of the ''Fire Emblem'' series filling key development roles. Development was handled by Intelligent Systems with supervision from Nintendo. As the series had seen declining sales with previous installments, ''Awakening'' was designed as the possible last entry in the series, with elements from all previous ''Fire Emblem'' games incorporated. Due to the 3DS still being fine-tuned by developers, the team's decisions for content and graphics were made based on what they thought was feasible for what they had available to them. However, some gameplay options and proposals were met with mixed feelings, such as the option to disable permanent character death, often known as '[[permadeath]]', a staple of the ''Fire Emblem'' franchise.

Upon release, the game received critical acclaim and achieved strong sales worldwide, with many critics praising the new additions to the traditional gameplay and accessibility to newcomers of the series. After release, the game was nominated for multiple awards from video game publications, often being cited as one of the best games on the 3DS platform, is credited with boosting sales for the 3DS and is considered [[List of games considered the best|one of the best role-playing video games of all time]]. ''Awakening''{{'}}s commercial success ensured the continuation of the series. The successor of ''Awakening'', ''[[Fire Emblem Fates]]'', was released in Japan in June 2015, and in Western territories in February 2016.

==Gameplay==

In ''Fire Emblem Awakening'', the player begins the game as one of the central characters, a customizable Tactician Avatar: the Avatar's gender, hair color, feature types, and voice can all be customized.&lt;ref name= "SilCustom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/03/22/a-look-at-fire-emblem-awakenings-dual-system-and-class-change-features/|title=A Look At Fire Emblem: Awakening’s Dual System And Class Change Features|author=Sahdev, Ishaan|publisher=Siliconera|date=March 22, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818155356/http://www.siliconera.com/2012/03/22/a-look-at-fire-emblem-awakenings-dual-system-and-class-change-features|archivedate=August 18, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two modes of play: Casual Mode and Classic Mode. In Classic mode, characters defeated in battle are [[Permanent death|permanently dead]], unable to be used for the rest of the game. Casual Mode enables the player to disable permanent character deaths. With permanent death disabled, fallen units are restored after the completion of the battle.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "AndriaDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comzyw/fire_emblem_permadeath/|title=Fire Emblem 3DS Includes Permadeath Option|author=Gantayat, Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=March 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421001714/http://andriasang.com/comzyw/fire_emblem_permadeath/|archivedate=April 21, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chrom or the Avatar character dies in battle in any mode, the player receives a "Game Over" message and must restart the battle.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "1upPreview"/&gt; The game has multiple difficulty levels: the three standard modes are Normal, Hard and Lunatic. A fourth difficulty level, Lunatic+, is unlocked after completing the game on Lunatic mode.&lt;ref name= "IGNpreview"/&gt; The playing mode and difficulty level are selected at the beginning of a new game.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"/&gt;

After the player is given access to a party of characters, they can travel across a world map both to new locations and revisit old locations. The time of day on the world map is synced to the player's time zone and time of day. New locations can contain main story missions as well as side stories where new characters can be recruited. Previously visited locations have shops where the player can acquire new weapons. They also can contain random enemy skirmishes. Between missions, players can go to a customizable central base called the Barracks, where the player can watch scenes between characters and perform other activities.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn02.nintendo-europe.com/media/downloads/games_8/emanuals/nintendo_3ds_2/fire_emblem__awakening_1/ElectronicManual_Nintendo3DS_FireEmblemAwakening_EN.pdf|title=Fire Emblem Awakening European instruction manual|format=PDF|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can recruit approximately forty characters, not including characters included in downloadable content.&lt;ref name= "KotakuTips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5981450/tips-for-playing-fire-emblem-awakening|title=Tips for Playing Fire Emblem: Awakening|author=Totilo, Stephan|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407002548/http://kotaku.com/5981450/tips-for-playing-fire-emblem-awakening|archivedate=April 7, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features multiple uses of the [[Nintendo 3DS]]-exclusive [[SpotPass and StreetPass]] functions via the world map. During navigation, the player can encounter other players and interact via StreetPass. The player can do battle with a party of up to ten characters from another player's world.

===Battle system===
[[File:Fire Emblem Awakening gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Screenshot of a battle in ''Fire Emblem Awakening'', showing two characters about to fight one another. The basic mechanics of the battle system are all displayed.]]
''Awakening'' uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] [[tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]] battle system. The terrain is displayed on the top screen of the 3DS, while unit information is displayed on the bottom screen. Before each battle, the player selects a limited number of characters from their roster for use in battle. The player can either control each unit manually or activate an auto-battle option. Character movement is dictated by a tile-based movement system. During combat, player-controlled sprite characters and enemy units controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) each get one turn where they position their units. An additional turn is added when unaffiliated AI-controlled units are in the field. Playable characters positioned next to each other in the field will support one-another, granting buffs, and performing actions such as blocking attacks. Two characters can also pair up as a single mobile unit, enabling both units to attack at once. As the relationship between characters strengthens, they gain greater bonuses to their strength and effectiveness when paired up in battle.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1upPreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/fire-emblem-awakening-killing |title=Fire Emblem Awakening: Killing for Keeps |author=Parish, Jeremy |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XK9tOtQO?url=http://www.1up.com/previews/fire-emblem-awakening-killing |archivedate=March 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During combat, the perspective switches to a 3D scene between combatants. Optional camera angles, including a first-person view through the eyes of playable characters, can be activated using the 3DS stylus.&lt;ref name="IGNpreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/01/11/the-incredible-depth-of-fire-emblem-awakening |title=The Incredible Depth of Fire Emblem Awakening |author=Drake, Audrey |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XLdY7eds?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/11/the-incredible-depth-of-fire-emblem-awakening |archivedate=March 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During battles, characters earn [[experience point]]s (XP) through successful actions during battle. When the character has reached 100 XP, their level is raised by one, increasing various stats including health and attack power. New skills are also learned by each character.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "SilClass"/&gt; The game includes a [[character class]] system, with approximately forty classes available.&lt;ref name= "AndriaDeath"/&gt; Each character, including the Avatar, has a starting class. When a unit reaches Level 10, they can either upgrade or change their classes using special items called Master Seals and Second Seals. A Master Seal promotes the character's class, improving character stats and giving access to new ability sets or weapons. A Second Seal allows a character to change class, or "reclass", when they are either at Level 10 or have reached their current Advanced Class. Upon reclassing, a character's experience level is reset to Level 1 while their stats and abilities are retained. The classes that most characters can reclass into are limited. The exception to this is the Avatar, who is able to reclass into any class available to their gender. Regardless of future changes, characters retain learned skills from earlier classes.&lt;ref name= "SilClass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/02/02/how-you-change-classes-in-fire-emblem-awakening-and-why-its-useful/|title=How You Change Classes In Fire Emblem: Awakening And Why Its Useful|author=Hou, Laura|publisher=Siliconera|date=February 2, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821132305/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/02/02/how-you-change-classes-in-fire-emblem-awakening-and-why-its-useful|archivedate=August 21, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A character's class affects both their attack capabilities and their mobility on the battlefield: for example, mages and archers can attack at greater ranges than melee units, mounted units have more powerful attacks than foot units, while flying units have greater mobility and range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/fire-emblem-awakening-character-guide/|title=Fire Emblem: Awakening character guide|author=Concepcion, Miguel|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224075532/http://www.gamesradar.com/fire-emblem-awakening-character-guide/|archivedate=December 24, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between characters are built up through Support conversations between chapters. The normal rankings of relationships are C to A, with A standing for a close friendship. For characters of opposing genders, an additional S ranking is available, in which the characters fall in love, marry and have children. Relationships also have a direct impact during battles, with certain character pairings granting positive effects such as increased mobility or an automatic guarding action. A couple's children can be found and recruited in optional chapters made available by the parent characters' marriage, with their appearance and in-game abilities varying depending on who their parents were. Most characters have a specific list of units which they can have Support conversations with; the Avatar can build a relationship with all characters, and (depending on their chosen gender) marry any unit from any generation as long as they are not a direct descendant.&lt;ref name= "FEAmanual"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "SilMarriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/01/25/the-benefits-of-getting-married-in-fire-emblem-awakening/|title=The Benefits Of Getting Married In Fire Emblem: Awakening|author=Hou, Laura|publisher=Siliconera|date=January 25, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831121005/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/01/25/the-benefits-of-getting-married-in-fire-emblem-awakening|archivedate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
&lt;!-- The player protagonist is referred to by developers and in promotional material as Avatar, never being given any kind of formal name or gender. Please do not use the default name "Robin" in the text. --&gt;
The game takes place approximately 2000 years after the events of ''[[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Fire Emblem Awakening | developer = [[Intelligent Systems]]/[[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | date = February 4, 2013 | platform = [[Nintendo 3DS]] | scene = Tiki Support Conversation B – Male Avatar | level =  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, the Fell Dragon Grima attempted to destroy the world. To stop Grima, the Divine Dragon Naga (voiced by [[Mela Lee]]) chose the ruler of the Halidom of Ylisse (known as the First Exalt) and granted them power through two magical objects: Falchion, a sword with the power to slay dragons; and the Fire Emblem, a magical shield. Using these, the Exalt struck down Grima, sending it into a long slumber.&lt;ref name="chapter 1 end"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Fire Emblem Awakening | developer = [[Intelligent Systems]]/[[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | date = February 4, 2013 | platform = [[Nintendo 3DS]] | scene = | level = Chapter 1: Unwelcome Change | quote = '''Frederick''': The exalt is a symbol of peace—Ylisse's most prized quality. Long ago, at the dawn of our age, the fell dragon tried to destroy the world. But the first exalt joined forces with the divine dragon and laid the beast low. Exalt Emmeryn reminds us all of the peace we fought for then.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the intervening period, the continents of Archanea and Valentia became known as Ylisse and Valm.

By the present time, the land of Ylisse is divided between Halidom of Ylisse, which continues to worship Naga, and is ruled by Exalt Emmeryn (voiced by Erin Fitzgerald) and defended by the Shepherds, her brother Chrom's (voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]]) militia force; the kingdom of Plegia, which worships Grima; and Regna Ferox, a country whose rulers periodically compete for dominance. Fifteen years prior to ''Awakening'', the last Exalt of Ylisse, Emmeryn's father, waged a [[religious war]] against Plegia, which greatly damaged both countries and left bitterness on both sides. Ylisse has slowly recovered from the war thanks to Emmeryn's peaceful actions.&lt;ref name="chapter 6 beginning"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Fire Emblem Awakening | developer = [[Intelligent Systems]]/[[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | date = February 4, 2013 | platform = [[Nintendo 3DS]] | scene = | level = Chapter 6: Forseer | quote = '''Chrom''': …Not everything Gangrel said was a lie. The last exalt, my father, waged war on Plegia for many years. The violence… It was a brutal campaign, ending only with his death 15 years ago. Plegia rightfully remembers their suffering, but his [Chrom's father's] war was no kinder to his own people. As the fighting dragged on, out army became more and more diminished. Farmers who could barely wield a pitchfork were conscripted and sent to their deaths. Soon there was no food at all, and the kingdom began to collapse. I was young, but I remember those dark times. ...I know how they affected Emmeryn. / '''Avatar''': Such an experience would change anyone. / '''Chrom''': Indeed. When our father died before her 10th year, he left her quite the legacy… Plegia's desire for vengeance… Our own people's unbridled rage… My sister became a target for blame on all sides. Her own subjects began to hurl insults—and stones. She still bears the scar from one… But she never let them see her pain.

Two years after Gangrel's defeat, Chrom inherits the throne of Ylisse, marries, and fathers a newborn daughter named Lucina. Chrom leads the Shepherds again when Emperor Walhart of Valm threatens to invade Ylisse. During the campaign, "Marth" returns, and reveals that she is a Lucina from an alternate timeline from more than 10 years in the future where Grima has been resurrected, and used a time traveling spell devised by Naga to return to the past in order to prevent the events leading to her future. To combat Grima, Chrom must perform the "Awakening", a ritual that grants him Naga's power, by combining the Fire Emblem with five magical gems divided among the nations. During and after the war in Valm, the Shepherds manage to retrieve four of the gemstones. They are then ambushed by Validar, the new king of Plegia and the Avatar's father, after he offers them the last gemstone. Validar takes control of the Avatar and steals the Fire Emblem from Chrom. He also reveals that the Avatar was born as the ideal vessel for Grima. Lucina realizes that Grima used the Avatar to kill Chrom in her timeline, and attempts to execute them; Chrom forces her to stand down, remaining confident the Avatar can overcome Grima's control. Alternatively, if the Avatar is Lucina's husband or mother, Lucina is unable to go through with it and stands down on her own. The Shepherds manage to track down Validar, who uses the Avatar to attack Chrom, mirroring the events of their nightmare. However, the Avatar uses their foreknowledge to prevent Chrom's death, allowing the Shepherds to kill Validar and recover the Fire Emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Fire Emblem Awakening | developer = [[Intelligent Systems]]/[[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | date = February 4, 2013 | platform = [[Nintendo 3DS]] | scene = | level = Chapter 23: Invisible Ties | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the possessed Avatar from Lucina's future appears, revealing that the present timeline Avatar's amnesia was caused by Grima's unsuccessful attempt to possess them. The future Avatar then uses the power gathered for Grima's resurrection to restore its dragon form. In a race against time, Chrom performs the Awakening and summons Naga. Although Chrom now has the power to stop Grima, Naga reveals that she only has enough power to put Grima to sleep for another thousand years. Naga explains that the only way to truly destroy Grima is to have him destroy himself through the Avatar, which could come at cost of the Avatar's life. Naga tells them that the Avatar will only survive if their bonds with Chrom and the Shepherds are strong enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Fire Emblem Awakening | developer = [[Intelligent Systems]]/[[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | date = February 4, 2013 | platform = [[Nintendo 3DS]] | scene = | level = Chapter 25: To Slay a God | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final battle, the Shepherds manage to weaken Grima. Chrom, already set against the sacrifice of the Avatar, offers to deliver the final blow to the fell dragon. Depending on the player's final choice, the game will reach one of two different endings. If the player lets Chrom deal the final blow, Grima is put back to sleep for another thousand years, though the Avatar is left with regrets. If the player stops Chrom from dealing the final blow, the Avatar will kill Grima, causing both to vanish.&lt;ref name="endgame avatar ending"&gt;{{cite video game | title = Fire Emblem Awakening | developer = [[Intelligent Systems]]/[[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] | publisher = [[Nintendo]] | date = February 4, 2013 | platform = [[Nintendo 3DS]] | scene = | level = Endgame: Grima | quote = '''Avatar''': ''[to a distraught Chrom]'' May we meet again…in a better life.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrom and the Shepherds refuse to believe that the Avatar is dead, and vow to find them and bring them home. In a post-credits scene, the Avatar wakes up in a field similar to the beginning of the game, where Chrom and Lissa find them and welcome them home.

==Development==
The original planning for ''Fire Emblem Awakening'' began in 2010, when [[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] director Genki Yokota was finishing his work on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]''. The game was co-developed by Nintendo and regular ''Fire Emblem'' developer [[Intelligent Systems]]. Among the staff members were veterans of the ''Fire Emblem'' series, including project manager Masahiro Higuchi, who had first worked on ''[[Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War]]'', and Intelligent Systems producer Kouhei Maeda, who first worked as a scenario writer for ''[[Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade]]''.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fireemblem.nintendo.com/developer-interview/|title=Fire Emblem Awakening Developer Interview|author=[[8-4|8–4 Inc.]]|publisher=Fire Emblem Official Website|accessdate=March 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210114506/http://fireemblem.nintendo.com/developer-interview/|archivedate=February 10, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first proposals were made after the completion of ''[[Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem]]'', a remake for the [[Nintendo DS]] of the [[Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem|third game]]. Development was very slow for the first year, during which time producer Hitoshi Yamagami organized the game's development structure. Once this was completed, he handed the main production duties over to co-director Genki Yokota.&lt;ref name="FEAiwata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Fire-Emblem-Awakening/Fire-Emblem-Awakening/1-An-All-New-Fire-Emblem/1-An-All-New-Fire-Emblem-724239.html |title=Iwata asks "Fire Emblem Awakening" |publisher=Nintendo UK |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XL4K0x72?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Fire-Emblem-Awakening/Fire-Emblem-Awakening/1-An-All-New-Fire-Emblem/1-An-All-New-Fire-Emblem-724239.html |archivedate=March 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art director was Toshiyuki Kusakihara. Character designs were done by Kusakihara and [[Yūsuke Kozaki]].&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; Kusakihara was brought on board to offer a fresh perspective on the ''Fire Emblem'' series and new ideas for the team, while Kozaki was brought in to help create a distinctive art style that would be well received overseas, as had his previous work for the [[Wii]] title ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]''.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; During development, Kusakihara and Kozaki had lengthy meetings about various aspects of the game. These meetings became so time-consuming that Kusakihara compared his situation to the [[Urashima Tarō|legend of Urashima Tarō]].&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt;

Due to declining sales for the series, the developers were told by Nintendo that ''Awakening'' would be the last ''Fire Emblem'' game if it failed to sell above 250,000 units. This caused panic for the team, with them considering including a high number of elements new to the game. Among the concepts were a modern-day setting or using the planet [[Mars]] as a setting. Eventually, the team decided that these elements would alienate rather than attract players and stuck to the medieval setting and style of previous ''Fire Emblem'' titles.&lt;ref name="FEAlast"/&gt; As a compromise, the team decided to make it the "culmination" of all the games in ''Fire Emblem'' series to that point, incorporating gameplay elements from multiple titles. This approach was approved by the team and the proposal was completed within a month, though the decision also created difficulties with choosing which elements to include, and how to balance them so they did not clash with one another. The game's final title, "''Awakening''", was born from this concept of an ultimate ''Fire Emblem'' game. It was initially just casually suggested by Yamagami when discussing ideas for a title with Yokota, and Yokota liked it. As development progressed, the team continued to come up with ideas that increased workload, but they maintained a positive attitude and pushed forward in spite of the consequent pressures.&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; Internally, the game was known as ''Fire Emblem Fin: The Children from the Brink''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:メイキング オブ ファイアーエムブレム 開発秘話で綴る25周年、覚醒そしてif|publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]]|isbn=978-4198640569|date=November 28, 2015|pages=60–61|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maeda was mainly responsible for the original scenario, thinking out the rough outline before the team created the events of each chapter in detail. Some plot points, such as the true identity of "Marth", were planned from an early stage, while many of the other plot twists came about during its development. Many of them were added at the suggestion of team members from both Intelligent Systems and Nintendo.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; Two key story themes while developing the game were the love for the characters, and the bonds characters developed over the course of the story. The latter theme was expressed in gameplay through the cooperative behavior of adjacent characters. While voice acting was included, it was limited to snappy lines meant to evoke a certain feeling. This was because the team had concerns about the amount of content in the game, which would increase a great deal with full voice acting, and its effect on the pacing. The team also used multiple well-known Japanese voice actors for the characters. Special voice overs and visuals were created for the character "confession" sequences.&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; All the main characters had a personalized back story, and appropriate personalities were chosen for them.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; The first one to be finalized was the child character Inigo, who was created by character planner Nami Kumoru.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; A large team of writers were employed to create the character dialogue, and a [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] containing the characters' personality traits was created for the writers to work from. While developing the playable and enemy characters, the team used feedback from fans saying they should name all the characters, including foot soldiers. Wanting to give the impression of every character having their own lives, they created full artwork for all characters.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; Creating the characters proved to be one of the hardest parts of development.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; While designing the characters, Kozaki took their backstories into account: for example, the [[thief]] character Gaius was drawn with a sack of [[Candy|sweets]], as he had a love for them.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; Kozaki was also responsible for creating the 2D artwork which represented the characters during conversations.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;

===Design===
[[File:FE; Awakening FPV screenshot.jpg|thumb|The game's optional first-person perspective during battle, one of the several features new to the ''Fire Emblem'' series, was included to increase player freedom and show off the platform's 3D effects.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt;]]
Once Nintendo gave the go-ahead for development, Intelligent Systems formed a small internal development team to handle the project. ''Awakening'' was the first ''Fire Emblem'' game for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was as yet unreleased and still undergoing final development. Because of this, the team had a large number of ideas for features to include, but they also only had a limited idea of what the system was capable of. Consequently, they had difficulties deciding how the 2D sprites and 3D environments would interact with each other, and ensuring they did not [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clip through objects]].&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; One notable feature missing from in-game character models was their feet. The original idea was to add a unique and uniform deformation to characters. As the team did not have much knowledge of the platform's CPU strength, the amount of character bones they could include were intentionally limited. This meant that the bones needed for the operation of ankles and feet were omitted. Later, it was discovered that ankles and feet could be included, but the team decided to leave that for a future game if it came to pass.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; A different explanation was that the team wanted players to focus on the top half of characters, so made their heads the largest part of their character models while shrinking their feet.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;

The concept for character graphics on the map underwent changes. Initially, some of the team felt that accurately displaying a character's equipment and class would be enough, but later it was decided to give them all individual characteristics. They were also able to add more unique character expressions than previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, enabling a greater emotional range during scenes of drama.&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; A different element was the environmental effects the team incorporated, such as dust clouds when characters performed actions in battle.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; For the full-motion cutscenes, the team wanted to create a sense of grandeur and spectacle, using the openings of [[Taiga drama|Taiga drama series]] as inspiration.&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; Japanese animation company Kamikaze Douga was in charge of supervising the production and art assets of the game's cutscenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamikazedouga.co.jp/contents/works_52.html|title=神風動画 / Works / ファイアーエムブレム 覚醒|language=Japanese|publisher=Kamikaze Douga|date=2012|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127003809/http://www.kamikazedouga.co.jp/contents/works_52.html|archivedate=January 27, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutscene animation was handled by Studio Anima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studioanima.co.jp/project/project-100/|title=ニンテンドー3DS™用ソフト「ファイアーエムブレム 覚醒」|language=Japanese|publisher=Anima Studios|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824105118/http://www.studioanima.co.jp/project/project-100/|archivedate=August 24, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to team members, their request to Studio Anima was to make the world "come alive" during the full-motion sequences, which were included at crucial moments in the plot.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;

The first part of the game to receive full attention from the team was the gameplay. As a test map, the team used the opening map for ''Mystery of the Emblem''. One of the early options was switching between 16x16 and 24x24 pixel characters depending on the camera's overhead distance. In the end, the team used a hardware-based scaling system instead of switching between graphics types so as to keep the frame rate consistent in battle. While designing the levels, the team created both maps with a plot-driven structure and maps that allowed for player freedom. An aspect of the battle system new to the series was the inclusion of an optional first-person viewpoint during battles. This was done with western players in mind, as developers wanted to both give players an option on their perspective in battle and demonstrate the platform's 3D effects.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; The difficulty levels proved a point of debate amongst the team, ranging from the naming of difficulties to whether to include the ability to adjust it on the fly, which some felt was contrary to ''Fire Emblem'' traditions. There was also debate about both the inclusion and mechanics of the marriage system. While some aspects went smoothly, there was contention about the ability to marry any of the characters, and Kusakihara's suggestion of having characters kissing at the conclusion of each romance was vetoed by the team.&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; An effort was made to make the interface and graphics easy for players to understand. An example of this was the cursor, which in previous games had been a triangular shape and for ''Awakening'' was changed to a pointing hand.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt; One of the more controversial ideas that made it into the final game was the "Casual Mode", first introduced in ''New Mystery of the Emblem''. Initially opposed by staff members at Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, Yamagami and others successfully defended the feature. Yamagami's stance was that modern gamers would not be pleased with needing to invest extra time because a character had died.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEAlast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/05/25/fire-emblem-awakening-was-almost-the-last-game-in-the-series/ |title=Fire Emblem: Awakening Was Almost The Last Game In The Series|author=Laura |publisher=Siliconera |date=May 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226035856/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/05/25/fire-emblem-awakening-was-almost-the-last-game-in-the-series/|archivedate=February 26, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, team members said that ''Awakening'' was the first time the team conformed to the popular image of Nintendo games being easy to play and user-friendly.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/50069/features/the-making-of-fire-emblem-awakening/|title=The making of Fire Emblem Awakening|author=East, Thomas|publisher=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''|date=May 30, 2013|accessdate=March 7, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611034646/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/50069/features/the-making-of-fire-emblem-awakening/|archivedate=June 11, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downloadable content===
''Fire Emblem Awakening'' was the first packaged title released by Nintendo to receive downloadable content (DLC) after launch, taking the form of additional maps and characters from previous entries in the ''Fire Emblem'' series. The idea for DLC content came up when the game was close to completion. Due to this, the team could not do anything that would invalidate the main story. For the additional playable characters, the team focused on the main cast, picked out the most suitable, and left the final choice to Maeda.&lt;ref name= "FEAinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "FEAiwata"/&gt; Starting from the game's release, over twenty different playable maps were released over several months at the rate of one map per week.&lt;ref name= "1upPreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "IGNpreview"/&gt; Nintendo decided to release [[downloadable content]] for the game in all available regions.&lt;ref name="siliconera2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/10/25/fire-emblem-awakening-english-trailer-is-finally-here/ |title=Fire Emblem Awakening English Trailer And Screenshots Are Here|author=Sahdev, Ishaan |publisher=Siliconera|date=October 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129061825/http://www.siliconera.com/2012/10/25/fire-emblem-awakening-english-trailer-is-finally-here/|archivedate=November 29, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it becomes available, the DLC can be accessed using the game's SpotPass system: within the context of the game's world, after a certain point in the game, the characters can access an area called the Outrealm Gate, being transported to the DLC maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2013/01/fire-emblem-awakening-dlc-and-streetpass-features-detailed|title=Fire Emblem: Awakening DLC and StreetPass features detailed|author=Romano, Sal|publisher=Gematsu|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012143836/http://gematsu.com/2013/01/fire-emblem-awakening-dlc-and-streetpass-features-detailed|archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various artists have contributed illustrations for the downloadable characters, including those who have worked on previous titles, such as Senri Kita, and newcomers, such as Kimihiko Fujisaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/04/20/drakengard-artist-helps-bring-roy-into-fire-emblem-awakening/|title=Drakengard Artist Helps Bring Roy Into Fire Emblem: Awakening|author=Yip, Spencer|publisher=Siliconera|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115012436/http://www.siliconera.com/2012/04/20/drakengard-artist-helps-bring-roy-into-fire-emblem-awakening/|archivedate=January 15, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the DLC maps received censorship upon release in North America and Europe, with a shot of a female playable character altered to hide her knickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/05/02/fire-emblem-dlc-censored-in-north-america |title=Fire Emblem DLC Censored in North America |author=Drake, Audrey |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 2, 2013 |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XMp6Ui7j?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/02/fire-emblem-dlc-censored-in-north-america |archivedate=March 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fire Emblem Awakening'' has received widespread critical acclaim, holding an aggregate score of 92/100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 72 reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaCritic"/&gt; After its release, ''Awakening'' was placed on [[GameSpot]]'s list of the best games on the 3DS, and reached second place on a similar list by [[GameTrailers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/best-3ds-games/|title=The Best 3DS Games|author=Ramsay, Randolph|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806173535/http://www.gamespot.com/best-3ds-games/|archivedate=August 6, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/ph0t8j/gt-countdown-top-3ds-games|title=GT Countdown Video – Top 3DS Games|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=April 18, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN included the game on two different lists: it reached #2 on their list of the top 25 Nintendo 3DS games, and #21 on their list of the top 125 Nintendo games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/09/10/the-top-25-nintendo-3ds-games |title=The Top 25 Nintendo 3DS Games |author=Otero, Jose |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=February 26, 2015 |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XN8Ei4Ea?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/10/the-top-25-nintendo-3ds-games |archivedate=March 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/the-top-125-nintendo-games-of-all-time |title=The Top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time |author=IGN Nintendo Nostalgia Crew |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=September 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XN83y6Uz?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/the-top-125-nintendo-games-of-all-time |archivedate=March 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s staff ranked it the eleventh best video game of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/the-25-best-video-games-of-2013/P3 | title=The 25 Best Video Games of 2013 | date=December 9, 2013 | work=Slant Magazine | accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Famitsu'' said in its review that the game could be enjoyed by hardcore fans and newcomers alike, as it made accommodations for both, and particularly praised the new gameplay features.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Audrey Drake called ''Awakening'' "the most fluid and stunning strategy RPG experience available on a portable, and features the best storytelling and production value of any 3DS game to date."&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Jeremy Parish, writing for [[1UP.com]], said that though the ''Fire Emblem'' series had changed little over the years while holding a place of respect within the genre, the changes Intelligent Systems implemented made ''Awakening'' "an engrossing title that should enjoy impressive shelf life." His main criticism was against the enemy AI, which occasionally unbalanced the gameplay.&lt;ref name= "1upReview"/&gt; Ray Carsillo of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', while sharing Parish's opinion on the lack of a restart option, called ''Awakening'' " probably the best ''Fire Emblem'' to come to the States yet."&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; While [[Eurogamer]]'s Rich Stanton, giving the game a perfect score, called it "a special game", praising its story themes and how it made him care about his characters.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt;

[[GameTrailers]] said that the game "takes positive strides forward with new additions like enhancements to the social system and battle mechanics, and the series’ established formula is all the better for it."&lt;ref name="GameTrailers"/&gt; Despite feeling mixed about the interface and multiplayer, [[GameSpot]]'s Heidi Kemps called  ''Awakening'' the best installment in the series for some time.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]], said that the development team had "added just enough to the time-tested ''Fire Emblem'' formula to bolster its challenges without cutting away its roots."&lt;ref name=Polygon/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Kimberley Wallace said that "[''Awakening''] made me scratch and claw for victory, and I savored every moment."&lt;ref name="GameInformer"/&gt; Chris Carter of [[Destructoid]], similar to ''Famitsu'', recommended it to old and new players, saying: "If you've been itching to get into a Fire Emblem game, this is a great place to start. If you've been playing them all along, you'll feel right at home."&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;

===Awards===
''Awakening'' was nominated for multiple awards after release.

===Sales===
The game's Japanese version sold exceptionally well, with it being the fastest selling entry in the series since detailed weekly tallies began.&lt;ref name="IGNsales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/25/fire-emblem-3ds-sweeps-japan-ps-vita-sales-down |title=Fire Emblem 3DS Sweeps Japan, PS Vita Sales Down|author=Drake, Audrey |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its opening week, the game managed to sell 242,600 units, reaching the top of the sales charts and beating the debut sales of the previous two ''Fire Emblem'' releases.&lt;ref name="AndriaSales"/&gt; It sold through 81.63% of its initial shipment, causing sell-outs in some stores.&lt;ref name="AndriaSales"/&gt; Japanese sales tracker [[Media Create]] attributed the initial high sales to Nintendo's promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="AndriaSales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con0ut/media_create_sales_info/|title=High Sell-Through For Fire Emblem Awakening|author=Gantayat, Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=April 27, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225080426/http://andriasang.com/con0ut/media_create_sales_info/|archivedate=December 25, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for the limited Japanese bundle also exceeded Nintendo's expectations, as the pre-order website crashed from the amount of people trying to buy it.

'''''First of the Summer Wine''''' is a [[British sitcom]] written by [[Roy Clarke]] that aired on [[BBC1]]. The pilot originally aired on 3 January 1988, and the first series of episodes followed on 4 September 1988. The show ran for two series of six episodes each, with the final episode airing on 8 October 1989. The pilot episode was produced and directed by [[Gareth Gwenlan]]. Both series of episodes were produced and directed by [[Mike Stephens]].  The [[BBC]] has never shown repeats of the show, although repeats do occasionally appear in the UK on [[Satellite television|satellite]] station [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]].&lt;ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE"&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=First of the Summer Wine – Special Article| date=| publisher=| url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/index.htm| work=Summer Wine Online| pages=| accessdate=28 December 2007| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082656/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/index.htm| archivedate=13 February 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was broadcast in Australia on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] network in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - UNCOVERED!"&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=First of the Summer Wine – Uncovered! |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |work=Summer Wine Online |pages= |accessdate=28 December 2007 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082703/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |archivedate=13 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''First of the Summer Wine'' was a [[prequel]] to Clarke's long running show, ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', portraying the youth of the principal characters from the mother show in the months leading up to World War II. With the possibility of war hanging over them, the young men and women enjoy their youth while trying to find a place for themselves in the world. The show used young, mostly unknown actors to play the characters, with only two actors from the original series making an appearance in the prequel.&lt;ref name="Bright and Ross 28"&gt;Bright and Ross (2000), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
With the success of ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', the [[BBC]] approved a new series which [[Roy Clarke]] would carry over characters of the original show.&lt;ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE" /&gt; With the new series, Clarke hoped to show the lives of his characters as they were in the "first summer" of their lives, as opposed to the last summer depicted in ''Last of the Summer Wine''. While there would still be the "shadow of the Grim Reaper" hanging over them, this time it would be because of World War II, not due to their old age.&lt;ref name="BBC Guide to Comedy"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last=| coauthors= | title=First of the Summer Wine | date=  | publisher= | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/f/firstofthesummer_7772635.shtml  | work =BBC Guide to Comedy| pages = | accessdate = 28 December 2007 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031003100438/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/f/firstofthesummer_7772635.shtml |archivedate = 3 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the new series, Clarke used mostly young, inexperienced actors to fill the roles of the characters carried over from the original series. The actors were required to mimic the vocal characteristics and mannerisms already established in ''Last of the Summer Wine'' to create a continuity between the two series.&lt;ref name="BBC Guide to Comedy"/&gt;

The show features much 1920s and 1930s music, which adds to the nostalgic feel of the show. The [[Theme music|theme tune]] is "Sweet and Lovely", sung by [[Al Bowlly]], accompanied by Roy Fox and his Band.  The recording was made in London on 18 September 1931.&lt;ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE" /&gt;

==Characters==
{{main article|List of Last of the Summer Wine characters}}
''First of the Summer Wine'' followed a group of young men and women, some of whom were adapted from ''Last of the Summer Wine'', with others being specifically created for the new show. The men consisted of Paul Wyett as the scruffy and immature Compo Simmonite; David Fenwick as meek and deep-thinking Norman Clegg; Paul McLain as snobbish ladder-climber Seymour Utterthwaite; [[Richard Lumsden]] as the eager soldier Foggy Dewhurst; Gary Whitaker as the love-smitten Wally Batty; and Paul Oldham as their friend, Sherbert. The women consisted of Helen Patrick as the object of Wally's affections, Nora Renshaw; Sarah Dangerfield as Ivy; [[Joanne Heywood]] as Dilys, [[Judy Flynn]] as Lena, and [[Linda Davidson]] as Anita Pillsworth.&lt;ref name="Bright and Ross 160" /&gt;

The adults around the young people act as supporting characters. [[Peter Sallis]] and [[Maggie Ollerenshaw]] play David and Violet Clegg, Norman's parents. [[Derek Benfield]] portrays Mr Scrimshaw, the manager of the shop where Ivy, Dilys, Sherbert, Norman and Seymour work.&lt;ref name="Bright and Ross 160" /&gt;

==Scenario==
''First of the Summer Wine'' takes place between May and September 1939, in the months leading up to World War II.&lt;ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - UNCOVERED!" /&gt; The series revolves around the diary entries of the young Norman Clegg. Each episode begins with him resting on his bedroom windowsill and greeting the day; the words "the diary of Norman Clegg, aged 18 years" introduce the theme of each episode.

Episodes revolve around the antics of the young men of a small Yorkshire village and their usually level-headed female counterparts, all of whom are grappling with the world around them, their youth, and their experiences with the opposite sex. With rumblings of war on the European continent as Hitler’s [[Nazi Germany]] and Great Britain become increasingly poised for war, the lives of the young men and women will be changed forever.&lt;ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - UNCOVERED!" /&gt;

The scenario uses [[retroactive continuity]]. In ''Last of the Summer Wine'', Seymour is introduced in later series, and is initially unknown to the other central characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First of the Summer Wine, Uncovered |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082703/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |archivedate=13 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6085">The '''Japanese Television Cartel''' was a [[cartel]] formed by the seven largest Japanese T.V. manufacturers. It operated from the 1950s until at least 1974. During that time period it engaged in illegal activities such as dumping, as well as price and output manipulation with the goal of taking control over the Japanese and American T.V. markets. Its operation halted in the aftermath of a series of investigations conducted by the authorities of the two countries.

==Background==
In 1950, the Japanese economy entered a phase of rapid growth which would last until 1973. This period was characterized by a number of protectionist policies including but not limited to the enactment of discriminatory laws towards foreign trade partners, the insulation and oligopolization of capital markets, the bureaucratic allocation of foreign exchange as well as state coordinated acquisition of foreign technology. The adoption of large scale production techniques and foreign know-how, led to a reduction in unit cost, which allowed large companies to expand their operations with the aid of loans from the country's largest banks which were given at sub-equilibrium interest rates. Nevertheless, Japan's leap into industrialization was not matched by the development of its product distribution systems, which remained largely unchanged. Companies reacted to the resulting bottleneck effect in sales by vertically integrating their sales systems, through the creation of informal business groups known as [[keiretsu]]. The formation of keiretsu, enabled manufacturers to enter into [[collusion]] with distribution companies by fixing the price of the product at an artificially low level, while the distributors' losses were secretly refunded through a system of [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]]. Distributors were accordingly rewarded or punished for their cooperation and loyalty.{{sfn|Yamamura|Vandenberg|1986|pp=238–246}} 

==Cartel==
Beginning its rise in the mid 1950s the Japanese home appliance production increased 25-fold by 1968. Pioneered in Europe and the United States, television technology spread to Japan by means of licensing arrangements and technical assistance from companies such as [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]], [[Philips]], [[General Electric]], [[Zenith Electronics]] and [[Western Electric]]. The Japanese television market was dominated by seven companies, namely [[Hitachi]], [[Toshiba]], [[Matsushita]], [[Sony]], [[Sanyo]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] and [[Mitsubishi]], who controlled a combined 99.9% of the market share. Facing the aforementioned distribution bottlenecks, television producers began dividing Japan into territories, thereafter assigning wholesalers to each one. With the wholesale industry under their complete control, television companies went on to create an undercover "Market Stabilization Group" which included the six of the biggest players in the industry excluding Sony. An investigation by the [[Fair Trade Commission (Japan)|Fair Trade Commission of Japan]] (FTCJ) uncovered a series of monthly, clandestine meetings, conducted by the higher management echelons of the industry over a period of 15 years. The group admitted to intentionally limiting the profit margin of retailers, minimizing sales to non-affiliated retailers, horizontal price and output manipulation. A further investigation also revealed the existence of a vertical price-fixing scheme between Sony and Matsushita. Despite the findings the FTCJ did not impose major fines or structural adjustments to those involved until the [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.]] lawsuit was launched in the United States in 1985.{{sfn|Yamamura|Vandenberg|1986|pp=249–255}}

Investigation within the US revealed the presence of five interconnected working groups involving all seven of the major Japanese companies, which met from 1964 until at least 1974. The groups, actively shared data on topics such as production, inventory, and shipment sizes. The information was then in ways similar to the ones already implemented in Japan. The cartels maintained an economic policy of increasing prices at the Japanese market while also [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] their products abroad, in an effort to damage their American competitors through [[predatory pricing]]. American companies failed to exploit their sudden competitive advantage on the Japanese market, while also suffering heavy losses domestically. The restructuring of the American television market resulted in the exit of 21 companies and the fall of numerous others into Japanese hands. Dumping and the aggressive use of rebates were determined to be forms of customs fraud under the 1921 U.S. Anti-Dumping Act, however. The U.S. Federal agencies such as the International Trade Commission conducted dozens of investigations, resulting in the Japanese-American Orderly Marketing Agreement, which limited the import of Japanese TV sets. In April 1980, the companies involved in the cartel were ordered to pay $66 million; however the collection of the fine was delayed for a significant time period as litigation continued. {{sfn|Yamamura|Vandenberg|1986|pp=255–266}} {{sfn|Elzinga|1999|pp=220–236}}

'''Jesus Army Productions''' is a [[performing arts]] company based in the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Barbados]].&lt;ref name="unitedcaribbean.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedcaribbean.com/jesusarmyproductions.html |title=Jesus Army Productions Christian drama leader Rommell Hall promoting Caribbean Christian dance and drama |publisher=Unitedcaribbean.com |date= |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus Army Productions came out of the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship ([[UCCF]]) at the [[University of the West Indies]], [[Cave Hill Campus]], Barbados.  Their mission is to spread the gospel of [[Jesus Christ]] in way which is comical and entertaining but that also makes you think.  Over the years, "Jesus Army Productions has developed a reputation for bringing wit and humour to serious pieces, while preaching God's word."&lt;ref name="nationnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/306080773479283.php |title=The Nation Newspaper &amp;#124; Drama's night |publisher=Nationnews.com |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213004920/http://www.nationnews.com/story/306080773479283.php |archivedate=13 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"To the uninitiated, Jesus Army Productions pushes the envelope in getting its message across.  The producers do not hold back on using everyday vices such as sex, lust and vanity to convey their message of salvation to the audience."&lt;ref&gt;The Weekend Nation (Barbados), 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early years==
In the year 2000 a young man named Rommel Hall became the Drama Coordinator of UCCF.  At the time he didn't know much about the performing arts except that "drama was the ability to tell a story on stage".  So with ideas in his head and Jesus by his side, Hall launched out into the dramatic realm.

With Hall at the helm, the UCCF Drama Group put on several full-length productions: "'''Stop, Think, Choose'''" – September 2001, "'''Living in the Real World'''" 8 March 2002&lt;ref&gt;The Barbados Advocate, 15 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; "'''Our Choice TV'''" September 2002 and "'''Tales From the Script'''" March 2003.

UCCF Drama also won a bronze award at the 2002 National Independence Festival of Creative Arts [[NIFCA]], held in Barbados every November.

It was from UCCF Drama that '''Jesus Army Productions''' was birthed.

==The Genesis==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Genesis CD Cover (2004).jpg|thumb|right|125px|The cover of Jesus Army Productions' 2004 EP "The Genesis"]] --&gt;In 2004 Jesus Army Productions released an [[Extended play|EP]] entitled "'''The Genesis'''".  From it came the hit song "'''Crisis'''" which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;2 for three weeks on the musical charts of Barbados' Christian radio station.

==Our Choice TV: Unloaded==
In July 2004, in conjunction with Christfestival, a now defunct event once held at UWI annually, Jesus Army Productions staged their first major dramatic production- "'''Our Choice TV: Unloaded'''".  The production involved a series of short skits showing how the television can have adverse effects on a person's life.  From within this production came the critically acclaimed "'''Jesus is the One'''" which drew a parallel between Jesus Christ and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] of the movie [[The Matrix]] and "'''The Must-Have Trade Expo'''".

==Trapped in an Elevator==
'''Trapped in an Elevator''' is the critically acclaimed [[stageplay]] performed at the 2007 National Independence Festival of Creative Arts.  "It told of the pitfalls in the lives of six people – a mother and her indisciplined daughter who was abandoned by her father; two best friends who were impregnated by the same man who turned out to be a runaway father; a man who wanted to kill himself because his marriage was called off; and
the narrator who has [a] little trouble with his wife."&lt;ref name="nationnews.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4342">The '''Kahnawake Gaming Commission''' is a gaming regulatory body that licenses and regulates a large number of [[online casino]]s, [[online poker]] rooms and online [[sportsbook]] sites, as well as three land-based poker rooms that are situated within the Mohawk Territory of [[Kahnawake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/permitholders.htm Kahnawake Gaming Commission: Permit Holders]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was first established in 1996 pursuant to the ''Kahnawake Gaming Law''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/faq.htm Kahnawake Gaming Commission: FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; enacted by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. The Commission's ''Regulations concerning Interactive Gaming''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/interactiveregs.htm Kahnawake Gaming Commission: Interactive Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; were first enacted in July, 1999.

The permits issued by the Commission to online gaming operators are called Client Provider Authorizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/permitholders.htm Kahnawake Gaming Commission: Permit Holders]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission charges an initial application fee for a Client Provider Authorization of US$25,000, plus an application fee of US$5,000 for each Key Person Licence.  Application fees include the cost of the first annual fee for both Client Provider Authorizations and Key Person Licences and are refundable if an application is not granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/docs/ApplicationProcessCPA.pdf Kahnawake Gaming Commission: Application Process]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The Mohawk Council of Kahnawake and the Commission have consistently asserted that the jurisdiction to enact the ''Kahnawake Gaming Law'' is an aspect of Kahnawake's Mohawk or "aboriginal rights" that have existed since [[time immemorial]] and that were most recently recognized and affirmed in subsection 35(1) of Canada's [[Constitution Act, 1982]].  Since it was first established in 1996, the legality of the ''Kahnawake Gaming Law'' and the activities of the Commission have never been challenged under the laws of Canada or any other jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1611862 Crowne , Emir Aly and Roy, Sanjay, Maintaining Provincial Monopolies: The Legality of Online Gambling Sites in Canada. Canadian Gaming Lawyer Magazine, Vol. 3, No. 1, May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 2007, in a case that raised a challenge to a decision of the Commission refusing the issuance of a permit, the [[Quebec Superior Court]] decided in favour of the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/news/pr07042007a.pdf Horne v. Kahnawake Gaming Commission et al.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the court ruled against the plaintiff it stated that "the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on the validity ... of the gaming law".

==Regulatory activity==

Presently, the Commission licences over 50 online gaming operators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/docs/CPA_List_Jan2010.pdf List of Interactive Permit Holders]&lt;/ref&gt; representing an estimated 250 online gaming sites.

In September 2009, following a lengthy investigation, the Commission issued its decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamingcommission.ca/news/pr09112009a.pdf Ultimate Bet Decision]&lt;/ref&gt; in what has become known as the Ultimate Bet cheating scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pocketfives.com/online-poker-scene/ultimate-bet-cheating-scandal-statement-released-2920689 Ultimate Bet Cheating Scandal Statement Released]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission's decision affirmed that cheating had occurred on the Ultimate Bet poker site and imposed a number of sanctions on Ultimate Bet's ownership, [[Tokwiro Enterprises]], including: a direction that approximately US$22,000,000 be refunded to Ultimate Bet players, a fine in the amount of US$1,500,000 and a direction that Ultimate Bet modify its operations in numerous specific ways to ensure there would be no further incidences of cheating.

In September 2016, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that it had reached an understanding with the Kahnawake Gaming Commission wherein the KGC would no longer provide licenses to gambling operators who accept customers from the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamingcommission.ca/news/pr09262016a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Signora''''' ({{IPA-it|la siɲˈɲoːra|pron}}; an [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase which translates to "the lady" in English) is a character in [[Commedia dell'arte]]. She is the wife of [[Pantalone]] and the mistress of [[Pedrolino]]. She is tough, beautiful and calculating, and wears very wide dresses along with very heavy makeup. She walks with a flick of the toe and her arms held far out to the sides of her body.

La Signora could be a "courtesan" (high class [[prostitute]]), but more usually she manages to wrangle her way into the household of an old man, usually Pantalone, where she would inevitably cuckold him. She was an older sexually experienced [[Colombina]], known as Rosaura.

* Appearance: Overdressed, wore too many jewels, too much hair, too many flowers, feathers and ribbons, fashionable; but over the top.
* Physicality: Like [[Il Capitano]], excessive and big gestures.
* Character Traits: Main aim is satisfaction of physical needs – more jewels, dresses and sex. She will scheme to have them assured. She has an immediate attraction to il Capitano – her Counterpart – and they must be together.

A common [[lazzo]] of La Signora is to have a fight with another woman, as she is very proud and often ridicules others.

This is a list of [[Chess variant|chess variants]]. Many thousands of variants exist; the 2007 catalogue in ''The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants'' estimates that there are well over 2,000, with the author noting that many more known variants were considered too trivial for inclusion.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2000|p=8|ps=: "Most published ones (but none described here), are, in truth, forgettable."}} This list includes those variants for which an article exists on the English Wikipedia, as well as some other variants of importance.

==Chess-derived games==
{{Dynamic list}}
These chess variants are derived from chess by changing the board, board setup, pieces, or rules.

===Orthodox chess rules===
Many variants employ standard chess rules and mechanics, but vary the starting position of the pieces or number of pieces.

====Orthodox rules on a standard 8×8 board====

=====Different starting position=====
These variants use standard boards and pieces, but the pieces start on nontraditional squares. In most such variants, the pawns are placed on their usual squares, but the position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these variants is usually to nullify established [[chess opening|opening]] knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position usually has less harmony and balance than the standard chess position.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2000|p=18}}

 |'''Upside-down chess''' starting position (White sits at bottom)
}}
|}

* '''[[Chess960]]''' (or '''Fischer Random Chess'''): The placement of the pieces on the first [[rank (chess)|rank]] is randomised, with the opponent's pieces mirroring it. Invented by [[Bobby Fischer]] (1996).
* '''[[Displacement chess]]''': Some pieces in the initial position are exchanged but the rules remain exactly the same. Some examples of this may be that the king and queen are flipped, or the knight on the b-[[file (chess)|file]] is traded with the bishop on the f-file.
* '''Pre-chess''':{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=77}} Proposed by [[Pal Benko]] in 1978. The game starts with white and black pawns set as usual, but the initial position of other pieces is selected by the players. White first places one of his pieces on his first rank, and then Black does the same. Players continue to alternate in this manner until all pieces have been placed, with the only restriction being that bishops must be on opposite-colour squares. The game then proceeds in the usual way.
* '''[[Transcendental Chess]]''': Similar to [[Chess960]], but the opening white and black positions do not mirror each other.
* '''Upside-down chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffsetup.dir/upside.html Upside-down chess] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]&lt;/ref&gt; The white and black pieces are switched so that White's pieces are on the 8th rank, with pawns on the 7th rank, one step away from promotion. The starting position looks like a standard chess starting position, but from the other player's perspective. As the pawns are blocked by pieces in the starting position, the game always starts with a knight move and smother checkmates are common.

=====Different number of pieces=====
These variants use standard chess pieces on a standard board, but players begin with unorthodox numbers of pieces. For example, starting with multiple queens or fewer pawns. Many such games use unbalanced starting positions, with one player having more or less of a particular piece than the other player.
* '''Charge of the Light Brigade''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/charge-of-the-light-brigade |title=Charge of the Light Brigade |last=Muller |first=H.G. |publisher=''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]'' |date=2015-02-27 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the usual king and pawns, one side has three queens and the other has seven knights.
* '''[[Dunsany's Chess]]''' (and the similar '''Horde chess'''): One side has standard chess pieces, and the other side has 32 pawns (or 36 in the case of Horde chess).
* '''Endgame chess''' (or '''The Pawns Game'''):{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=72}} Players start the game with only pawns and a king. Normal check, checkmate, ''[[en passant]]'', and pawn promotion rules apply.
* '''[[Chess handicap|Handicap chess]]''' (or '''Chess with odds'''): Variations to equalise chances of players with different strength.
* '''Peasants' Revolt''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/peasantrevolt.html |title=Peasant Revolt |last=Whelan |first=George |publisher=''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]'' |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=76}} White has a king and eight pawns (the peasants) against Black's king, pawn, and four knights (the nobles). Black has the advantage. To narrow the contest, the game has also been played with three knights (on b8, c8, and g8) instead of four. By R. L. Frey (1947). 
* '''Sixteen Pawns''':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chessvariants.com/unequal.dir/16pawns.html&lt;/ref&gt; White plays without his queen, but chooses where on the third and fourth ranks to place eight extra pawns. By [[Legall de Kermeur]] (18th century). [[Alexandre Deschapelles]] and [[Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais]] later established that eight extra pawns favour White too much, and hence played the game with only five, six, or seven extra pawns for White instead.
* '''[[Really Bad Chess]]''': A [[mobile video game]] by [[Zach Gage]]; Each player has one king and fifteen other pieces selected at random. 
* '''Weak!''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/unequal.dir/weak.html Weak!] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]&lt;/ref&gt; White has the usual pieces, Black has one king, seven knights, and sixteen pawns. This game was played at a Columbia University chess club in the 1960s.

[[File:Rhombic Chess gameboard and starting position.png|thumb|upright=1.2|'''[[Rhombic Chess]]''' by Tony Paletta]]
In these variants, the same pieces and rules as in chess are used, but the board is different; It can be smaller or larger, the shape of either the board or individual spaces can be non-square or modular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Jelliss |first1=G. P. |title=Reshaping the Chessboard |publisher=[[British Chess Variants Society]] |magazine=[[Variant Chess]] |date=Autumn 1997 |volume=3 |issue=25 |pages=92–93 |issn=0958-8248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or it can even be extra-dimensional or [[Bounded set|unbounded]]. The movement of pieces in some variants is modified in concurrence with the geometry of the gameboard.
* '''Active Chess''':{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=114}} Played on a 9×8 board, adding a queen with an extra pawn in front. Invented by G. Kuzmichov (1989), whose students tested the game, deciding that the optimal starting position was to place the second queen on the eighth or ninth files.
* '''[[Balbo's Game]]''': A novel-shaped board with 70 squares. Full armies for each player, minus one pawn. No castling. By G. Balbo (1974).  
* '''[[Hexagonal chess#Brusky's hexagonal chess|Brusky's Hexagonal Chess]]''': Chess on an irregular board of 84 hex cells. Same as '''Gliński's Hexagonal Chess''', but with ten pawns instead of nine, linear startup, two forward move directions for pawns, pawns capture forward diagonally, and castling. By Yakov Brusky (1966).
* '''[[Circular chess]]''': Played on a circular board consisting of four rings, each of sixteen squares.
* '''[[Cross chess]]''': Cross-shaped cells, board geometry like hex chess but moves akin to normal chess (e.g. bishops have four directions (not six); queens eight (not twelve)). Extra rook, knight, and pawn per side. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Cylinder chess]]''': Played on a cylinder board with a- and h-files "connected". Thus a player can use them as if the a-file were next to the h-file (and vice versa).
* '''[[Hexagonal chess#De Vasa's hexagonal chess|De Vasa's Hexagonal Chess]]''': Chess on a rhombus-shaped board of 81 hex cells. Same as '''Gliński's Hexagonal Chess''', but linear startup, two forward move directions for pawns, pawns capture forward diagonally to the side, and castling. Invented by Helge E. de Vasa (1953).
* '''[[Double Chess]]''': Two full armies per side on a 12×16 board, the first to mate an enemy king wins. Pawns advance up to four steps on their first move. [[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]] found the game "remarkably interesting".{{sfnp|Pritchard|1994|p=91|ps=: "Hayward drew Capablanca's attention to the game. The Cuban found it 'remarkably interesting' and a match was arranged between him and the Hungarian master Geza Maroczy."}} Invented by Julian Hayward (1916).
* '''Doublewide chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/doublewide-chess.html|title=Doublewide chess}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Two regular chessboards are connected (for a 16×8 play surface). Each player plays with two complete sets of chess pieces. 
* '''Flying chess''': Played on a board of 8×8×2, giving a total of 128 cells. Only certain pieces can move to and from the additional level.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=226|ps=}}
* '''[[Hexagonal chess#Gliński's hexagonal chess|Gliński's Hexagonal Chess]]''': The most popular version of chess for the hex board. Includes three bishops, nine pawns, 91 hex cells. Invented by Władysław Gliński (1936).
* '''[[Grid chess]]''': The board is overlaid with a grid of lines. For a move to be legal, it must cross at least one of these lines.
* '''[[Hexagonal chess]]''': A family of variants played on a [[hexgrid]] with three colours and three bishops.
* '''[[Infinite chess]]''':&lt;ref name="IC"&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/boardrules.dir/infinite.html Infinite Chess] at ''The Chess Variant Pages''. An infinite chess scheme represented using ASCII characters.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous players and mathematicians have conceived of chess variations played on an unbounded chessboard.&lt;ref name = "PBS"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN-I6u-AxMg "Infinite Chess, PBS Infinite Series"] PBS Infinite Series, with academic citations including "''Transfinite game values in infinite chess''" (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In one example, when using "Converse's rules," the pieces and their relative starting positions are unchanged - only the board is infinitely large.&lt;ref name="IC"/&gt;
* '''[[Los Alamos chess]]''' (or '''Anti-Clerical chess'''): Played on a 6×6 board without bishops. This was the first chess-like game played by a computer program.
* '''[[Masonic Chess]]''': Every other board rank is indented. Same as chess, with moves adapted to the new brickwork-like board. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Hexagonal chess#McCooey's hexagonal chess|McCooey's Hexagonal Chess]]''': Chess on the same hexagonal board as Gliński's Hexagonal Chess, but using a different starting array, seven pawns instead of nine, and pawns capture forward diagonally. By Richard Honeycutt and David McCooey (1978-1979).
* '''[[Minichess]]''': A family of variants played with regular chess pieces and standard rules, but on a smaller board.
* '''Polgar reform chess''': In his book ''Reform-Chess'' (1997), [[László Polgár]] proposed several variants played on board of size 5×8, 6×8, 8×6, or 9×6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[László Polgár]] |title=Reform-Chess |publisher=Könemann Verlags GmbH |year=1997 |isbn=3-89508-226-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial piece setup is determined by players in the same way as in Benko's Pre-chess. There are special rules for castling depending on the board. Polgar recommended these variants to train creativity and to speed up the game.
* '''Polgar Superstar Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mayhematics.com/v/vol8/vc61.pdf [[Variant Chess]]]'', Vol 8, Issue 61&lt;/ref&gt; Hexagonal variant played on a special star-shaped board. Invented by [[László Polgár]] (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://polgarstarchess.blogspot.com/search/label/Patent Polgar Superstar Chess Patent]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Rhombic Chess|Rhombic chess]]''': Uses a hex-shaped board comprising 72 rhombus cells. Normal set of chess pieces move ''edgewise'' or ''pointwise''. Checkmate objective as usual. By Tony Paletta (1980). 
* '''[[Hexagonal chess#Shafran's hexagonal chess|Shafran's Hexagonal Chess]]''': Chess on an irregular hex board of 70 cells. Same as '''Gliński's Hexagonal Chess''', but differs by starting position, pawn first-move options, pawns capturing forward diagonally,  and castling. Invented by Grigorevich Shafran (1939).
* '''Spherical chess''': A family of variants played on a chessboard wrapped around a sphere. The a- and h-files are adjacent. The poles are circular or octagonal and may or may not be occupied according to the variant. There are no board edges, so kings always have eight adjacent squares. Trans-polar diagonal moves mostly differentiate between variants.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=223|ps=}}{{sfnp|Pritchard|1994|pp=285–86|ps=}}

===Unorthodox rules with traditional pieces===
These variants introduce changes in the mechanics of the game, such as movement of pieces, rules for capturing, or winning conditions, using standard chess pieces.

====Unorthodox rules on a standard 8×8 board====
* '''Absorption chess''' (also called '''cannibal chess''', '''power absorption chess''', or '''seizer's chess'''): Pieces gain the abilities of the pieces they capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/difftaking.dir/cannibal.html|title=Cannibal Chess and Absorption Chess}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chess.computerwebservices.net/power.php |title=Power Absorption Chess |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Chess Variants |publisher=Computer Web Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Andernach chess]]''': A piece making a capture changes colour.
* '''[[Atomic chess]]''': Capture on any square results in an "atomic explosion" which kills (i.e. removes from the game) all pieces in the eight surrounding squares, except for pawns.
* '''[[Beirut Chess]]''': Players secretly equip one of their men with a "bomb", which can be detonated at any time, wiping out all pieces on surrounding squares. Win by checkmating the opponent, or blowing up his king. By Jim Winslow (1992).
* '''Benedict chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/difftaking.dir/benedict.html|title=Benedict chess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces are not allowed to be "captured". Example: if a white bishop 'captures' a black knight, that knight is then removed and replaced with a white knight on the same square. The 'attacking' bishop does not move.
* '''Checkers chess''':{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=51}} Normal rules of chess. However, pieces can only move forwards until they have reached the far rank.
* '''[[Checkless chess]]''': Players are forbidden from giving [[check (chess)|check]] except to [[checkmate]].
* '''[[Circe chess]]''': Captured pieces are reborn on their starting squares.
* '''[[Crazyhouse]]''': Captured pieces change the colour and can be dropped on any unoccupied location. There are two variations of this variant, known as '''Loop chess''' and '''Chessgi'''.
* '''[[Cubic Chess]]''': Piece cubes display the six piece types, a player can promote any pawn by rotating its cube to match a captured piece type. By Vladimír Pribylinec (1977). 
* '''[[Dynamo Chess]]''': Capturing is replaced by pushing or pulling enemy pieces off the board. By Hans Klüver and Peter Kahl (1968). A close variant of '''Push Chess''' (by [[Fred Galvin]], 1967).
* '''Einstein chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janko.at/Retros/Glossary/Einstein.htm Einstein chess]&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces transform into more or less powerful pieces when they move.
* '''[[Extinction chess]]''': To win, a player must capture all of any one type of pieces of the opponent (for example, all the knights an opponent has, or all their pawns, etc.).
* '''Guard chess''' (or '''Icelandic chess'''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.org/difftaking.dir/guardchess.html|title=Guard chess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allows captures only when a piece is completely unprotected by friendly pieces. Checkmate occurs when the piece forcing the mate is protected and therefore cannot be captured.
* '''Haft Schrödinger Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antumbrastation.com/haft-schroedinger-chess.html|title=Haft Schroedinger Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every piece starts in a [[quantum superposition]] initially able to be any piece until the waveform is collapsed by observation. As in chess, Haft Schrödinger Chess does not have [[Perfect information#Examples|hidden information]], whereas Schrödinger's Chess is regarded as a game of hidden information.
* '''Hierarchical chess''':{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=48}} Pieces must be moved in the order: pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king. A player who has the corresponding piece but cannot move it loses.
* '''[[Hostage chess]]''': Captured pieces are held in the capturer's "prison", and can be released by the opponent and dropped into play (like shogi) via a "hostage exchange". By [[John A. Leslie|John Leslie]] (1997). 
* '''Jedi Knight chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://gotjustice.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/jedi-knight-chess-variant/ Jedi Knight chess].&lt;/ref&gt; Knights may move three steps diagonally or horizontally or both, depending on the rules accepted.
* '''Kamikaze chess''' (or '''Hara-Kiri chess'''):{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=44}} When capturing, the capturing piece is removed from play also. So, a king cannot defend itself by capturing an attacker. A capture is not allowed if it exposes the king to [[Discovered attack|discovered check]]. Idea from B. G. Laws (1928).
* '''[[Losing chess#Kamikaze chess|Kamikaze chess]]''': A variant of Losing chess. The king is royal and removing a check takes precedence over capturing. The king must be lost last; moving into check is permitted after all other men have been captured.  
* '''[[King of the Hill (chess)|King of the Hill]]''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.lichess.org/variant/kingOfTheHill|title=King of the Hill • Bring your King to the center to win the game. • lichess.org|website=en.lichess.org|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to checkmate, a legal move that moves one's own king to one of the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) wins. This is analogous to [[sannin shogi]]'s rule that allows a player to win by legally moving their king to the center.
* '''[[Knight relay chess|Knight Relay chess]]''': Pieces defended by a friendly knight can move as a knight.

 |'''Knightmate''' starting position
}}
* {{Anchor|Knightmate}}'''Knightmate''' (or '''Mate The Knight'''):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffobjective.dir/knightmate.html Knightmate] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to checkmate the opponent's knight (initially on e-file). The kings on b- and g-files can be captured as other pieces. Pawns can promote to kings but not to knights. By Bruce Zimov (1972).
* '''[[Legan chess]]''': Played as if the board would be rotated 45°, initial position and pawn movements are adjusted accordingly.
* '''[[Losing chess]]''' (or '''Antichess''', '''Giveaway chess''', '''Suicide chess''', '''Killer chess''', '''Take-all chess''', '''Reverse chess'''): Capturing moves are mandatory and the object is to lose all one's pieces. There is no check; the king is captured like an ordinary piece.
* '''[[Madrasi chess]]''' (or '''Weird chess'''): A piece which is attacked by the same type of piece of the opposite colour is paralysed.
* '''[[Monochromatic chess]]''': All pieces must stay on the same colour square as they initially begin.
* '''[[Patrol chess]]''': Captures and checks are only possible if the capturing or checking piece is guarded by a friendly piece.
* '''[[PlunderChess]]''': The capturing piece is allowed to temporarily take the moving abilities of the piece taken.
* '''Pocket Knight Chess''' (or '''Tombola Chess'''):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/pocket.html "Pocket Knight"] ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=52}} Players have an extra knight they keep at the side of the board. Once during the game, a player may place the knight on any empty square for his move. Play then proceeds as normal.

=====Multimove variants=====
In these variants one or both players can move more than once per turn. The board and the pieces in these variants are the same as in standard chess.
* '''[[Avalanche chess]]''': Each move consists of a standard chess move followed by a move of one of the opponent's pawns.
* '''Doublemove Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/multimove.dir/doublemove.html|title=Doublemove chess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to '''Marseillais chess''', but with no ''[[en passant]]'', check or checkmate. The object is to capture the king. By [[Fred Galvin]] (1957). 
* '''Double-Take Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[https://jmar306.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=36&amp;action=edit&amp;message=6&amp;postpost=v2 Double-Take Chess] by Joel Marler&lt;/ref&gt; Each player, once per game, can make two moves during one of their turns. These two moves cannot be used to place the opponent's king in checkmate.
* '''[[Kung-fu chess|Kung-Fu chess]]''': A variant without turns. Any player can move any of his pieces at any given moment.
* '''[[Marseillais chess]]''' (or '''Two-move chess'''): After the first turn of the game by White being a single move, each player moves twice per turn.
* '''[[Monster chess]]''' (or '''Super King'''): White has the king and four pawns against the entire black army but may make two successive moves per turn.
*'''Multimove Chess ''(i,j)''''': A class of chess variants where white gets ''i'' moves per turn and black gets ''j'' moves per turn. Check is not enforced, and victory is by capturing the enemy king. The games are described and analysed logically in a 2015 journal article. The authors [[Solved game|weakly solved]] the game for all ''(i,j)'' pairs except for ''(1,1)'' (functionally, regular chess) and ''(2,2)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=Emily Rita |last2=Dubbs |first2=Alexander |title=Winning Strategies in Multimove Chess (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;) |journal=Journal of Information Processing |date=2015 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=272–275 |doi=10.2197/ipsjjip.23.272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Progressive chess]]''' (or '''Scottish chess'''): White moves once, then Black moves twice, then White moves three times, and so on.
* '''Swarm chess''': During each turn, each piece that a player can move they must move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUjqIuKumI0|title=Chess: Swarm Variation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Incomplete information or elements of chance=====
In contrast to classical chess, these are not games of [[perfect information]]; luck or chance events are added as an element, such as in [[poker]] or [[backgammon]].
* '''ChessHeads''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessmate.com/ChessHeads.html ChessHeads] chessmate.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12932 ChessHeads] BoardGameGeek&lt;/ref&gt; Played with cards that change the game rules.
* '''[[Dark chess]]''': The player sees only squares of the board that are attacked by their pieces.
* '''[[Dice chess]]''': The pieces a player is able to move are determined by rolling a pair of dice.
* '''Fantasy Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shadowhex.com Fantasy Chess]&lt;/ref&gt; Chess with wargaming added. Players fight for squares (which can be co-occupied) using dice. Can be expanded to four players; piece capability can improve each game.
* '''[[Knightmare Chess]]''': Played with cards that change the game rules.
* '''[[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]]''': Neither player knows where the opponent's pieces are but can deduce them with information from a referee.
* '''No Stress Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/19918|title=No Stress Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketed for teaching beginners, the piece(s) a player is able to move are determined by drawing from a deck of cards, with each card providing the rules for how the piece may move. Neither castling nor ''[[en passant]]'' is allowed.
* '''[[Penultima (game)|Penultima]]''': An inductive variant where the players must deduce hidden rules invented by "Spectators".
* '''Schrödinger's chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elvis.rowan.edu/~kilroy/other/?chess|title=Schrödinger's chess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players' minor pieces are concealed so the opponent does not know what they are until revealed. When covered, pieces move in a restricted way (as queens that can only move two squares).
* '''Synchronous chess''':{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=100}} Players try to outguess each other, moving simultaneously after privately recording intended moves and anticipated results. Incompatible moves, for instance to the same square with no anticipated capture, are replayed. Alternatively, two pieces moving to the same square are both captured, unless one is the king, in which case it captures the other. Play ends with capture of king.
* '''Viennese Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffsetup.dir/viennese.html Viennese Chess]&lt;/ref&gt; A barrier or screen between the two halves of the chessboard, two players then place their pieces on their half of the board. The barrier is then lifted and the game is then played as in orthodox chess.

====Unorthodox rules on an unorthodox board====
[[File:Chad init config.png|thumb|290px|right|'''[[Chad (chess variant)|Chad]]''' by Christian Freeling]]
[[File:Jeson Mor gameboard &amp; init config.png|thumb|240px|right|'''[[Jeson Mor|Jesön Mor]]''' starting position]]
* '''[[Alice Chess]]''': Played with two boards: a piece moved on one board passes "through the looking glass" onto the other board. By [[V. R. Parton]] (1953).
* '''[[Apocalypse (chess variant)|Apocalypse]]''': On a 5×5 board, each side has two knights and five pawns, win by eliminating all enemy pawns. Prepared moves are executed simultaneously. By C. S. Elliott (1976).
* '''[[Chad (chess variant)|Chad]]''': Kings are limited to 3×3 "castles" on a 12×12 board dominated by eight rooks per side which can promote to queens. By Christian Freeling (1979).
* '''[[Chessence]]''': Nine men per player move according to their relative positions to each other on a 6×9 board with missing squares and kings immobile in the corners. By Jim Winslow (1989).
* '''Colour Chess''': Played on a multicoloured board of six colours, with the order of turns taken as in '''Marseillais chess''' but with rules indicating which colour each piece may move to. The game is won by capturing the opponent's king (rather than checkmate) and kings may remain in check. Similar variants include '''Sequence Colour Chess''', and '''Swarm Colour Chess'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h03T_fwcHk|title=Colour Chess - How to Play
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dogearedgames.com/colourchess/|title=Colour Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By Tom Norfolk (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217977/colour-chess-lure|title=Colour Chess + Lure}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Congo (chess variant)|Congo]]''': Kings (lions) are limited to 3×3 "castles" on a 7×7 board. By Demian Freeling (1982).    
* '''[[Diplomat chess]]''': Played on a circular board with 43 cells, including the centre circle which is considered [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] ''and'' diagonal to every adjacent cell. Includes a 'diplomat' piece which instead of capturing can suborn enemy pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.org/43.dir/diplomat/diplomat-chess.html|title=Diplomat Chess}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Dragonfly (chess variant)|Dragonfly]]''': Played on a 7×7 or hex board, no queens, captured non-pawn pieces never die (ala Chessgi) and can be dropped on any open square. By Christian Freeling.
* '''[[Jeson Mor|Jesön Mor]]''': Nine knights per side on a 9×9 board. The first to occupy square e5, and then leave it, wins the game. From Mongolia. 
* '''[[Parallel Worlds Chess]]''': A 3D variant using three boards, each player commands two armies, capturing either enemy king wins. The middle board is a sort of "twilight zone" obeying its own rules. By R. Wayne Schmittberger (1980s).
* '''[[Rollerball (chess variant)|Rollerball]]''': Inspired by the sci-fi film of the same name, pieces move clockwise around a Roller Derby-like track. By Jean-Louis Cazaux (1998).
* '''[[Sovereign Chess]]''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/sovereign-chess |last=Bates |first=Mark |title=Sovereign Chess |publisher=''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]'' |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variant is played on a 16×16 board. In addition to the standard black and white pieces, the board is also encircled by 80 other coloured pieces (10 colours of 8 pieces each). Coloured squares near the center of the board correspond to the coloured pieces around the board, and when a player's piece occupies a coloured square, that player gains control of the matching coloured pieces. If a piece on a coloured square is moved or captured, control of the matching pieces is lost (transferred to the other player in case of capture). Players may also switch the color of their initial army through "regime change". By Mark Bates.
* {{anchor|Troy}}'''Troy''': A variant inspired by the [[Trojan War]] played on a 91-cell hexagonal board. Pieces are named after characters from the myth.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=206|ps=}}
* '''Zonal chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/shape.dir/zonal/zonal.html "Zonal Chess"] by Larry Smith, ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Board has triangular wings or "zones" on either side of the main 8×8 board. Queens, bishops and rooks that start from one of the squares in either zone may change direction and keep going on the same move. A queen, for example, could zig around an obstruction and attack a piece in the opposite zone. The power to change direction only applies when a piece's move starts from a zonal area. It is possible (using the queen and rook) to cross the board from one zone to another, but any piece entering a zone cannot make use of the extended move.

===Unorthodox rules using nontraditional pieces===

====Nontraditional (fairy) pieces on a standard 8×8 board====
Most of the pieces in these variants are borrowed from chess. The game goal and rules are also very similar to those in chess; however, these variants include one or more [[fairy pieces]] which move differently from chess pieces.

 |'''Anti-king chess'''. The [[anti-king]] is shown as an inverted king.
}}
* '''Anti-King chess''': Features an [[anti-king]]. This piece is in check when not attacked. If a player's anti-king is in check and unable to move to a square attacked by the opponent, the player loses (checkmate). The anti-king cannot capture enemy men, but can capture friendly men. A king may not attack the opponent's anti-king. The anti-king may not check its own king. Other rules the same as in standard chess, including check and checkmate to the regular king. By Peter Aronson (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffobjective.dir/anti-king-chess.html Anti-King chess] by Peter Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two setups were suggested by the inventor initially, but only the second one (Anti-King II), which is very close to standard chess gained popularity.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Baroque chess|Baroque]]''' (or '''Ultima'''): Pieces on the first row move like queens, and pieces on the second row move like rooks. They are named after their unusual capturing methods. For example, leaper, immobilizer and coordinator.
* '''[[Berolina chess]]''': Which uses the Berolina pawn instead of the normal pawn, all other things being equal.
* '''[[Chess with different armies]]''': Two sides use different sets of fairy pieces. There are several armies of approximately equal strength to choose from including the standard FIDE chess army.
* '''[[Duell (chess)|Duell]]''': Dice are used instead of pieces.
* '''[[Falcon-Hunter Chess]]''': A falcon moves forward as a bishop; backward as a rook. The hunter moves forward as a rook; backward as a bishop. Players introduce the fairies as the game progresses. By Karl Schulz (1943).
* '''[[Grasshopper chess]]''': The pawns can promote to grasshopper, or grasshoppers are on the board in the initial position.
* '''[[Pocket Mutation Chess]]''': Player can put a piece temporarily into the pocket, optionally mutating it into another (including fairy) piece.
* '''Spartan chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartanchessonline.com/] by Steven Streetman.&lt;/ref&gt; Black (the Spartans) has an army headed by two kings, which otherwise consists exclusively of unorthodox pieces, and battles the standard FIDE army (the Persians) of white.
*{{Anchor|Way of the Knight}}'''Way of the Knight''': Invented by [[Ralph Betza]], incorporating two elements from [[tabletop role-playing game]]s. Begins with the standard starting position and pieces, however through capturing and advancing up the board pieces can earn "[[Experience point|experience]]", and a sufficiently experienced piece is upgraded to a more powerful one. Upgrades include various fairy pieces, and involve player choices of "[[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/wotn.html|title=Way of the Knight|website=www.chessvariants.com|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/wotnsample.html|title=A Sample game of Way of the Knight|last=Trenholme|first=Sam|website=www.chessvariants.com|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Empress and/or princess pieces=====
There are a number of variants which use the [[Empress (chess)|empress]] (rook + knight) and [[Princess (chess)|princess]] (bishop + knight) compound pieces. The empress is also named marshall, chancellor, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/rook-knight.html The Piececlopedia: The Rook-Knight Compound] by Fergus Duniho and David Howe.&lt;/ref&gt; The princess is also called cardinal, archbishop, janus, paladin, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/bishop-knight.html The Piececlopedia: Bishop-Knight Compound] by Fergus Duniho and David Howe.&lt;/ref&gt; Another compound piece is the [[Amazon (chess)|amazon]] (queen + knight). To adapt to the new pieces, the board is usually extended to 10×8 or 10×10 with additional pawns added.&lt;ref name="material power in variant chess games"&gt;[https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess960-chess-variants/comparison-of-material-power-in-variant-chess-games "Comparison of Material Power in Variant Chess Games"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Almost Chess]]''': Uses an 8×8 board, with the conventional starting position, but queens are replaced by chancellors (empresses). By Ralph Betza (1977). A related variant is '''[[Sort of Almost Chess]]''' (Ralph Betza, 1994), where one player has a queen and the other has a chancellor.
[[File:Grand Chess init config.PNG|right|thumb|290px|'''[[Grand Chess]]''' by Christian Freeling]]
* '''[[Capablanca Chess]]''': A variant by the former world chess champion, [[José Raúl Capablanca]]. Played on a 10×8 board with chancellor (empress) and archbishop (princess).
* '''[[Capablanca Random Chess]]''': Generalises all possible variants of [[Capablanca Chess]] with random starting positions following a method similar to that used in [[Chess960]]. By Reinhard Scharnagl (2004). 
* '''[[Chigorin Chess]]''': Similar to '''Sort of Almost Chess''', but White's minor pieces are all knights and Black's are all bishops. By Ralph Betza (2002). 
* '''[[Embassy Chess]]''': Uses a 10×8 board with marshall (empress) and cardinal (princess). The starting position is borrowed from [[Grand Chess]]. By Kevin Hill (2005).  
* '''[[Gothic chess]]''': A commercial variant played on a 10×8 board with chancellor (empress) and archbishop (princess).
* '''[[Grand Chess]]''': Uses a 10×10 board with marshall (empress) and cardinal (princess). Invented by [[Christian Freeling]] (1984). 
* '''[[Janus Chess]]''': Uses a 10×8 board with two januses (princesses). By Werner Schöndorf (1978).
* '''[[Maharajah and the Sepoys]]''': Black has a complete army, White only one piece: the maharajah (amazon).
* '''[[Modern Chess (chess variant)|Modern Chess]]''': Played on a 9×9 board, with an extra pawn and a prime minister (princess). By Gabriel Vicente Maura (1968).
* '''[[Seirawan chess]]''': A commercial variant. Uses a standard 8×8 board with elephant (empress) and hawk (princess).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seirawanchess.com Seirawan Chess]&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Grandmaster (chess)|GM]] [[Yasser Seirawan]] and [[Bruce Harper]] (2007).

=====Other unorthodox pieces=====
The pieces in these variants are borrowed from both chess and another game. The game goal and rules are either the same or very similar to those in chess. However, these variants include one or more [[fairy pieces]] which move differently from chess pieces.
* '''Chessers''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://schwartztronica.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/checkmate-by-checkers/ Chessers]&lt;/ref&gt; Played on a regular chessboard but with [[Draughts|checkers]] integrated with standard chess pieces. By Christopher Schwartz and Sander Beckers.
* '''Playing cards on a chessboard''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardgameopen.64g.ru/en.htm, "Playing card games on a chess board"]&lt;/ref&gt; A card game allowing open play on a board with rectangular sectors, just as in chess or [[Draughts|checkers]], but with the application of playing cards.
* '''Prince &amp; Princess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://profemaravi.blogspot.com/2015/07/chess-10x10-succession-prince-princess.html], "Succession Chess"&lt;/ref&gt; The chess variant that uses the criterion of succession, where the king or queen are replaced in favor of the prince or the princess, created by [[Antonio Maravi Oyague]].
* '''Proteus''':{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=304}} A chess variant using dice to represent normal chess pieces, created by [[Steve Jackson Games]].

====Unorthodox pieces using unorthodox boards====
* '''Bomberman chess''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/contest/bomberman.html Bomberman chess]&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the ''[[Bomberman]]'' video game series. Played on a 10×8 board with special bomb and defuser pieces. The bomb can be exploded on its turn in vertical and horizontal directions (similar to the movement of a rook), destroying any pieces in the blast range. The defuser can capture a bomb.
* '''[[Chesquerque]]''': Played on four [[Alquerque]] boards combined. Includes an extra pawn and [[Princess (chess)|archbishop]] per side. By George Dekle Sr. 	
* '''Chess on an Infinite plane''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/chess-on-an-infinite-plane Chess on an Infinite Plane] game rules&lt;/ref&gt; One type of [[infinite chess]]. Seventy-six pieces are played on an unbounded chessboard. The game uses orthodox chess pieces, plus [[Mann (chess)#History|guards]], [[Fairy chess piece#H|hawks]], and [[Empress (chess)|chancellors]]. The absence of borders makes pieces effectively less powerful (as the king and other pieces cannot be trapped in corners), so the added material helps compensate for this.&lt;ref name="material power in variant chess games"/&gt; Despite the infinite playing area, mathematical investigations have shown that in a general endgame, one player can force a win in a finite number of moves.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brumleve, Joel David Hamkins, Philipp Schlicht, The Mate-in-n Problem of Infinite Chess Is Decidable, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 7318, 2012, pp. 78-88, Springer [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30870-3_9], available at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5597v4 arXiv].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a sub-variant which uses the [[Fairy chess piece#H|huygens]], possibly making the game mathematically undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/trappist-1  Chess on an Infinite Plane with Huygens Option] game rules&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chess on a Really Big Board]]''': Played on a 16×16 board, with twelve piece types (six being the orthodox chess pieces). Has many subvariants, including a larger 24×24 version and a three-dimensional 16×16×16 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/16x16.html|title=Chess on a Really Big Board}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gess]]''': Chess with variable pieces, played on a [[Go (game)|Go]] board.
* '''[[Omega chess]]''': On a 10×10 board with four extra squares, one per corner. Includes the champion and wizard fairy pieces. Both are leapers, with different ways of leaping.
* '''[[Three-dimensional chess#Raumschach|Raumschach]]''': Called "the classic 3D game" (Pritchard). Played on a 5×5×5 board, including a new piece (the unicorn) for moving through cube vertices.
* '''Shako''':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/shako.html Shako] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]&lt;/ref&gt; Played on a 10×10 board. New pieces are the cannon from [[xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) and an elephant moving as a fers+alfil of old [[shatranj]] (ancestors of queen and bishop), so diagonally one or two squares with jumps allowed. By Jean Louis-Cazaux (1997).
* '''[[Stealth chess]]''': Played in the fictional [[Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild]] from the ''[[Discworld]]'' series of books; played on an 8×10 board. The fairy piece is the [[assassination|Assassin]].
* '''[[Stratomic]]''': Adds nuclear missiles to the standard chess array on a 10×10 board. When launched they irradiate any 3×3 area (friendly pieces included) except kings. By Robert Montay-Marsais (1972). 
* '''[[Triangular Chess]]''': Board comprises 96 triangles. The rook and bishop have three directions; the queen, six. Three extra pawns and a unicorn. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Triangular Chess#Tri-Chess|Tri-Chess]]''': A variation of Triangular Chess. The rook and bishop are increased to six directions; the queen, to twelve. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[2000 A.D. (chess variant)|2000 A.D.]]''': Played on a 10×10 board, features the empress, capricorn, gorgon, chimaera, dragon, mimotaur, unicorn, and fury fairy chess pieces. By V. R. Parton.

=== Three-dimensional variants ===
[[File:Parallel_Worlds_Chess_init_config.png|right|upright 1.3|thumb|[[Parallel Worlds Chess]], a 3D variant]]
{{Mainarticle|Three-dimensional chess}}
A number of variants have been developed where the playing area is in three [[dimension]]s.

Similar to [[Patience (game)|solitaire]], there are a few chess variants for a single player. Unlike [[chess puzzle]]s, these variants have a random starting position. Some of these are similar to [[Mathematical chess problem#Permutation problems|permutation chess problems]], for example the game '''Queen's Quadrille''', which was invented by Karen Robinson in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/solitaire.dir/quadrille.html Queen's Quadrille]&lt;/ref&gt; All chess pieces (except pawns) are randomly placed on a 4×4 board. Then one of the queens is removed and the game is started. Pieces move as usual, however capturing is not allowed. A player can move white and black pieces in any order, without regard for colour. The goal is to move the queen along a predetermined pattern; for example from one corner to the other, or visit all squares on the board only once. The same idea is found in the game '''Hippodrome''', which was invented by Andy Lewicki in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/solitaire.dir/hippodrome.html Hippodrome]&lt;/ref&gt; The initial position is obtained by placing four knights on the first row and all other pieces from a chess set (except pawns) on the remaining fields. Then one of the pieces (except knights) is removed and the game is started. The goal is to move all knights to the opposite rank.

In 1998 Robinson also invented a game which Hans Bodlaender named '''Chess Contradance''', as the setup is like a contradance with the two lines facing each other.  The pieces are setup as in regular chess, but without pawns. The first and eighth ranks are safe havens, i.e., no piece can be captured on these ranks. The object of the puzzle is to move the pieces such that all pieces move to the opposite back row without ever putting any piece in danger of being captured. Black and White alternate moves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/solitaire.dir/squaredance.html Chess Contradance]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants for more than two people {{anchor|Multiplayer variants}}===
{{Main|Multiplayer chess}}
[[File:Bughouse game.jpg|right|thumb|275px|'''[[Bughouse chess]]''', the game in progress]]
* '''[[Bosworth (game)|Bosworth]]''': A four-player variant played on 6×6 board. It uses a special card system with the pieces for spawning.
* '''[[Bughouse chess]]''' (or '''Exchange chess''', '''Siamese chess''', '''Swap chess''', '''Tandem chess''', '''Transfer Chess'''): Two teams of two players face each other on two boards. Allies use opposite colours and give captured pieces to their partner. The two-player version of the game, played with only one board, is [[Crazyhouse]].
* '''[[Business chess]]''': Played with two teams using normal chess playing rules but allowing up to five variations of the game. The team may discuss and play alternative moves freely.
* '''[[Djambi]]''': Can be played by four players on a 9×9 board and four sets of special pieces. Pieces can capture or move those of an adversary. Captured pieces are not removed from the board, but turned upside down. There are variants for three or five players (''Pentachiavel''). (1975)
* '''[[Enochian chess]]''': A four-player variant with magical symbolism, associated with the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].
* '''[[Forchess]]''': A four-player variant using the standard board and two sets of standard pieces.
* '''[[Fortress chess]]''': A four-player variant played in Russia in 18th and 19th centuries.
* '''[[Four-player chess]]''' (or  '''Four-handed''', '''Four-man''', '''Four-way chess'''): Can be played by four people and uses a special board and four sets of differently coloured pieces.
* '''[[Quatrochess]]''': A four-player variant, in addition to the standard chess army, each side controls a chancellor, archbishop, mann, wazir, fers, two camels, and two giraffes. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Three-Man Chess]]''': Three chessboard halves fused into one, first to checkmate wins. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Three-player chess]]''': A family of variants specially designed for three players.
* '''[[Tri-Chess]]''': For three players; 150 triangular cells; [[Empress (chess)|chancellor]] (empress) and [[Princess (chess)|cardinal]] (princess) replacing queen. By George Dekle Sr.

===Games inspired by chess===
These variants are very different from chess and may be classified as [[Abstract strategy game|abstract strategy]] [[board game]]s instead of chess variants.
* '''[[Arimaa]]''': A game inspired by [[Garry Kasparov|Garry Kasparov's]] defeat by chess computer [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]]. This game is easy for people to understand but difficult for computers to play well. To prove that Arimaa is computer resistant, a $10,000 USD prize is offered for developing a program to defeat the top human Arimaa players.
* '''[[Martian chess]]''': Played with [[Icehouse pieces]].
* '''[[Navia Dratp]]''': A cross between [[shogi]] and [[miniature wargaming]].
* '''[[The Duke (board game)|The Duke]]''': An abstract strategy game where the board, pieces, and gameplay mechanics have some strong parallels with chess.

==Chess-related historical and regional games==
Some of these games have developed independently while others are ancestors or relatives of modern chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=H. J. R. |authorlink=H. J. R. Murray | title=[[A History of Chess]]
|publisher=Benjamin Press (originally published by Oxford University Press)| year=1913 | isbn=0-936317-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of these variants may be limited to their respective places of origin (as is largely the case for shogi), or worldwide (as is the case for xiangqi). The games have their own institutions and traditions.

'''MTV''' (sometimes called '''MTV Europe''') is a [[Europe|pan-European]] pay television network launched on 1 August 1987. Initially, the channel served all regions within Europe being one of the very few channels that targeted the entire European continent. Today, the channel only serves a selection of European countries as [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]] began to regionalise its network in 1997.

MTV began as '''MTV Europe''' under a co-operative agreement between [[Viacom]], [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Robert Maxwell]], which lasted until 1991 when Viacom took over full ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D61339F932A0575BC0A967958260 Viacom Gets MTV Europe - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; MTV is wholly owned and operated by [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]].

Since its premiere, MTV revolutionized the music industry. Slogans such as "I want my MTV!" became embedded in the concept of the VJ was popularized, the idea of a dedicated video-based outlet for music was introduced, and both artists and fans found a central location for music events, news, and promotion. MTV has also been referenced countless times in popular culture by musicians, other TV channels and shows, films and books.

==History==

===1987-1997 - One MTV for the whole of Europe===
From its launch in 1987 and until its break-up into different MTV stations across Europe in 1997, '''MTV Europe''' became famous for its [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]]s who came from all over Europe (plus Pip Dann, a [[New Zealand]]er), who used to introduce videos and programs round the clock in [[English language|English]].

* MTV Europe launched on the 1st of August 1987 from [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] with a live performance from [[Elton John]] and was transmitted from AirTV in Camden Town, London. It kicked off in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Finland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=tte1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalaby|first1=Jean K.|title=Transnational Television in Europe: Reconfiguring Global Communications Networks |date=2009 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9780857717474 |page=29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* With similar [[tongue-in-cheek]] humour as the 1981 launch of [[MTV]] in the U.S. (where the first video was the ''[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]'' by [[The Buggles]]), the first video shown was ''[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]'' by [[Dire Straits]], which, appropriately, starts and finishes with repetition of the line ''"I want my MTV"'', voiced by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].
* MTV shows at this time included ''[[MTV's Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[Headbanger's Ball|Headbangers Ball]]'', ''[[MTV's Most Wanted]]'' with [[Ray Cokes]], ''The Big Picture'' (movie releases), ''The Pulse'' (fashion and style), ''[[120 Minutes (UK TV series)|120 Minutes]]'' with [[Paul King (musician, VJ)|Paul King]] and the ''MTV Coca-Cola Report'' with [[Kristiane Backer]] (music news, interviews and tour dates).
* MTV bought [[Breakfast Television Centre]] in Hawley crescent, [[Camden Town]] the former headquarters of [[ITV plc|ITV]]'s now defunct breakfast television company, [[TV-am]] in 1993.
* MTV always had its Transmission Centre in London - having been launched in August 1987 from the [[Chrysalis Group|Chrysalis]] TV owned Air TV facility.
* MTV became something of a pioneer in Europe when in 1995 it began to broadcast using [[Digital television|digitally compressed transmissions]].
* From 1993 to 1996, MTV was broadcast on Russian TV channels [[2x2 (TV channel)|2x2]], [[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]], [[Muz-TV]], Seti-NN etc.

===1997-2010 - The regionalization of MTV in Europe===
In 1997, MTV Networks Europe began to regionalize its MTV feed in a number of areas in Europe.

* In March 1997, ''MTV Central'' (Central as in [[Central Europe]]) was launched as a [[German-language|German]]-speaking MTV music channel available in Germany and Austria. It was initially broadcast out of Hamburg before moving to Munich and finally Berlin. MTV Central later was renamed [[MTV Germany]].
* On 1 July 1997, [[MTV UK &amp; Ireland]] launched, followed by [[MTV Italia]] in September. [[MTV Nordic]] for [[Scandinavia]] launched in June 1998 and [[MTV Russia]] for [[Russia]] launched on 25 September 1998. Since 2000, [[MTV Networks Europe]] launched other regional channels across the continent. [[MTV (France)|MTVF]] for [[France]] launched in June, followed by [[MTV Poland|MTV Polska]] in July and both [[MTV (Spain)|MTV España]] and [[MTV (Dutch TV channel)|MTV NL]] in September.&lt;ref name=tte2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalaby|first1=Jean K.|title=Transnational Television in Europe: Reconfiguring Global Communications Networks |date=2009 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9780857717474 |page=210 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2002, the channel re-branded as 'MTV European'. In August 2007, it moved its editorial base from London to [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], though still beaming its signal from MTV Networks Europe's London headquarters.

===2010-present===
* Prior to 1 August 2010, MTV provided a unique mix of popular culture programming along with music videos.
* As of 1 August 2010, European's MTV has controversially removed its core music programming and replaced it with reality based programming from [[MTV|the US MTV channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=1301719|title=Mtv europe dropping long time shows|work=digitalspy.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New AUGUST schedules for MTV European|url=http://community.mtv.tv/Discussion-Thread/New-AUGUST-schedules-for-MTV-European/020CAFFFF01DAD05C00090105278B?ref_title=Community+Discussions&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.mtv.tv%2fContent%2fDiscussions%2fDiscussionResults.aspx%3ftcId%3d41004&amp;ref_category=41004|work=MTV European website|accessdate=11 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EOyupWcA?url=http://community.mtv.tv/Discussion-Thread/New-AUGUST-schedules-for-MTV-European/020CAFFFF01DAD05C00090105278B?ref_title%3DCommunity%2BDiscussions%26ref_url%3Dhttp://community.mtv.tv/Content/Discussions/DiscussionResults.aspx?tcId%3D41004%26ref_categor|archivedate=13 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Magic Bubble''''' ({{zh|t=魔術泡泡|p=Móshù Pào Pào}}), is a {{vgy|1991}} adult-oriented [[puzzle video game]] developed and published in [[Asia]] by [[C&amp;E]] for [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], which is [[Copyright infringement|unlicensed]] from [[Nintendo]]. It's one of three [[Pornography|pornographic]] themed titles released by [[Panesian]], along with ''[[Hot Slots]]'' and ''[[Peek-A-Boo Poker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=191868|title=Wii Feature: 25 rarest Nintendo games ever|publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com|date=2008-06-29|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of [[United States dollar|$]]1000 on auction sites such as [[eBay]]. It also exist a [[Sega Mega Drive]]/[[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] port dating back to 1993, but more suitable for all ages in its structuring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCzVCz3kTew Mega Drive Longplay - Magic Bubble - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Magic Bubble'' gameplay is reminiscent that of ''[[Tetris]]'' and ''[[Puzzle Bobble]]'' (although the latter was born in 1994), where the goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to others with similar color along the top screen part. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]]. The game is over if the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the playing bottom area. Finally, when a level is completed the player will be rewarded with [[erotica]].

The [[United Nations|U.S.]] licensed version from [[American Video Entertainment]], was released in 1991 under the title '''''Mermaids of Atlantis''''', with all [[Pornography|pornographic]] elements removed or obscured. In the same year, a localized version leaving intact those contents was released by [[Hacker International]] in [[Japan]] as '''''Soap Panic''''', and still in the U.S. by [[Panesian]] as '''''Bubble Bath Babes'''''.

==Reception==
[[Allgame]] gave this video game a score of 2.5 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=26532 Rating of ''Bubble Bath Babes''] at [[allgame]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nederlandse Omroep Stichting''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈneːdərˌlɑntsə ˈʔɔmrup ˌstɪxtɪŋ}}; abbr. '''NOS''' {{IPA-nl|ˌɛnoːˈɛs|}}), English:  '''Dutch Broadcast Foundation''', is one of the broadcasting organizations making up the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] system. It has a special statutory obligation to make news and sports programmes for the three Dutch public television channels and the Dutch public radio services.

The foundation's remit derives from the Dutch Media Act 2008, which stipulates that the NOS produce regular and frequent programming of a public service nature, including, notably, a full and impartial news service and coverage of parliamentary procedures and debates, as well as reporting on sporting and other national events.

The NOS also acts as technical co-ordinator for the Dutch public broadcasting system as a whole. In the event of emergencies and/or the breaking of a major news story, it can assume control of the public networks in order to provide co-ordinated coverage of events in co-operation with the other members of the systems. 

The NOS does have correspondents in multiple countries, including a permanent studio in Washington DC. 

Programmes produced by the NOS include its daily television and radio bulletins, the ''[[NOS Journaal]]''. Parliamentary reports are shown from a special studio in The Hague. It also supplies news programmes aimed at children (''[[Jeugdjournaal]]''), teens and young adults (''NOS op 3'') and sports fans (''NOS Langs de Lijn'', ''NOS Studio Sport''). Programmes are made available via television, radio and online. The NOS also broadcast text pages and a website, which are both often used by the public.

== History ==

===Unions and foundations (1947–1969)===
The '''Netherlands Radio Union''' (NRU) was established in 1947. After several failed attempts to create a public broadcasting system and link up with a national station, the NRU was created as a union of broadcasting associations that provided operational support. The associations were responsible for their own output, but studios, orchestras and outside broadcast facilities were managed by the NRU. Weekly radio plays were also the domain of the NRU and would run until 1986. The NRU became the Dutch founding member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] in 1950.

Meanwhile, the '''Netherlands Television Service''' (NTS) was created in 1951, two years after public television returned to the airwaves. The NTS served as a similar organization to the NRU, in that broadcast and transmission facilities were supplied to member associations for making programmes.

It wasn't until 1956 that the NTS itself produced its first programme, a news bulletin called the ''NTS Journaal''. This was followed by a sports round-up, ''Sport in Beeld'' ''(Sports Illustrated)'' in 1959, and in 1967 of ''Langs de Lijn'' ''(Along the Line)'', a joint production of several broadcasting associations.

===The birth of the NOS (1969–1995)===
A new Media Act was passed into law in 1967, merging the Netherlands Radio Union and the Netherlands Television Foundation. The new organization, the ''Nederlandse Omroep Stichting'' ''(Netherlands Broadcasting Service)'' was created on 29 May 1969. The NOS, as was its predecessors, was tasked with co-ordinating the whole public broadcasting system, as well as providing news and sport bulletins. It also inherited the technical and production facilities needed to make and broadcast radio and television programmes. All broadcasting members of the NRU and the NTS were made members of the NOS.

On 2 May 1977, a strike by sound engineers affected television news broadcasts. Upset viewers called on all broadcasters to resolve the situation.

On 1 April 1980 the NOS launched its teletext service, in the framework of supplying news and information. It first experimented with teletext in 1977. In 1981,. on the 25th anniversary, the NOS aired its first televised youth news bulletin, called the '''[[Jeugdjournaal]]'''.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NOSwaterident1993.png|right|thumb|180px|Former NOS ident from 1993.]] --&gt;
The Media Act of 1988 meant several changes to NOS and the broadcasting system. The Services Department, which was made up of the technical, broadcast and transmission facilities of the NOS, was privatised, which meant the broadcasting associations were required to pay to use the facilities. The Netherlands Broadcast Production Company (NOB) consisted of those facilities, mainly based in Media Park in [[Hilversum]]. The Media Act also required broadcasting association members take up positions on the NOS Board of Directors. A new government commission oversaw content and financial matters, as well as admitting potential new broadcasting associations.

===The split of the NOS (1995–2007)===
In 1995, saw another Media Act enacted which saw the broadcasting duties of the NOS greatly reduced, with the creation of the '''[[Nederlandse Programma Stichting]]''' ''(Netherlands Programming Service)''. The NPS took on the programming tasks of the NOS concerning culture, art, children, education and ethnic-minorities, whilst the NOS concentrated on news, sport and live events.

A new Supervisory Board replaced the Board of Directors in 1998. The previous management was replaced with a three-man board, now charged with developing strategies and responsibility for all public output. Programming co-ordinators were appointed for each television and radio network and channel identities were created, largely replacing the varying on-air presentation of the pillar broadcasters. The broadcasting associations also have a degree of input through the Supervisory Board.

In 2002, the coordination element of the public broadcast system, administered by the NOS were now made clearer with the creation of an unbrella organization, '''Publieke Omroep''' ''(Public Broadcasting)'', while programme makers operated under the name "RTV NOS". The reorganization caused NOS to be loosened from the public broadcasting system, causing it to be a neutral member of NPO, and then starting to reorganize itself.

===A new look (2005–present)===
[[Image:NOS logo.svg|right|thumb|NOS' current logo is created by [[Lambie-Nairn]] and was officially introduced on December 17, 2005.]]
In 2005, saw the organization obtain a new corporate identity. The previous NOS logo was in use for 36 years and featured the initials of the company in lower case, with round and obtuse angles. The new logo was designed by graphic designers [[Lambie-Nairn]], complete with new [[Station identification|idents]] for its television programmes. The typeface was [[Gotham (typeface)|Gotham]].

Its news-gathering operations also changed, with the news departments for radio, television and internet merging and re-organized into different sections (NOS, NOS News, NOS Sports, with NOS Events added in 2009).

An announcement made by the Minister of Education in 2007 confirmed a further division of the NOS. The umbrella group ''Publieke Omroep'', managed by the NOS was to be legally separated and renamed [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep]] ''(Netherlands Public Broadcasting)''. The move was to ensure the NOS operated under the same conditions as its fellow broadcasting associations, as well as transferring membership of the European Broadcasting Union.

In 2009, the NOS became fully independent and now has its own Board of Directors.

Since 2012, the NOS has got a new style and layout and, for some programs, other titles. The biggest change is visible in the 8 o'clock NOS Journaal (traditionally the most viewed and therefore the most important news broadcast of the NOS), where they adopted standing presentation.

==Programming==

===Television===
The NOS is responsible for news, sport, political and events programming on the public service television networks and produce the following:
* [[NOS Journaal]] – one of the most important news programmes in the Netherlands, broadcast on all public stations whenever possible. The flagship edition is the 8pm bulletin on [[NPO 1]], often called ''achtuurjournaal'', supplemented by two shorter editions at 6pm &amp; midnight and hourly bulletins throughout the day.
* [[Jeugdjournaal|NOS Jeugdjournaal]] – A news programme aimed at 8–12 year olds, aired on children's channel [[NPO Zapp]]. It is broadcast at 7pm and lasts 20 minutes, and a short bulletin is broadcast every weekday at 8:45 am, when primary school starts.
* [[NOS Studio Sport]] – A sports programme covering the most popular sports. It has the right to broadcast major sports tournaments, like the [[Olympic Games]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA European Championship|UEFA Euro]]. The NOS no longer has the right to broadcast full matches of the [[Eredivisie]], but Studio Sport Eredivisie still provides summaries of matches played. The programme also covers matches and competitions in other sports, most notably [[tennis]], [[ice skating]], [[cycling]] and [[field hockey]]. The editorial staff is also responsible for the [[NOS Sportjournaal]], a news programme about sport.

==== Themed channels ====

Besides broadcasting on the main three public television channels, The NOS is also responsible for two digital channels, ''NPO Nieuws'' and ''NPO Politiek'':

'''Operational Studies Group''', also known as '''OSG''', is a publisher of tabletop [[WarGames|wargames]] mostly devoted to the wars of [[Napoleon I]].  Some of their more notable games include ''Napoleon at Leipzig'', ''Napoleon at Bay'' and ''Bonaparte in Italy''. OSG is a leader in the design and production of [[Napoleonic]] Wargames. OSG's Board Wargames are played on historically accurate heavy-stock paper maps. The armies and leaders that move across the maps are represented by 1/2" square die-cut cardboard playing pieces.

OSG is run by Kevin Zucker, a former managing editor at [[Simulations Publications]].  Zucker left OSG in 1979, and the company closed down soon thereafter, but Zucker renewed the company name to market new wargames, such as ''Four Lost Battles'' (a game representing the defeat of Napoleon's marshals in the campaign leading up to the Battle of Leipzig) and "The Habit of Victory" (*Napoleon's 1807 Campaign in Poland).

After a hiatus in 2009, the company once again commenced production in 2010. "The Coming Storm" (four battles of the 1806-07 campaign) was published on 22 December 2010.

'''''Pariah''''' ({{lang-sv|Paria}}) is a one-act play written by [[August Strindberg]].

==Origins==
Strindberg wrote ''Pariah'' along with his play ''[[Creditors (play)|Creditors]]'' in the town of Holte, Denmark during the winter of 1888&amp;ndash;1889. He was in Denmark to create a theatre of his own, following the example he admired of the [[Théâtre Libre]] in Paris, which had been founded two years earlier.  Strindberg’s theatre would present naturalistic plays, and the artistic director would be his wife, [[Siri von Essen]].  It was to be called “The Scandinavian Experimental Theatre”, and then was renamed “Strindberg’s Experimental Theatre”.  Beset with disasters, not the least of which was the [[censorship]] of his play, ''[[Miss Julie]]'', the theatre had a tumultuous and extremely brief history. The theatre premiered in Holte on March 9, 1889 with a triple bill: ''Pariah'', ''Creditors'', and ''The Stronger''. The evening was a success, with applause and curtain calls.  Even harsh critics were won over, with the exception of a newspaper reviewer who demanded that Strindberg be deported. The performance was then repeated in the nearby Swedish town, [[Malmö]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, Olof. ''August Strindberg''. Farrar Straus Giroux. 1984. Library of Congress catalog number 84-42803.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael.  Strindberg. Random House. 1985. Page 214.  {{ISBN|0-394-50442-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the audience at Malmö was [[Ola Hansson]], who had just published a short story from which, Strindberg claimed in a program note, the title and theme of ''Pariah'' were taken.  However, Hanssen said he didn’t recognize anything of his original theme. Hanssen also reports that at this time he had lent Strindberg a book of mysteries by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and that Poe was a significant influence on Strindberg’s writing at this time. A possible example of that influence, is that a scene of psychological detective work occurs in Poe’s short story, "[[The Gold Bug]]", that appears to have inspired an episode in ''Pariah''. Strindberg's original title for the play is “''Paria''”, with its Hindu etymology.  Some English translations use the title, “The Outcast”, which, however, can be confused with an earlier play by Strindberg, “The Outlaw”.&lt;ref&gt;Strindberg, August. Björkman, Edwin. Translator. ''Plays. Creditors Pariah'' Charles Scribner’s Sons. 1913. {{ISBN|9781177291842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important to Strindberg with this and other plays, such as ''Miss Julie'' and ''[[The Father (Strindberg play)|The Father]]'', was his desire to achieve the ideals of Naturalism in drama as described and analyzed by the French author and theorist, [[Emile Zola]] — the ''nouvelle formule''. Strindberg modeled ''Pariah'' on the ''Les Quarts d’Heure'' (1888) plays of the French writers Gustave Guiches and Henri Lavedan, which, in his essay “On Modern Drama and Modern Theatre”, Strindberg describes as dramas reduced to a single scene.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, Borge Gedso. ''Strindberg’s Naturalistic Theatre''. Russell &amp; Russell.1962. {{ISBN|0-8462-1729-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pariah'' carries on, in a veiled manner, a debate that Strindberg had been having through postal correspondence with the philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who in ''[[Twilight of the Idols|Götzen-Dämmerung]]'', portrays a criminal as a strong person, who is just misdirected in life.  In ''Pariah'' the criminal, Mr. Y, is portrayed as weak and a criminal from birth.  Strindberg in this play shows some influenced of his reading of the French translation of  the ''l’uomo delinquente'' (1876) by [[Cesare Lombroso]], an Italian criminologist, who promotes the idea that criminality can be discerned in a person’s external self, as happens in the play, when Mr. X notices that Mr. Y is “terribly narrow between the ears.”&lt;ref&gt;Lamm, Matin.  Carlson, Harry G. editor. ''August Strindberg''. Benjamin Blom, Inc. Publishers. 1971 Library of Congress catalog number 69-16323. Page 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The play involves a battle of brains between two men, “Mr. X'' and'' Mr. Y’’ in a Darwinian struggle for survival. The men are in a room in a farmhouse during a storm.  A box of gold sits on the table, for which Mr. X is responsible.  Both have committed crimes in their personal history.  Mr. X, in his youth, murdered a man, but he was not caught, and he explains why it is right that he avoided punishment.  As for Mr. Y, he forged a financial document, which secured a loan.  For this he was caught and sent to prison, and he explains why it was unfair that he was punished. As both stories are shared during the play, it sets the men against one another. Which one is really the most guilty, and have either of them atoned for his sin? Mr. Y finally rationalizes that Mr. X. should pay Mr. Y a penalty or a bribe as a way of bringing "a little better balance into these unequal human conditions." Or it can be seen as Mr. X paying a bribe to keep Mr. Y quiet about Mr. X's crime. The atmosphere becomes tense and threatening, and the contest comes to a head when Y becomes armed with a knife, and X is armed with a stronger will, and can use his greater mental prowess to overpower Y.&lt;ref&gt;Strindberg, August. Björkman, Edwin. Translator. ''Plays. Creditors Pariah'' Charles Scribner’s Sons. 1913. {{ISBN|9781177291842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*Mr. X is a middle-age archeologist. He has been digging up and collecting treasures of antiquity.
*Mr. Y is a middle-age Swedish/American.  He has arrived to collect insects for a small museum.

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/classics/resources/poetics/poettran.htm
 |title=Aristotle's Poetics, adapted from the translation by S.H. Butcher
 |accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">A '''re-recording mixer''' in North America, also known as a '''dubbing mixer''' in Europe, is a [[post-production]] [[audio engineer]] who mixes recorded dialogue, sound effects and music to create the final version of a [[soundtrack]] for a [[feature film]],  [[television program]], or [[television advertisement]]. The final mix must achieve a desired sonic balance between its various elements, and must match the [[film director|director]]'s or [[sound design]]er's original vision for the project. For material intended for broadcast, the final mix must also comply with all applicable laws governing sound mixing (e.g., the [[Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act|CALM Act]] in the United States and the EBU R128 loudness protocol in Europe).  

The different names of this profession are both based on the fact that [[live sound mixing|the mixer is not mixing a live performance to a live audience]] nor [[Production sound mixer|recording live on a set]].  That is, he or she is re-recording sound already recorded elsewhere (the basis of the North American name) after passing it through mixing equipment such as a [[digital audio workstation]] and may dub in additional sounds in the process (the basis of the European name).  While mixing can be performed in a recording studio or home office, a full-size mixing stage or dubbing stage is used for feature films intended for release to movie theaters in order to help the mixer envision how the final mix will be heard in such large spaces. 

During production or earlier parts of post-production, sound editors, sound designers, sound engineers, production sound mixers and/or music editors assemble the tracks that become raw materials for the re-recording mixer to work with. Those tracks in turn originate with sounds created by professional musicians, singers, actors, or foley artists. 

The first part of the traditional re-recording process is called the "premix." In the dialog premix the re-recording mixer does preliminary processing, including making initial loudness adjustments, [[fade (audio engineering)|cross-fading]], and reducing environmental noise or [[Spill (audio)|spill]] that the on-set microphone picked up. In most instances, audio restoration software may be employed. For film or television productions, they may add a temporary/permanent music soundtrack that will have been prepared by the music editor, then the resulting work will be previewed by test audiences, and then the film or television program is re-cut and the soundtrack must be mixed again. Re-recording mixer may also augment or minimize audience reactions for television programs recorded in front of a studio audience. In some cases, a [[laugh track]] may augment these reactions.

During the "final mix" the re-recording/dubbing mixers, guided by the director or producer, must make creative decisions from moment to moment in each scene about how loud each major sound element (dialog, sound effects, laugh track and music) should be relative to each other. They also modify individual sounds when desired by adjusting their loudness and spectral content and by adding artificial reverberation. They can insert sounds into the three-dimensional space of the listening environment for a variety of venues and release formats: movie theaters, home theater systems, etc. that have stereo and multi-channel ([[5.1]], [[7.1]], etc.) sound systems.

'''Record Store Day''' is an annual event inaugurated in 2008 and held on one Saturday every April and every "Black Friday" in November to "celebrate the culture of the independently owned [[record store]]".&lt;ref name=RSD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordstoreday.com/CustomPage/614|title=ABOUT US |author=|date=|website=recordstoreday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day brings together fans, artists, and thousands of independent [[record store]]s across the world.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{Cite news| last = Passey| first = Brian| title = Vinyl records spin back into vogue| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2011-02-25-vinyl25_ST_N.htm| accessdate = 2 March 2011| work=USA Today| date=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of records are pressed specifically for Record Store Day, with a unique list of releases for each country, and are only distributed to shops participating in the event. The event began in the [[United States]] and remains headquartered there. Record Store Day has official international organizers in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Presentación oficial Record Store Day 2017|url=http://www.recordstoreday.es/presentacion-oficial-record-store-day-2017/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=Web Oficial Record Store Day SPAIN|date=20 March 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Sound Garden Plaque Post.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Plaque commemorating the creation of Record Store Day]]

Retrieved August 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Record Store Day was officially founded in 2007 by Eric Levin, Michael Kurtz, Carrie Colliton, Amy Dorfman, and Don Van Cleave, and is now celebrated at stores across the world, with hundreds of recording and other artists participating in the day by making special appearances, performances, meet and greets with their fans, the holding of fund raisers for community non-profits, and the issuing of special [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] and CD releases along with other promotional offerings to mark the occasion.

Each store holds their own party for the day, to celebrate the perceived individuality of each store, and the place it holds in its community. Although Record Store Day, the day, only occurs once a year, Record Store Day, the organization, provides promotions, marketing, and other opportunities for stores throughout the year, maintaining a website, social media and other means of promulgating its views about the value of independent record stores. Record Store Day is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Dept. of Record Stores, along with the Coalition of Independent Music Stores and the Alliance of Independent Media Stores.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Universal Music]]'s sales manager, Marc Fayd’Herbe, has described Record Store Day as "the single best thing that has ever happened" for independent record shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/84089 | title=Universal call Record Store Day 'the single best thing that has ever happened to the indie stores' | publisher=IPC | work=NME | date=31 March 2015 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | author=Britton, Luke Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 event was credited with the highest U.S. vinyl sales,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Record Store Day Drives Vinyl Sales to Historic Peak in SoundScan Era|url = http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/1559614/record-store-day-drives-vinyl-sales-to-historic-peak-in|website = Billboard|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 edition resulted in independent retailers recording the highest percentage of physical album sales, since the [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] system was introduced in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Record Store Day Breaks Sales Records, Nirvana Tops Vinyl Singles|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/record-store-day-breaks-sales-records-nirvana-tops-vinyl-singles-20140425|website = Rolling Stone|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2015 Libera awards, the [[American Association of Independent Music]] awarded Record Store Day its "Marketplace Ally" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 2015 Libera Award Winners!  {{!}} A2IM|url = http://a2im.org/news/the-2015-libera-award-winners/|website = a2im.org|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Record Store Day 2016 produced the biggest week of sales for the vinyl LP format since the introduction of SoundScan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7348566/record-store-day-gain-vinyl-album-sales|title=Record Store Day Spurs 131 Percent Gain in Vinyl Album Sales in U.S.|website=Billboard|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has been criticized for catering to [[record collecting|record collectors]], rather than casual music fans, and delaying the release of non-affiliated records by monopolizing the capacity of record pressing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/arts/music/record-store-day-underscores-a-small-renaissance.html | title=Watch Out, iTunes.

==Record Store Day by year==
===2008===
[[Metallica]] officially kicked off the event at [[Rasputin Music]] in [[Mountain View, California]], on April 19, 2008.

===2010===
The third annual Record Store Day took place on Saturday, April 17, 2010.

The year's event was also celebrated by giving young artists an opportunity to showcase their talent in the form of a national "Record Store Day: High School Battle of the Bands".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordstoreday.com|title=Home - RECORD STORE DAY|author=|date=|website=www.recordstoreday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local, participating independent record stores nominated one local high school band by picking a cut from the band's supplied recording and entered their name and song cut into the contest. A panel of record executives and members from the Fender Corporation judged the entrants. Nine national semi-finalists were chosen to appear on a limited edition, compilation vinyl LP of their winning songs. Pressed by Gotta Groove, the LP features digital convenience. On the day of the event,  it was announced that the grand prize winning band was SANUK, an indie band of HS students from Indianapolis, Indiana. They received a generous prize package of musical gear from the Fender Corporation and recording time with recording greats - [[Jack Ponti]] and [[Kevin Shirley|Kevin "The Caveman" Shirley]]. SANUK was championed by their local record store, Indy CD &amp; Vinyl. The sponsors of the contest were Caroline Distribution and EMI Label Services, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=404 "Record Store Day Battle of the Bands"] News, Fender web site&lt;/ref&gt; and Fender Music Foundation. Aside from the Band Battle contest, many participating record stores had a line-up of live talent performing throughout the day. In 2010, more than 1,400 independent record stores participated in the unofficial holiday. More than 1,000 were from the US alone. Record stores saw a 41% increase in sales over the previous year's celebration, and a 109% increase over the previous Saturday's sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Record Store Day a $ucce$$| work = Hits Daily Double| date = April 20, 2010| url = http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/news/newsPage.cgi?news08028m01| accessdate = April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the event had become such a nationally recognized event, that in the U.S., it was even referenced on "Saturday Night Live."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Record Store Day is 'more important' than Christmas| work = LA Times| date = April 21, 2010| url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/on-the-charts-record-store-day-is-more-important-than-christmas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the year, the first [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] Record Store Day was also held, on November 26, 2010.

===2011===
The fourth annual record store day took place on Saturday, April 16, 2011. The official ambassador for the event was [[Ozzy Osbourne]].&lt;ref name=ambassador/&gt; Over six-hundred artists celebrated the event with in-store appearances, making it the world's largest music event of its kind. Artists who made in-store appearances included [[Beastie Boys]], the [[Foo Fighters]], [[Duran Duran]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]], Del McCoury and the New Orleans Preservation Hall Jazz Band, [[Regina Spektor]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[the dBs]], [[The Raveonettes]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[Frightened Rabbit]], the [[Deftones]], [[Chuck D]], [[the Beach Boys]]' Al Jardine, [[Lonely Island]], and [[Josh Groban]]. Most of the releases for the year were limited between 300 and 7000 copies worldwide.  According to Billboard Magazine, the 182,000 bump in unit sales in the week that Record Store Day was held was directly attributed to the success of the event itself. The official film of the event was "Sound It Out", a feature-length documentary directed by [[Jeanie Finlay]], documenting the Sound It Out Records shop in Stockton-on-Tees, the very last record shop in Teesside. The film premiered to critical acclaim at SxSW and had its joint premiere at SheffDocFest and the Edinburgh International Film Festival. During the year, the second Black Friday Record Store Day was also held, on November 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-vinyl.blogspot.com/2011/10/record-store-day-presents-black-friday.html|title=Record Store Day Presents Black Friday 2011|author=|date=|website=new-vinyl.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this Record Store Day featured an exclusive 12" vinyl reissue of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s 1981 debut single [[Ceremony (New Order song)|"Ceremony"]] that included not only the song and its B side, "In a Lonely Place," but also the original 1980 demo recordings of those tracks by New Order's previous incarnation, [[Joy Division]].

'''''Sanctuary''''' is a Canadian [[science fiction]]-[[fantasy]] television series, created by [[Damian Kindler]] and funded largely by the Beedie Development Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Now |first=Burnaby |url=http://www.canada.com/burnabynow/news/story.html?id=7af48a4b-a394-4eb7-9c05-4a0808997edc |title=Made-in-Burnaby show gets Beedie's backing |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for four series from 2008 to 2011; a fifth series was planned but never made.

The show is an expansion of an eight-[[webisode]] series that was released through the Internet in early 2007. Seeing the success of the [[web series]], [[Syfy]] decided to buy the broadcast rights to the series and pay to re-stage the series in a season of thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name="13eps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/01/sci_fi_picks_up_tappings_isanctu.shtml|title=SCI FI picks up Tapping's Sanctuary|accessdate=October 4, 2008|author=Sumner, Darren|date=January 31, 2008|work=[[GateWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show centers on Dr. [[Helen Magnus]], a 157-year-old [[teratologist]] (born August 27, 1850),  and her team of experts who run the Sanctuary, an organization that seeks out extraordinarily powerful creatures and people, known as Abnormals, and tries to help and to learn from them while also having to contain the more dangerous ones.

The series premiered on October 3, 2008, in both Canada and the United States and on October 6 in the United Kingdom. The premiere drew in more than 3 million viewers, making it the highest rated original series premiere for [[Syfy]] since ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'' debuted in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enewsi.com/news.php?itemid=14221|title=Sanctuary is a hit|first=Jay|last=Cochran|publisher=Entertainment News International|date=November 13, 2008|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere two-parter, "[[Sanctuary for All]]", was a combination and rewriting of the first four webisodes and was followed by "[[Fata Morgana (Sanctuary)|Fata Morgana]]", based on Webisodes 5-8. Amanda Tapping, with all of the original cast from the web series, made the transition to the television series. A second season of 13 episodes aired in 2009–10,&lt;ref name="2nd-season"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Sanctuary-Gets-Caught-1000561.aspx|title=Sanctuary Gets Caught in the Bermuda Triangle|first=Erin|last=Fox|accessdate=October 9, 2010|date=December 4, 2008|work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sanctuary'' was renewed for a third season of 20 episodes on December 12, 2009.&lt;ref name="20eps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/12/syfy-renews-stargate-universe-sanctuary-season-second-.html|title=Syfy renews 'Stargate: Universe' and 'Sanctuary'|first=James|last=Hibberd|accessdate=October 9, 2010|date=December 13, 2009|work=[[The Live Feed]]|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanctuary episodes ==
{{Main|List of Sanctuary episodes}}

== Series overview ==
''Sanctuary'' follows the exploits of Dr. Helen Magnus ([[Amanda Tapping]]) and her quest to protect various [[cryptid]]s, legends, and abnormal animals/people with certain extraordinary powers and abilities (what most people would consider "monsters"). She heads the Sanctuary Network, which consists of large facilities known as "Sanctuaries" scattered throughout the world serving as safe havens for these "Abnormals". She is initially aided in her quest by her reluctant protégé Will Zimmerman ([[Robin Dunne]]); her intrepid, if somewhat reckless, daughter Ashley ([[Emilie Ullerup]]); the talkative geek and [[Werewolf|lycanthrope]] Henry Foss ([[Ryan Robbins]]), a computer and security expert; and her taciturn, ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''-like assistant, played by [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] (unnamed, but listed as "Bigfoot" in the show's credits).

===First season===
The history of Dr. Magnus is gradually revealed. In her youth she was trained by her father, a gifted Victorian-era scientist, to study the world and protect the unusual. Helen was a member of a group of experimental scientists known as "The Five", which also included [[List of Sanctuary characters#Nikola Tesla|Nikola Tesla]] ([[Jonathon Young]]), [[List of Sanctuary characters#Clara Griffin|Nigel Griffin]], [[List of Sanctuary characters#James Watson|Dr. James Watson]] ([[Peter Wingfield]]), and Magnus's lover [[List of Sanctuary characters#John Druitt|John Druitt]] (Heyerdahl again), who wanted to push the boundaries of their understanding of the physical world through unconventional means. At some point during their partnership, Magnus acquired a vial of untainted vampire blood and used it in a serum that "The Five" injected into themselves. After the injection, they each developed Abnormal traits: Magnus experienced drastically slowed aging, and longevity with no clear limit; Nigel Griffin acquired the power to become invisible at will; Dr. James Watson's intellect was tremendously heightened; Nikola Tesla underwent transformation into a vampire, with the additional power of electrical manipulation; John Druitt developed longevity and the ability to teleport through time and space, but, already unstable and soon possessed by a malevolent energy creature (explained Season 2 Episode 11), he was driven to give in to his dark impulses, and becomes [[Jack the Ripper]].
Episode Three introduces "The Cabal", a powerful shadow organization that captures, studies, and experiments on Abnormals, in the belief that the Abnormal population is a threat to the human species. During the first-season finale, "[[List of Sanctuary episodes#Episodes|Revelations]]", they test a small amount of a biological weapon named Lazarus that causes all types of Abnormals to become extremely violent, attacking anyone nearby and then dying painfully. This is part of The Cabal's overall plan to incite humanity against the Abnormals so that they can wipe out the entire Abnormal population and gain greater influence over humanity. They brainwash Ashley, and in season two, convert her into a vampiric supersoldier, using her as a template for a small army which attacks the Sanctuary network. Against all odds, Magnus and her teams stop them at the Old City Sanctuary, and Ashley, in a moment of clarity, apparently sacrifices herself. Her father, Druitt, hunts down and kills the heads of the Cabal, which seems to disband.

===Second season===
As season two progresses, Magnus grapples with denial, then grief, and finally accepts the loss of Ashley. Meanwhile, the team adjusts to newcomer Kate Freelander ([[Agam Darshi]]), a former freelance Cabal operative. They also deal with their relationships (Magnus's in particular) to the remaining members of the Five, and increased international coordination in the wake of the Cabal's attacks on the Global Sanctuary Network that Magnus had established. It emerges that an enormous marine Abnormal, Big Bertha, had been preserved rather than euthanized by Magnus, and that Bertha is, somehow, a sapient being named Kali existing on a psychic or spirit plane, intricately tied to nature and Abnormals around the world. At the end of the second season and beginning of the third, a man named Edward Forsythe ([[Callum Blue]]) tries to take control of Bertha, and NY Sanctuary House Head Terrence Wexford ([[Paul McGillion]]) goes rogue trying to destroy her, even attempting to depose and kill Magnus.

===Third season===
Ultimately, Bertha/Kali is saved and Wexford is ousted, but more questions are raised than answered. Will visits the spirit plane via induced cardiac arrest, and while there he sees two other powerful beings in addition to Kali; encounters Helen's father, who gives Will a message for her; and then spontaneously returns to life with no brain damage after an unprecedented length of time. The Sanctuary team speculate that the beings are avatars of Abnormals as powerful as Big Bertha, one of which may have been the source of the earthquake that stopped a destructive tidal wave started by Kali's wrath. Meanwhile, Gregory Magnus's message leads the Sanctuary team to old birthday gifts that he had given to Helen years before, which in conjunction produce a tangible holographic map or miniature representing an unknown [[steampunk]]-style city. This is eventually revealed to be Praxis, an advanced underground civilization of humans and Abnormals. After an initial period of mistrust (exacerbated by the antics of Adam Worth ([[Ian Tracey]]), an old enemy of Helen's who inspired [[Jekyll and Hyde]]), Helen and her team save the world and reach an entente, with Gregory acting as ambassador. However, the peace does not last long. Worth, who escaped, manipulated unhappy Abnormals in Praxis while experimenting with a dangerously unstable energy source to power a time machine. The end results of his machinations were the destruction of Praxis, several armies of displaced Abnormals marching on the upper world, and his escape to the past to attempt to save his daughter, with Magnus hot on his heels.

===Fourth season===
Magnus is able to thwart Worth and prevent any major changes to the timeline, then returns to the present by living through the intervening years again. She and her team manage to end the Abnormal assault on humanity without too much bloodshed, but still must contend with increasing persecution from the Special Counter-Insurgency Unit (SCIU), an anti-Abnormal agency. Magnus is forced to cut the Sanctuary network's ties to the UN, reputable banking institutions, etc. in order to maintain independence, a move made possible by her extensive preparations during her second trip through the twentieth century. Additionally, a number of Hollow Earth Abnormals refuse to remain quietly underground and engage in terrorist activities against humans. Matters come to a head when a contingent of these Abnormals, led by Caleb, agree to cease their violent activities in exchange for Magnus' help in establishing a homeland in Old City. She agrees, but SCIU is highly suspicious due to the group's former attacks. This skepticism proves justified, since Caleb plans to release a substance that would bring out latent Abnormal traits in normal humans, effectively eradicating the species. Magnus is also prepared for this betrayal, taking Caleb out with a massive explosion that destroys the Sanctuary. Now presumed dead, she is free to begin anew in an Edenic underground city based on the work of [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Albert Einstein]], one last secret from her repeated century.

*[[Robin Dunne]] as Dr. [[Will Zimmerman]], a forensic psychiatrist who is recruited by Dr. Magnus to help her treat Abnormals.
*[[Emilie Ullerup]] as [[Ashley Magnus]] (seasons 1–2), the daughter of Dr. Magnus and John Druitt. Ashley is an expert monster hunter, and provides a counterbalance to Dr. Magnus's desire to protect creatures.

==Production==
The series is produced by [[Stage 3 Media]] based in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, founded in 2006. The webisodes were filmed from January 3 to January 31, 2007, at [[Bridge Studios]].&lt;ref name="stargate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/01/istargatei_cast_and_crew_seek_is.shtml|title=Stargate cast and crew seek Sanctuary|accessdate=October 4, 2008|author=Read, David|date=January 31, 2007|work=[[GateWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sanctuary'' is filmed almost entirely using the [[Chroma key|green screen]] technique. Unlike many other shows, elaborate sets are not built for the scenes to be filmed; instead, they are created using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] technology. Production on the television version of ''Sanctuary'' began in early 2008, with a reshooting of the pilot episode, "[[Sanctuary for All]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938572.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Sanctuary|author=Lowry, Brian|title=Analysis of Sanctuary the TV Series|publisher=Variety Magazine|accessdate=October 2, 2009|date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/main/searchlist/8109.html|title=Finding Sanctuary in CG|accessdate=October 4, 2008|author=Romanello, Linda|date=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reshoot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/080910-sanctuary-wood.html|title=Green Screen Cowboy: Directing SCI FI's 'Sanctuary'|accessdate=October 4, 2008|author=Eramo, Steven|date=September 10, 2008|work=[[Newsarama.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season cost an estimated $21&amp;nbsp;million ([[Canadian dollar|CAN]]), and filmed in [[Burnaby]], British Columbia.&lt;ref name=canada.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=7af48a4b-a394-4eb7-9c05-4a0808997edc&amp;k=28025|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102050645/http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=7af48a4b-a394-4eb7-9c05-4a0808997edc&amp;k=28025|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 2, 2013|title=Made-in-Burnaby show gets Beedie's backing|first=Nic|last=Price|date=October 8, 2008|accessdate=October 9, 2010|work=Burnaby Now|publisher=Canada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, the series was confirmed to have been picked up for a second season of thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name="2nd-season"/&gt; The second season began production in the end of March/beginning of April, 2009. Guest stars for the second season include [[Agam Darshi]], who will play con-artist Kate Freelander,&lt;ref name=jent&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nt2099.com/J-ENT/news/american-entertainment/sci-fis-sanctuary-begins-production-on-season-2/|title=Sci Fi's Sanctuary Begins Production on Season 2|first=Dennis|last=Amith|date=April 6, 2009|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=J-ENT}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; former ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' actor [[Michael Shanks]] as Jimmy for the ninth episode, entitled "Penance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/06/sg-1s-michael-shanks-will.php|title=SG-1's Michael Shanks will guest-star in an episode of Sanctuary|first=Jenna|last=Busch|date=June 10, 2009|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Sci Fi Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' actor [[Paul McGillion]], who will play Wexford, a character he played in the webseries, in the final two episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/07/21/stargates-dr-beckett-to-guest-star-on-sanctuary/|title=Stargate's Dr. Beckett to guest star on Sanctuary|first=Mike|last=Moody|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=October 25, 2009|publisher=TV Squad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sanctuary'' is the first television series in North America to use the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED camera]] exclusively. The RED camera system does away with tape and film and records straight to a hard drive allowing the Anthem Visual Effects and the series' post production team immediate access to the day’s footage, and is capable of recording at resolutions up to 4096 horizontal by 2304 vertical pixels, four times the resolution of current day [[High-definition television|HD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/01/how-the-red-one-camera-makes-sci-fis-sanctuary-look-good.php|title=How the RED One camera makes SCI FI's Sanctuary look good|first=Peter|last=Pachel|date=January 13, 2009|accessdate=June 16, 2009|publisher=Sc Fi Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with being a primary cast member, Amanda Tapping is also an executive producer on the show, but according to Tapping herself in an interview with ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', she does not get paid extra as an executive producer, mainly because what salary the executive producers would get would go towards paying for the sets, because the series is not backed up by a studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5058675/tonights-sanctuary-premiere-is-green-but-greens-good|title=Tonight's Sanctuary Premiere Is Green, But Green's Good|first=Alex|last=Carnevale|date=October 3, 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=io9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although heavily reliant on virtual sets, a few episodes in the first season, including "Kush" and "Requiem", were filmed on practical sets, including the fuselage of an aircraft. The series also took a different filming style for the ''[[Cloverfield]]''-esque "Instinct".&lt;ref name="2nd-season"/&gt;

==Broadcast and release==
Unlike traditional TV series, the primary distribution channel for ''Sanctuary'' was originally the Internet. Episodes were sold directly to viewers on the official website. The web episodes or "[[webisode]]s", are about 15–20 minutes in duration and were released bi-weekly. The success of the webisodes led the [[Syfy]] Channel to commission a 13-episode season for 2008.&lt;ref name="13eps"/&gt; The first four webisodes were rewritten and reshot as a two-hour premiere episode, "[[Sanctuary for All]]".&lt;ref name="reshoot"/&gt; After the deal with the SciFi channel, the webisodes were moved to the Sci Fi network on Hulu.com.

In its first season on [[Syfy]], the original series, ''Sanctuary'' has averaged a 1.9 Household rating; 1,044,000 Adults (ages 18–49); 1,371,000 Adults (ages 25–54) and 2,366,000 total viewers. The pilot episode, "[[Sanctuary for All]]" received a Nielsen household rating of 2.2, the highest rated original series premiere from [[Syfy]] since the series premiere of ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'' in July 2006. The 2.2 rating represented more than 2.7&amp;nbsp;million viewers; 1.08&amp;nbsp;million among the adult 18–49 demographic and 1.4&amp;nbsp;million among the adult 25–54 demographic. This placed ''Sanctuary'' the number one cable program among adults 25–54, and number four among adults 18–49. The ratings success also boosted the web series to 1.2&amp;nbsp;million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/10/06/viewers-seek-sanctuary-on-sci-fi-1-program-among-adults-25-54/5779|title=VIEWERS SEEK ‘SANCTUARY’ ON SCI FI, No.&amp;nbsp;1 Program Among Adults 25–54|first=Bill|last=Gorman|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate=June 13, 2009|publisher=tvbythenumbers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, both parts placed the series first place on the top ten viewing programmes for [[ITV4]] during the two weeks they aired. The first part was viewed by 565,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10/?|title=BARB's multichannel top 10 programmes (Go on w/e 12/10/08, and scroll down to ITV4)|publisher=barb.co.uk|accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second part received a higher viewing figure of 608,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10/?|title=BARB's multichannel top 10 programmes (Go on w/e 19/10/08, and scroll down to ITV4)|publisher=barb.co.uk|accessdate=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
{{see also|List of awards and nominations received by Sanctuary}}
''Sanctuary'' has a score of 56 on [[Metacritic]], signifying "mixed or average reviews" based on 7 television reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/sanctuary?q=Sanctuary|title=Sanctuary reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tori Ireland Mell of ''IGN'' called the series an intriguing story, and a mind-blowing concept, and believes the series from a production standpoint was executed well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/915/915521p1.html|title=Sanctuary: "Sanctuary for All" Review|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2009|first=Tori|last=Ireland Mell|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers have made comparisons between ''Sanctuary'' and British science fiction series ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'', as well as drawing comparisons between Dr. Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) and [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] from ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scifi.about.com/od/sanctuary/fr/SANC_review.htm|title=Review: 'Sanctuary' Premiere|first=Mark|last=Wilson|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/10/04/sanctuary-sanctuary-for-all-season-premiere/|title=Sanctuary: Sanctuary for All (series premiere)|first=Jason|last=Hughes|date=October 4, 2008|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=TV Squad}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' reviewer Bill Keveney said that [[Amanda Tapping]] had reached her "comfort zone," and continued with further positive reaction to the TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-10-02-tapping-sanctuary_N.htm|title=Amanda Tapping finds her comfort zone in 'Sanctuary'|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=May 10, 2009|accessdate=May 10, 2009|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Bentley from ''[[McClatchy Newspapers]]'' commented Tapping's role as Dr. Helen Magnus was a way for the actress to make a name for herself outside of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' as character [[Samantha Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2008245692_tvsanctuary10.html|title=Star's new role more than a change of accents|first=Rick|last=Bentley|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2009|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' described the show as "competent if not particularly innovative sci-fi," and said that the series might be of interest to fans of Tapping's earlier works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/10/amanda-tapping.html|title=Amanda Tapping provides 'Sanctuary' to freaky critters|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|work=Chicago Tribune|date=October 3, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that the series does not have "the narrative force of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' or the wit and creativity of ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]''," further stating "it's not an embarrassment for the channel, but it doesn't raise the stakes either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/arts/television/03sanc.html?_r=1|title=TV Review – 'Sanctuary' – Amanda Tapping as a Sci Fi Channel Doctor With a Digital Menagerie|first=Mike|last=Hale|work=The New York Times|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sasuke''''' (サスケ; stylized in Japan as '''''SASUKE''''') is a Japanese [[sports entertainment]] [[television special]] in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage [[obstacle course]]. An edited version, named '''''Ninja Warrior''''', is screened in at least 18 other countries.

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Development==
Recorded on location at [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|Midoriyama]] studio in [[Yokohama]], it airs on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] between [[Japanese television drama]] seasons. The show's name ''Sasuke'' is named after [[Sarutobi Sasuke]], a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jamison|first1=Leslie|title=The Great American Obstacle Course|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-great-american-obstacle-course|accessdate=19 August 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each three-hour special (with the exception of ''Sasuke'' 24 which lasted 5 {{frac|1|2}} hours) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 35 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, except in 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|筋肉番付|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html "Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS renamed the show once again '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition.

Applicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.

In its 35 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:秋山和彦|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,&lt;ref&gt;"Yuuji Urushihara does it again" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).

===Popularity===
The popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.

''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Gary. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-12-07-ninja07_ST_N.htm "Americans latch onto G4's intense 'Ninja Warrior'"]. ''[[USA Today]]''. December 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.

Other international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), Germany ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) . An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.

==Competitors==
The show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Sasuke All-Stars===
The Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The six consisted of:
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=秋山和彦}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist. He is known for being the first contestant to ever achieve total victory. He has not been able to repeat his success, being hindered by an eye condition known as degenerative [[retinitis]] that has been affecting him for years. Overall, he has competed 20 times and has been officially retired since ''Sasuke'' 28 in 2012. An offer was made for Akiyama to return for the 30th anniversary tournament in 2014, but he declined and has remained retired since.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

†&amp;nbsp;– Nagano touched the top of the Shin-Cliffhanger after swinging from the second to the third ledge. He disqualified himself, admitting his error and bowing out after he reached the next platform.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; – Nagano was allowed a second attempt at the First Stage due to a malfunction of the Slider Jump.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Toshihiro Takeda|ja|3=竹田敏浩}}''', a [[firefighter]]. Known for reaching the Third Stage more than anyone else. He can usually be seen wearing his trademark orange firefighter pants and dark blue shirt, though he changed his trademark clothes since ''Sasuke'' 30 after he quit his firefighter job. However, he is the only All-Star that hasn't made it to the Final Stage yet. Overall, he has competed 26 times and continues to compete to this day. The only times he didn't appear were in ''Sasuke'' 26 and ''Sasuke'' 27, thus avoiding any risk affecting his new job as a Helicopter Rescue Jumper.

He is also the only person to have attempted the first and second version of the Final Stage in ''Sasuke'' 3 and ''Sasuke'' 7. He can be seen wearing his trademark gas station uniform shirt and cap (always with Esso/Mobil branding); he has only competed without it seven times (the 1st, 4th, and 28th since he changed his job). He continues to compete to this day.

He is also known for building obstacles in his backyard (over 13 of them, in fact), and many competitors have visited his home to train on the 'Shiratori Shrine' (However, as of ''Sasuke'' 30, it has been demolished). He has competed the least of the All-Stars: only 12 times due to chronic back and neck pains that have continued to plague him for years. Despite having only competed once since ''Sasuke'' 21, he is not officially retired and has not ruled out the possibility of returning should his health permit it, although this is unlikely.

He was once thought to be the one most likely to complete the entire course by the tournament's producers, but has not passed the First Stage in thirteen years, since tournament 12. He has "retired" from ''Sasuke'' on three separate occasions following the 12th, 24th and 28th tournaments, but returned each time nonetheless. He was given the nickname "Mr. ''Sasuke''" because he was once thought to be the most likely competitor to clear all four stages, but hasn't passed the First Stage since ''Sasuke'' 12. Overall, he has competed 27 times, second only to Yamamoto Shingo, but has been barred from competing since ''Sasuke'' 30 in 2014. However, on a broadcast of Nico Nico in December 2016, Inui Masato revealed to the chat that Katsumi Yamada will be allowed to return as it is the 20th anniversary of the show since it began airing in 1997, should he be healthy enough to compete.&lt;ref&gt;"Sasuke 3 Review: Keep Rolling, Rolling, Rolling Log: Final Stage Podcast Episode 21" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZxYq3TYak] ''Youtube'', January 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sasuke New Stars (Shin Sedai)===
The Sasuke New Stars (in contrast to the All stars) are new younger competitors who have made a name for themselves on the recent editions of the course. "Shin Sedai" or New Stars became famous since ''Sasuke'' 17, after Shunsuke Nagasaki made it to the Final Stage.  There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in ''Sasuke'' 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage.  Membership in the New Stars has included the following:

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shunsuke Nagasaki|ja|3=長崎峻侑}}''', a trampolinist. He is considered one of the most promising of recent competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This skilled trampolinist, who is called "Prince of the Trampoline", has won several medals in the Trampoline World Cups and Doha Asian Games. He made his debut in ''Sasuke'' 14. He is the first to be called one of the "Shin Sedai" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33. Surprisingly, he failed the Spider Walk in ''Sasuke'' 34. He failed the Spider Drop in ''Sasuke'' 35, the first time he failed the Second Stage for the two consecutive times. This meant that Nagasaki was eliminated at the Second Stage in consecutive tournaments for the first time. As of 2018, Nagasaki has completed the First Stage eleven times (five consecutively), the Second Stage seven times (four consecutively), and the Third Stage once.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Yuuji Urushihara|ja|3=漆原裕治}}''', a [[shoe]] salesman, an Unlimited Cliffer member No. 3.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} He spent upwards of five years trying to qualify through the ''Sasuke'' Trials. Finally, he qualified for ''Sasuke'' 21, and in the next tournament became the first competitor to reach Shin-''Sasuke''{{'s}} Final Stage. He got his Final Stage attempt in ''Sasuke'' 22, but he failed it close to the button. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he became the third person to achieve Kanzenseiha, and in ''Sasuke'' 27, he went on to become the only person to achieve it twice. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 29, he failed the Backstream. In ''Sasuke'' 30, he timed out on the Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he took more time to clear the Tackle and timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe. In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In SASUKE 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion.

In ''Sasuke'' 23, when Nagano Makoto joined him in the Final Stage, it was heard that Kanno was the leader of the Shin Sedai. After that in ''Sasuke'' 24, Kanno timed out on the First Stage, then in ''Sasuke'' 25 he failed the Balance Tank on the Second Stage. Then in ''Sasuke'' 26 he failed the Rolling Escargot on the First Stage, and in ''Sasuke'' 27 he withdrew before the Salmon Ladder on the Second Stage. Then he reached the Third Stage in ''Sasuke'' 28, 29, 30, and 31, failing the Crazy Cliffhanger the first three times, but clearing it on his fourth attempt. He failed on the next obstacle, Vertical Limit Kai. He timed out at the top of the Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 32, after dislocating his shoulder. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill; he jumped from the bottom of Rolling Hill too high but he couldn't save himself from his fall. He did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 34. He came back for SASUKE 35. He started strong, and even made the transition on the Dragon Glider, but the bar became crooked while dismounting, causing him to only get one foot on the platform and tap the water.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ryo Matachi|ja|3=又地諒}}''', a former painter and a plumber. He has competed nine times, failing the First Stage in his first three tries, but in ''Sasuke'' 27, his best performance, he made it to the Final Stage, timing out mere inches from the buzzer on the Tsuna Nobori. In the next two tournaments, he failed the Passing Wall and Backstream, respectively. However, in ''Sasuke'' 30, he made it to the Final Stage where he almost got to the buzzer, but time ran out. In ''Sasuke'' 31 however Ryo fell a victim to the Warped Wall along with Nagano and Yuuji due to the endurance needed in order to complete the obstacle. In ''Sasuke'' 32, he timed out at the Tarzan Rope, after having trouble with the Tackle and Soritatsu Kabe. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed the new obstacle Fishbone in the first transition although his run was digested.{{clarify|reason=Runs can't be eaten, and I can't guess what was intended. Similarly wherever the word "digested" appears in this article.|date=June 2018}} He surprisingly failed the Double Pendulum in ''Sasuke'' 34 and got digested once again. He once again timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe, thus failing the First Stage for the 5th straight time in ''Sasuke'' 35.

*'''Yusuke Suzuki''', a PE teacher in a junior high school in Kanagawa. He competed five times. He competed since ''Sasuke'' 16 but his run was all cut. After a seven-year hiatus, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Spin Bridge and the second wall of the Ni Ren Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 30. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was completely cut. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 32 wearing number 66, and completed the First Stage for the first time with just 2.12 seconds remaining. He then went on to clear the Second Stage, becoming one of eight to do so, with 9.59 seconds remaining. However, his first attempt on the Third Stage was a struggle. On the first transition of the Drum Hopper he slipped and nearly fell, and only just managed to reposition himself, while the other transitions showed signs of unease. His strength was sapped for the next obstacle, the Flying Bar, where he failed the first transition after the bar did not reach the second set of rungs. In his fluff piece for ''Sasuke'' 32, it was falsely stated that he had failed the First Stage four times, when in fact he had competed for the first time in four tournaments beforehand. In ''Sasuke'' 33, his run was digested but he failed the Double Pendulum. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he failed the Sidewinder Kai. He was unable to repeat his performance from the previous tournament as he had a surprising fall on the Fish Bone in ''Sasuke'' 35.

===Athletes===
World-class athletes, including Olympians, have attempted ''Sasuke'':

====Japanese athletes====

Several Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage Rolling Escargot.

After the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.

====American athletes====
Various American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&amp;nbsp;– in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.

[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.

[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.

Levi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.

Levi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.

Levi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.

He has not competed in ''American Ninja Warrior'' ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About - Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |url=https://realeyeshomestead.com/about/ |website=Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.

He also participated in ''American Ninja Challenge'' and then became an ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' stalwart once NBC and G4/Esquire created an entire American-based ''Sasuke'' competition. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 (reaching the Third Stage), after he won the ''Sasuke'' Asean Open Cup 2013 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (where he achieved a gold medal in overall stages) and ''ANW'' Season 7 and 8 (where he is to compete in the Vegas Finals) in the space of a calendar year. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 31 and failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. He made his fourth appearance in ''Sasuke'' 32; he is the first person ever to beat the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger and the third American to clear the Japanese Cliffhanger, after Travis Allen Schroeder in ''Sasuke'' 4 and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8, but he failed the next obstacle Vertical Limit Kai. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he failed the second trial on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, due to timing problems on the moving ledge. He fell at the same place just like the last tournament in ''Sasuke'' 34. He managed to clear the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, the second time he cleared it. Unfortunately, he failed on the first ledge of the Vertical Limit, he managed to get hold of the ledge and made it halfway before falling in ''Sasuke'' 35.

*'''[[Jessie Graff]]''', a stuntwoman who currently works on the [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'' TV series]]. Previously a pole vaulter in college, she initially competed in multiple seasons of ''American Ninja Warrior'', becoming the first woman to complete Stage 1 in Las Vegas in 2016. In 2017, she became both the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') and Stage 2 at the original Mt. Midoriyama (''Sasuke'' 34). In Stage 3, she went out on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger at the first transition, but not before earning an invitation to the next tournament.

*'''[[Kacy Catanzaro]]''', the first woman in the world to clear the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder while competing in ''American Ninja Warrior'' (''ANW'' 6 in 2014, during the Dallas qualifiers). In 2016, she competed at ''Sasuke'' 32 but narrowly timed out on Stage 1 after passing the Warped Wall.

====Bulgarian athletes====
[[Bulgaria]]n gymnast and six-time Olympian (1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012) [[Yordan Yovchev]] (spelled on G4 as '''Jordan Jovtchev''') first competed in the 8th competition. During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 23, where he managed to pass all of the other obstacles but sadly timed out on the final rope ladder.

*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lee En-Chih|ja|3=リー・エンチ}}''' (who was incorrectly listed as ''Lee Yen Chi'' in the US version and was mistakenly called ''Lee Enchi'' or ''Li En Zhi'' for years), is a professional rock climber from Taiwan. In his first attempt in ''Sasuke'' 17, he cleared the First Stage but failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 18, he failed the Jumping Spider in the First Stage. After a two-tournament absence, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 21 and was one of only nine competitors to make it to the Second Stage, timing out on Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he was one of four people to make it to the Third Stage, ultimately failing the Shin-Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he made it to the Final Stage for the first time but timed out 19 meters away. Li became the third foreigner to reach the Final Stage since [[Yordan Yovchev]] and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8. In ''Sasuke'' 25, he went to the Third Stage, but he failed the Ultimate Cliffhanger. He made it back to the Ultimate Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 26, but again failed there.  In ''Sasuke'' 25 and 26, Li finished first overall, becoming the only foreigner to have progressed further than any competitor in consecutive tournaments. After making it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger two times, it looked as if Li would go all the way in ''Sasuke'' 27. However, he shocked many when he failed the Step Slider in Stage 1. This was his earliest defeat ever, and first time failing Stage 1 since ''Sasuke'' 18. He failed the First Stage yet again in ''Sasuke'' 28, on the Spinning Bridge. He finally cleared the First Stage again in ''Sasuke'' 29, but timed out on the Passing Wall, on the Second Stage. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He decided to retire from ''Sasuke'' due to replacement by Taiwan representatives. Since ''Sasuke'' 31, his fellow Liao Long Zhun fully ruled the Taiwan representatives. He is also the only foreigner to clear Stage One six times in a row (''Sasuke'' 21–26).

====Tahitian athletes====
*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ragivaru Anastase|ja|3=ラギヴァル・アナスターズ}}''', a Tahitian dance instructor, competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. He was fastest with 35 seconds left. But he failed on the Crazy Cliffhanger. Then, he joined ''Sasuke'' 32. He had the fastest time again in the First Stage and Second Stage, but he failed the Flying Bar when he ran the obstacle in bad weather. In ''Sasuke'' 33, his run was digested and surprisingly failed the Rolling Hill. He made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 34 and fell before the first transition.

Former [[Pride Fighting Championships]] and [[Pancrase]] Japanese mixed martial artist and pro wrestler [[Ikuhisa Minowa]], competing in [[DREAM (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]] known as "Minowaman", was featured in the 26th competition wearing red wrestling tights, pads, and boots. He failed the second obstacle, "Hazard Swing" after jumping from the swing, and missing the rope on the platform, falling into the water below. He also competed in the 29th competition, but failed the first obstacle, the "Long Jump", where he landed feet first onto the sandbox and jumped backwards into the water. Japanese featherweight mixed martial artist from DREAM [[Hideo Tokoro]] (announced as a "freelance fighter") was featured right after Minowaman in the 26th competition where he failed to grab the rope to swing himself to the other side in the first obstacle "Step Slider".

Several professional wrestlers have also competed, including [[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]], [[Masanori Murakawa|The Great Sasuke]] (referred to as ''Great Ninja Warrior'' in the US and UK versions), [[Minoru Suzuki]], [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], [[Kota Ibushi]]  and [[Naohiro Hoshikawa]]. Suzuki and Tanahashi were the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship|Triple Crown Heavyweight]] and [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]], respectively, during their runs in the course.

===Japanese entertainers===
Several Japanese or Japan-based entertainers have taken part in ''Sasuke'', including action movie star [[Kane Kosugi]] and his brother Shane. Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition. He reached the Final Stage in the 8th competition, becoming, alongside [[Yordan Yovchev]], the first foreigner to make it that far. Competing in heavy rain, Kane timed out on the Rope Climb; he has not competed since. Shane timed out on the Second Stage's Wall Lift in the 2nd competition, then failed the First Stage's Rolling Log in the 3rd competition. In the 4th, he came close to completing the First Stage but timed out on the Rope Climb. In the 6th and 7th competitions, he made it to the Third Stage, failing both times on the Body Prop. In the 8th competition, he failed to get past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Unlike his brother, Shane competed in the 9th competition, where he failed the Big Boulder in the First Stage.

Other entertainers who have competed include {{Interlanguage link multi|Hiromichi Sato|ja|3=佐藤弘道}}, host of several [[NHK]] children's programs; Shigeyuki Nakamura, a champion of the Muscle Gym event in ''[[Kinniku Banzuke]]''; actor-singer Kazumi Morohoshi, a former member of the band Hikaru Genji who is now a solo artist; actor/announcer [[Kenjirō Ishimaru]]; and actors Masaki Nomura and [[Shōei]]. Sato debuted in the 18th tournament and failed the First Stage's Flying Chute. In the 19th tournament, he failed the Log Grip. In the 20th competition, he timed out before he attempted the Tarzan Rope. In the 21st competition, he timed out on the Warped Wall. In the 22nd, Sato finally cleared the First Stage but failed the Metal Spin in the Second. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Metal Spin again. He missed ''Sasuke'' 25, but failed the Jumping Spider again in ''Sasuke'' 26. He missed ''Sasuke'' 27 and 28 but competed in 29, where he shocked the crowd by unexpectedly going out on the first obstacle, the Long Jump. Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Shōei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.

Actor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions. In his first attempt, he failed the Jump Hang in the First Stage, but in the next tournament, he made it all the way to the Third, where he was defeated by the first obstacle, the Propeller Bars.

Actor and singer [[Tetsuji Sakakibara]] competed four times (23rd–26th tournaments) but never cleared the First Stage, failing on the Jumping Spider in the 23rd and 24th tournaments, the Jump Hang in the 25th tournament, and the Half-Pipe Attack in the 26th tournament.

Actor [[Ryosuke Yamamoto (actor)|Ryosuke Yamamoto]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 and ''Sasuke'' 31. He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30. In ''Sasuke'' 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orugōru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.

[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actress]] [[Tomoko Kaneda]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in ''Sasuke'' 35.

[[Golden Bomber]] members Kenji Darvish and Yutaka Kyan also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Kyan failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Darvish had previously competed in ''Sasuke'' 28 and 30 and failed the First Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he finally completed the First Stage and failed the Cross Slider in the Second Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 32, Kyan did better on the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance on the new obstacle Tie Fighter. Darvish failed at the Tie Fighter when he lost his balance. In ''Sasuke'' 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting in ''Sasuke'' 35.

===Japanese comedians===
Several Japanese comedians have taken part in ''Sasuke'', including {{Interlanguage link multi|Akira Omori|ja|3=大森晃|lt=Akira Omori}} ("The Monkey"), [[Koriki Choshu]] ("the most famous gut in Japan" and 2nd on G4's Craziest Contestants Poll), [[Passion Yara]] ("screaming wacko" and 5th on G4s craziest contestants poll), [[Masaki Sumitani]] ("Razor Ramon H.G." or "Hard Gay"), [[Yoku Hata]] ("Guitar Samurai"), [[Tetsurō Degawa]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Kinnikun Nakayama|ja|3=なかやまきんに君}}. Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&amp;nbsp;– for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st–3rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26–28), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka "Mr. Narcissus") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.

Penalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=ワッキー}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.

===Other notable competitors===
65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as "the Octopus" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.

Toyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the "Japanese Bruce Lee" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.

45-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.

===Women in ''Sasuke''===
The first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.&lt;ref&gt;In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.

[[:jp:遊佐雅美|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as "Miyabi" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a "Warrior Wipeout" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.

All three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.

* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4–6)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times – the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.

* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.

* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.

American gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.

Another American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] – the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') – was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament.

===American Ninja Challenges===
{{Main article|American Ninja Challenge}}
In fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28–30 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.

The second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.

The third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&amp;nbsp;– the first woman to qualify&amp;nbsp;– of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.

The fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he "underestimated the cardio" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.

In the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.

==List of ''Sasuke'' stages and obstacles==

===Stage 1===
One hundred participants are given the opportunity to attempt the First Stage, a course which primarily tests one's speed. The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.

Typically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.

That goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.

{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names "{{lang|ja|フリークライミング}}"(Free Climbing) and "{{lang|ja|�?登り}}"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the "Mountain Climb" in subtitles.

{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later become the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.

{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Prism See-Saw" is called the "Prism Tilt" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Prism See-Saw."

{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Cross Bridge" is called the "Bridge of Blades" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Cross Bridge."

{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the "Rope Hang," but that name is erroneous.

{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.

{{note|8|8}} As of the 22nd competition, G4 has referred to the Tarzan Rope/Rope Ladder combination as the "Final Climb".

{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.

{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Tackle" is called the "Triple Tackle" in the UK English dub. 

{{note|11|11}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "TIE Fighter" is called the "Prop Slider" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from the Star Wars franchise to use a name associated with a Star Wars character. 
&lt;/div&gt;

===Stage 2===
Those with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.

Unlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as "Mr. ''Sasuke''" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.

On average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.

'''+''' — This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.

&lt;div class="references-small;"&gt;
{{note|10|10}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names "{{lang|ja|スパイダーウォーク}}" (Spider Walk), "{{lang|ja|動�??�?}}" (Moving Walls) and "{{lang|ja|スパイダークライム}}" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it "Spider Walk".

{{note|11|11}} The onscreen Japanese graphics "{{lang|ja|五連�?ンマー}}" reveal this obstacle's real name as "Five Continuous Hammers". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.

{{note|12|12}} In those competitions there are two "Moving Walls" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.

{{note|13|13}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Third Stage===
The Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply "sticky spray" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.

Out of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.

But the English version and the Japanese announcer call them the "Climbing Bars," one of the many [[gairaigo]] (words borrowed from [[English language|English]]) used to describe ''Sasuke'' obstacles.

{{note|20|20}} In the 19th and 20th this obstacle was the Sending Climber, but in the 21st they changed the obstacle and the name to Hang Climbing. G4 calls it Ascending Climb.

{{note|21|21}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the "Lamp Grasper" is called the "Globe Grasp" in subtitles. But the Japanese announcer calls it the "Lamp Grasper."

{{note|22|22}} The Kudari Lamp Grasper is also called the Descending Lamp Grasper. G4 continues to call it the "Globe Grasp."

{{note|23|23}} The Vertical Limit Kai was modified to have three separate sections instead of two.
&lt;/div&gt;

===Final Stage===
To date, the Final Stage has known six forms. Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|完全制覇}}), translated roughly as "complete domination", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as "total victory". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.

Of all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.

The original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15 meter (49&amp;nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.

The second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.

The third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} "Heavenly Ladder" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} "G Rope." The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.

The fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20 meter (66&amp;nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5 meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.

The fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&amp;nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.

For the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18–24 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7–17 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&amp;nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (スパイダークライム) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&amp;nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (綱登り) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&amp;nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&amp;nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35 second Final Stage is not out of the question.

The prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|¥]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|¥]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.

Typically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.

&lt;div class="references-small;" &gt;
{{note|24|24}} According to the Sasuke Mania Official Site, the official Japanese names for the ropes in 1st–4th, 5th–17th, and 25th–27th are "{{lang|ja|15m綱登り}}", "{{lang|ja|10m綱登り}}" and "{{lang|ja|20m綱登り}}" respectively, in which "{{lang|ja|綱登り}}" means "Rope Climb". ''Ninja Warrior'' just calls them "Rope Climb", without the length of the ropes.

{{note|25|25}}  If the "Spider Climb" is not completed in fifteen seconds, the walls start to slide back, making it harder to traverse, and finally impossible if not completed soon after.

&lt;/div&gt;

===United States===
{{further information|American Ninja Warrior}}
The program previously aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] in the United States under the name '''''Ninja Warrior'''''. Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the "Ninja Killer" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and "Warrior Wipeout" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].

The show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.

As of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that "Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants." and that they "...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles." Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that "Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year."

====''American Ninja Warrior''====

{{main article|American Ninja Warrior}}
The popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.

The qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.

''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.

A second season was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a "boot camp" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.

After boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan "Rocket" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.

The third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'' debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan "Rocket" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael "Frosti" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David "Young Flip" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.

Of the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.

A fourth season of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&amp;nbsp;– regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.

The show returned for its fifth season on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round.

=====''USA vs Japan''=====
{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan .282014-Present.29|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}

In 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.

At the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&amp;nbsp;– one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6–0 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)

Sideswipe (sometimes'' 'Agujero''' in [[Mexico]], '''Lambor''' in [[Japan]], '''Frérot''' [[Québec]], '''Freccia''' (meaning "arrow") in [[Italy]]) is described in his tech file as a brave but often brash warrior. He is almost as skilled as his twin brother [[Sunstreaker]] in combat, but is less ruthless. Sideswipe transformed into a red [[Lamborghini Countach]], while his brother, Sunstreaker, transformed into a yellow Lamborghini Countach. Because of his jetpack, Sideswipe was one of few G1 Autobots with the ability to fly and capacity for space flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transformers The Ultimate Guide|last=Furman|first=Simon|year=2004|publisher=DK Publications|ISBN=978-0-7566-3012-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s The Journal did a report on how some people considered Transformers like Sideswipe and other war toys too violent for children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/transformers-make-coleslaw-of-the-cabbage-patch&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=April 2015|reason=does not mention Sideswipe by name, but was he listed in the video as one of the red cars? }} Dreamwave comics artist [[Pat Lee (comics)|Pat Lee]] says his favorite Transformer is Sideswipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/01.03/feature/2/index.php3|title=Animefringe: Features: Transformers The Comic: An Interview With Pat Lee|author=Animefringe|date=|work=animefringe.com|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
Sideswipe was part of the initial crew of Autobots aboard the ''Ark'' when it crash-landed on Earth four million years ago. He awakened along with his fellow Transformers in 1984, with both he and his brother being reformatted into [[Lamborghini]] sports cars. Sideswipe loaned [[Optimus Prime]] the use of his rocket pack when the Decepticons nearly escaped from Earth with a starship full of energon. Throughout Seasons 1 and 2, Sideswipe was voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]].

Sideswipe and Sunstreaker often operated together. When antimatter-fueled Decepticons attacked the Ark on one occasion in the episode "Roll for It", Sideswipe and Sunstreaker took to the air to battle with the incoming seeker jets, in a rambunctious, if ultimately ineffective, display of "''jet judo.''"

When investigating tremors that were shaking the Autobot base, [[Ironhide]]'s scanner found some interesting objects inside a rock wall. Sideswipe, using his piston-like arms, helped [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]] remove the rock wall and found a cave full of dinosaur bones, the discovery of which would lead to the development of the [[Dinobots]].

Towards the end of 1985, Sideswipe, impersonating himself as the [[Stunticon]] [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters|Breakdown]], is among the team of five Autobots who disguised themselves as the Stunticons. Penetrating the Decepticons' camp, the Autobots ran into trouble when the real Stunticons arrived, trying to prove their identities by forming [[Menasor]]. With a combination of [[Windcharger]]'s magnetic powers and [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]]'s illusion-creating ability, the Autobots were able to appear as Menasor too, but the deception was soon revealed, though they were still able to thwart the Decepticons' plans. Another major role for Sideswipe was stopping the [[Combaticons]]' plot to pull the Earth into the sun, in which he and other Autobots team up with Decepticons to travel to Cybertron. Sideswipe himself reversed the effects of the plot, saving the Earth.

In an early script for ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' there was a scene planned where Sideswipe, [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]] and [[Tracks (Transformers)|Tracks]] hop off [[Ultra Magnus]] to attack [[Constructicons|Devastator]], but they are pushed back and Red Alert is shot in the back and killed.

Sideswipe appears in the first two episodes of the Japanese series ''[[Transformers: Headmasters]]'', participating with [[Ultra Magnus]], the [[Trainbots]], and [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] (who may have mistakenly appeared, as he was killed in ''The Transformers: The Movie'') on a shootout against the [[Triple Changers]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], and [[Sixshot]]. During a segment of this intense shootout, Sideswipe manages to hit [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]] and later, after foiling a new Decepticon assault, has also a line.

===Books===
Sideswipe appeared in the 1984 sticker and story book ''[[Return to Cybertron]]'' written by [[Suzanne Weyn]] and published by [[Marvel Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~sstoneb/tf/books/sticker/return/return.html|title=Marvel Books- Transformers Sticker Book: Return to Cybertron|author=|date=|work=ohio-state.edu|accessdate=February 28, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722103816/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~sstoneb/tf/books/sticker/return/return.html|archivedate=July 22, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sideswipe was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio book ''[[List of Transformers books#Autobots' Lightning Strike|Autobots' Lightning Strike]]''.

Sideswipe appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book ''[[List of Transformers books#The Lost Treasure of Cybertron|The Lost Treasure of Cybertron]]'' by Marvel Books.

Sideswipe was featured in the 1993 ''Transformers: Generation 2'' coloring book "[[Decepticon Madness]]" by [[Bud Simpson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Bud|isbn=1-56144-346-8|title=Decepticon Madness|publisher=[[Modern Publishing]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===

====3H Enterprises====
Sideswipe returned in the pages of the [[BotCon]] exclusive ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' comics. He was amongst the Autobot heroes of the Great War welcomed back to Cybertron. However, all of them were transported away by [[Unicron]]. Reformatted into a new body, he was forced to fight for Unicron's amusement (and unbeknownst to all, so that the Spark energy from fallen combatants could revitalize his own shattered frame). He ends up fighting his own brother. All were subsequently freed by the resurrected [[Optimus Primal]], and Sideswipe went on to serve him as part of the new Autobot faction.

Although Universe ended at issue #3, the flashback of [[Optimus Prime (Robots in Disguise)|Optimus Prime]] would reveal what happened. In the final battle between the forces of Optimus Primal and Unicron, the Chaos-Bringer had disappeared (due to the events of ''[[Transformers: Energon]]''), with Primal's forces barely making it out. Sideswipe was among those seen escaping.

====Devil's Due Publishing====
In this reimagining of the Generation One story, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. In this storyline Sideswipe and Sunstreaker both turned into Cobra Stingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yojoe.com/vehicles/84/stinger/|title=YOJOE.COM - Cobra Stinger|author=|date=|work=yojoe.com|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Destro]] attempted to use them in a battle against G.I. Joe, but the two of them were temporarily put out of commission by [[Wheeljack]]. They were later seen fighting the Decepticons on Cobra Island.

Sideswipe reappeared in the third crossover series as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force trying to rescue Optimus Prime. Sideswipe returned in the fourth crossover as part of a group led by Prowl working with former G.I. Joe leader Hawk to stop the spread of Cybertronian technology on Earth. After failing to apprehend Destro, the group relaxed on their ship - only to be attacked by the [[Monster Pretenders]], with Sideswipe being incapacitated. He was later shown being repaired.

====Dreamwave Productions====
Before the civil war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, Sideswipe was a merchant. After the war broke out he joined the Autobots. When Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobots splintered into smaller factions. Sideswipe stayed with the main Autobot force, now under the leadership of Prowl.

With the Autobots learned that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Sideswipe was part of a small investigation team led by Prowl. They discovered the mobile command base to be [[Trypticon]] and were forced to battle with little chance of success until the giant [[Decepticon]] was ordered to leave.

Some time after being reawakened on Earth four million years later, Sideswipe was aboard a ship named 'The Ark II' created by the Autobots and their human allies to end the war on Earth and return to Cybertron. However, the ship was sabotaged and exploded shortly after take-off. The human allies were killed, but Sideswipe and other Autobots were lost in the ocean. Sideswipe and the other lost Autobots were later found by Optimus Prime who used the Matrix to revive them. Sideswipe fought in the battle against the Decepticons in [[San Francisco]], attacking [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] with Sunstreaker.

When [[Ultra Magnus]] came to Earth claiming that the Earth-based Autobots were Cybertonian criminals; Optimus Prime surrendered and returned to Cybertron with half of his force. Sideswipe was amongst those ordered to stay behind, now under the command of [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]].

Sideswipe and the other Autobots who remained on Earth were attacked by [[Starscream]] and [[Combaticons|Bruticus]]. Sideswipe fell in this battle and was later repaired by the Earth Defense Command.

As part of a small group led by Jazz and [[Marissa Faireborn]] of the Earth Defense Command to search for missing soldiers and solve the mystery of the deserted city, Sideswipe found and battled the Insecticons along with his twin brother Sunstreaker. After defeating the [[Insecticons]], the Autobots rejoined the other Autobots and were led by Prowl to the site of the future Autobot City: Earth.

====IDW Publishing====
Long ago, before the war, Sunstreaker and Sideswipe were law enforcers working under the Senate, and were involved with the arrest of Impactor.

Sideswipe made his first [[IDW Publishing]] appearance in the ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' issue on [[Galvatron]]. Assigned to [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]]'s unit on Cybertron guarding [[Thunderwing]]'s body.

Chafing under Hound's command due to Sunstreaker going missing on Earth (in ''[[The Transformers: Escalation]]''), Sideswipe clashed with his superior, even going over his head to call [[Optimus Prime]] on Earth, being reprimanded as a result. However, the matter was rendered moot when the mysterious Galvatron appeared, killing [[Leadfoot (Transformers)|Leadfoot]]. An enraged Sideswipe blasted him, and was blasted aside as a result. While the rest of Hound's unit engaged Galvatron, Sideswipe recovered and blew apart Galvatron's head with a single full-powered shot. As Hound chastised him, the undead Galvatron recovered and rendered the whole unit unconscious with one blast, before leaving with Thunderwing.

Sideswipe and his unit were redeployed to Earth under Optimus Prime's orders in issue #1 of ''[[The Transformers: Devastation]]'', but were rediverted to Garrus-9 following the Decepticons' abduction of the [[Monster Pretenders|Monstructor components]].

Sideswipe has appeared among the Autobots on Cybertron in ''All Hail Megatron''. He now appears to have a form based on the ''Universe Classics Series'' Sideswipe toy.

====Marvel Comics====
In the original ''Marvel Transformers'' comics, Sideswipe's role was largely similar to that of the animated series, serving as a loyal warrior under Optimus Prime.

Sideswipe joined the list of the long-term injured during the ''Dinobot Hunt''. He was charged, along with [[Silverstreak|Bluestreak]] and [[Huffer (Transformers)|Huffer]], with bringing in the powerful Dinobot, [[Grimlock]]. Unfortunately, the party found the mentally ill Grimlock locked in vicious combat with [[Sludge (Transformers)|Sludge]], who had been planted there by the Decepticons. Sideswipe was seriously injured while trying to contain the situation, but managed at least to put out a distress call, alerting [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and Optimus Prime.

He appeared to avoid deactivation by the [[Underbase]] powered [[Starscream]], he was not seen again after issue #50 of the US comic.

He appeared again in the Generation 2 comics as part of a raiding party under Grimlock that was outthought and captured by the forces of [[Jhiaxus]]. He was freed by Prime, and later appeared battling the [[Swarm (Transformers)|Swarm]].

Originally called Stepper in the Japanese series "Micron Legend", he was renamed Sideswipe (with a space) when Hasbro released the series in America. Transforming into a blue Nissan Skyline, Sideswipe's alternate mode is as realistic as an Armada toy can get to an actual vehicle. However, his robot mode is considered by many to be very poorly designed and is the subject of much ridicule.

Note: Early packaging of Sideswipe spelled his name without a space, but it was later added. According to online posts by Hasbro employees there was a mixup in the naming of Sideswipe and Mini-Con [[Nightbeat (Transformers)|Nightbeat]], and the original intention was for them to have each other's name, making this toy a true homage to the original Nightbeat.

===Animated series===
Sideswipe first appears in the Armada episode "Past"(Part 1) as a rookie in Optimus Prime's squad. He is rather ridiculous and awkward youth. In the animated series it is revealed that once he had been saved from Decepticon execution by [[Blurr]], and has travelled to Earth to join him at last. But Blurr is not too glad to have such a subordinate. So, by Prime's consent, he charges [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] to take care of Sideswipe. Initially Hot Shot is displeased very much that he has to fuss over such a misfit, but he begins to train him, however. When Hot Shot's former friend [[Wheeljack]] arrives and attacks him, Sideswipe does his best to defend his trainer. And when Sideswipe himself is taken a prisoner by Wheeljack, Hot Shot immediately races to his rescue. Though the conflagration threatens to consume them all, Hot Shot abandons the fight to save Sideswipe, successfully getting him out just in time. Since this moment Sideswipe hero-worships his new friend, much to Hot Shot's amusement, though the latter sometimes feels annoyed with such enthusiastic displays of friendship and even tries to get away from his admirer.

Sideswipe always did everything to prove his fighting skill to everyone in practice, but he never had become a great warrior, however. Nevertheless, he proved to be a real boon for the Autobots because of his good understanding of the computers (for example, he succeeded in deciphering the secret access code of the Decepticon Base revealed by [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]). Later, Sideswipe served as Hot Shot's most loyal soldier when that one briefly took command of the Autobots after [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]]'s death.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Sideswipe also appeared in [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]]'s '' Transformers: Armada'' comic, with a much lesser role. He first appeared in issue #14. He was one of a team of Autobots under [[Jetfire]] who investigated odd Space Bridge activity at the Decepticon HQ - unaware it had been taken over by the [[Heralds of Unicron]]. [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] was still present, and stalked Jetfire's team. Sideswipe survived relatively unscathed - unlike [[Blurr]] and [[Dropshot (Transformers)|Dropshot]] - and helped to eventually destroy the samurai Decepticon.

Sideswipe was last seen in issue #18 of the Armada series and did not make any appearances in the Transformers: Energon comic series.

This Sideswipe (again spelled without a space) is an alternate universe version of the ''Generation 1'' character from the [[BotCon]] exclusive ''Shattered Glass'' comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots are evil.

Although initially an evil Autobot, Sideswipe was betrayed by Optimus Prime - who killed Sideswipe's mentor Drench. Sideswipe repainted himself in Drench's colors while bearing a scar across his chest, and joined the Decepticons to avenge his mentor's death. He is partnered with the Decepticon Micromaster Whisper, who he refers to as his "Mini-Con."

Sideswipe appears as a member of Megatron's forces in the ''Transformers: Timelines'' story "[[Shattered Glass (Transformers)|Shattered Glass]]" by [[Fun Publications]]. He befriends a lost Autobot named [[Cliffjumper]], a traveler from another dimension where the Autobots are heroic, and helps the Decepticons in the attack on the Ark launch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Espen Grundetjern |date=Botcon 2008 |editor=Pete Sinclair &amp; Brian Savage |inker=[[Don Figueroa]] |issue=3 |letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Don Figueroa |publisher=Fun Publications |story=Shattered Glass |title=Transformers Timelines |volume=2 |writer=Pete Sinclair &amp; Benson Yee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sideswipe appears in the fiction "Dungeons &amp; Dinobots", a text based story. He defends the Arch-Ayr fuel dump from an Autobot attack and later helps capture the Dinobots [[Slugfest (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines|Slugfest]] and [[Goryu#Transformers: Timelines|Goryu]] for the Decepticons. Cliffjumper and Sideswipe then track [[Grimlock#Transformers: Timelines|Grimlock]] to an ancient crypt, which ends up being the home of the life-creating computer known as the [[Omega Terminus]]. They are joined by the Autobots [[Rodimus#Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)|Rodimus]] and [[Blurr#Transformers: Timelines|Blurr]], who are also hunting Grimlock. The enemies end up joining forces to fight Grimlock, the Terminus and a host of zombie transformers, including Drench and this world's [[Cliffjumper (other incarnations)#Transformers: Timelines|Cliffjumper]]. They escape, but their memories of the event are suppressed by the Terminus.

In "Do Over", Sideswipe is present when [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)|Megatron]] announces the impending launch of the ''Nemesis'', designed to stop the Autobot warship known as the ''Ark''. The ''Nemesis'' launches after the ''Ark'', and after a brief battle the ''Nemesis'' is shot down and crashes on Earth, with the crew escaping in stasis pods. Although not directly depicted, Sideswipe is a member of the crew of the ''Nemesis''.

In ''Blitzwing Bop'', Sideswipe, [[Bombshell (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)|Bombshell]] and [[Blitzwing#Transformers: Timelines|Blitzwing]] stop a scheme by [[Female Autobots#Transformers: Timelines|Elita One]] and [[Brawn (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines|Brawn]] to make attack drones from human cars by implanting control devices in the cars in a car wash.

Sideswipe appears in the [[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|second]] and [[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|third]] of the [[Transformers (film series)|live action film series]]. He transforms into a [[Chevrolet Corvette#Concept cars|Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Concept]] in 2009 and a Chevrolet Centennial Corvette convertible in 2011. He has two wheeled feet like Bonecrusher from the first film. Sideswipe is armed with guns, a back-mounted machine gun and Cybertanium blades. Early concept art of Sideswipe portrayed him as being red, but he ended up silver, presumably due to director [[Michael Bay]]'s notion that the color red does not photograph well on film (the same reason [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#The Transformers|Optimus Prime]] in the film series is primarily blue over red). His Hasbro battle bio states that he is 15&amp;nbsp;ft. tall and that he is a master in almost every form of [[martial arts]] on Cybertron.

In ''Revenge of the Fallen'', Sideswipe first appears in the chase in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], pursuing the Decepticon Sideways. Using his wheeled feet to maneuver, Sideswipe somersaulted over him while shooting at him, then threw one of his arm blades into the front of Sideways' vehicle mode. As he landed, Sideswipe reattached the blade (which was still embedded in Sideways) and forced it lengthwise down Sideways' body, cutting him in half. He was also seen in the fight against the Decepticons after [[Optimus Prime]] was killed by [[Megatron]] as [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and the twins escaped with Sam. Sideswipe was surrounded by the human military and forced to go back to the Autobot base alongside [[Ironhide]], [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]], [[Arcee]], [[List of female Transformers|Chromia]], [[List of female Transformers|Elita-One]] and Jolt. They arrived in Egypt and fought against many Decepticons. Sideswipe was the first to spot Sam and watched as Optimus Prime was resurrected. Sideswipe was brushed aside by [[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]] when he teleported in front of them.

Sideswipe returns in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' as one of the main Autobots. He accompanies Bumblebee, [[Wheeljack|Que/Wheeljack]], and Dino/Mirage when they investigated a nuclear facility in the Middle East. Later he joined Dino and Bumblebee in accompanying the humans to find out more about the Space Race. Sideswipe helped Bumblebee and Dino fight the three Dreads on the highway, who are after [[Sentinel Prime]], using his stealth force weapons to shoot at Hatchet. He then helped Ironhide finish off Crowbar and Crankcase in a ''Mexican Standoff'', as Sideswipe called it. Sideswipe was expelled from Earth along with the other Autobots and was thought to have perished when [[Starscream]] destroyed the Xanthium. He participated in the final battle in Chicago. He was captured by the Decepticons and witnessed the death of Que. He almost shared Que's fate, but escaped after [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]] and Brains crashed a Decepticon carrier ship. He helped Bumblebee and Ratchet fire at incoming Decepticons, and briefly battled Sentinel Prime alongside them, but he was blasted backwards by the treacherous Prime. Sideswipe was among the surviving Autobots at the end of the film.

In Transformers: The Last Knight reveals that Wheelie and Topspin have survived being hunted by Cemetery Wind. And given that Sideswipe was also mentioned to have been killed by Cemetery Wind in ''Age of Extinction Topps Europe collector cards'', the only Autobots who survived the end of Dark of the Moon whose current status is unknown is Dino and Roadbuster.

Sideswipe was spotlighted in ''Tales of the Fallen'' #2, which revealed the Autobot trained under [[Ironhide#Transformers|Ironhide]], and was charged with protecting an Autobot colony from the Decepticons. The Decepticon [[Demolishor#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Demolishor]] attacked and killed all but Sideswipe, laying waste to the colony. Sideswipe vowed revenge, and upon arriving on Earth, chased after his nemesis without care for any innocent in the crossfire. Ironhide arrived and tried to stop Sideswipe, but it was only when Ironhide called Sideswipe "no better than the enemy" did Sideswipe stand down, and Demolishor escaped.

Sideswipe appears in ''Transformers: Nefarious'' #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film.

[[Image:Zoopraxiscope 16485d.gif|thumb|200px|right|Black-and-white animation of a colored zoopraxiscope (without distortion, hence the elongated form)]]

The '''zoöpraxiscope''' (initially named ''zoographiscope'' and ''zoogyroscope'') is an early device for displaying moving images and is considered an important predecessor of the [[movie projector]]. It was conceived by [[photography|photographic]] pioneer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in 1879 (and built for him by January 1880 to project his famous [[chronophotography|chronophotographic]] pictures in motion and thus prove that these were authentic). Muybridge used the projector in his public lectures from 1880 to 1895. The projector used 16" glass disks onto which Muybridge had an unidentified artist paint the sequences as silhouettes. This technique eliminated the backgrounds and enabled the creation of fanciful combinations and additional imaginary elements. Only one disk used photographic images, of a horse skeleton posed in different positions.  A later series of 12" discs, made in 1892–1894, used outlines drawn by Erwin F. Faber that were printed onto the discs photographically, then colored by hand. These colored discs were probably never used in Muybridge's lectures. All images of the known 71 disks, including those of the photographic disk, were rendered in elongated form to compensate the distortion of the projection. The projector was related to other projecting [[phenakistiscope]]s and used some slotted metal shutter discs that were interchangeable for different picture disks or different effects on the screen. The machine was hand-cranked.&lt;ref name="compleat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/mZoo.htm|title=COMPLEAT EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE - ZOOPRAXISCOPE STORY|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kingston"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200246/museum_collections_and_exhibitions/539/eadweard_muybridge/3|title=Eadweard Muybridge|last=Hammond|first=Michael|website=www.kingston.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The device appears to have been one of the primary inspirations for [[Thomas Edison]] and [[William Kennedy Dickson]]'s [[Kinetoscope]], the first commercial film exhibition system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/kinetoscope/ |title=See Thomas Edison’s Steampunk Version of Oculus Rift |last=Bierend |first=Doug |publisher=Condé Nast |date=29 May 2014 |website=Wired |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from all of the known seventy-one surviving zoopraxiscope discs have been reproduced in the book ''Eadweard Muybridge: The Kingston Museum Bequest'' (The Projection Box, 2004).

}}

As stipulated in Muybridge's will the original machine and disks in his possession were left to [[Kingston upon Thames]], where they are still kept in the [[Kingston Museum]] Muybridge Bequest Collection (except for four discs that are in other collections, including those of the [[Cinémathèque française]] and the [[National Technical Museum (Prague)|National Technical Museum]] in Prague).&lt;ref name=compleat/&gt;&lt;ref name=kingston/&gt;

Muybridge also produced a series of 50 different paper 'Zoopraxiscope discs' (basically [[phenakistiscope]]s), again with pictures drawn by Erwin F. Faber. The discs were intended for sale at the 1893 World's Fair at Chicago, but seem to have sold very poorly and are quite rare. The discs were printed in black-and-white, with twelve different discs also produced as [[chromolithography|chromolithographed]] versions. Of the coloured versions only four different ones are known to still exist with a total of five or six extant copies.&lt;ref name="muyblog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muy%20blog3.htm#part15|title=COMPLEAT EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE - MUY BLOG 2009|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
