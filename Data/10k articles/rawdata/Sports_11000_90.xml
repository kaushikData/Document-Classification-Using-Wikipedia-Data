It started as Racing Club de Masuku. As a result of management changes, the club moved to Bongoville and was renamed AC Bongoville. In its first season 2008–2009 in the Gabon Championnat National D1, it finished 9th in the league. Later on, the club slipped to Division 2. But after winning the championship of Gabon Championnat National D2 in 2011, the club moved back to Division 1 of the Gabonese league starting season 2011–2012.

Beninese player Sylvain Azougoui, the long-time goalkeeper of the club, died on 20 April 2014 during a game between AC Bongoville and Centre Mberi Sportif held in Bongoville when Sanogo, an attacker from the rival Centre Mberi Sportif accidentally kicked him in the head during a division 1 league game between the two teams. Azougoui died on his way to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27101201|title=Player dies in Gabon after kick to the head|date=21 April 2014|accessdate=2014-04-21|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allan Park''' was a [[Association football|football]] ground located in [[Cove, Aberdeen|Cove]], a suburb of [[Aberdeen]], Scotland. It was the home to [[Highland Football League]] club [[Cove Rangers F.C.|Cove Rangers]]. The ground had a capacity of 2300 spectators, with 200 on seats or benches. Its largest attendance was 2,100, in the league playoff 2008–09 vs [[Deveronvale F.C.|Deveronvale]] which they won 3-1 to lift the league title for the third year running.

Allan Park was named after a local farmer, who sold the club the land on which they built the ground in 1948.&lt;ref name = "deal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1849756|title=Cove Rangers and Dons strike  deal |work=Press and Journal |publisher=Aberdeen Journals|first=Ryan|last=Crighton|date=30 July 2010|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Cove Rangers were planning to sell Allan Park for housing and share in part of the [[New Aberdeen Stadium]] project with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen FC]].&lt;ref name = "deal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/sport/spl/aberdeen/aberdeen-ignominy-now-par-for-the-course-1.1125210 |first=Frank |last=Gilfeather|title=Aberdeen ignominy now par for the course|work=The Herald|publisher=|date=22 September 2011|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme was thrown into doubt, however, when [[Aberdeen City Council]] rejected an application by the two clubs to build a new ground for Cove Rangers that Aberdeen FC would also have used as a training ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19396170|title=New Aberdeen FC stadium sites 'offered by landowners'|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19342785|title=New Aberdeen FC park 'killed off', says Stewart Milne|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2015 Cove Rangers said goodbye to Allan Park as they played their final game before moving to a new stadium being constructed just outside the [[Cove Bay|Cove]] area in Aberdeen. Allan Park had been bought by housing developers for a figure believed to be around the £3m mark. The sale also included a social club, also owned by the football club, which closed its doors the following day.

They are [[anabolic]] and increase [[protein]] within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, especially in [[skeletal muscle]]s, and also have varying degrees of [[androgenic]] and [[virilization|virilizing]] effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of [[masculinity|masculine]] [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s such as the growth of [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]]. The word ''anabolic'', referring to [[anabolism]], comes from the Greek ἀναβολή ''anabole'', "that which is thrown up, mound". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of [[sex hormone agonist]]s, the others being [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s like [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]] and [[progestogen]]s like [[progesterone (medication)|progesterone]].

AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]] and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and {{abbrlink|AIDS|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}}. The [[American College of Sports Medicine]] acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in [[body weight]], often as lean mass increases and that the gains in [[muscular strength]] achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Powers |title=Performance-Enhancing Drugs |editor-first1=Joel |editor-last1=Houglum |editor-first2=Gary L. |editor-last2=Harrelson | name-list-format = vanc |work=Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers |publisher=SLACK Incorporated |date=2011 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1-55642-901-9 |p=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbkoeZuwqjwC&amp;pg=PA345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Medical===
[[File:Anabolicsteroids41.jpg|thumb|Various AAS and related compounds.]]

Since the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses.

====Anabolic====
* [[Bone marrow]] stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for [[hypoplastic]] [[anemia]]s due to [[leukemia]], [[kidney failure]] or [[aplastic anemia]].&lt;ref name=Basaria&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Basaria S, Wahlstrom JT, Dobs AS |title=Clinical review 138: Anabolic-androgenic steroid therapy in the treatment of chronic diseases |journal=J.

* [[Human development (biology)|Growth]] stimulation: AAS can be used by [[pediatric endocrinology|pediatric endocrinologists]] to treat children with [[growth failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ranke MB, Bierich JR |title=Treatment of growth hormone deficiency |journal=Clinics in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=495–510 |year=1986 |pmid=2429792 |doi=10.1016/S0300-595X(86)80008-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the availability of synthetic [[growth hormone treatment|growth hormone]], which has fewer side effects, makes this a secondary treatment.
* Stimulation of [[appetite]] and preservation and increase of [[muscle]] mass: AAS have been given to people with [[cachexia|chronic wasting conditions]] such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grunfeld C, Kotler DP, Dobs A, Glesby M, Bhasin S |title=Oxandrolone in the treatment of HIV-associated weight loss in men: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study |journal=J.

AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. These sports include [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[shot put]] and other [[track and field]], [[cycling]], [[baseball]], [[wrestling]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[football]], and [[cricket]]. Such use is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of most sports. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as high as 2.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hickson RC, Czerwinski SM, Falduto MT, Young AP |title=Glucocorticoid antagonism by exercise and androgenic-anabolic steroids |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=331–40 |year=1990 |pmid=2199753 |doi=10.1249/00005768-199006000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male students used AAS more frequently than female students and, on average, those that participated in sports used steroids more often than those that did not.

===Available forms===
{{See also|List of androgens/anabolic steroids}}

The AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and its many [[testosterone ester|ester]]s (but most typically [[testosterone undecanoate]], [[testosterone enanthate]], [[testosterone cypionate]], and [[testosterone propionate]]),&lt;ref name="Becker2001"&gt;{{cite book | first = Kenneth L. | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVfzRvaucq8C&amp;pg=PA1185 |year=2001 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-1750-2 |pages=1185–1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nandrolone]] [[nandrolone ester|ester]]s (typically [[nandrolone decanoate]] and [[nandrolone phenylpropionate]]), [[stanozolol]], and [[metandienone]] (methandrostenolone).&lt;ref name="Kicman2008"/&gt; Others that have also been available and used commonly but to a lesser extent include [[methyltestosterone]], [[oxandrolone]], [[mesterolone]], and [[oxymetholone]], as well as [[drostanolone propionate]] (dromostanolone propionate), [[metenolone]] (methylandrostenolone) esters (specifically [[metenolone acetate]] and [[metenolone enanthate]]), and [[fluoxymesterone]].&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; [[Androstanolone|Dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), known as androstanolone or stanolone when used medically, and its [[dihydrotestosterone ester|ester]]s are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt; [[Boldenone undecylenate]] and [[trenbolone acetate]] are used in [[veterinary medicine]].&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;

[[Designer steroid]]s are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market.&lt;ref name="pmid25684733"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rahnema CD, Crosnoe LE, Kim ED | title = Designer steroids - over-the-counter supplements and their androgenic component: review of an increasing problem | journal = Andrology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–5 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25684733 | doi = 10.1111/andr.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of notable designer steroids include [[1-testosterone]] (dihydroboldenone), [[methasterone]], [[trenbolone enanthate]], [[desoxymethyltestosterone]], [[tetrahydrogestrinone]], and [[methylstenbolone]].&lt;ref name="pmid25684733" /&gt;

====Routes of administration====
[[File:Depo-testosterone 200 mg ml.jpg|thumb|upright|A vial of injectable testosterone cypionate]]

There are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration is the most convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one-sixth is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17α position, e.g. [[methyltestosterone]] and [[fluoxymesterone]]. This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds before they reach the systemic circulation.

Testosterone can be administered [[Parenteral medication|parenterally]], but it has more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in [[enanthate]], [[undecanoate]], or [[cypionate]] [[ester]] form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone at the site of injection; absorption rate (and thus injection schedule) varies among different esters, but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 12 weeks. A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system.&lt;ref name=Chr/&gt; Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle, not into the vein, to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. In addition, because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil, intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous [[embolism]] (clot) in the bloodstream.

[[Transdermal patch]]es (adhesive patches placed on the skin) may also be used to deliver a steady dose through the skin and into the bloodstream. Testosterone-containing creams and gels that are applied daily to the skin are also available, but absorption is inefficient (roughly 10%, varying between individuals) and these treatments tend to be more expensive. Individuals who are especially physically active and/or bathe often may not be good candidates, since the medication can be washed off and may take up to six hours to be fully absorbed. There is also the risk that an intimate partner or child may come in contact with the application site and inadvertently dose himself or herself; children and women are highly sensitive to testosterone and can suffer unintended masculinization and health effects, even from small doses. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt;

The traditional routes of administration do not have differential effects on the efficacy of the drug. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as [[first-pass effect|first-pass metabolism]]. However, the orally available forms of AAS may cause [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]] in high doses.&lt;ref name=Kicman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kicman AT, Gower DB |title=Anabolic steroids in sport: biochemical, clinical and analytical perspectives |journal=Ann.

Other side-effects can include alterations in the structure of the [[heart]], such as [[left ventricular hypertrophy|enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle]], which impairs its contraction and [[diastolic|relaxation]], and therefore reducing ejected blood volume.&lt;ref name="De1991" /&gt; Possible effects of these alterations in the heart are hypertension, [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, [[congestive heart failure]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], and [[sudden cardiac death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sullivan ML, Martinez CM, Gallagher EJ |title=Atrial fibrillation and anabolic steroids |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=851–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10499702 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(99)00095-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are also seen in non-drug-using [[sportsperson|athletes]], but steroid use may accelerate this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dickerman RD, Schaller F, McConathy WJ |title=Left ventricular wall thickening does occur in elite power athletes with or without anabolic steroid Use |journal=Cardiology |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=145–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9778553 |doi=10.1159/000006834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=George KP, Wolfe LA, Burggraf GW |title=The 'athletic heart syndrome'.

====Growth defects====
AAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Low doses of AAS such as [[oxandrolone]] are used in the treatment of [[idiopathic short stature]], but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height.&lt;ref name="ShortStature2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wit JM, Oostdijk W | title = Novel approaches to short stature therapy | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research.

====Feminization====

{{see also|Feminization (biology)}}

There are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. Development of breast tissue in males, a condition called [[gynecomastia]] (which is usually caused by high levels of circulating [[estradiol]]), may arise because of increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol by the enzyme [[aromatase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marcus R, Korenman SG |title=Estrogens and the human male |journal=Annu Rev Med |volume=27 |pages=357–70 |year=1976 |pmid=779604 |doi=10.1146/annurev.me.27.020176.002041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced [[sexual function]] and temporary [[infertility]] can also occur in males.&lt;ref name="administration282"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumoto AM |title=Effects of chronic testosterone administration in normal men: safety and efficacy of high dosage testosterone and parallel dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and sperm production |journal=J.

This side-effect is temporary; the size of the testicles usually returns to normal within a few weeks of discontinuing AAS use as normal production of sperm resumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alén M, Reinilä M, Vihko R |title=Response of serum hormones to androgen administration in power athletes |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=354–9 |year=1985 |pmid=2991700 |doi=10.1249/00005768-198506000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Masculinization====
{{See also|Virilization}}

Female-specific side effects include [[hirsutism|increases in body hair]], permanent deepening of the voice, [[clitoral hypertrophy|enlarged clitoris]], and temporary decreases in [[menstrual cycle]]s.

====Kidney problems====
Kidney tests revealed that nine of the ten steroid users developed a condition called [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], a type of scarring within the kidneys.

{{See also|Anabolic–androgenic steroids abuse}}

A 2005 review in ''[[CNS Drugs]]'' determined that "significant psychiatric symptoms including aggression and violence, [[mania]], and less frequently [[psychosis]] and suicide have been associated with steroid [[drug abuse|abuse]]. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] on discontinuation of AAS".&lt;ref name="pmid15984895" /&gt; High concentrations of AAS, comparable to those likely sustained by many recreational AAS users, produce [[apoptotic]] effects on [[neuron]]s,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} raising the specter of possibly irreversible neurotoxicity. Recreational AAS use appears to be associated with a range of potentially prolonged psychiatric effects, including dependence syndromes, [[mood disorder]]s, and progression to other forms of substance abuse, but the prevalence and severity of these various effects remains poorly understood.&lt;ref name=khp&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-Term Psychiatric and Medical Consequences of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Abuse: A Looming Public Health Concern? |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=98 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–12 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |pmc=2646607 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from ''therapeutic'' use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses.&lt;ref name="pmid12230967"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brower KJ |title=Anabolic steroid abuse and dependence |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=377–87 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12230967 |doi=10.1007/s11920-002-0086-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mood disturbances (e.g. depression, [hypo-]mania, psychotic features) are likely to be dose- and drug-dependent, but AAS dependence or withdrawal effects seem to occur only in a small number of AAS users.&lt;ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/&gt;

Large-scale long-term studies of psychiatric effects on AAS users are not currently available.&lt;ref name=khp/&gt; In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use.&lt;ref name=Fudala&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fudala PJ, Weinrieb RM, Calarco JS, Kampman KM, Boardman C |title=An evaluation of anabolic-androgenic steroid abusers over a period of 1 year: seven case studies |journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=121–30 |year=2003 |pmid=12938869 |doi=10.3109/10401230309085677}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagonis TA, Angelopoulos NV, Koukoulis GN, Hadjichristodoulou CS |title=Psychiatric side effects induced by supraphysiological doses of combinations of anabolic steroids correlate to the severity of abuse |journal=Eur.

====Diagnostic Statistical Manual assertion====
[[DSM-IV]] lists [[Personality disorder#Diagnosis|General diagnostic criteria]] for a personality disorder guideline that "The pattern must not be better accounted for as a manifestation of another mental disorder, or to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g. drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g. head trauma).". As a result, AAS users may get misdiagnosed by a psychiatrist not told about their habit.&lt;ref name="Rashid et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/apt.bp.105.000935 |title=Anabolic androgenic steroids: What the psychiatrist needs to know |year=2007 |vauthors=Rashid H, Ormerod S, Day E |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=203–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality profiles====
Cooper, Noakes, Dunne, Lambert, and Rochford identified that AAS-using individuals are more likely to score higher on [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]] (4.7 times), [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] (3.8 times), [[Paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]] (3.4 times), [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] (3.1 times), [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] (2.9 times), [[Passive-aggressive personality disorder|passive-aggressive]] (2.4 times), and [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] (1.6 times) personality profiles than non-users.&lt;ref name="pmid8889121"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper CJ, Noakes TD, Dunne T, Lambert MI, Rochford K |title=A high prevalence of abnormal personality traits in chronic users of anabolic-androgenic steroids |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=246–50 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8889121 |pmc=1332342 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.30.3.246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have suggested that antisocial personality disorder is slightly more likely among AAS users than among non-users (Pope &amp; Katz, 1994).&lt;ref name="Rashid et al 2007"/&gt; [[Bipolar disorder|Bipolar]] dysfunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vitalquests.org/publication2steroiduse.html |title=Dr. Ritchi Morris |publisher=Vitalquests.org |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203081738/http://www.vitalquests.org/publication2steroiduse.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[substance dependency]], and [[conduct disorder]] have also been associated with AAS use.&lt;ref name="pmid19922565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Brower KJ, Wood RI, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Anabolic-androgenic steroid dependence: an emerging disorder |journal=Addiction |volume=104 |issue=12 |pages=1966–78 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19922565 |pmc=2780436 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02734.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood and anxiety====
Affective disorders have long been recognised as a complication of AAS use.

A 2005 review determined that some, but not all, randomized controlled studies have found that AAS use correlates with [[hypomania]] and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thiblin I, Petersson A |title=Pharmacoepidemiology of anabolic androgenic steroids: a review |journal=Fundam Clin Pharmacol |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=27–44 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15660958 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2004.00298.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study on a nationally representative sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts.

A 1996 [[randomized controlled trial]], which involved 43 men, did not find an increase in the occurrence of angry behavior during 10 weeks of administration of [[testosterone enanthate]] at 600&amp;nbsp;mg/week, but this study screened out subjects that had previously abused steroids or had any psychiatric antecedents.&lt;ref name="Bhasin1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhasin S, Storer TW, Berman N, Callegari C, Clevenger B, Phillips J, Bunnell TJ, Tricker R, Shirazi A, Casaburi R |title=The effects of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone on muscle size and strength in normal men |journal=N.

As their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: ''anabolic'', meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and ''androgenic'' (or ''virilizing''), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics.

Some examples of the anabolic effects of these hormones are increased [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] from [[amino acid]]s, increased appetite, increased bone remodeling and growth, and stimulation of [[bone marrow]], which increases the production of [[red blood cell]]s. Through a number of [[Anabolic steroid#Mechanism of action|mechanisms]] AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of [[skeletal muscles]], leading to increased strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schroeder ET, Vallejo AF, Zheng L, Stewart Y, Flores C, Nakao S, Martinez C, Sattler FR |title=Six-week improvements in muscle mass and strength during androgen therapy in older men |journal=J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=1586–92 |year=2005 |pmid=16424293 |doi=10.1093/gerona/60.12.1586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grunfeld C, Kotler DP, Dobs A, Glesby M, Bhasin S |title=Oxandrolone in the treatment of HIV-associated weight loss in men: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study |journal=J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=304–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16540931 |doi=10.1097/01.qai.0000197546.56131.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giorgi A, Weatherby RP, Murphy PW |title=Muscular strength, body composition and health responses to the use of testosterone enanthate: a double blind study |journal=Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine Australia |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=341–55 |year=1999 |pmid=10710012 |doi=10.1016/S1440-2440(99)80007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. Processes affected include pubertal growth, [[sebaceous gland]] oil production, and sexuality (especially in fetal development). Some examples of virilizing effects are [[clitoral hypertrophy|growth of the clitoris]] in females and the [[penis]] in male children (the adult penis size does not change due to steroids{{medcn|date=March 2013}} ), increased [[vocal cord]] size, increased [[libido]], suppression of [[endogenous|natural]] [[sex hormone]]s, and impaired [[spermatogenesis|production of sperm]].&lt;ref name="DoirpMissing"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn CM |title=Anabolic steroids |journal=Recent Prog.

Men may develop an enlargement of breast tissue, known as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and a reduced sperm count.&lt;ref name=casapalmera&gt;{{cite web |title=How Anabolic Steroids Alter Both Men And Women |url=http://casapalmera.com/types-symptoms-and-effects-of-anabolic-steroid-use/ |work=casapalmera.com|accessdate=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating [[hypogonadism]] in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects.&lt;ref name="Chr"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Katzung | editor-first = Bertram G. |last=Chrousos |first=George P. |chapter=The Gonadal Hormones &amp; Inhibitors |title=Basic &amp; Clinical Pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical McGraw-Hill distributor |location=New York London |year=2012 |isbn=0071764011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral [[prostate]] (VP) and [[levator ani]] muscle (LA) of male [[Laboratory rat|rats]]. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. Two or more batches of rats are [[castrated]] and given no treatment and respectively some AAS of interest. The ''LA/VP ratio'' for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LA&lt;sub&gt;c,t&lt;/sub&gt;–LA&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)/(VP&lt;sub&gt;c,t&lt;/sub&gt;–VP&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above).&lt;ref name=pmid9593936/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13064212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershberger LG, Shipley EG, Meyer RK | title = Myotrophic activity of 19-nortestosterone and other steroids determined by modified levator ani muscle method | journal = Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

====Body composition and strength improvements====
Body weight in men may increase by 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;kg as a result of short-term (&lt;10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. Animal studies also found that fat mass was reduced, but most studies in humans failed to elucidate significant fat mass decrements. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. Both [[muscle hypertrophy]] and the formation of new [[muscle fibers]] have been observed. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/&gt;

The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the [[vastus lateralis]] and the [[trapezius muscle]] as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. After drug withdrawal, the effects fade away slowly, but may persist for more than 6–12 weeks after cessation of AAS use.&lt;ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/&gt;

Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the [[bench press]].&lt;ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/&gt; For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes.&lt;ref name="pmid61389"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hervey GR, Hutchinson I, Knibbs AV, Burkinshaw L, Jones PR, Norgan NG, Levell MJ |title="Anabolic" effects of methandienone in men undergoing athletic training |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=2 |issue=7988 |pages=699–702 |date=October 1976 |pmid=61389 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(76)90001-5 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(76)90001-5/abstract}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7018798"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hervey GR, Knibbs AV, Burkinshaw L, Morgan DB, Jones PR, Chettle DR, Vartsky D |title=Effects of methandienone on the performance and body composition of men undergoing athletic training |journal=Clin.

===Dissociation of effects===
Endogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008"/&gt; On the basis of animal [[bioassay]]s, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Dissociation between the ratios of these two types of effects is observed in rat bioassays with various AAS relative to the ratio observed with testosterone.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Explanations for the dissociation include differences in [[intracellular]] [[metabolism]], [[functional selectivity]] (recruitment of [[coactivator (genetics)|coactivator]]s), and [[Nuclear receptor#Non-genomic|non-genomic]] mechanisms (i.e., signaling through non-AR [[membrane androgen receptor]]s, or mARs).&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Support for the latter two explanations is limited and more hypothetical, but there is a good deal of support for the intracellular metabolism explanation.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;

The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; It is referred to as the [[myotrophic–androgenic index]].&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In this model, anabolic (myotrophic) activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]]/[[levator ani]] muscle and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat [[prostate gland|ventral prostate]] (or, alternatively, the rat [[seminal vesicles]]) in response to exposure to the AAS, and the measurements are then compared and used to form a ratio.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;

====Intracellular metabolism====
Testosterone is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in various tissues by [[5α-reductase]] into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by [[aromatase]] into [[estradiol]], which is an [[estrogen]] and lacks significant AR affinity.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In addition, DHT is metabolized by [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD) and [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3β-HSD) into [[3α-androstanediol]] and [[3β-androstanediol]], respectively, which are [[metabolite]]s with little or no AR affinity.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; 5α-Reductase is widely distributed throughout the body, and is concentrated to various extents in skin (particularly the scalp, beard-area of the face, pubic area, and genital area (penis and scrotum)), prostate, seminal vesicles, liver, and the brain.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In contrast, expression of 5α-reductase in [[skeletal muscle]] is undetectable.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Aromatase is highly expressed in [[adipose tissue]] and the brain, and is also expressed significantly in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; 3α-HSD is also highly expressed in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;

Natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS are analogues and are very similar structurally.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; For this reason, they have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized by the same [[steroidogenic enzyme|steroid-metabolizing]] [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; According to the intracellular metabolism explanation, the androgenic-to-anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is related to its capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction with the AR activity of any resulting products.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; For instance, whereas the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion via 5α-reductase into DHT in tissues where 5α-reductase is expressed, an AAS that is not metabolized by 5α-reductase or is already 5α-reduced, such as DHT itself or a derivative (like [[mesterolone]] or [[drostanolone]]), would not undergo such potentiation in said tissues.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Moreover, nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase, but unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, the 5α-reduced metabolite of nandrolone has much lower affinity for the AR than does nandrolone itself, and this results in reduced AR activation in 5α-reductase-expressing tissues.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; As so-called "androgenic" tissues such as skin/hair follicles and male reproductive tissues are very high in 5α-reductase expression, while skeletal muscle is virtually devoid of 5α-reductase, this may primarily explain the high myotrophic–androgenic ratio and dissociation seen with nandrolone, as well as with various other AAS.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;

Aside from 5α-reductase, aromatase may inactivate testosterone signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, in addition to being free of the potential side effect of [[gynecomastia]], might be expected to have a higher myotrophic–androgenic ratio in comparison.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic–androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks).&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In accordance, DHT, [[mestanolone]] (17α-methyl-DHT), and [[mesterolone]] (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like [[metenolone]], [[oxandrolone]], [[oxymetholone]], [[drostanolone]], and [[stanozolol]] are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;

====Antigonadotropic effects====
Changes in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt; AR agonists are [[antigonadotropic]] – that is, they dose-dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt; By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt; In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent [[progestogen]]s, and activation of the [[progesterone receptor]] (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt; The combination of sufficient AR and PR activation can suppress circulating testosterone levels into the [[castration|castrate]] range in men (i.e., complete suppression of gonadal testosterone production and circulating testosterone levels decreased by about 95%).&lt;ref name="pmid20933120" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9920070"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu FC, Balasubramanian R, Mulders TM, Coelingh-Bennink HJ | title = Oral progestogen combined with testosterone as a potential male contraceptive: additive effects between desogestrel and testosterone enanthate in suppression of spermatogenesis, pituitary-testicular axis, and lipid metabolism | journal = J.

====5α-Reductase and androgenicity====
Testosterone can be robustly converted by [[5α-reductase]] into DHT in so-called androgenic tissues such as [[skin]], [[scalp]], [[prostate]], and [[seminal vesicles]], but not in [[muscle]] or [[bone]], where 5α-reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; As DHT is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone, the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In contrast to testosterone, DHT and other 4,5α-dihydrogenated AAS are already 5α-reduced, and for this reason, cannot be potentiated in androgenic tissues.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; 19-Nortestosterone derivatives like [[nandrolone]] can be [[metabolism|metabolized]] by 5α-reductase similarly to testosterone, but 5α-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., [[5α-dihydronandrolone]]) tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists, resulting in reduced androgenic activity in tissues that express 5α-reductase.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In addition, some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including [[trestolone]] (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)), [[11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone]] (11β-MNT), and [[dimethandrolone]] (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone), cannot be 5α-reduced.&lt;ref name="pmid20599615"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Attardi BJ, Hild SA, Koduri S, Pham T, Pessaint L, Engbring J, Till B, Gropp D, Semon A, Reel JR | title = The potent synthetic androgens, dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone, do not require 5α-reduction to exert their maximal androgenic effects | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 212–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20599615 | pmc = 2949447 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2010.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt; 17α-Alkylated DHT derivatives cannot be potentiated via 5α-reductase however, as they are already 4,5α-reduced.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;

====Aromatase and estrogenicity====

Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including nandrolone, [[trenbolone]], [[ethylestrenol]] (ethylnandrol), [[metribolone]] (R-1881), trestolone, 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the [[progesterone receptor]] (AR) and hence are [[progestogen]]s in addition to AAS.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16497801"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Attardi BJ, Hild SA, Reel JR | title = Dimethandrolone undecanoate: a new potent orally active androgen with progestational activity | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 3016–26 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16497801 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-1524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the case of estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity.&lt;ref name="pmid16497801" /&gt; This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as [[wikt:antispermatogenic|antispermatogenic agent]]s and [[male contraceptive]]s (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing [[azoospermia]] and reversible [[male infertility]]).&lt;ref name="pmid16497801" /&gt;

====Oral activity and hepatotoxicity====
Non-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; A notable exception to this are AAS that are androgen [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]]s or [[androgen prohormone|prohormone]]s, including [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[androstenediol]], [[androstenedione]], [[boldione]] (androstadienedione), [[bolandiol]] (norandrostenediol), [[bolandione]] (norandrostenedione), [[dienedione]], [[mentabolan]] (MENT dione, trestione), and [[methoxydienone]] (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS).&lt;ref name="WarrenConstantini2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Warren, Michelle P. |author2=Constantini, Naama W. |title=Sports Endocrinology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNJ9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA458|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-016-2|pages=458–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GregoryTravis2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haff, G.

====Neurosteroid activity====
DHT, via its metabolite [[3α-androstanediol]] (produced by [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD)), is a [[neurosteroid]] that acts via [[positive allosteric modulation]] of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]].&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Testosterone, via conversion into DHT, also produces 3α-androstanediol as a metabolite and hence has similar activity.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, [[stanozolol]], and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their [[central nervous system]] effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8294123"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7603620"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8858992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masonis AE, McCarthy MP |title=Effects of the androgenic/anabolic steroid stanozolol on GABAA receptor function: GABA-stimulated &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; influx and [&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S] TBPS binding |journal=J.

===Detection in body fluids===
The most commonly employed human physiological specimen for detecting AAS usage is urine, although both blood and hair have been investigated for this purpose. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary urinary metabolites may be detectable for up to 30 days after the last use, depending on the specific agent, dose and route of administration. A number of the drugs have common metabolic pathways, and their excretion profiles may overlap those of the endogenous steroids, making interpretation of testing results a very significant challenge to the analytical chemist. Methods for detection of the substances or their excretion products in urine specimens usually involve [[gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name="pmid18570179"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mareck U, Geyer H, Opfermann G, Thevis M, Schänzer W |title=Factors influencing the steroid profile in doping control analysis |journal=J Mass Spectrom |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=877–91 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18570179 |doi=10.1002/jms.1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19429460"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fragkaki AG, Angelis YS, Tsantili-Kakoulidou A, Koupparis M, Georgakopoulos C |title=Schemes of metabolic patterns of anabolic androgenic steroids for the estimation of metabolites of designer steroids in human urine |journal=J.

==History==

===Discovery of androgens===
The use of [[gonadal]] [[steroid]]s pre-dates their identification and isolation. Medical use of [[testicle]] extract began in the late 19th century while its effects on strength were still being studied.&lt;ref name="DoirpMissing" /&gt; The isolation of gonadal steroids can be traced back to 1931, when [[Adolf Butenandt]], a chemist in [[Marburg]], purified 15 milligrams of the male hormone [[androstenone]] from tens of thousands of litres of urine. This steroid was subsequently [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in 1934 by [[Leopold Ružička]], a chemist in [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name = "PMID7817189"/&gt;

In the 1930s, it was already known that the [[testes]] contain a more powerful androgen than [[androstenone]], and three groups of scientists, funded by competing [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, raced to isolate it.&lt;ref name = "PMID7817189"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoberman JM, Yesalis CE |title=The history of synthetic testosterone |journal=Scientific American |volume=272 |issue=2 |pages=76–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7817189 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0295-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "PMID11176375"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman ER, Bloom DA, McGuire EJ |title=A brief history of testosterone |journal=Journal of Urology |volume=165 |issue=2 |pages=371–373 |year=2001 |pmid=11176375 |doi=10.1097/00005392-200102000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hormone was first identified by Karoly Gyula David, E.

===Development of synthetic AAS===
The development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in [[Eastern Bloc]] countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and other [[amateur sports|amateur]] [[Olympic weightlifting|weight lifters]]. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects.&lt;ref name="pedsreview"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calfee R, Fadale P |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=e577–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler's work resulted in the production of [[methandrostenolone]], which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's [[off-label use]]rs were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Peters [http://www.slate.com/id/2113752/ The Man Behind the Juice], ''Slate'' Friday, Feb. 18, 2005. Retrieved 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.&lt;ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/&gt;

Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: [[Alkylation]] at C17α position with [[methyl]] or [[ethyl group]] created orally active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; [[esterification]] of testosterone and [[nortestosterone]] at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both oral and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios.&lt;ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
Androgens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as ''androgenic'' (i.e., virilizing) and ''anabolic'' (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic).&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; The term ''anabolic steroid'' can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects.&lt;ref name="Kochakian1946"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochakian|first1=Charles D.|title=The Protein Anabolic Effects of Steroid Hormones|volume=4|year=1946|pages=255–310|issn=0083-6729|doi=10.1016/S0083-6729(08)61085-7|quote=In recent years several laboratories (Kochakian, Albright, Wilkins) have entertained the hope of finding a protein anabolic steroid without any, or with only minor, sexual effects. These studies have received special impetus and encouragement from the observation of Kochakian that certain steroids have greater renotrophic (anabolic?) than androgenic effects.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be separable.&lt;ref name="Kochakian1946" /&gt;

In 1953, a testosterone-derived steroid known as [[norethandrolone]] (17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone) was synthesized at [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]] and was studied as a [[progestin]], but was not marketed.&lt;ref name="Kochakian2012" /&gt; Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency.&lt;ref name="Kochakian2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sneader2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Sneader|title=Drug Discovery: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&amp;pg=PA206|date=23 June 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89979-2|pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first steroid with a marked and favorable separation of anabolic and androgenic effect to be discovered, and has accordingly been described as the "first anabolic steroid".&lt;ref name="Wermuth2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camille Georges Wermuth|title=The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qmt1_DQkCpEC&amp;pg=PA34|date=2 May 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-056877-5|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Edward Wright|title=Altered States: The Use and Abuse of Anabolic Steroids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnbZAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Masters Press|isbn=978-1-57028-013-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norethandrolone was introduced for medical use in 1956, and was quickly followed by numerous similar steroids, for instance [[nandrolone phenylpropionate]] in 1959 and [[stanozolol]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Wermuth2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Office1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

Although ''anabolic steroid'' was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone itself.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kochakian2012" /&gt; While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic relative to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain androgenicity.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kochakian2012" /&gt; (Likewise, all "androgens" are inherently anabolic.)&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kochakian2012" /&gt; Indeed, it is probably fundamentally impossible to completely dissociate anabolic and androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR.&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; As such, the distinction between the terms ''anabolic steroid'' and ''androgen'' is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term ''anabolic–androgenic steroid'' (''AAS'').&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kochakian2012" /&gt;

===Legal status===
[[File:Compounds showing anabolic and androgenic effects.png|thumb|right|Various compounds with anabolic and androgenic effects, their relation with AAS]]

The legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many&lt;!--most--&gt; countries they are not illegal. In the U.S., AAS are currently listed as Schedule III [[controlled substances]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], which makes simple possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to one year in prison for the first offense. Unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute AAS as a first offense is punished by up to ten years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/844.htm |title=Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act |publisher=US Department of Justice |accessdate=2009-09-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724051512/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/844.htm |archivedate=24 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] and are [[Schedule IV (Canada)|Schedule IV]] substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling AAS in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw |short title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act |abbr=S.C. |year=1996 |chapter=19 |section=4 |subsection=7 |link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-2.html#h-4 |linkloc=Department of Justice |wikilink=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; Import and export also carry similar penalties.

In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. A study conducted in 1993 by the Canadian Centre for Drug-Free Sport found that nearly 83,000 Canadians between the ages of 11 and 18 use steroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deacon |first=James |title=Biceps in a bottle |journal=Maclean's |page=52 |date=2 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAS are also illegal without prescription in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steroids |publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology |year=2006 |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/steroids.html |accessdate=2007-05-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405033442/http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/steroids.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Brazil{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and Portugal{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, and are listed as Class&amp;nbsp;C [[Controlled Drug]]s in the United Kingdom. AAS are readily available without a prescription in some countries such as Mexico and Thailand.

====United States====
[[File:SteroidpillsDEA.jpg|thumb|right |200px| Steroid pills intercepted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration during the Operation Raw Deal bust in September 2007.]]
The history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the [[U.S. Congress]] considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] victory at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]]. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the [[Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990]].&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;{{USBill|101|HR|4658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after AAS were scheduled in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products in the U.S., including Ciba, Searle, Syntex, and others. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, [[progestin]]s, and [[corticosteroid]]s) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added [[prohormone]]s to the list of [[controlled substance]]s, with effect from January 20, 2005.&lt;ref name="usdoj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/cngrtest/ct031604.html |title=News from DEA, Congressional Testimony, 03/16/04 |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206195542/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/cngrtest/ct031604.html |archivedate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, AAS are classified as class C drugs for their illegal abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as [[benzodiazepines]]. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS.

Part 1 drugs are subject to full import and export controls with possession being an offence without an appropriate prescription. There is no restriction on the possession when it is part of a medicinal product. Part 2 drugs require a Home Office licence for importation and export unless the substance is in the form of a medicinal product and is for self-administration by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patient.info Controlled Drugs |url=http://patient.info/doctor/controlled-drugs |publisher=Egton Medical Information Systems Limited |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law enforcement====
United States federal law enforcement officials have expressed concern about AAS use by police officers. "It's a big problem, and from the number of cases, it's something we shouldn't ignore. It's not that we set out to target cops, but when we're in the middle of an active investigation into steroids, there have been quite a few cases that have led back to police officers," says Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.annarbor.com/health/steroid-abuse-among-law-enforcement-a-problem-nationwide/ |title=Steroid abuse among law enforcement a problem nationwide |first=Juliana |last=Keeping |work=The Ann Arbor News |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=1512&amp;issue_id=62008 |title=Anabolic Steroid Use and Abuse by Police Officers: Policy &amp; Prevention |work=The Police Chief |date=June 2008 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom "are using criminals to buy steroids" which he claims to be a top risk factor for [[police corruption]].

In 2006, Finnish authorities announced a record seizure of 11.8 million AAS tablets. A year later, the DEA seized 11.4 million units of AAS in the largest U.S seizure ever.

In the U.S., Canada, and Europe, illegal steroids are sometimes purchased just as any other illegal drug, through dealers who are able to obtain the drugs from a number of sources.

The '''Bezirksliga''' ({{lang-en|County League}}) is commonly a medium set of amateur divisions  set at steps 7, 8 or 9 in the [[German football league system]].

== Structure ==
Depending on the structural organisation within each of the 21 state football associations of the [[German Football Association]], the Bezirksliga either falls under the state association's jurisdiction or one of its subsidiary county football associations that organise their divisions mostly following the borders of the corresponding [[Regierungsbezirk|government districts]]. In the league pyramid, the Bezirksliga always ranks below the superior state association's divisions, typically being the [[Verbandsliga]] and the [[Landesliga]] but ahead of the district associations' [[Fußball-Kreisliga|Kreisliga]].

The Bezirksliga does not exist within all associations, and where existing it is set in varying numbers and form. The former Bezirksoberliga is currently not existing in the league system, as the Hesse state association renamed the division to [[Fußball-Gruppenliga|Gruppenliga]] and as the state associations of Lower Saxony and Bavaria disbanded the league in recent years.

'''Burton-on-Trent Cricket Ground''' (exact name unknown) was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Burton-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1840, when the [[North of England cricket team|North]] played the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in the grounds first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match.  The following year the ground held its second and final first-class match when the North again played the Marlybone Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/367_f.html First-Class matches played on Burton-on-Trent Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match on the County Ground came in 1848 and saw Burton-on-Trent play [[Manchester Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/367_misc.html Other matches played on Burton-on-Trent Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact location of the ground remains unknown, although some sources such as [[Cricinfo]] believe the ground may in fact be the Town Ground.

'''East Coast Railway Stadium''' is a [[cricket]] stadium in [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Odisha]]. It hosts [[Ranji Trophy]], and other matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ranji match at Railway stadium from tomorrow|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/11/30/stories/2010113055280200.htm|accessdate=4 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Construction of the galleries and renovation of the stadium is under process to make it suitable for international cricket matches.

==History==

The authorities have submitted an Rs 54-crore plan to the [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]] to upgrade the stadium, making it capable of holding international cricket matches. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.orissalinks.com/orissagrowth/archives/1294 orissalinks]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the plan, the stadium will have a seating capacity of nearly 42,000. It will have a parking lot as well as other facilities needed to host international matches.

The authorities are even planning to build galleries with grassy slopes for spectators as seen in most cricket grounds of New Zealand. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/railway-cricket-tourney-begins/article5616940.ece thehindu] &lt;/ref&gt;

The present stadium was built across an area of over 22 acres at a cost of Rs 6 crore.
The stadium has four turfs for practice. The drainage system is one of the best in the state.
The stadium hosted its first [[Ranji Trophy]] match in November 2008.

A few Twenty20 matches during the first edition of the [[Odisha Premier League]] were also hosted at this venue. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.eastcoastrail.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&amp;dcd=1349&amp;id=0,4,268 eastcoastrail] &lt;/ref&gt;

A huge manual scoreboard has been put up for the first time for Odisha versus Karnataka Ranji Trophy match.

In 2010, Bhubaneswar Stadium was put to use during the Orissa-Punjab Elite Group B [[Ranji Trophy]] tournament league match was played. General Manager of [[East Coast Railway]] AK Vohra inaugurated the match. Former Australian cricketer and Odisha coach [[Michael Bevan]] was also present. &lt;ref&gt; [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/297/297616.html cricketarchive] &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estadio Monumental''' is a [[soccer]] Stadium in [[Macul]], south-east of the centre of the [[Chile]]an capital [[Santiago]]. It serves as the home ground of [[Colo-Colo]], and on occasions also for other clubs and the national football team. The stadium has a current spectator capacity of 47,347.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.colocolo.cl/2009/06/estadio-monumental/ Estadio Monumental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107011910/http://www.colocolo.cl/2009/06/estadio-monumental/ |date=2012-01-07 }}, Colo-Colo (Official Club Website, reviewed 4 January 2012)''&lt;/ref&gt; The actual playing field is named after [[David Arellano]], the founder of Colo-Colo, therefore, on occasions the whole stadium is referred to as '''Estadio Monumental David Arellano'''.

The stadium was first opened in 1975 with a double-header in front of 25,599 people.  In the first match [[Santiago Morning]] and [[Santiago Wanderers]] drew 1-1 and in the main event Colo-Colo defeated [[Deportes Aviación]] 1-0, [[Carlos Orellana]] being the scorer. However, the stadium proved unsuitable for ongoing use, and therefore only five more matches took place there for the time being.

Completed in its current form in 1989, it was reopened in September of that year with a match between Colo-Colo and [[CA Peñarol]] from Uruguay, which the hosts won 2-1, thanks to goals by [[Marcelo Barticciotto]] and [[Leonel Herrera Silva|Leonel Herrera]]. The official capacity of the stadium then was between 62,500 and 65,000 spectators. The highest ever recorded attendance when 69,305 spectators saw a league match between Colo-Colo and [[Club Universidad de Chile]] in 1992. In the 2016-17 season, [[Colo-Colo]] drew an average home league attendance of 21,509 for the Apertura and 23,229 for the Clausura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/chi-primera-division-2016-2017-clausura/1/|title=Primera División 2016/2017 Clausura - Attendance|author=|date=|website=worldfootball.net|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was in 1991 home to the second [[1991 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]] final, won by Colo-Colo 3-0, making it the sole Chilean club to win the trophy.

Accidents, including a fatality in 1993, instigated various modernisations which led to a reduction of the capacity to the current 47,000 spectators.

The stadium is also rented out to club [[Santiago Morning]] and other Chilean teams that require holding games on the international tournament scale. It has also been used by the [[Chile national football team]] when the [[Estadio Nacional de Chile|Estadio Nacional]], the main football stadium of the country, is unavailable. The American rock band [[Pearl Jam]] played at the stadium on November 16, 2011, as part of their [[Pearl Jam Twenty Tour|20th anniversary tour]].&lt;ref name="CentralSouth"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/news/pearl-jam-announces-2011-south-and-central-american-tour | title=Pearl Jam Announces 2011 South and Central American Tour | date=2011-07-11 | accessdate=2011-07-11 | publisher=pearljam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its principal tenant and owner is the corporate entity ''Blanco y Negro'' that runs Colo-Colo and for which Chilean [[billionaire]] and [[Chilean presidential election, 2009|President]] [[Sebastián Piñera]] is a major shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20060314/pags/20060314121311.html|title=Sebastián Piñera invirtió en Colo Colo en su afán por "modernizar el fútbol chileno"|publisher=cooperativa.cl|language=Spanish|accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International matches==

As well as hosting club teams, Estadio Monumental has held seven games between Chile and other national squads. In 1997, Ivan Zamorano scored five goals for Chile in a 6-0 win over Venezuela during a France 1998 World Cup qualifier. In 2009, Chile drew 2-2 in another qualifier against Venezuela for the South Africa 2010 World Cup, and won 1-0 against Ecuador for a qualifier in the same competition. In 2012, Chile played two qualifiers for the Brazil 2014 World Cup at the Estadio Monumental, winning 4-2 against Peru, and losing 1-3 against Colombia. Two international friendly matches have been held the stadium: a 2-0 win for Chile over Uruguay in 2010, and a 4-0 Chilean victory over Estonia in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=chi/fixturesresults/gender=m/index.html#|title=Member Association - Chile - FIFA.com|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national team has existed since 1996. They have recorded three victories, against [[Belarus]], [[Albania]], and [[Republic of Macedonia]], all of which were at home. They are one of the most penalized teams in Europe, having received more red and yellow cards in the WC 2006 Qualifiers than any other team. 

[[Albert Celades]] is an Andorran, who has played for both [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. The midfielder never made an appearance for the Andorran squad. However, he did make it to the Spanish national team.{{cn|date=July 2012}} 

[[FC Andorra]] is the only Andorran team to play in the Spanish football league system instead of the domestic league.

The '''history of the West Indian cricket team''' begins  in the 1880s when the first combined West Indian team was formed and toured Canada and the United States.{{Ref label|First tour|62}} {{Ref label|Development|63}} In the 1890s, the first representative sides were selected to play visiting [[English cricket team|English]] sides. Administered by the West Indies Cricket Board ("WICB"),{{Ref label|WICB|1}} and known colloquially as '''''The Windies''''', the West Indies [[cricket]] team represents a sporting confederation of [[English language|English-speaking]] [[Caribbean]] countries.

The WICB joined the sport's international ruling body, the [[Imperial Cricket Council]], in 1926,{{Ref label|Test status|2}} and played their first official international match, which in cricket is called a [[Test cricket|Test]], in 1928.{{Ref label|First Test|3}} Although blessed with some great players in their early days as a Test nation, their successes remained sporadic until the 1960s, by which time the side had changed from a white-dominated to a black-dominated side. By the late 1970s, the West Indies had a side recognised as unofficial world champions, a title they retained throughout the 1980s.{{Ref label|World champions|4}} Their team from the 1970s and 1980s is now widely regarded as having been one of the best in test cricket's history, alongside [[Don Bradman]]'s [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]].  During these glory years, the Windies were noted for their four-man [[fast bowling]] attack, backed up by some of the best [[batsman|batsmen]] in the world. The 1980s saw them set a then-record streak of 11 consecutive Test victories in 1984, which was part of a still-standing record of 27 tests without defeat (the other tests being draws), as well as inflicting two 5–0 "blackwashes" against the old enemy of [[English cricket team|England]]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, however, West Indian cricket declined, in part due to the rise in popularity of [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] and [[association football|football]] in West Indian countries, and the team today is struggling to regain its past glory.{{Ref label|Current rankings|5}}

In their early days in the 1930s, the side represented the British colonies of the [[West Indies Federation]] plus [[British Guyana]]. The current side represents the now independent states of [[Antigua and Barbuda]], Barbados, [[Dominica]], Grenada, [[Guyana]], Jamaica, [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], Saint Lucia, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and the [[British overseas territories|British dependencies]] of [[Anguilla]], [[Montserrat]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] along with the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Sint Maarten|St. Maarten]].{{Ref label|WICB|1}} National teams also exist for the various islands, which, as they are all separate countries, very much keep their local identities and support their local favourites. These national teams take part in the West Indian [[first class cricket|first-class]] competition, the [[Stanford 20/20]], the [[Carib Beer Cup]] (earlier known as the ''Busta Cup'', ''Shell Shield''  and various other names).{{Ref label|Domestic competitions|6}} It is also common for other international teams to play the island teams for warm-up games before they take on the combined West Indies team.

The first major international cricket played in the West Indies was between local, often predominantly white, sides and English tourists – the [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] player [[Robert Slade Lucas]] [[RS Lucas' XI cricket team in West Indies in 1894-95|toured]] the West Indies with a team in [[1894-95 West Indian cricket season|1894–95]],{{Ref label|Lucas tour|7}} and two years later [[Arthur Priestley]] took a team to Barbados, Trinidad, and Jamaica, which included, for the first time, a match against a side styled "All West Indies", which the West Indians won.{{Ref label|Priestley tour|8}} [[Lord Hawke]]'s English team, including several English [[Test cricket|Test]] players, toured around the same time, playing Trinidad, Barbados and British Guiana (now Guyana).{{Ref label|Hawke tour|9}} Then in [[1900 English cricket season|1900]] the white Trinidadian [[Aucher Warner]], the brother of future England captain [[Pelham Warner]], led a touring side to England, but none of the matches on this tour were given [[first class cricket|first-class]] status.{{Ref label|Warner tour|10}} Two winters later, in [[1901-02 West Indian cricket season|1901–02]], the [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] [[wicketkeeper]] [[Richard Bennett (English cricketer)|Richard Bennett]]'s XI went to the West Indies, and played three games against teams styled as the "West Indies", which the hosts won 2–1.{{Ref label|Bennett tour|11}} In [[1904-05 West Indian cricket season|1904–05]], [[John Egerton, 4th Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Brackley]]'s XI toured the Caribbean – winning both its games against "West Indies".{{Ref label|Brackley tour|12}}

The tours to England continued in [[1906 English cricket season|1906]] when [[Harold Austin]] led a West Indian side to [[English cricket team|England]].{{Ref label|Austin tour|13}} His side played a number of [[county cricket|county teams]], and drew their game against an "England XI". However, that England XI only included one contemporary Test player – wicketkeeper [[Dick Lilley]] – and he had not been on England's most recent tour, their [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1905-06|1905–6 tour of South Africa]]. The [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], which had taken over responsibility for arranging all official overseas [[English cricket team|England]] tours,{{Ref label|MCC takeover|14}} visited the West Indies in [[1910-11 West Indian cricket season|1910–11]],{{Ref label|First MCC tour|15}} and [[1912-13 West Indian cricket season|1912–13]] but after that there was no international cricket of any note until the West Indian team went to England in [[1923 English cricket season|1923]]. This tour did not include a game against an England team, but there was an end-of-season game against [[Shrimp Leveson Gower|HDG Leveson-Gower's]] XI against a virtual England Test side at the [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] cricket festival, a traditional end-of-season game against a touring side at the English seaside resort of Scarborough, which Leveson-Gower's XI won by only four [[wicket]]s.{{Ref label|1923 tour|16}} [[1925-26 West Indian cricket season|1925–26]] saw another MCC tour of the West Indies.{{Ref label|1925–26 tour|17}}

The MCC was eager to promote cricket throughout the British Empire, and on 31 May 1926 the West Indian Cricket Board, along with their [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and [[Indian cricket team|Indian]] counterparts, was elected to the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC), which previously consisted of the MCC and representatives of [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]].{{Ref label|ICC membership|18}} Election to full membership of the ICC meant the West Indies could play official [[Test cricket|Test matches]],{{Ref label|Test designation|19}} which is the designation given to the most important international games, and the Windies became the fourth team actually to play a recognised Test match on 23 June 1928 when they took on England at [[Lord's]] in London.{{Ref label|First Test|2}} They did not, however, enjoy immediate success – the West Indies lost all three 3-day Tests in that [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1928|1928 tour]] by a long way, failing to score 250 runs in any of their six [[innings]] in that series. They also failed to dismiss England for under 350 runs in a series completely dominated by England.{{Ref label|First series|20}}

==The early Tests (1930s and 1940s)==
[[Image:West Indies cricket team 1930-31.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The West Indies team that toured Australia in 1930–31.{{Ref label|1930–31 picture|21}}]]
The West Indies played 19 Tests in the 1930s in four series against [[English cricket team|England]] and one against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]. The first four of these were played against an England team led by the Honourable [[Freddie Calthorpe]] that toured in 1929–30. However, as [[Harold Gilligan]] was leading another English team to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] at exactly the same time, this was not a full-strength England side. The series ended one-all, with the West Indies first ever Test victory being recorded on 26 February 1930. West Indians [[George Headley]] scored the most runs (703) in the rubber and [[Learie Constantine]] took the most wickets (18).{{Ref label|1929–30 tour|22}}

The Windies toured Australia in [[1930-31 Australian cricket season|1930–31]].{{Ref label|1930–31|23}} They lost the Test series 4–1. The fifth and final Test showed some promise – batting first, the West Indies spent the first three days earning a 250-run lead with five wickets down in their second innings. A bold [[declaration and forfeiture|declaration]] was backed up by their bowlers, as [[Herman Griffith]] took four wickets and West Indies won by 30 runs to their first overseas Test victory. By the time the team left, they had left a good impression of themselves with the Australian public, although at first the team were faced with several cultural differences – for example, their hosts did not at first appreciate that the tourists' Roman Catholic beliefs would mean they would refuse to play golf on Sundays or engage in more ribald behaviour. The West Indian sides of the time were always led by white men, and the touring party to Australia comprised seven whites and eleven "natives", and the West Indian Board of Control wrote to their Australian counterparts saying "that all should reside at the same hotels". Australia at the time had in place its "[[White Australia]]" policy, with the Australian Board having to guarantee to the Government that the non-whites would leave at the end of the tour. When the West Indians arrived in Sydney, the whites were immediately given a different hotel from the blacks. They complained, and thereafter their wishes were met. The tour lost a lot of money, part of which was due to the [[Great Depression]] then affecting Australia.{{Ref label|White Australia|24}} The West Indians won four and lost eight of their 14 first-class fixtures.

[[1933 English cricket season|1933]] saw another tour of England. Their hosts had just come back from defeating Australia in the infamous ''[[Bodyline]]'' series,{{Ref label|Bodyline tour|25}} where England's aggressive bowling at the body with a legside field attracted much criticism. England won the three-Test series of three-day Tests against the Windies 2–0. The second, drawn, Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]], Manchester, provided an intriguing footnote to the Bodyline controversy when [[Manny Martindale]] and [[Learie Constantine]] bowled Bodyline – fast, short-pitched balls aimed at the body – against the Englishmen, the only time they faced it in international cricket.{{Ref label|Bodyline by WI|26}} The tactic did not work, as [[Douglas Jardine]], the [[English national cricket captains|English captain]] who ordered his players to bowl it against the Australians, did not flinch as he scored his only Test century, making 127 out of England's 374.{{Ref label|Bodyline scorecard|27}}
[[Image:Learie Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Learie Constantine{{Ref label|Constantine picture|28}}]]
Another England tour of the West Indies followed in 1934–35.{{Ref label|1934–35 tour|29}} England won the first Test in Barbados on a poor pitch, affected by rain, and in a match where 309 runs were scored, England took a four-wicket victory. Both sides [[declaration and forfeiture|declared]] one of their innings closed to have their bowlers take advantage of the poor pitch. The second Test saw the Windies win by 217 runs, and a drawn third Test saw the series go to a decider at [[Sabina Park]] in Jamaica. A massive 270 not out from [[George Headley]] saw the Windies declare on 535 for 7. Despite a century from [[Les Ames]], England could not avoid going down by an innings and 161 runs – the West Indies had secured their first Test series victory.

The West Indies toured England in 1939.{{Ref label|1939 tour|30}} England won the first Test at [[Lord's]] easily by 8 wickets, then there was a rain-affected draw in Manchester, and finally a high-scoring draw at [[the Oval]] in mid-August. The highlight of the series for the West Indies was George Headley scoring hundreds in both innings in the Lord's Test. With the clouds of World War II seemingly about to envelope Europe, the rest of the tour was cancelled and the Windies returned home. They would play no more Tests until 21 January 1948 saw the start of the first Test the West Indies played since the War,{{Ref label|1947–48 tour|31}} which resulted in a draw against the MCC side from England. The second Test was also drawn, with [[George Carew (cricketer)|George Carew]] and [[Andy Ganteaume]] both making centuries. Ganteaume was then dropped, ending with a Test average of 112 – the highest in Test history.{{Ref label|Ganteaume record|32}} The West Indies won the final two Tests chasing sub-100 totals, and wrapped up the series 2–0, their first away-series victory.

In 1948, West Indies toured newly independent [[Indian cricket team|India]]{{Ref label|Indian independence|33}} for the first time for a five Test tour. The tour was preceded by a non-Test tour of [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]]{{Ref label|1948 Pakistan tour|34}} and followed by a similar short tour of [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Ceylon]].{{Ref label|1948 Ceylon tour|35}} After three high-scoring draws against the Indians, the West Indians wrapped up the fourth by an innings before a thrilling fifth Test, which left the Indians six runs away from victory with two wickets in hand as time ran out, so that the West Indies thus won the rubber 1–0. Carrying on from his hundred in the series against England, [[Everton Weekes]] set a record of scoring hundreds in five successive Test innings.{{Ref label|1948 India tour|36}}

==The post-War period (1950s)==
1950 saw another tour of England, the series saw the emergence for the West Indies of their great spinning duo, [[Sonny Ramadhin]] and [[Alf Valentine]].{{Ref label|Ramadhin and Valentine|37}} England won the first Test by 202 runs, but Valentine and Ramadhin's bowling would win the series for the visitors. The second Test saw the Windies put on 326 thanks to 106 from [[Allan Rae (cricketer)|Allan Rae]] before Valentine (4 for 48) and Ramadhin (5 for 66) skittled England in the first innings. A mammoth 168 from [[Clyde Walcott]] saw England set a theoretical target of 601. Ramadhin's 6 for 86 and Valentine's 3 for 79 dismissed the hosts for 274. The spinning duo took 12 wickets, [[Frank Worrell]] made 261 and [[Everton Weekes]] 129 as the third Test went the Windies way by 10 wickets, the fourth saw 14 wickets from Valentine and Ramadhin and centuries from Rae and Worrell as England were defeated by an innings. The West Indies won the series 3–1.{{Ref label|1950 tour|38}}

In 1951–1952 the Windies visited [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]. The first Test saw a narrow defeat by three wickets, with the two spinners seemingly continuing their form with twelve wickets between them. The second Test was lost by seven wickets, as Australia replied to the Windies 362 and 290 with 567 (which included centuries from [[Lindsay Hassett]] and [[Keith Miller]]) and 137 for 2. 6 wickets from Worrell in the third Test saw Australia dismissed for only 82, and the Windies eventually won by six wickets to pull back to two-one down in the series. The fourth Test saw the series lost in a narrow defeat. Worrell, batting with an injured hand, scored 108 and helped the Windies to 272 before Australia made 216 in reply. 203 from the Windies left Australia a target of 260. 5 wickets from Valentine helped reduced the Aussies to 222 for 9, 38 short with 1 wicket remaining. It didn't happen, as some brilliant running between the wicket for Australia by [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Doug Ring]] saw West Indies lose their composure and the match. The fifth Test saw three batting collapses, as Australia (116 and 377) beat Windies (78 and 213) by 202 runs to finish the rubber four-one winners.{{Ref label|1951–52 Australia tour|39}} The West Indies then went on to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. In the first Test encounter between the two teams, the visitors scored a five wicket victory. In the second and final Test, [[Allan Rae (cricketer)|Allan Rae]] scored 99, [[Jeffrey Stollmeyer]] 152, [[Frank Worrell]] 100 and [[Clyde Walcott]] 115 as the West Indies put on 546 for 6 declared. There wasn't enough time to bowl out the opposition twice though, as the hosts made 160 and were following-on at 17 for 1 when stumps were drawn, leaving the Windies series winners.{{Ref label|1951–52 New Zealand tour|40}}

The [[Indian cricket team|Indians]] toured at the beginning of 1953.{{Ref label|1953 tour|41}} The Windies won the second of the five Tests that were played, with the others all being draws. The highlight of these games we [[Frank Worrell]]'s 237 in the fifth Test, where all the three W's scored hundreds, as the West Indies scored a 1–0 series victory. [[Len Hutton]] led an MCC (England) side to the islands in 1953–1954. [[Sonny Ramadhin]] again starred for the Windies taking 23 wickets (no other West Indian took more than 8), as Walcott's 698 runs was more than 200 higher than second-placed West Indian, Everton Weekes. The five match rubber was drawn two-all.

Australia came and conquered in 1954–1955.{{Ref label|1954–55 tour|42}} After the Aussies made 515 in the first innings of the first Test, the Windies went down by 9 wickets. Then the Windies 382 was put in the shade by 600 for 9 declared by the visitors as the second Test was drawn. A low-scoring third Test saw Australia (257 and 133 for 2) beat the hosts (182 and 207) by 8 wickets. After Australia scored 668 in the fourth Test, the series was lost, although a double century from captain [[Denis Atkinson]] and a world-record stand for the seventh wicket allowed the Windies to reach 510 and draw the Test. The fifth Test saw the West Indies win the toss and bat. Walcott's 155 was the highest score of their 357. The Australians then batted and batted, in total for 245.4 overs in the 6-day Test, as they put on 758 for 8 declared, with five players making centuries. 319 in the West Indies' second innings left them defeated by an innings and 82 runs in the Test, and by three games to nil in the series. Walcott set records by scoring five hundreds, and hundreds in both innings of a match twice. A four-Test tour of [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] followed in February 1956.{{Ref label|1955–56 tour|43}} After two wins by an innings and one by 9 wickets, the Windies were surprised by the Kiwis in the fourth, dismissing them for 145 and 77 as they recorded their first ever Test win in their 45th Test.{{Ref label|First NZ win|44}}

[[John Goddard (cricketer)|John Goddard]] returned to captain the West Indians for a five-Test tour of England in 1957, which was lost three-nil, with England having the better of the two draws.{{Ref label|1957 tour|45}} Then 1957–1958 [[Gerry Alexander]] led a team that defeated [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] three-one.{{Ref label|1957–58 tour|46}} It was in this series in [[Sabina Park|Jamaica]] that [[Garry Sobers]] scored 365 not out to record what was then the highest score in [[Test cricket|Test match]] cricket.{{Ref label|Sobers 365|47}} Alexander went on to lead the West Indies to a three-nil win over five Tests in [[Indian cricket team|India]],{{Ref label|1958–59 India tour|48}} and a 2–1 defeat by [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in a three match rubber in the following winter.{{Ref label|1958–59 Pakistan tour|49}} In 1959–1960 he led as West Indies went down one-nil at home in a five-match series with [[English cricket team|England]].{{Ref label|1959–60 tour|50}}

==A period of mixed fortunes (1960s)==

Despite being a region where whites are a minority, until 1960 West Indies were always captained by white cricketers, though this was more social than racial discrimination. Throughout the 1950s, social theorist [[CLR James]], the increasingly political former cricketer [[Learie Constantine]] and others called for a black captain.{{Ref label|Calls for black captain|51}} Constantine himself had stood in for [[Jackie Grant]] in the field against England on the 1937–38 tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Howat  |first=Gerald|authorlink = Gerald Howat |title=Learie Constantine |year=1976 |publisher=Readers Union Limited |location=[[Newton Abbot]] |pages=109–10 |isbn=}} (Book Club edition. First published London, 1975. Allen &amp; Unwin. {{ISBN|0-049-20043-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Headley]] captained the West Indies in the First Test against England in 1947–48 when the appointed, white captain, [[John Goddard (cricketer)|John Goddard]] was injured.{{Ref label|Early black captains|52}} However, no black was appointed as captain for a whole series until [[Frank Worrell]] was chosen to lead [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1960-61|West Indies in their tour of Australia in 1960–61]].{{Ref label|Worrell captain|53}} In his three years as captain, Worrell moulded a bunch of talented but raw cricketers into probably the best team in the world.{{Ref label|Best team|54}}

In 1960, [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] were the best team in the world but on their way down, while West Indies were on their way up. It so happened that when they met,{{Ref label|1960 Australia|55}} the two teams were of almost equal strength. The result was a series that has been recognised as one of the greatest of all time.{{Ref label|Best series|56}} The first Test in [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Brisbane]] was the first Test ever to end in a [[Tied Test|tie]], which in cricket means the side batting last has been dismissed with scores level. The teams shared the next two Tests. In the fourth, Australia's last pair of [[Ken Mackay]] and [[Lindsay Kline]] played out the last 100 minutes of the match to earn a draw, while Australia won the final Test and the series by two wickets. One of the days of play was attended by a world-record crowd of 90,800.{{Ref label|World record crowd|57}} Such was the impression created by Worrell's team that the newly instituted trophy for the series between the two teams was named the [[Frank Worrell Trophy]].

West Indies beat [[Indian cricket team|India]] 5–0 at home next year,{{Ref label|India 1961–62|59}} and in 1963, they beat a fine [[English cricket team|English team]] by three matches to one.{{Ref label|1963 tour|60}} The [[Lord's]] Test of this series saw a famous finish. With two balls left, England needed six runs to win, and West Indies one wicket. The non-striker was [[Colin Cowdrey]], who had his left arm in a sling, having fractured it earlier in the day. However, [[David Allen (cricketer)|David Allen]] safely played out the last two balls and the match ended in a draw.{{Ref label|Cowdrey broken arm|61}} Worrell retired at the end of the series.{{Ref label|Worrell retires as captain|62}} The selectors picked [[Garry Sobers]] to succeed him.{{Ref label|Sobers captain|63}}

Worrell did, however, serve as the team manager{{Ref label|Worrell team manager|64}} when West Indies hosted Australia in 1964–65.{{Ref label|1964–65 tour|65}} The matches against Australia were bitterly fought, with accusations about [[Charlie Griffith]]'s action (he was accused of [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|throwing]], which is banned in the laws of cricket) and [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] wars.{{Ref label|1964–65 controversy|66}} The West Indies won this series 2–1 to be the unofficial world champions. Sobers was not as good at man-management as Worrell and cracks soon began to appear.{{Ref label|Sobers man-management|67}} Often it was his individual brilliance that made the difference between a win and a loss.{{Ref label|Sobers brilliance|68}} Throughout the 1960s, West Indies bowling was led by [[Wes Hall]], Griffith, [[Lance Gibbs]] and Sobers himself.{{Ref label|1960s attack|69}} Hall and Griffith faded and then retired by the end of the decade,{{Ref label|Hall and Griffith retirement|70}} but WI could find no replacement for them till the mid-1970s.

Sobers was at his best in England in 1966,{{Ref label|1966 tour|71}} scoring 722 runs and taking 20 wickets in the five Tests. Three times he topped 150, and the 163* at Lord's turned a certain defeat into a near victory. West Indies won 3–1. England toured the West Indies in 1967–68{{Ref label|1967–68 tour|72}} for a series that became noted for England's deliberate slow play.{{Ref label|1967–68 slow play|73}} West Indies were forced to [[follow on]] in the first Test but saved it without difficulty. The second Test was played on an underprepared wicket at [[Sabina Park|Kingston]]. England won an important toss and scored 376. The bounce of the wicket having become very uneven, West Indies collapsed to 143 and followed on. On the fourth day in the second innings, a disputed decision led to a crowd riot, and the match had to be stopped for some time.{{Ref label|1967–68 riot|74}} In a curious decision, the West Indian Cricket Board (WICB) agreed to add a 75-minute sixth day to compensate for the lost time.{{Ref label|1967–68 sixth day|75}} Sobers played an outstanding innings of 113 not out, which allowed West Indies to set England a target of 159 in 155 minutes. England just about saved the game, losing eight wickets for 68. In the fourth Test West Indies gained a first innings lead of 122 at [[Queen's Park Oval|Port-of-Spain]], but with the second innings score at 92 for 2, Sobers, frustrated by England's slow over rates and wanting to give himself a chance, albeit a small one, to win, surprisingly declared the innings, a decision for which he was widely criticised at the time.{{Ref label|1967–68 surprise declaration|76}} England were set a target of 215 in 165 minutes and they achieved it with 3 minutes to spare. West Indies made one last effort to win the final Test, but England drew it with only wicket left in their second innings. West Indies lost the series 0–1, the first defeat since 1960–61.

Australia and [[Bill Lawry]] had their revenge in 1968–69, when West Indies lost the away series 1–3.{{Ref label|1968–69 Australia tour|77}} [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] managed to draw the series that followed,{{Ref label|1968–69 New Zealand tour|78}} and then in 1969 West Indies were defeated 0–2 in England.{{Ref label|1969 tour|79}}

==World dominance (1970s)==
West Indies' woes overflowed into the 1970s. At home in 1970–71, they lost to [[Indian cricket team|India]] for the first time. In the next year, a five Test series against [[New Zealand cricket team]] ended with no team coming close to winning one. A major find in the New Zealand series was [[Lawrence Rowe]], who started off with a double century and century on his debut. Under [[Rohan Kanhai]]'s captaincy, West Indies showed the first signs of revival. Australia won the closely fought 1972–73 series in the Caribbean by two Tests. With Sobers back – but Kanhai still the captain – West Indies defeated [[English cricket team|England]] 2–0 in 1973. This included a win by an innings and 226 runs at [[Lord's]], their biggest win against England. The return series in West Indies ended 1–1, though the home team was the better side. Rowe continued his run scoring three centuries including a 302 at Kingston. The final Test of this 1973–74 series marked the end of an era in West Indies cricket – it was the last Test of both Garry Sobers and Rohan Kanhai, and marked the emergence of fast bowler [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]].

The new captain [[Clive Lloyd]] had made his first appearance in Test cricket in 1966 and had since become a fixture in the side. His avuncular, bespectacled appearance and a stoop near the shoulders masked the fact that he was a very fine fielder, especially in the covers, and a devastating stroke player. Lloyd's first assignment was the tour of India in 1974–75. West Indies won the first two Tests comfortably. [[Gordon Greenidge]] started his career with 107 and 93 in the first Test. [[Vivian Richards]] failed on his debut, but scored 192* in his second. India fought back to win the next two, but Lloyd hit 242* in the final Test to win the series.

[[File:WestIndiesCricketFlagPre1999.svg|thumb|200px|Flag of the West Indies cricket team prior to 1999]]

West Indies won the inaugural [[1975 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] in England in 1975, defeating [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in the final. Then in 1975–76 they toured Australia, only to lose 1–5 in the six-Test series, and then beat India at home two-one in a four Test series later that same winter. It was in Australia that the quick bowler [[Michael Holding]] made his first appearance. [[Colin Croft]] and [[Joel Garner]] made their debut the next year, and [[Malcolm Marshall]] two years after. In the span of about four years, West Indies brought together a bowling line-up of a quality that had rarely been seen before. The tour of India had seen the debut of [[Vivian Richards]], arguably the finest West Indian batsman ever, and [[Gordon Greenidge]], who joined a strong batting line-up that already included [[Alvin Kallicharran]] and opener [[Roy Fredericks]] in addition to Rowe and Lloyd. These players formed the nucleus of the side that became recognised as world Test match champions until the beginning of the 1990s.

Next came a tour of [[English cricket team|England]] in 1976. In a TV interview before the series, English captain [[Tony Greig]] commented that the West Indies tend to do badly under pressure and that "we'll make them grovel". This comment, especially as it came from a South African-born player, touched a raw nerve of the West Indians. Throughout the series, the English batsmen were subjected to some very hostile bowling. After the first two Tests ended in draws, West Indies won the next three. Of the many heroes for West Indies, Richards stood out with 829 runs in four Tests. He hit 232 at Trent Bridge and 291 at the Oval. Greenidge scored three hundreds, two of which were on the difficult wicket at Old Trafford. Roberts and Holding shared 55 wickets between them, Holding's 8 for 92 and 6 for 57 on the unhelpful wicket at the Oval being a superlative effort.

West Indies won a home series against a tough Pakistan side in 1976–77. A few months later, the [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) controversy broke out. Most of the West Indian players signed up with [[Kerry Packer]], an Australian TV magnate who was attempting to set up his own international cricket competition. The Australian team that toured West Indies the next year included no Packer players. West Indies Cricket Board fielded a full-strength team under the argument that none of the West Indies players had refused to play, but disputes arose in the matter of payment and about the selection of certain players. Before the third Test, Lloyd resigned his captaincy. Within two days all the other WSC-contracted players also withdrew. [[Alvin Kallicharran]] captained the team for the remaining Tests of the series, which the Windies won three-one.

WICB allowed the WSC players to appear in the [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]], and the West Indies retained the title with little difficulty. By the end of 1979, the WSC disputes were resolved. Kallicharran was deposed after losing a six-match series one-nil in [[Indian cricket team|India]] and Lloyd returned as captain for a tour against a full-strength [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] (where the Windies won two-nil, with one draw) and [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. The [[West Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 1979–80|latter tour]] was full of controversy. New Zealand won the first Test at [[Carisbrook|Dunedin]] by one wicket, but West Indies were never happy with the umpiring. West Indian discontent boiled over the next Test at [[Jade Stadium|Christchurch]]. While running into bowl, [[Colin Croft]] deliberately shouldered the umpire [[Fred Goodall]]. When Goodall went to talk to Lloyd about Croft's behaviour, he had to walk all the way to meet the West Indian captain, as the latter did not move an inch from his position at the slips. After tea on the third day, West Indies refused to take the field unless Goodall was removed. They were persuaded to continue, and it took intense negotiations between the two boards to keep the tour on track. The Kiwis won the three match series after the second and third Tests ended in draws.  Nevertheless, the defeat proved to be the West Indies last Test series loss for the next 15 years.

|}
The 1980s started with a one-nil victory away to England over five Tests, one-nil away to Pakistan over four Tests, two-nil home to England over four Tests and a one-all draw away to Australia. Then in 1982–83, a West Indian rebel team toured [[apartheid]] South Africa. It was led by [[Lawrence Rowe]] and included prominent players like [[Alvin Kallicharran]], [[Colin Croft]], [[Collis King]] and [[Sylvester Clarke]]. WICB banned the players for life (which was later revoked), and some were refused entry back home. However, the rebels managed another tour the next year, which included most of the players of the original team. Despite this loss of talent, the official Windies side continued to dominate.  During this time, the West Indies established themselves as one of Test cricket's all-time great sides, peaking perhaps on their tour of England in 1984, where they won the series 5–0, the only time in Test cricket history the touring side has whitewashed a five-test series. This was followed by a second "blackwash" against England at home in 1985–86. At the same time, the West Indies established the then-record of 11 consecutive Test victories, which was part of a still-standing record of 27 Tests without defeat.  In the period from 1980 to 1985–86 they won 10 out of 11 Test series, the 1981–82 series in Australia being drawn 1–1.  The West Indies' only notable defeat in this period was in the one-day arena, when, to general surprise, they lost to [[Indian cricket team|India]] in the final of the [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup]].

West Indian captain [[Clive Lloyd|Lloyd]] retired from Test cricket at the end of the 1984–85 series against Australia. In total Lloyd had captained West Indies in 74 Test matches, winning 36 of them. [[Vivian Richards]] was Lloyd's successor, and continued the run of success. Meanwhile, a change of old guard was also happening. [[Joel Garner]] and [[Michael Holding]] had retired by 1987. A major find was [[Curtly Ambrose]], who was as tall as Garner and equally effective with the ball. [[Courtney Walsh]], who made his first appearance in 1984, bowled with an action that resembled Holding. [[Ian Bishop (cricketer, born 1967)|Ian Bishop]] also had a similar action, and was as good a bowler till injuries interrupted his career. [[Patrick Patterson (cricketer)|Patrick Patterson]] was faster than all the rest, but had a short career. Marshall still was the finest fast bowler in the world. But the batting was beginning to show signs of weakness, despite the presence of Richards, Greenidge and [[Desmond Haynes]]. West Indies failed to qualify for the semifinals of the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987 World Cup]]. By the end of the 1980s, while still the best team in the world, they had lost the aura of invincibility that they had till the middle of the decade. Finding good replacements for senior players was again becoming a problem.

==Fall from grace (1990s-2007)==
During the early 1990s, the West Indies team was dealt a massive blow with the retirement of its star players like Richards, Greenidge, Dujon and Marshall (who all retired after the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1991|away series against England in 1991]]), bringing an end to a glorious era. This left a youthful and inexperienced side. Indeed, after Richards' retirement the only players with significant experience were [[Richie Richardson]] (who was appointed the new captain of the side), [[Desmond Haynes]] (who was soon dropped), [[Gus Logie]] (who was recalled), [[Courtney Walsh]] (who was now the leader of the West Indian pace attack) and [[Roger Harper]] (who came and went). However, this did not immediately affect their performance. Richie Richardson proved to be a decent successor to Richards. A new crop of young players emerged such as [[Brian Lara]], [[Curtly Ambrose]], [[Ian Bishop (cricketer, born 1967)|Ian Bishop]], [[Jimmy Adams]], [[Carl Hooper]], [[Phil Simmons]], [[Keith Arthurton]] and [[Winston Benjamin]]. It was five more years before the West Indies lost a series, but they had a number of close shaves before then. Making a comeback to international cricket, [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] played its first Test match in [[Kensington Oval|Bridgetown]], a match which was attended by fewer than 10,000 people because of a boycott. Needing 201 to win on the last day, South Africa reached 123 for 2 before Ambrose and Walsh took the remaining 8 wickets for 25 runs. In [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1992-93|1992–93]], the West Indies defeated [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] by one run in [[Adelaide Oval|Adelaide]], where a loss would have cost them the series. In 1994–95, the West Indies salvaged a draw in India when, after losing the first Test and drawing the second, they secured a win in the third.  In 1992, the West Indies once again failed to qualify for the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] semi-finals.

Australia finally defeated the West Indies 2–1 in 1994–95 to become the unofficial world champions of Test cricket. The [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996 World Cup]] ended with a defeat in the semi-final, which forced [[Richie Richardson]] to end his career. The captaincy passed over to Courtney Walsh and then in 1998 to Brian Lara. The West Indies made their first ever official tour to South Africa in 1998–99. It was a disaster, starting with player revolts and ending with a 5–0 defeat. The [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]] campaign ended in the group stages. The next year, [[England cricket team|England]] won a series against the West Indies for the first time in thirty-one years. The West Indies ended the decade with another 5–0 defeat, this time in Australia.

For most of the 1990s, the West Indian batting lineup was dominated by [[Brian Lara]]. Lara became a regular in the side after the retirement of Viv Richards in 1991. In 1993–94, he scored 375 against England in [[Antigua Recreation Ground|Antigua]], breaking [[Garry Sobers|Sobers']] world record for the highest individual score in Test cricket. He continued his fine form playing for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in the [[1994 English cricket season|1994 English County Championship]], posting seven first-class hundreds in eight innings (including the Test match 375). The last of these was 501 [[not out]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]], which improved upon [[Hanif Mohammad]]'s thirty-five-year-old record as the [[highest score in first-class cricket]]. The West Indian bowling attack was spearheaded by [[Curtly Ambrose]] and [[Courtney Walsh]], the latter setting a then world record of 519 wickets. However, these two had both retired by 2001, and their successors failed to maintain the high standards that Ambrose and Walsh had set. Despite the emergence of some good batsmen like [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]] and [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]], Brian Lara remained the crucial figure of the side.

After a 2–0 defeat by [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1999–00, Lara was replaced as captain by [[Jimmy Adams]], who initially enjoyed series wins against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]]. However, a 3–1 defeat by [[English cricket team|England]] and a 5–0 whitewash by [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] saw him replaced by [[Carl Hooper]] for the 2000–01 visit by [[South African cricket team|South Africa]]. By the time Lara was restored to the captaincy in 2002–03, series had been lost to [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and [[Indian cricket team|India]]. The only series win of note was against India (although [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]] were also beaten) as the West Indies plummeted to eighth place in the world-rankings, below all the other established Test nations.

After losing the first series of his second captaincy period to world champions [[Australian cricket team|Australia]], Lara secured success against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]], before another poor run saw 3–0 defeats in 4-Test series against both [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] and [[English cricket team|England]]. In the drawn fourth Test against England, Lara became the only man to regain the world record for highest individual Test score by scoring 400 not out, once again in Antigua, bettering [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against Zimbabwe the previous year. The West Indies were then [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2004|whitewashed 4–0 in England]]. Lara's last act as captain was to win the [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy]], a one-day competition second only to the Cricket World Cup, at [[the Oval]], London – a win that was a welcome surprise for the Caribbean which had just been hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]].

===Player, Board disputes===

This joy was short-lived as a major dispute broke out in 2005 between the West Indian Players Association (WIPA) and the Cricket Board. The point of contention was clause 5 of the tour contract which gave WICB ''the sole and exclusive right to arrange for sponsorship, advertising, licensing, merchandising and promotional activities relating to WICB or any WICB Team''. [[Digicel]] were the sponsors of the West Indian Team, while most of the players had contracts with [[Cable &amp; Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable &amp; Wireless]]. This conflict, coupled with a payment dispute meant that the West Indies initially announced a team absent Lara and a number of other leading West Indians for South Africa's visit in 2004–05, leading to [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]] becoming captain. Some of these players did, in the end, compete. However, the dispute had not been resolved and rumbled on, leading to a second-string side being named for the [[West Indians in Sri Lanka in 2005|tour of Sri Lanka in 2005]]. A resolution did not arise until October 2005, when a full-strength side was finally named for the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|2005–06 tour of Australia]]. It was on this tour that [[Brian Lara]] overtook [[Australian cricket team|Australian]] [[Allan Border]] as the highest run-scorer in [[Test cricket|Test match]] cricket, despite the West Indies losing the series 3–0.

In 2009, another dispute erupted when many senior players decided not to take part over pay and contract issues. The WICB chose a second-string side to take part in a series against Bangladesh and the Champions Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/422960.html WICB-WIPA dispute]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ICC decided to get involved in order to resolve this long standing dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/567819.html ICC to resolve WICB WIPA dispute]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, another dispute between WICB and West Indian Players Association (WIPA) led to the team's Indian tour being curtailed. The bone of contention was a protracted payment structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-west-indies-2014-15/content/story/789919.html West Indies cut short tour of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Players has made themselves unavailable for tests, and with Jason Holder being thrust into the role of captaincy, and was met with much distrust between veteran bowlers and Holder and the administration and selectors. As a result, West Indies lost 21 matches by an innings since 1995-2015, when the team never lost more than 4 matches by over an innings combined from 1966-1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Batsmen drag West Indies to new low|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-west-indies-2015-16/content/story/951611.html|website = Cricinfo|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the Top/Rise of a T20 Power==
When [[Twenty20]] cricket began to be contested full force beginning with the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|2007 World Twenty20]] in South Africa, the West Indies began to develop and realize an advantage of possessing and developing Richards-style batsmen who could devastate bowling attacks with power. As well, many West Indian batsmen put an emphasis on power to prepare for Twenty20 play as it offered them their most lucrative contracts. Foremost among the hard hitters was [[Chris Gayle]], who both hit the first T20 international century and became the first to hit two.

At the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]] in Sri Lanka, the Windies thrashed Australia in the semifinals and then beat the hosts by 32 runs to win their third ICC world championship and their first since Richards, Holding, Lloyd and Co. had won the 1979 World Cup. In the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20|2016 World Twenty20]], they beat host India in the semifinals after a scintillating successful chase and were still cheered back at their hotel by local and traveling fans&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/CricketAus/status/715648198769926144 Fans welcome the West Indies back to the Oberoi in Mumbai after beating India] Cricket Australia on Twitter&lt;/ref&gt; as they advanced to face England in the final, which they won by four wickets after [[Carlos Brathwaite]] hit four consecutive sixes off [[Ben Stokes]] with 19 runs required off the final over. In contrast to being 8th in the ICC Test Rankings and 9th in the ICC ODI Rankings, the Windies entered the match as 2nd in the ICC T20 rankings behind only India.

== Bowling attack ==
The West Indies generally play [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]] more so than [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. The West Indian team at any one time will generally consist of four fast bowlers (as opposed to a mixture of fast and spin bowlers). They have on occasion played spin bowlers however, they tend to be batting [[Eldine Baptiste|All-Rounders]]. Examples include [[Gus Logie]], [[Carl Hooper]], etc. One famous example of their "four-pronged" pace attack (as it has been dubbed) was during the 1980s when the attack generally included :
*[[Malcolm Marshall]] (fast bowler)
*[[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] (fast)
*[[Michael Holding]] (fast) and 
*[[Joel Garner]] (fast).
Other pacemen surrounding that quartet included *[[Patrick Patterson (cricketer)|Patrick Patterson]] (fast), *[[Colin Croft]] (fast) &amp; *[[Sylvester Clarke]] (fast).

Their current attack includes:
* [[Kemar Roach]] (fast)
* [[Ravi Rampaul]] (fast medium)
* [[Tino Best]] (fast)
* [[Sheldon Cottrell]] (fast medium)
* [[Darren Sammy]] (medium fast)
* [[Jason Holder]] (fast medium) and 
* [[Dwayne Bravo]] (fast medium)

Other pacemen of this era include [[Andre Russell]] (fast medium), [[Miguel Cummins]] (fast medium), [[Fidel Edwards]] (fast), [[Krishmar Santokie]] (fast medium), [[Shannon Gabriel]] (fast), [[Lionel Baker]] (fast medium) and [[Jerome Taylor]] (fast).

[[File:MathieuGaron.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption.|[[Mathieu Garon]], playing for the [[Los Angeles Kings]], in full goaltending gear.]]
In [[ice hockey]], the [[goaltender]] wears specialized '''goaltending equipment''' to protect himself from the impact of the [[Hockey puck|puck]] and to assist himself in making [[Save (ice hockey)|saves]].

Most modern goaltending equipment is made from hydrophobic synthetic leather and [[nylon]] on the outside and dense closed-cell [[foam]]s and plastics inside. In the past, pads were often made out of leather and stuffed with horse hair.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) specifies maximum dimensions of goaltending equipment to prevent goaltenders from having an unfair advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hockey League|year=2006|title=Rule 21 - Goaltender's Equipment|url=http://nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule21.html|accessdate=2008-09-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010616060222/http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule21.html|archivedate=2001-06-16|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Many other professional and non-professional leagues adhere to equipment size regulations based on [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Ice Hockey Federation|year=2006|title=IIHF Rule Book 2006-2010|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blocker==
{{main|Blocker (ice hockey)}}
[[File:Roller-hockey-(Quad)-Goalie-Stick-Glove.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption.|A blocker designed for roller hockey]]
The blocker consists of a glove with a rectangular board attached to the backhand side. The board is usually curved up at one end, which is designed to help control the deflection of the puck and will create a tougher angle on a shot if a goaltender uses the shaft-down technique. The blocker is worn on the hand that holds the stick, so a right-handed goaltender wears the blocker on the right hand, and a left-handed goaltender wears it on the left hand. This is called a "full right goalie" as the goaltender wears the catch glove in the right hand. A blocker is sometimes called a ''waffle'' in reference to older models, which were covered with real leather, but had holes cut in the leather to save weight, giving the blocker a waffle-like appearance. The placement of the palm on the back of the blocker varies though it has been traditionally placed in the middle. Newer models tend to place the palm further to the inside of the glove in order cover more of the net. Typically, the goaltender wears only one blocker. However, near the end of his career, retired goaltender [[Dan Blackburn]] played with two blockers after nerve damage rendered him incapable of closing his glove hand.

==Catcher==
{{main|Trapper (ice hockey)}}
The ''Catcher'' or ''glove'' is the glove worn on the free hand. It is similar to a [[baseball mitt]], but has additional padding to protect the lower forearm, wrist, palm, fingers and thumb, and has a deeper pocket. The first goaltender trapper, worn by [[Reid Miller]] in 1948, who played for the [[Wadena Wolverines]] and the [[North Stars]], was a baseball first baseman's mitt. Common variations among trappers include the pocket angle.{{clarify|date=September 2012}} If the glove is too bulky, it does not allow for good stick handling. Trappers tend to be one of the most cared-for pieces of equipment for the goaltender. In order to prevent what is called a "pancake pocket", goaltenders often deepen the pocket by strapping objects inside the glove when not in use. The trapper's fit is extremely important as well as the goaltender's sense of the pocket and angles of the trapper. As a result, transitioning to a new glove may be difficult because of the significant break in-time. Some people suggest that the size of the trapper should be reduced from its present dimensions, which cannot be justified by the legitimate need to maximize protection.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Chest and arm protector==
The ''chest and arm protector'' or ''arm and body pad'' is designed to protect the chest, shoulders, arms, and collarbone area from the impact of pucks and is worn under the [[hockey jersey]]. The chest and arm protector has continually become more protective in recent years. In the early days of goaltending, it was much smaller and less protective, consisting mostly of thick felt. In effect, these pads were little better than what baseball catchers wear today. With the advent of better materials such as high density plastics and foams, chest protectors can be made to protect the body from injury. However, even with modern chest protectors, goaltenders still receive bruises and other minor injuries from pucks that hit them in the torso.

==Jockstrap==
A goaltender jock with a cup pocket, which protects the pelvic area, is more protective than a common [[jockstrap]] with [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]], though it generally uses the same internal plastic cup, or maybe a bit larger. The jock has padding over the internal plastic cup and additional padding from the top of the cup to the waist. Many modern jocks use two cups, one in front of the other, in order to provide more protection. Instead of a jock, female goaltenders wear a [[pelvic protector]] known as a ''jill''.

==Leg pads==
[[File:Jacques Plante 1944-1945.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Goalie [[Jacques Plante]] wearing goaltender equipment from the 1940s]]
Goaltenders wear special leg [[pads]] to protect their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved significantly over the years. The earliest leg pads were very similar to the [[cricket]] pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a ''skip-over roll'', was added to the outside edge of each pad face, extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the knee rolls. In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to the very top of the leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goaltender pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather toe strap with a toe bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the "box" style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the "box" style pad, the edge between the pad face and the pad inside edge is square, keeping the pad face more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the blocking area when the goaltender is in the "butterfly" position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than {{convert|11|in|cm}} and can be no longer than {{convert|38|in|cm}}. The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender.

==Mask==
{{main|Goaltender mask}}
[[File:Martin Gerber.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption.|[[Martin Gerber]], playing for the [[Ottawa Senators]], wearing a modern goalie mask.]]
The first modern goaltender mask was pioneered by professional goaltender [[Jacques Plante]]. Early masks were constructed from [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] and were molded to the shape of the wearer's face. These became less popular in the year 1969 in North America when a series of severe and career ending injuries struck down many NHL goaltenders using molded masks and prompted the [[Canadian Standards Association]] to outlaw molded masks in 1978. Assuredly, it was also [[Vladislav Tretiak]]'s brilliant play during [[Canada]]-[[USSR]] [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]], that North American players first began to notice the superiority of the helmet/cage-type mask as opposed to the form-fitting fiberglass model, especially in terms of increased vision. Another significant advance in mask design came during the 1974-75 season, when goaltending great [[Tony Esposito]], who had experienced puck and stick injuries to his eyes, fitted a steel cage over the eyeholes of his molded mask and crafted a fiberglass extension to protect the top of his head, thereby setting the groundwork for the next step in mask evolution, the modern goaltender mask, commonly referred to as the "hybrid" mask.
Today, most goaltenders utilize hybrid masks made of fiberglass, [[kevlar]], [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]], and other [[composite material]]s. Modern masks have a large cutout in the eye and nose area covered by a [[steel]] or [[titanium]] cage. 
Many goaltenders are able to be identified by the custom artwork [[airbrush]]ed on their masks. Some maintain the same theme throughout their career, changing the colors to match their team's colors. Examples include [[Curtis Joseph]]'s [[Cujo]], [[Ed Belfour]]'s eagle, [[Félix Potvin]]'s abstract cat design, [[Martin Brodeur]]'s generic Devils mask, or [[Patrick Lalime]]'s [[Marvin the Martian]]. Some goaltenders have more generic team-specific artwork, while others vary the artwork over the course of their careers.

An alternative to the mask, is the earlier mentioned "bird-cage" helmet and cage combo, which consists of a wire facemask attached to a standard hockey helmet. This became popular during the 1970s since a cage provides better sightlines than a molded fiberglass mask. Its popularity peaked during the 1980s, yet started to decline during the 1990s, as hockey equipment manufacturers discontinued the production of helmets and cages favored by goaltenders. By the turn of the 21st century, only a few professional goalies still wore a helmet/cage combo. Included in this small group were [[Chris Osgood]] of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Rick DiPietro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islanders Dipietro Dons Osgood’s Old Mask To Protect Shattered Face|url=http://ingoalmag.com/news/islanders-dipietro-dons-osgoods-old-mask-to-protect-shattered-face/|publisher=www.ingoalmag.com|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[New York Islanders]] in the NHL, [[Martin Prusek]] of [[Dinamo Riga (current)|Dinamo Riga]] in the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]], and [[Marco Bührer]] of [[SC Bern]] in the [[Swiss]] [[National League A]]. [[Dominik Hašek]] also wore the helmet/cage combo for the duration of his career.

There were various helmet/cage combinations used by professionals. One was the [[Cooper Canada|Cooper]] SK600 helmet with the Cooper HM30 cage (worn by [[Ken Wregget]] and [[Billy Smith (ice hockey)|Billy Smith]]). Another was the Cooper SK2000 helmet with either the Cooper HM30 cage (previously used by Osgood and [[Dan Cloutier]]) or the Cooper HM50 cage (previously used by Hašek). Another one was the [[Jofa]] 280 Helmet with the 260.51 cage, which was last worn by [[Arturs Irbe]]. [[Don Beaupre]] wore a Cooper SK600 with a Jofa 260.51 cage. After [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired Cooper and consolidated it as [[Nike Bauer]], the SK2000 and HM50 were discontinued, while the HM30 was marketed as a field hockey mask (and subsequently discontinued in 2004). Jofa eventually phased out the 280 helmet and its respective cage, but now offer the RBK 3K helmet and 287 cage for the European market since consolidating with [[Reebok]].

There are currently two models of goaltender masks which are both available to the North American market and based on the helmet/cage combination. The first model is the Hasek Pro Style 357, manufactured by the Warwick Mask Company, which follows the traditional helmet/cage style of masks. Current users of these helmets include Prusek and Bührer, while Hašek used this model from the 2001-02 season up to his retirement. The second is the Mage, manufactured by Sportmask. The difference between the Mage and other helmet/cage combinations is that the Mage's cage attaches to a helmet with a back plate as opposed to a helmet that's enclosed. Mage users include [[Florida Panthers]] goaltender [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]] and [[Genève-Servette HC]] goaltender [[Tobias Stephan]].

== Pants/Breezers ==
Goaltenders' pants are similar in appearance to the pants that forwards and defensemen wear. Goaltender pants are heavily padded all down the front and sides, with a tailbone protector incorporated into the rear of the pant. They also have protective foams on the inner thigh for increased protection from shots. They also have attachments for the options of suspenders.

== Skates ==
Goal [[Ice skate|skate]]s differ from regular hockey skates. The blade is longer, wider, and flatter to provide the goalie with more stability. It is made out of [[carbon steel]] rather than [[stainless steel]]. The blade holder, which is molded to the cowling, is shorter vertically so that the goaltender is lower to the ice. The boot does not have a tendon guard, which is the piece of a regular hockey skate that extends up the back of the ankle to protect the [[Achilles' tendon]]. Finally, the boot used to be inside a rigid cowling to protect the foot from direct impact. The current trend is to remove the cowling. Cowlings made the skates wider, especially at the bottom of the boot.  When the modern goaltender went into a deep "butterfly" position, to see between the players in front of him, the cowl would lift the blade off the ice. The new goaltender skate is made out of newer materials, allowing the boot itself to provide the needed protection. The cowlings are being phased out of professional play.

The special [[Ice hockey stick|hockey stick]] goaltenders use has a blade that is approximately {{convert|3+1/2|in|cm}} wide. The lower {{convert|25|to|28|in|cm|abbr=off}} of the shaft is widened to provide more blocking surface. This area is called the ''paddle''. Although traditional goaltender sticks were usually made completely of wood, most modern sticks are reinforced with graphite and fiberglass and the paddle and blade are injected with foam to make them lighter. Recently, manufacturers have begun to produce sticks made completely from [[composite material]]s, which are lighter.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} However, it may be argued that composite sticks are less durable than their wooden counterparts. While these sticks are widely sold, most professional goaltenders have in fact continued to use the foam core paddle-wood shaft type, even though it may be painted to look composite. The reason is both durability and the ability of the "old" style construction to absorb shock. Player sticks are made to transmit feeling (i.e. of the puck) to the player's hands when stickhandling. Goaltenders need the stick to absorb the shock of the puck impact when making a save.

'''International Aikido Federation''' ('''International Aikido Federation''') is a world governing body for the sport of [[Aikido]].

==Structure==
The International Aikido Federation was formed in 1976 to serve as a primary global aikido organisation. It is an [[umbrella organisation]] with member organisations from more than 40 nations (for example, the All-Japan Aikido Federation is one member). All members must be recognised by the Hombu, so the IAF exclusively represents the [[Aikikai]] school. The IAF is a nominally democratic organisation but special roles are given to the Doshu and a council of senior instructors, to safeguard the "technical and moral" integrity of aikido. The IAF currently admits only one member organisation per country and gives each such member equal vote (it was modeled on the [[United Nations|UN]]; it does not necessarily give every Aikikai student equal representation).&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aikido-international.org/images/2015/01/IAF-membership-application-rules.pdf |title=Rules for Membership Applications
 |website=aikido-international.org |publisher=International Aikido Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAF demonstrates aikido at the [[World Games]], and represents aikido to the globe. The IAF also organises International Aikido Congresses every four years, facilitating direct training between aikido students of different countries, sharing instruction by the world's most senior aikido instructors, and also providing a channel for official communication with the Hombu.

The IAF publishes a list of member nations and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aikido-international.org/membership-advice/hotspot |title=Member Nations |website=aikido-international.org |publisher=International Aikido Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inyokern Airport''' {{airport codes|IYK|KIYK|IYK}} is a public use [[airport]] located {{Convert|1|nmi|}} northwest of the [[central business district]] of [[Inyokern, California|Inyokern]], in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], [[California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; It is owned by the Indian Wells Valley Airport District&lt;ref name=FAA /&gt; and serves the [[Indian Wells Valley]] area. The airport is mostly used for [[general aviation]] and was previously served by a number of commuter and regional airlines over the years with passenger flights to Los Angeles ([[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]]).

As per [[Federal Aviation Administration]] records, the airport had 11,149 passenger boardings (enplanements) in [[calendar year]] 2008,&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Historical airline service ===

As early as the mid 1950s, Inyokern had scheduled passenger air service operated by [[Southwest Airways]] with [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft twice a day on weekdays nonstop to [[Burbank Airport]] (BUR, now [[Bob Hope Airport]]) in the Los Angeles area.  According to the March 11, 1954 Southwest Airways system timetable, this DC-3 service was "operated under and subject to terms of U.S. Navy Contract".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, March 11, 1954 Southwest Airways system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  Southwest Airways then changed its name to [[Pacific Air Lines]] which in 1960 was operating nonstop DC-3 service to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] ([[LAX]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, April 24, 1960 Pacific Air Lines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, Pacific was operating [[Martin 4-0-4]] propliners from the airport to LAX.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetablimages.com{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, July 1, 1964 Pacific Air Lines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Pacific Air Lines merged with [[Bonanza Air Lines]] and [[West Coast Airlines]] to form [[Air West]] which at this time was operating [[Fairchild F-27]] turboprops from Inyokern to Los Angeles via a stop at [[Fox Field]] in [[Lancaster, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, July 1, 1968 Air West system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  Air West then changed its name to [[Hughes Airwest]] which continued to serve the airport with F-27 propjet flights to LAX via Lancaster.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1972 Hughes Airwest system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Cable Commuter Airlines was operating [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] turboprops to [[LAX]] in competition with Air West.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Dec. 1, 1968 Cable Commuter Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest in the early 1970s, a number of commuter and regional airlines served the airport over the years with scheduled passenger flights to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] ([[LAX]]). Schedules in the [[OAG (Air Travel Intelligence)|Official Airline Guide (OAG)]] from 1974 through 2007 list flights operated at various times over the years by [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] (operated by [[Wings West Airlines]]), C&amp;M Airlines, Cable Commuter Airlines, [[Delta Connection]] (operated by [[SkyWest Airlines]]), [[Desert Sun Airlines]], [[Golden West Airlines]], Indian Wells Airlines, Mojave Airlines, and [[United Express]] (initially operated by [[Mesa Airlines]] and later by [[SkyWest Airlines]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Los Angeles flight schedules from Inyokern, Official Airline Guide (OAG) editions:  Nov. 15, 1979; April 1, 1981; Feb. 15, 1985; Dec. 15, 1989; Oct. 1, 1991; Oct. 1, 1996; July 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feb. 2007 OAG Flight Guide, Worldwide edition&lt;/ref&gt; These OAGs also list the various turboprop aircraft types that were operated by most of the above airlines into the airport including the [[Beechcraft C99]] (Desert Sun and Mojave Airlines), the [[Beechcraft 1900C]] (Mesa Airlines), the [[British Aerospace]] [[BAe Jetstream 31]] (Wings West), the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] (Cable Commuter Airlines and Golden West), the [[Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia]] (SkyWest) and the [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner]] (SkyWest and Wings West).  C&amp;M Airlines and Indian Wells Airlines operated small [[Cessna]] prop aircraft.  Scheduled passenger airline service ended following the cessation of [[United Express]] flights operated by [[SkyWest Airlines|SkyWest]] in November 2013.&lt;ref name="ridgecrestca.com"&gt;Jack Barnwell,

On July 7, 2017, airport officials awarded a contract to [[Boutique Air]] to begin daily flights to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] starting August 8, 2017. On October 12, 2017, the Indian Wells Valley Airport District board of directors voted to terminate its contract with Boutique Air following a 60-day notice.&lt;ref name="ridgecrestca.com"/&gt;

=== Drag racing ===
The '''Inyokern Airport Dragstrip''' opened in 1954, and was the second oldest continuously operating [[dragstrip]] in the United States, behind Thornhill Dragstrip in Kenton, KY which opened in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.na-motorsports.com/Tracks/CA/Inyokern.html Inyokern Dragstrip] at North American Motorsports Pages&lt;/ref&gt; The drag strip closed during the 2005 season due to new [[Federal Aviation Administration]] regulations.

=== Soaring ===
Beginning in the 1950s, regular glider records were set out of Inyokern in various sources of lift.  Due to its location on the lee side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, it is an excellent location for altitude records in wave conditions or distance and speed records in thermal lift.  It is a challenging location, as the winds change frequently, but with three long runways pilots generally have a variety of options for launch and landing.  Many well known pilots have flown gliders out of Inyokern, including [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Paul Bikle]], and [[Steve Fossett]].

Presently Inyokern Airport is the home to Sierra Soaring Club, which operates a [[Cessna 182 Skylane|Cessna 182]] for towing gliders, a Blanik L-23 for rides and instruction, and a [[Schweizer SGS 1-35|Schweizer 1-35]] and [[Schempp-Hirth Standard Cirrus|Standard Cirrus]] for wave flights and cross country soaring.

=== Film history ===
In the wake of the drag strip's closing, the airport has been actively promoting its use for film shoots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmiyk.com|title=Filming at Inyokern Airport|website=www.filmiyk.com|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Ridgecrest Regional Film Commission marketing its (Runway 28) as "the region's #1 filming location".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmdeserts.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=129&amp;Itemid=20|title=RACVB - Local Film commissions Host Location Pros (10/25/01)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315112102/http://www.filmdeserts.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=129&amp;Itemid=20|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable example of this new use is a [[television advertisement]] titled "Gravity", for the [[Lexus IS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macguff.com/?j=showjob&amp;id=79|title=Mac Guff - Digital visual effects design studios|first=Handmade by La Haute Société.|last=www.lahautesociete.com|website=www.macguff.com|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The airdrop "target" featured in the commercial, where the falling automobile hits the ground, was painted on the old drag strip; however, many of the vehicle shots preceding the car drop actually feature the Lexus rolling down runway 20. Other notable automotive television ads shot here include most spots from [[Saab (automobile)|Saab]]'s "Born from Jets" campaign, as well as spots for [[Volkswagen]], [[Volvo]], [[Cadillac]], [[Nissan]], [[Mazda]], [[Toyota]], [[Ford]], and [[Chevrolet]], just to name a few.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Inyokern Airport covers an area of {{Convert|1640|acre|}} at an [[elevation]] of {{Convert|2457|feet|}} above [[mean sea level]]. It has three [[asphalt]] paved [[runway]]s: 15/33 is {{Convert|7100|by|75|feet}}, 2/20 is {{Convert|6275|by|75|feet}}, and 10/28 is {{Convert|4150|by|75|feet}}4,150 by 75 feet (1,265 x 23 m).&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2010, the airport had 28,573 aircraft operations, an average of 78 per day: 80% [[general aviation]], 10% [[military aviation|military]], 6% [[air taxi]], and 5% [[airline|scheduled commercial]]. At that time there were 117 aircraft based at this airport: 84% single-[[aircraft engine|engine]], 9% multi-engine, 5% [[glider (sailplane)|glider]], and 3% [[ultralight]].&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">'''Last Man Standing is a motorcycle race''' held annually in [[Bulcher, Texas]], US.  The race consists of 300 of the world’s top [[enduro]] riders from around the world and they all converge on Bulcher for the Red Bull’s Last Man Standing Enduro event. The race takes place on the Red River Motorcycle Trails course straddling the Texas/Oklahoma border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://racerxonline.com/2009/04/30/red-bull-last-man-standing-wins-xtremey-award|title=Red Bull Last Man Standing Wins Xtremey Award - Racer X Online|website=Red Bull Last Man Standing Wins Xtremey Award - Racer X Online|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located northwest of Dallas/Fort Worth along the [[Texas]]-[[Oklahoma]] border, the Red River Motorcycle Trails have some of the most challenging terrain in North America for racing Enduro Motorcycles. The event is a carved out 40-mile loop that features steep rocky climbs, descents, boulders the size of cars and forests with trees that one can barely walk through. The race also presents its riders with the 100&amp;nbsp;mph straight-aways of hard packed, loamy dirt and sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dirtrider.com/features/news/141_0507_red_bull_off_road_racing_shootout|title=Red Bull Last Man Standing, An Off-Road Racing Shootout - News - Dirt Rider Magazine|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==
The race is an "every man for himself never before seen in off-road racing," according to Josh Whitaker with [[KTM]] North America, who represents the leading manufacturer of off-road motorcycles. " Last Man Standing Enduro Event combines gut-wrenching terrain with favorite elements from Enduro, Cross Country and Desert racing techniques. Red Bull sponsors the Last Man Standing event which consists of four elimination stages of one lap each and starts by bunching together approximately 300 invited riders on the 40-mile circuit.

==Course==
The first two 40-mile laps happen during the day and the second two laps at night.  The top 50 percent of the riders then move on until only 25 riders are left for the fourth and final stage. The rider who wins the event is crowned "Last Man Standing" claiming the majority share of prize money made up of entry fees.

The Course starts with 200 riders, side-by-side.  Each line-up in a valley with no lines and no trails.  What awaits the riders is all terrain. Across the valley, a signal fire is lit, which is when the riders take off.

==Trail==
The trails have the tightest, fastest, steepest, and most technical terrain. The ever-changing dirt brings the red clay of the Southeast and the hard packed light colored sand mix of the West into a cloud storm of riders and dust. At night, only the best at the top of their game will advance to the night laps and face a  reversed direction of the race.

==Finish==
The Finish of the race is a test of skill, endurance, and mental toughness. The race is a race to survive. Because in the end, there is only one who will emerge as the best as Last Man Standing

[[File:Automobile Palace, Llandrindod 02.JPG|thumb|right|National Cycle Collection]]
The '''National Cycle Collection''' of Wales is a collection of bicycles through the ages established in 1997, and located in [[Llandrindod Wells]], [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]].  It contains around 250 bicycles from 1818 to 2005, including a large collection of penny farthings and solid tyred safety bicycles, as well as cycling books, accessories and paraphernalia.&lt;ref name=bbcpix&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19585315 |title=In pictures: National Cycle Museum in Wales |website=''BBC News'' |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=2017-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building and site was known as The Automobile Palace, a project of bicycle shop owner Tom Norton who bought the site in 1906 for his expanding business.&lt;ref name=motorsport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1963/57/pioneer-welsh-motor-business |title=A pioneer Welsh motor business |website=Motorsport Magazine |date=July 1963 |accessdate=2017-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was initially completed in 1911 in an [[Art Deco]] style and then tripled in size, to the same standard, in 1919. It has received a Grade II* [[Listed building|heritage listing]], being "an exceptionally early grid-pattern steel-framed building surviving largely unaltered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300009064-the-automobile-palace-llandrindod-wells |title=The Automobile Palace |website=British Listed Buildings |accessdate=2017-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pitch''' or a '''sports ground''' is an outdoor playing area for various [[sport]]s.  The term ''pitch'' is most commonly used in [[British English]], while the comparable term in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]] is '''playing field''' or '''sports field'''.

In most sports the official term is '''field of play''', although this is not regularly used by those outside refereeing/umpiring circles.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The field of play generally includes out-of-bounds areas that a player is likely to enter while playing a match, such as the area beyond the [[touchline]]s in [[association football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]] or the [[sidelines]] in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], or the "[[Foul ball|foul territory]]" in [[baseball]].

The surface of a pitch is most commonly composed of [[Sod|sod (grass)]], but may also be [[artificial turf]], [[sand]], [[clay]], [[gravel]], [[concrete]], or other materials. A playing field on [[ice]] may be referred to as a ''rink'', for example an [[ice hockey rink]], although ''rink'' may also refer to the entire building or, in the sport of [[curling]], to either the building or a particular team.

In the sport of [[cricket]], the [[cricket pitch]] refers not to the entire [[Cricket#The playing field|field of play]], but to the section of the field on which batting and bowling take place in the centre of the field. The pitch is prepared differently from the rest of the field, to provide a harder surface for bowling.

A pitch is often a [[Regulation of sport|regulation]] space, as in an [[association football pitch]].

The term '''level playing field''' is also used metaphorically to mean fairness in non-sporting human activities such as business where there are notional winners and losers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Justice in an Unfair World: Toward a Level Playing Field|first=Ethan B|last=Kapstein|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=16 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game Court ==
'''Game Court''' is one of the names for a multi-sport athletic space, typically constructed outdoors, where such games as [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[paddle tennis]] and other racquet sports, and up to a dozen more games and activities can be played. They are usually smaller than a regulation tennis (120' x 60')or basketball (84'x50')court, although there is no set dimensions or size for a game court. The game-court concept was popularized by Sport Court in the 1970s, and some generic references are made to game courts as 'sport courts', although that is a trademark of Connor Sport Court International, LLC. Game courts are often found in residential backyards, giving families and children opportunities for healthy recreation close to home. 

Game courts are usually constructed using a rectangular sub-base made from concrete or asphalt, then covered with an open-grid modular polypropylene (or similar) sports surface to improve safety. Most feature athletic equipment such as basketball goals, net systems for racquet sports, volleyball and badminton, lights for nighttime play, fencing or ball containment netting, hockey/soccer goals, lines or markings for various sports, and practice or training components can also be incorporated into the design.

=== Surface ===
The surface of a game court--as opposed to simply playing on concrete or asphalt--is designed for safe play and to reduce injury. Many people have started to use [[suspended athletic courts]] to cover old athletic courts like tennis courts and basketball courts. The surface should provide appropriate traction for various types of sports and activities, as well as shock or force reduction to minimize overuse and stress injuries. 
Game courts are typically custom-designed to the interests of the family or organization, and are versatile in enabling a wide variety of sports to be played in a relatively small space. Some activities played on a game court are enjoyable modifications of other sports (such as short-court tennis) that allow for similar skills to be developed as the 'regulation' game, but on a reduced-scale court size. A typical game court of 50'x30' might include a basketball key and 3-point line arranged around a hoop, overlaid by short-court tennis or pickleball lines (which can also be used for volleyball or badminton) along the longer dimension. 

=== Ball Containment ===
Game courts for private use will frequently be built with a high fence surrounding the surface to allow for containment of the ball used in play.  Any of several materials have been used in construction including chain link fencing of fabric mesh.

The '''''Royal Institute Dictionary''''' ('''RID'''; {{lang-th|พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน}}, {{RTGS|Photchananukrom Chabap Ratchabandittayasathan}}) is the official and [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]]&lt;ref name ="thanksin"&gt;{{cite journal |author = [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] | date = July 17, 2002 | script-title=th:ประกาศสำนักนายกรัฐมนตรี เรื่อง ระเบียบการใช้ตัวสะกด ลงวันที่ 11 กรกฎาคม 2545 |trans-title=Announcement of the Office of the Prime Minister, Re: Regulation of spellings, dated July 11, 2002 | journal = Government Gazette | volume = 199 | issue = special, 66 D | page = 1 | publisher = Secretariat General of the Cabinet | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/00090541.PDF | accessdate = October 1, 2012 | language = Thai | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web | title = พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน | trans-title = Royal Institute Dictionary | publisher = Royal Institute of Thailand | date = January 16, 2007 | url = http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1380 | accessdate = October 1, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044212/http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1380 | archivedate = November 27, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; dictionary of [[Thai language]], published by the [[Royal Society of Thailand]].

The Royal Society of Thailand has published four fully revised editions of the dictionary, and many intermittent reprintings with minor revisions. Each of the major revisions is associated with a significant year in Thai history, although in the case of the 1999 and 2011 editions, the actual publication date is a later year.

== Status ==
The dictionary is the only prescriptive and official dictionary of Thai words.&lt;ref name ="thanksin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "status"/&gt; It has also frequently been used by the courts in interpreting the general meanings of the words in dispute, although the RIT has issued a statement that the dictionary is not intended to produce legal effect concerning [[Legal case|cases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/1973_6255.pdf | script-title = th:ราชบัณฑิตยสถานชี้แจงเรื่องการให้คำปรึกษาความหมายภาษาไทยที่มีผลทางคดี | trans-title = The Royal Institute's explanation on provision of legal advice concerning Thai language | publisher = Royal Institute of Thailand | date = December 1, 2011 | format = pdf | language = Thai | accessdate = October 1, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable legal cases is the case of a transgender who applied for judicial permission to change his title from "Mister" to "Miss" in 1986, as the law at that time only allowed a female to use the latter title. The applicant argued that he could be considered a female, since he had undergone [[Sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], having his [[Sex reassignment surgery|sexual organ removed]] and having [[Breast implant|breasts augmented]], etc. The [[Supreme Court of Justice of Thailand|Supreme Court of Justice]] ruled that, according to the ''RID 1982'', a female is "a person that can be pregnant", and denied his application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | script-title = th:คำพิพากษาศาลฎีกาที่ 157/2524 | trans-title = Judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice No. 157/2524 | url = http://www.lawreform.go.th/lawreform/images/th/jud/th/thsc/2503/cd_10858.pdf | publisher = Council of State of Thailand | date = n.d. | format = pdf | language = Thai | accessdate = October 1, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050842/http://www.lawreform.go.th/lawreform/images/th/jud/th/thsc/2503/cd_10858.pdf | archivedate = March 4, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Watcharin Sangsikaeo | date = December 2006 | script-title=th:คำสั่งทางปกครองกับผู้แปลงเพศ |trans-title=Administrative acts and transgenders | journal = Sukhothai Thammathirat's Legal Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–104 | publisher = Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University | language = Thai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable case is that of [[Samak Sundaravej]], then prime minister who was [[Samak Sundaravej#Court decision|accused of conflict of interest in 2008]]. The [[Election Commission of Thailand|Election Commission]] and the [[Senate of Thailand|Senate]] jointly complained before the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] that Samak worked for a private commercial business while in office. The [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|''Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, Buddhist Era 2550 (2007)'']], prohibits a public officer from being an employee of any person, especially a commercial business. Samak argued that he had not been paid for hosting two cookery shows in question, ''Tasting and Grumbling'' and ''All Set at 6 am'', and could not be regarded as an employee under the Civil and Commercial Code or the law on labour. The court decided that the term "employee" in the constitution conveys a general meaning. As the ''RID 1999'' defines an "employee" as "a person who agrees to work for another person, irrespective of how he is called", the court found Samak guilty and terminated his ministership, removing him from office in consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = [[Constitutional Court of Thailand]] | date = November 19, 2008 | script-title=th:คำวินิจฉัยของศาลรัฐธรรมนูญที่ 12-13/2551 เรื่อง ประธานวุฒิสภาส่งคำร้องของสมาชิกวุฒิสภาเพื่อขอให้ศาลรัฐธรรมนูญพิจารณาวินิจฉัยการสิ้นสุดความเป็นรัฐมนตรีของนายกรัฐมนตรี เรื่อง คณะกรรมการการเลือกตั้งขอให้ศาลรัฐธรรมนูญพิจารณาวินิจฉัยการสิ้นสุดความเป็นรัฐมนตรีของนายกรัฐมนตรี |trans-title=Decision of the Constitutional Court No. 12-13/2551, Re: President of the Senate forwarded a senatorial petition for a decision of the Constitutional Court as to whether the ministership of the Prime Minister ought to be terminated, and the Election Commission submitted a petition for a decision of the Constitutional Court as to whether the ministership of the Prime Minister ought to be terminated | journal = Government Gazette | volume = 125 | issue = 122 A | page = 1 | publisher = Secretariat General of the Cabinet | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2551/A/122/1.PDF | accessdate = October 1, 2012 | language = Thai | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ผ่าคำวินิจฉัยศาลรัฐธรรมนูญที่ 12-13/2551 (กรณีการจัดรายการโทรทัศน์ของนายสมัคร สุนทรเวช) |trans-title=Looking into the Decision of the Constitutional Court No. 12-13/2551 (Samak Sundaravej's TV Shows Case) | author = Phonsan Liangbunloetchai | publisher = PubLaw | url = http://www.pub-law.net/publaw/view.aspx?id=1280 | date = September 28, 2008 | accessdate = October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revision method ==

The methodology of the Dictionary Revision Commission (DRC) of the RIT has remained virtually unchanged for more than 70 years. The ''RID'' is produced by the DRC which is a relatively small group of experienced Thai scholars, convening at least once per week and working through the previous edition of the dictionary alphabetically, reviewing it entry by entry and sense by sense, suggesting new senses and entries as the work proceeds. Once the end of the alphabet is reached, a new edition of the ''RID'' is prepared for publication.

== Editions ==

=== 1950 edition ===

[[File:RID 1950.jpg|right|thumb|150px|RID 1950, first printing (1950).]]

The 1950 edition of the ''RID'' was first published in 1950. Although it is the first dictionary published by the RIT, it is a revision of an earlier dictionary published by the Thai government in 1927.

Work commenced on what would become ''RID 1950'' in 1932, when the duty of producing the official governmental dictionary still belonged to the Ministry of Education, then known as the Department of Education (กรมธรรมการ). This task was transferred to the RIT in 1934, although the actual commission carried on as before, both in membership and methodology. From start to finish, the first meeting of the DRC was held on 5 October 1932, and the commission met for the final time before publication on March 8, 1950, having convened a total of 1,299 meetings over the course of over seventeen years. Meetings were held only once weekly until 1942, after which the commission met two days per week. In 1949, as the dictionary neared completion, the commission met three times per week. The original commission consisted of seven members in 1932, and at publication in 1950 had fifteen members. Two of the original seven members, as well as one later member, died before the work of revision was completed.

The ''RID 1950'' remained the standard dictionary of Thai for more than 30 years, with 20 printings totalling 187,000 copies.

=== 1982 edition ===

[[File:RID 1982.jpg|left|thumb|150px|RID 1982, fourth printing (1988).]]

The 1982 edition of the ''RID'' was first published in 1982, in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of [[Bangkok]] as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Thailand by King [[Rama I]].

In 1976, prime minister [[Tanin Kraivixien]] ordered a revision of ''RID 1950'', as part of an increased effort to promote knowledge of the standard language among Thai citizens. His charge included the task of updating the dictionary to include new words that had become standard, particularly terms coined by the RIT that had gained widespread use, as well as to include in this revised dictionary those words which were overlooked or otherwise omitted in the previous edition. The motion to have the RIT finally produce an "unabridged dictionary" was presented by Tanin at the cabinet meeting of 28 December 1976 and was accepted. Work was officially ordered the following day, with the charge to complete the new dictionary within one year.

At the end of the first year, the DRC requested an extension of another year, citing great interest from both other government bodies as well as the general public, so as to be able to process the many requests and suggestions received. After the second year had passed, a seven-month extension was requested and granted, followed by a three-month request, after which the revision was completed. In total, the commission met 280 times, first on 22 February 1977, and finally on 27 December 1979.

The ''RID 1982'' remained the standard dictionary of Thai for more than 20 years, with six printings totalling 280,000 copies.

In 1996, in collaboration with [[Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center|National Electronics and Computer Technology Center]] (NECTEC), the ''RID 1982'' was also produced in a limited edition CD-ROM version to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the reign of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Twelve-thousand discs were made, of which 8,000 were distributed to educational institutions throughout the country, and the remainder were given away to interested persons upon request.

The sixth and final printing of 60,000 copies in 1996 was expected to be sufficient until the completion of ''RID 1999'', but as it proved not to be, and with the supply of the CD-ROM edition similarly exhausted, the RIT decided to meet the demand by creating an internet edition of the ''RID 1982''. It was online from 1996 until 2007, when it was supplanted by an online version of ''RID 1999''.

=== 1999 edition ===

[[File:RID 1999.jpg|right|thumb|150px|RID 1999, first printing (2003).]]

The 1999 edition of the ''RID'' was first published in 2003. It is called the 1999 edition to commemorate the sixth cycle (72nd) birthday anniversary of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in that year.

The ''RID 1999'' had been the standard dictionary of Thai language until 2012. It had been printed just once in a massive run of 200,000 copies.

In mid-2007, the RIT made the ''RID 1999'' available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp|title= Royal Institute Dictionary|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 13 October 2013|website= Web|publisher= [[Royal Institute of Thailand]]|accessdate= |quote= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000030/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp|archivedate= 3 March 2009|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 edition ===

==== Publication ====
On 5 April 5, 2012, RIT secretary general Kanokwalee Chuchaiya announced that the RIT had completed the revision of the 1999 edition, and that [[Yingluck Shinawatra]]'s [[Yingluck cabinet|cabinet]] had endorsed budgets for the publication of the new edition in a massive run of 200,000 copies. The printing of the first 100,000 copies was completed at the end of 2012 and these copies were distributed to government agencies and educational institutions only. The other 100,000 copies were published for sales.&lt;ref name="2011 edition"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/2045_2393.pdf | script-title = th:ราชบัณฑิตยสถานจัดทำพจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๔ เฉลิมพระเกียรติพระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว เนื่องในโอกาสมหามงคลเฉลิมพระชนมพรรษา ๗ รอบ ๕ ธันวาคม ๒๕๕๔ | trans-title = The Royal Institute has completed the Royal Institute Dictionary, BE 2554 (2011), Commemorating His Majesty the King's 7th Cycle Birthday Anniversary, December 5, 2011 | publisher = Royal Institute of Thailand | date = April 5, 2012 | format = pdf | language = Thai | accessdate = October 1, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083410/http://www.royin.go.th/upload/246/FileUpload/2045_2393.pdf | archivedate = April 7, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the revised words, this new edition contains hundreds of new words having been in regular use following the publication of the previous edition, including legal terms, political terms, names of plants, animals, sweets, colloquialisms, and slang.&lt;ref name = "2011 edition"/&gt;

Although the edition was actually released in 2012, it is called the 2011 edition to commemorate King Bhumibol Adulyadej's seventh cycle (84th) birthday anniversary in 2011.&lt;ref name = "2011 edition"/&gt; On 27 May 2013, Yingluck Shinawatra announced repealing the 1999 edition and replacing it with the 2011 edition. The announcement was published in the [[Royal Thai Government Gazette|''Government Gazette'']] on 13 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=th:ประกาศสำนักนายกรัฐมนตรี เรื่อง ระเบียบการใช้ตัวสะกด ลงวันที่ 27 พฤษภาคม 2556 |trans-title=Announcement of the Office of the Prime Minister, Re: Regulation of Spellings, dated 27 May 2013 | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2556/E/071/4.PDF | language = Thai | journal = Government Gazette | issue = volume 130, special issue 71 D | page = 4 | date = July 13, 2013 | accessdate = July 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"Samba Gold"''' (Samba d'Or) is a [[association football|football]] award given to the best [[Brazil]]ian footballer in [[Europe]], as awarded by the Sambafoot Company.

A '''wallflip''' is a [[stunt]] involving a [[Flip (acrobatic)|backflip]] from a wall. This is commonly used in urban [[acrobatics]] displays. A wallflip involves running up to a wall (or other vertical or near-vertical surface) and placing your foot on this surface. You must then push off with enough [[force]] to complete a three-quarter rotation and land back on your feet.

== Variations ==
'''Two-Step Wallflip'''

This is identical to the wallflip. However to perform it one will take an extra step up the wall for a total of two steps. This trick can be done with either foot being used first; however for beginners, the first step will consist of the less dominant foot so when the second step is taken the user will have more force to push off and complete the flip.

'''Three-Step Wallflip'''

Also identical to the wallflip, however consisting of three steps taken up the wall instead of one. Once again this can be performed using any combination of foot placement; however for beginners the more dominant leg will take the first step, followed by the less dominant. This will then allow the dominant leg to take the third and final step, ensuring the completion of the flip.

'''Four-Step Wallflip'''

Just as the name implies, this is a wallflip with four steps. This trick is very uncommon and difficult. It is rarely done outside of the gym although a Four-Step Wallflip on a "real" urban wall is not unheard of. However, less than a dozen tricksters have ever landed it outside of the gym.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

'''Wallflip Twist'''

This stunt starts out similar to the wallflip in the effect that the performer runs up to a vertical surface and places their foot on this surface. It differs, however, because after one places their foot on the vertical surface they must twist their upper body to do a half rotation while also pushing off to do the flip. This will result in the user landing facing away from the wall instead of towards the wall.

'''Wall to wall flip'''

The wall to wall flip uses more than one surface when being performed. This trick will start by running up to one surface then placing either foot on this surface. The user will then jump or run to the second surface (commonly used on a 90 degree angle corner in which case the first surface is one wall and the second surface is the intersecting wall) and push with their opposite foot to complete the rotation. This trick can be done with any combination of steps or directions.

'''Wallflip Full Twist'''

This stunt starts out like a wallflip by the performer running to a wall and placing their foot on the wall. Then it changes and requires the performer to push up and still do a back somersault but also do a 360 degree rotation during the backwards rotation. Once both rotations are complete, the performer lands facing the wall again.

== Troubleshooting ==
The wallflip is an easier and simple trick because it consists of only a three quarter rotation instead of a full rotation. The extra quarter is subtracted because the trick starts from the vertical surface used. To perform this trick correctly one must push both away from the wall and upwards from the wall. The force pushing away from the wall is so that the user does not come into contact with the surface during the trick, such as hitting their head on the surface while they are rotating. The upwards force gives the trick height and will also force rotation to ensure a proper landing.

To overcome the fear of not making the full rotation, a [[Spotting (climbing)|spotter]] or two spotters may be used. They should stand to the side of the user, and when the user is horizontal with their back facing the floor, the spotters may give them extra rotation and height by pushing their back upwards (this is similar to the way in which spotters can be used when learning a backtuck).
