'''ARMZ Uranium Holding Co.''' (AtomRedMetZoloto, a contraction of a Russian phrase meaning "Atom Rare Metals Gold") is a Russian [[uranium mining]] company. It is wholly owned by [[Atomenergoprom]], a part of [[Rosatom]].&lt;ref name=wnn141107&gt;

AtomRedMetZoloto was founded in 1992. In 2008, all uranium mines in Russia as well as uranium mining related assets in other countries owned by Rosatom subsidiaries were brought under ARMZ Uranium Holding Co.

ARMZ Uranium Holding Co. mines uranium in Russia and Kazakhstan. New operations involve Armenia, Namibia and Canada.&lt;ref name=wnn220408/&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn220708&gt;{{cite news

'''Austronesia''', in historical terms, refers to the homeland of the [[Austronesian people|peoples]] who speak [[Austronesian languages]], including [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]-[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Filipino language|Filipino]], the [[Visayan languages]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], the [[Polynesian languages]], [[Fijian language|Fijian]], [[Formosan languages|Taiwan's Formosan languages]], [[Tetum language|Tetum]] and around ten-thousand other languages.

The Austronesian homeland is thought by linguists to have been prehistoric [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Austronesian Homeland: A Linguistic Perspective | last = Blust | first = Robert | journal=Asian Perspectives | year=1985 | volume=26 | pages=46–67 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bellwood, Peter S., (editor.) | author2=Fox, James J., 1940-, (editor.) | author3=Tryon, D.

==Etymology of term==
The name Austronesia comes from the [[Latin]] ''austrālis'' "southern" plus the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''νήσος'' (''nêsos'') "island".

However, in contemporary terminology, the word Austronesia pertains to the regions where [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken. Austronesia then covers almost half of the globe,  mostly ocean and oceanic islands, starting from [[Madagascar]] to the west until [[Easter Island]], to the east.

==Region==
Austronesia as a region has three traditional divisions: [[Taiwan]] (Formosa), the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], and Austronesian [[Oceania]] ([[Micronesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[File:Austronesia Map.jpg|thumb|The region where [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken spans over 200 degrees of longitude from [[Madagascar]] to [[Easter Island]]]]

==Madagascar==
{{Main|Madagascar|Malagasy language}}

==Taiwan==
{{Main|Taiwan|Taiwanese aborigines}}

==Maritime Southeast Asia==
{{See also|East Indies|Maritime Southeast Asia}}

Maritime Southeast Asia covers the modern nations of:

*[[Brunei]]
*[[East Timor]]
*[[Indonesia]]
*[[Malaysia]]
*[[Philippines]]
*[[Singapore]]

And as well: The [[Pattani (region)|Pattani region]] of [[Thailand]], and the [[Cham (Asia)|Chamic]] areas of [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Hainan Island]].

Islands in the vicinity, with native populations having Malay or mixed Malay ancestry, which are not considered part of the Malay Archipelago include [[New Guinea]] and the [[Marianas Islands]].

==South Asia==
{{Main|Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Malays}}

Eastern Sri Lanka, well as parts of the [[Andaman Islands]] inhabited by the [[Orang Laut]].

==Oceania==
{{Main|Oceania}}

===Micronesia===
The term ''Micronesia'' was coined in 1832 by [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] from the Greek roots μικρός ''mikros'' 'small' and νῆσοι ''nēsoi'' 'islands', thus meaning 'small islands'.

Politically, Micronesia is divided among eight territories:
*the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (sometimes referred to simply as "Micronesia", or alternatively abbreviated "FSM");
*the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]];
*the Republic of [[Palau]];
*the Commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]];
*the Republic of [[Nauru]];
*the Republic of [[Kiribati]];
*the Territory of [[Guam]].
*the Territory of [[Wake Island]].

===Melanesia===
The term Melanesia was coined in 1832 by [[ Jules Dumont d'Urville]] from the Greek meaning 'black islands', in reference to the dark skin of the [[Melanesians]].

The following islands and groups of islands are traditionally considered part of Melanesia:
*[[Fiji]]
*[[New Caledonia]]
*[[New Guinea]], politically split between [[Indonesia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]
*[[Solomon Islands]]
*[[Vanuatu]]
*[[Maluku Islands]], politically in [[Indonesia]]
*[[Torres Strait Islands]], politically in [[Australia]]

Other islands with populations of mixed Melanesian ancestry but are not part of the traditional Melanesian area include:
*[[Nauru]]
*[[Timor]], politically split between Indonesia and [[East Timor]]
*[[Maluku Utara]], politically in Indonesia
*[[Flores]], politically in Indonesia
*[[Sumba]], politically in Indonesia

===Polynesia===
The term Polynesia was coined in 1756 by [[Charles de Brosses]] from the Greek meaning "many islands", describing the multiplicity of the islands in this area of the Pacific.

Countries and territories traditionally included in Polynesia include:
*[[American Samoa]] (overseas United States territory)
*[[Cook Islands]] (self-governing former territory of New Zealand)
*[[Easter Island]] (part of Chile, called Rapa Nui in the [[Rapa Nui language]])
*[[Fiji]] ([[Lau Islands]])
*[[French Polynesia]] ("overseas nation", a territory of France)
*[[Hawai‘i]] (a state of the United States)
*[[Loyalty Islands]] (a dependency of the French territory of New Caledonia)
*[[New Zealand]] (called Aotearoa in Māori)
*[[Niue]] (a self-governing dependency of New Zealand)
*[[Rotuma]] (an island in the extreme north of Fiji)
*[[Samoa]] (independent nation)
*[[Swains Island]] (politically part of American Samoa)
*[[Tokelau]] (overseas dependency of New Zealand)
*[[Tonga]] (independent nation)
*[[Tuvalu]] (independent nation)
*[[Wallis and Futuna]] (overseas territory of France)

In addition to these islands in this mid-Pacific Ocean, Polynesia often is meant to include the [[Polynesian outliers]]: islands that are culturally or linguistically Polynesian, but that are geographically in Melanesia or Micronesia. Most of these are small or isolated islands, like [[Rennell Island|Rennell]] or [[Tikopia]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].

'''''Biùtiful cauntri''''' is a 2007 Italian documentary film about illegal [[toxic waste]] dumping in [[Southern Italy]]. It was directed by Esmeralda Calabria and Andrea D'Ambrosio and written by Calabria, D'Ambrosio and Peppe Ruggiero. It focuses on the progressive poisoning of thousands of square miles of Southern Italian agricultural land and the deadly effects upon people, animals, and plant life in the areas of [[Caserta]] and [[Naples]], and behind that the interwoven relations between the Italian government, corrupt pseudo-legitimate businessmen, and the Italian organized crime group, the [[Camorra]]. The title is literally the Italian pronunciation of "beautiful country". A secondary focus of the film is governmental inaction, in some cases lasting over a decade and a half, despite the pleas of the people affected.

==Release and book==
It was premiered in November 2007 at the [[Torino Film Festival]], where it received a special mention. It was then released in ten Italian movie theaters in March 2008. On 15 July 2008 the film was released in France, where it received a positive review from [[Le Monde]]. The film was released on DVD along with a 90-page book published under the Senza Filtro imprint of Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli.

==Awards==
*2008 [[Nastro d'Argento]] "Best Documentary"
*2008 Italian Golden Globes "Best documentary"
*2009 [[Giancarlo Siani]] Prize - First Prize "Ex Aequo" for Audiovisual Media (16 October 2009)

A '''blaster''' is a fictional [[gun]] that appears in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars universe|universe]]. [[Lucasfilm]] defines the blaster as "ranged energized particle weaponry". Many blasters mirror the appearance, functions, components, operation, and usage of real life firearms. They are also said to be able to be modified with certain add-ons and attachments, with Han Solo's blaster being said to be illegally modified to provide greater damage without increasing power consumption.

The design of the traditional [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] blaster is based on the real-life [[Sterling sub-machine gun]] used by the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces of the United Kingdom]] over the second half of the 20th century, with changes made by the filmmakers such as alterations to the [[Magazine (ammo)|magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originalprop.com/blog/movie-guns/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope/|title=Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|work=Movie Prop Collecting with Jason DeBord's Original Prop Blog Film &amp; TV Prop, Costume, Hollywood Memorablia Pop Culture Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design in films==

In the films, the design of the blaster rifle was based on the [[Sterling submachine gun]]. The design of the blaster pistol owned by the fictional character [[Han Solo]] was based on the [[Mauser C96|7.63-caliber Mauser C96]], an early and successful automatic pistol that was used in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Lucasfilm's prop department added a scope and an emitter nozzle to the pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Henderson | first=Mary | year=1997 | title=Star Wars: The Magic of Myth | publisher=Spectra | pages=167, 170 | isbn=978-0-553-37810-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blaster made for the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' was lost, and a second blaster was made with resin from the cast used for the first one. The blaster was subsequently used as a prop in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Child | first=Ben | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/02/star-wars-harrison-ford-weapon-auction | title=Star Wars: Han Solo's blaster to sell at auction | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional Sterlings firing blank cartridges were used in some scenes with the laser bolt added later in [[post-production]]. These blank cartridges are responsible for the muzzle flash seen on screen and, in some scenes, the cartridges themselves can be seen being ejected from the guns, or the actual sound of the blank cartridge is not dubbed over by a sound effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originalprop.com/blog/?page_id=8524|title=Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|work=Movie Prop Collecting with Jason DeBord's Original Prop Blog Film &amp; TV Prop, Costume, Hollywood Memorablia Pop Culture Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Burtt]], a [[sound designer]] who worked on the ''Star Wars'' films, came up with the sound of blaster fire during a family backpacking trip in the [[Pocono Mountains]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rinzler | first=J. W. | year=2010 | title=The Sounds of Star Wars | publisher=Chronicle Books | page=54 | isbn=978-0-8118-7546-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burtt hit the [[guy-wire]] of an [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] transmitter tower with a hammer and recorded the sound with a microphone close to the impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Whittington | first=William | year=2007 | title=Sound Design and Science Fiction | publisher=University of Texas Press | page= | isbn=978-0-292-71431-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a chapter of the book ''Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars'', Michael Kaminski, writing about the influence of Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]] on the ''Star Wars'' films, said that Kurosawa's ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' influenced the exchange of blaster fire. Like in ''Ran'', color-coding and an "onscreen sense of direction" of blaster fire are used to depict opposing forces. In the ''Star Wars'' original trilogy, rebels employed red blaster fire and often attacked from the left, while the Empire employed green blaster fire and attacked from the right. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', the second film of the prequel trilogy, the color and the direction were reversed. In that film, the Republic employed green and blue blaster fire and attacked from the right, while the Separatists employed red blaster fire and attacked from the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kaminski | first=Michael | chapter=Under the Influence of Akira Kurosawa: The Visual Style of George Lucas | year=2012 | editor1-last=Brode | editor1-first=Michael | editor2-last=Deyneka | editor2-first=Leah | title=Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars: An Anthology | publisher=Scarecrow Press | page=97 | isbn=978-0-8108-8512-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In-universe technology ==
The inner workings of blasters essentially create particle beams to inflict damage. When the trigger is pulled, the blaster chambers a small volume of the fictional Tibanna gas into a ''gas conversion enabler'' (or XCiter). The XCiter excites the gas particles with energy from a power-pack, which attaches to the weapon much like a magazine does to real world weapons. Afterwards, the excited gas is compressed into a beam in the actuating blaster module before being focused by first a prismatic crystal and then the galven circuitry in the barrel of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology|last=Smith|first=Bill|publisher=Boxtree|year=1998|isbn=0 7522 2338 0|location=London|pages=4, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
One prop of Han Solo's blaster was expected to sell at auction for US $200,000-300,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/12/han-solo-blaster-auction/|title=Here's Your Chance to Own Han Solo's Blaster – For $300K|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another for $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/hokey-religion-is-no-match-for-this-authentic-han-solo-1825623256|title=Hokey Religion is No Match For This Authentic Han Solo Blaster Auction, Kid|first=Julie|last=Muncy|date=April 28, 2018|work=[[io9]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13392">In [[fluid mechanics]] and [[mathematics]], a '''capillary surface''' is a [[interface (matter)|surface]] that represents the interface between two different [[fluid]]s. As a consequence of being a surface, a capillary surface has no thickness in slight contrast with most real fluid interfaces.

Capillary surfaces are of interest in mathematics because the problems involved are very nonlinear and have interesting properties, such as discontinuous dependence on boundary data at isolated points.&lt;ref name="Finn"&gt;{{cite paper

They are also of practical interest for fluid management in space (or other environments free of [[body force]]s), where both flow and static configuration are often dominated by capillary effects.

==The stress balance equation==
The defining equation for a capillary surface is called the stress balance equation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/1.63/www/Lec-notes/Surfacetension/ Surface Tension Module], by John W. M. Bush, at [[MIT OCW]]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be derived by considering the forces and stresses acting on a small volume that is partly bounded by a capillary surface. For a fluid meeting another fluid (the "other" fluid notated with bars) at a surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the equation reads

:&lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{ij} - \bar{\sigma}_{ij}) \mathbf{\hat{n}} = - \gamma \mathbf{\hat{n}} (\nabla_{\!S} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}) + \nabla_{\!S} \gamma \qquad ; \quad \nabla_{\!S} \gamma = \nabla \gamma - \mathbf{\hat{n}} (\mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \nabla \gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit [[Surface normal|normal]] pointing toward the "other" fluid (the one whose quantities are notated with bars), &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations#The stress tensor|stress tensor]] (note that on the left is a tensor-vector [[tensor product|product]]), &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface tension]] associated with the interface, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \nabla_S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface gradient]]. Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\nabla_{\!S} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is twice the [[mean curvature]] of the surface.

In [[fluid mechanics]], this equation serves as a [[boundary condition]] for interfacial flows, typically complementing the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. It describes the discontinuity in [[stress (physics)|stress]] that is balanced by forces at the surface. As a boundary condition, it is somewhat unusual in that it introduces a new variable: the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that defines the interface. It's not too surprising then that the stress balance equation normally mandates its own boundary conditions.

For best use, this vector equation is normally turned into 3 scalar equations via dot product with the unit normal and two selected unit tangents:

:&lt;math&gt;((\sigma_{ij} - \bar{\sigma}_{ij}) \mathbf{\hat{n}}) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} = -\gamma \nabla_{\!S} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;((\sigma_{ij} - \bar{\sigma}_{ij}) \mathbf{\hat{n}}) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{t}_1} = \nabla_{\!S} \gamma \cdot \mathbf{\hat{t}_1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;((\sigma_{ij} - \bar{\sigma}_{ij}) \mathbf{\hat{n}}) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{t}_2} = \nabla_{\!S} \gamma \cdot \mathbf{\hat{t}_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the products lacking dots are [[tensor product]]s of tensors with vectors (resulting in vectors similar to a matrix-vector product), those with dots are [[dot product]]s. The first equation is called the '''normal stress equation''', or the normal stress boundary condition. The second two equations are called '''tangential stress equations'''.

===The stress tensor===

The stress tensor is related to [[velocity]] and pressure. Its actual form will depend on the specific fluid being dealt with, for the common case of incompressible Newtonian flow the stress tensor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

\sigma_{ij} &amp;= 
-\begin{pmatrix}
p&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;p&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;p
\end{pmatrix} +

\mu \begin{pmatrix}
2 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} &amp; 2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \\
\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} &amp; \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} &amp; 2\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}
\end{pmatrix} \\

&amp;= -p I + \mu (\nabla \mathbf{v} + (\nabla \mathbf{v})^T)

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] in the fluid, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[viscosity]].

==Static interfaces==

In the absence of motion, the stress tensors yield only [[hydrostatic pressure]] so that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma_{ij} = -pI&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of fluid type or compressibility. Considering the normal and tangential equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\bar p - p = \gamma \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \nabla \gamma \cdot \mathbf{\hat{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation establishes that curvature forces are balanced by pressure forces. The second equation implies that a static interface cannot exist in the presence of nonzero surface tension gradient.

If gravity is the only [[body force]] present, the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] simplify significantly:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\nabla p + \rho \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

If coordinates are chosen so that gravity is nonzero only in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction, this equation degrades to a particularly simple form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d p}{d z} = \rho g \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \rho g z + p_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is an integration constant that represents some reference pressure at &lt;math&gt;z = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this into the normal stress equation yields what is known as the [[Young-Laplace equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar \rho g z + \bar p_0 - (\rho g z + p_0) = \gamma \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta \rho g z + \Delta p = \gamma \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; is the (constant) pressure difference across the interface, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in [[density]]. Note that, since this equation defines a surface, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of the capillary surface. This [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equation]] when supplied with the right boundary conditions will define the static interface.

The pressure difference above is a constant, but its value will change if the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is shifted. The linear solution to pressure implies that, '''unless the gravity term is absent''', it is always possible to define the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate so that &lt;math&gt;\Delta p = 0&lt;/math&gt;. [[Scale analysis (mathematics)|Nondimensionalized]], the Young-Laplace equation is usually studied in the form &lt;ref name="Finn"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa z + \lambda = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

where (if gravity is in the negative &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction) &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is positive if the denser fluid is "inside" the interface, negative if it is "outside", and zero if there is no gravity or if there is no difference in density between the fluids.

This [[nonlinear]] equation has some rich properties, especially in terms of existence of unique solutions. For example, the nonexistence of solution to some [[boundary value problem]] implies that, physically, the problem can't be static. If a solution does exist, normally it'll exist for very specific values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which is representative of the pressure jump across the interface. This is interesting because there isn't another physical equation to determine the pressure difference. In a capillary tube, for example, implementing the contact angle boundary condition will yield a unique solution for exactly one value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Solutions often aren't unique, this implies that there are multiple static interfaces possible; while they may all solve the same boundary value problem, the minimization of energy will normally favor one. Different solutions are called ''configurations'' of the interface.

===Energy consideration===

A deep property of capillary surfaces is the [[surface energy]] that is imparted by surface tension:

:&lt;math&gt;E_S = \gamma_S A_S\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the surface being considered, and the total [[energy]] is the summation of all energies. Note that ''every'' interface imparts energy. For example, if there are two different fluids (say liquid and gas) inside a solid container with gravity and other energy potentials absent, the energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum \gamma_S A_S = \gamma_{LG} A_{LG} + \gamma_{SG} A_{SG} + \gamma_{SL} A_{SL}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts &lt;math&gt;LG&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;SG&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;SL&lt;/math&gt; respectively indicate the liquid–gas, solid–gas, and solid–liquid interfaces. Note that inclusion of gravity would require consideration of the volume enclosed by the capillary surface and the solid walls.

[[Image:ForcesAtContactLine.png|frame|right|400px|Illustration of distributed forces at the contact line, with the contact line perpendicular to the image. The vertical part of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LG}&lt;/math&gt; is balanced by a slight deformation of the solid (not shown and inconsequential to this context).]]

Typically the surface tension values between the solid–gas and solid–liquid interfaces are not known. This does not pose a problem; since only changes in energy are of primary interest. If the net solid area &lt;math&gt;A_{SG} + A_{SL}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and the [[contact angle]] is known, it may be shown that (again, for two different fluids in a solid container)

:&lt;math&gt;E = \gamma_{SL}(A_{SL} + A_{SG}) + \gamma_{LG} A_{LG} + \gamma_{LG} A_{SG} \cos(\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E}{\gamma_{LG}} = \Delta A_{LG} + \Delta A_{SG} \cos(\theta) = \Delta A_{LG} - \Delta A_{SL} \cos(\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[contact angle]] and the capital delta indicates the change from one configuration to another. To obtain this result, it's necessary to sum (distributed) forces at the contact line (where solid, gas, and liquid meet) in a direction tangent to the solid interface and perpendicular to the contact line:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp;= \sum F_{\mathrm{Contact \ line}} \\
  &amp;= \gamma_{LG} \cos(\theta) + \gamma_{SL} - \gamma_{SG}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is zero because of the [[Statics|static]] state. When solutions to the Young-Laplace equation aren't unique, the most physically favorable solution is the one of minimum energy, though experiments (especially low gravity) show that [[metastable]] surfaces can be surprisingly persistent, and that the most stable configuration can become metastable through mechanical jarring without too much difficulty. On the other hand, a metastable surface can sometimes spontaneously achieve lower energy without any input (seemingly at least) given enough time.

==Boundary conditions==
Boundary conditions for stress balance describe the capillary surface at the '''contact line''': the line where a solid meets the capillary interface; also, volume constraints can serve as boundary conditions (a suspended drop, for example, has no contact line but clearly must admit a unique solution).

For static surfaces, the most common contact line boundary condition is the implementation of the [[contact angle]], which specifies the angle that one of the fluids meets the solid wall. The contact angle condition on the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is normally written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}} = \cos(\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the contact angle. This condition is imposed on the boundary (or boundaries) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \partial S&lt;/math&gt; of the surface. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat v&lt;/math&gt; is the unit outward normal to the solid surface, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat n&lt;/math&gt; is a unit normal to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Choice of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat n&lt;/math&gt; depends on which fluid the contact angle is specified for.

For dynamic interfaces, the boundary condition showed above works well if the contact line velocity is low. If the velocity is high, the contact angle will change ("dynamic contact angle"), and as of 2007 the mechanics of the moving contact line (or even the validity of the contact angle as a parameter) is not known and an area of active research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

The '''Clean Energy Ministerial''' (CEM) are global forums held to promote policies and to share best practices with the aim of accelerating a transition to [[clean energy]]. The forums have included partnerships and collaboration between the [[private sector]], [[public sector]]. [[non-governmental organization]]s, and others. The forum typically incorporated two interrelated features: 1) an annual high-level policy [[dialogue]] with energy ministers and other top global stakeholders; and 2) year-round [[policy]]-targeted technical initiatives and high-visibility campaigns. The CEM is currently the only regular meeting of energy [[Minister (government)|minister]]s focused exclusively on clean energy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Barack Obama|President Obama]] announced in a video message at the sixth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM6) in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida, Mexico]] that the United States would host the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7) in 2016. At [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]] in Paris in December, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary [[Ernest Moniz]] and California Governor [[Jerry Brown|Edmund G. Brown]] Jr. announced CEM7 would be hosted in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. CEM7 is a high-level meeting of energy ministers coming together to discuss and implement actions of respective climate and clean energy goals put forward at [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21.]] CEM7 includes a public-private action day with opportunities for governments, companies, and other key stakeholders to highlight ambitious clean energy efforts and announce new actions to help achieve national and global clean energy and climate goals.

Through the CEM, 23 countries and the [[European Commission]] collaborate on efforts to improve energy efficiency, enhance clean energy supply, and expand clean energy access.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the CEM ==

At the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention]] on Climate Change conference in [[Copenhagen]] in December 2009, U.S. Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]] announced that he would host the first Clean Energy Ministerial to bring together ministers with responsibility for clean energy technologies from the world’s major economies and ministers from a select number of smaller countries that are leading in various areas of clean energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| website = www.cleanenergyministerial.org
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework of the CEM ==

Members of the Clean Energy Ministerial (as of 2016) represent about 90% of global clean energy investment and 75% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing countries hold 50% of capacity for building out clean energy, but more than 70% of growth in clean energy investment since 2000 has been in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;  Global investment in clean energy reached $260 billion in 2011; however, the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) estimated that $5 trillion is needed by 2020 to avoid a dangerous rise in greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;  The CEM’s low-cost, high-impact year-round initiatives deliver tangible results and enable proven policies, programs, and technologies to realize broader, faster, and lower-cost diffusion and replication among CEM and non-CEM countries. The CEM initiatives are focused on improving energy efficiency worldwide, enhancing clean energy supply, and expanding clean energy access. While CEM initiatives are led by CEM members, participation in initiatives is open to any country.

=== Current Activities ===
As of 2016, the CEM has 10 active initiatives, described below:
* The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) works to accelerate the global scale-up of electric drive vehicles (EVs).
* The Energy Management Working Group (EMWG) seeks to improve energy efficiency in the industrial and commercial sectors worldwide by accelerating broad use of energy management systems.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* The Super-Efficient Equipment and Appliance Deployment (SEAD) initiative promotes energy-efficient appliances and equipment.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;
* The Multilateral Solar and Wind Working Group (MSWWG) works to lower the costs of solar and wind energy in regions around the world.
* The 21st Century Power Partnership (21CPP) works to transform the electricity sector through integrated policy, regulatory, and technical solutions for large-scale deployment of smart grids, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* The Global Lighting and Energy Access Partnership (Global LEAP) works to facilitate access to affordable, clean, and quality-assured off-grid energy solutions.
* The Global Sustainable Cities Network (GSCN) provides a platform for sustainable city initiatives throughout the world.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* The International Smart Grid Action Network (ISGAN) works to accelerate the development and deployment of smarter electricity grids worldwide.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;
* The Clean Energy Education and Empowerment (C3E) initiative strives to close the gender gap and help advance women’s careers and leadership in clean energy.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;
* The [[Clean Energy Solutions Center]] is a first-stop resource for clean energy policy, best practices, data, analysis tools, and expert assistance.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; During the 2015 ministerial meeting, a decision was made to expand this initiative and add a finance-based component, the Clean Energy Finance Solutions Center.
Past initiatives include the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and Efficient District Heating and Cooling (DHC) Working Group, the Cool Roofs and Pavements Working Group, the Sectoral Working Group, the Bioenergy Working Group, Carbon Capture Use and Storage, and Sustainable Development of Hydropower.[1]

== Past Ministerial Meetings ==

=== 2017 Eighth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM8) ===

China hosted the eighth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM8) in Beijing on 6–8 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Energy Ministerial CEM8|url=http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/events-cem/clean-energy-ministerial-8-cem8|website=Clean Energy Ministerial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual meeting of energy ministers and other high-level delegates from the 24 member countries and the European Union provided an opportunity to leverage high-level political will and private sector leadership to drive ambitious, real-world clean energy policies and actions.

Delegates participated in a series of roundtable discussions which identified barriers and proposed solutions for a range of action areas. They included:

* Digitalisation of the Energy Sector to Enhance Energy Productivity &amp; Renewables Integration
* Optimising the Impact of Our Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policies
* Electric Vehicle Deployment Policies for the Next Decade: From the Second Million to Mass Market Adoption
* Leveraging City-Scale Building Efficiency Action

The CEM8 Summary Report identifies the group's findings and recommendations in each of the above areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEM8 Roundtable Summary Report|url=http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/CEM8_RT_Summary_Report.pdf|website=Clean Energy Ministerial|publisher=Clean Energy Ministerial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 Seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7) ===
The United States hosted the CEM7 in San Francisco, California, on June 1–2, 2016, under the leadership of then-U.S. Secretary of Energy [[Ernest Moniz]] and California Governor [[Edmund G. Brown Jr.|Edmund G. Brown Jr]].

The announcement at the COP was followed by a discussion among other CEM ministers on the role of the CEM post [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]] as a key implementation forum to help countries deliver on their respective national clean energy goals and build capacity to increase ambition even further over time. That discussion included [[Ali Ibrahim Al-Naimi,]] Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, [[Ibrahim Baylan]], Sweden’s Minister of Energy, [[Amber Rudd]], [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom’s]] Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and [[Lars Christian Lilleholt]], Denmark’s Minister of Energy, Utilities and Climate.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the city and state’s role in advancing clean energy policies along with the concentration of clean technology companies, research and development, and the business community in the region were key deciding factors. [[San Francisco]] and the broader Bay Area, which encompasses Silicon Valley, is known as a global hub of the clean energy industry and is home to some of the most innovative technology companies that are playing a crucial role in advancing clean energy globally.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; [[California]] recently signed into law climate and clean energy legislation that sets aggressive targets for the share of the state’s electricity from renewable sources and for energy efficiency savings in buildings.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

"I can think of no better place than California to play host to the world's clean energy leaders," said [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEM7 is expected to include global energy leaders such as China’s Minister of Science and Technology [[Wan Gang]], European Commissioner for Climate and Energy [[Miguel Arias Cañete]], and India’s Minister of Power, Coal &amp; New &amp; Renewable Energy [[Piyush Goyal]].&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Leaders from the business and investment community working in clean energy are also expected to participate as well as leaders from international energy organizations, foundations, research institutes, and academia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

The first Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM1) was hosted by the [[United States]] in 2010. The [[United Arab Emirates]] hosted the second Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM2) in 2011. The [[United Kingdom]] hosted the third Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM3) in 2012. [[India]] hosted the fourth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM4) in 2013. [[South Korea]] hosted the fifth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM5) in 2014. [[Mexico]] hosted the sixth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM6) in 2015.&lt;ref name="cleanenergyministerial.org"&gt;{{Cite web

=== 2018 Ninth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM9) ===

The 9th Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM9) and the 3rd Mission Innovation Ministerial (MI-3) was co-hosted by the European Commission together with Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Nordic Council of Ministers and take place back-to-back in the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö respectively, on May 22–24, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9th Clean Energy Ministerial and 3rd Mission Innovation Ministerial|url=https://www.cem9-mi3.eu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall theme is "Energy Integration and Transition: towards a competitive and innovative low carbon economy."

In addition to a number of official side events in connection with the two ministerial meetings, activities took place concurrently in and around Copenhagen and Malmö under the umbrella “Nordic Clean Energy Week”, on May 21 – 24, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic Clean Energy Week|url=https://nordiccleanenergyweek.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordic Clean Energy Week is co-hosted by Sweden and Denmark. During this week, politicians, researchers, business and industry gathered to discuss future energy solutions.

== Future Ministerial Meetings ==

=== 2019 Tenth Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM10) ===

Vancouver, Canada will host CEM10, the 10th Clean Energy Ministerial and MI-4, the 4the Mission Innovation Ministerial, in May 2019.

'''Coliban Water''' is a regional [[water]] corporation in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], established on 1 July 1992. 

The service area includes 55 towns, of which the Greater City of [[Bendigo]] is the largest and also location of the head office.

The region serviced by Coliban Water extends from [[Cohuna]] and [[Echuca]] in the north to [[Kyneton]] and [[Trentham, Victoria|Trentham]] in the south. The western boundary incorporates [[Boort]], [[Wedderburn, Victoria|Wedderburn]], [[Bealiba]] and [[Dunolly]], with [[Heathcote, Victoria|Heathcote]] and [[Tooborac]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coliban.com.au/about/ Coliban Water -About Coliban Water&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302201803/http://www.coliban.com.au/about/ |date=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coliban Water manages, maintains and operates more than 50 reservoirs and water storage basins across North-Central Victoria.

==History==
[[Edward Nucella Emmett]] worked to establish a reliable water supply for Bendigo, he was the main promoter of Bendigo Waterworks Company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/re-member/bioregfull.cfm?mid=355 Parliament of Victoria, former members Emmett, Edward Nucella]&lt;/ref&gt; a precursor of Coliban Water. Given the financial problems of the Victorian colonial government and the lack of local government funds he worked to privately fund a new water supply. The Sandhurst Municipal Council controlled a 22-acre ‘Water Reserve’ site along the Bendigo Creek at [[Golden Square, Victoria|Golden Square]]. With funding from wealthy investors in Melbourne he formed the company that was incorporated through parliament. Joseph Brady was the first engineer for the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coliban.com.au/about/history.asp History: "Water for Gold! - The fight to quench Central Victoria's Goldfields", Coliban Water, See slides 20-25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410135727/http://www.coliban.com.au/about/history.asp |date=2013-04-10 }} retrieved 18 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compact Wind Acceleration Turbines (CWATs)''' are a class of [[wind turbine]] that uses structures to accelerate wind before it enters the wind-generating element.&lt;ref&gt;DeRosa, Ronald; "New company wants to harness area's wind power": ''Register Citizen'', August 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of these structures has been around for decades&lt;ref&gt;Leibowitz, Barry; Duffy, Robert, “Verification Analysis of the Toroidal Accelerator Rotor Platform Wind Energy Conversion System”, prepared for New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, September 1988&lt;/ref&gt; but has not gained wide acceptance in the marketplace.  In 2008, two companies targeting the mid-wind (100&amp;nbsp;kW-1 MW) marketplace have received funding from [[venture capital]].  The first company to receive funding is Optiwind, which received its series A funding in April 2008, and the second company is Ogin, Inc. (formerly FloDesign Wind Turbine Inc.), which also received its series A funding in April 2008.  Optiwind&lt;ref&gt;http://www.optiwind.com&lt;/ref&gt; is funded through [[Charles River Ventures]] and FloDesign is funded through [[Kleiner Perkins]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, George; "FloDesign Has Innovation Down to a Science"; ''Business West'', April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other CWATs under development include the WindTamer from AristaPower, WindCube, Innowind (conceptual offshore application) and Enflo turbines.

==History==
CWATs are a new acronym that encompasses the class of machines formerly known as DAWTs (diffuser augmented wind turbines).  The technologies mentioned above all use diffuser augmentation that is substantially similar to previous designs as the primary means of acceleration. 
DAWTs were heavily researched by K. Foreman and Oman of [[Grumman Aerospace]] in the 1970s and 1980s and Igra in [[Israel]] in the 1970s.  At the end of a decade of [[wind tunnel]] research and design funded by Grumman, [[NASA]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]], it was determined that the DAWT system's economics were not sufficient to justify commercialization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In the 1990s the Grumman technology was licensed to a [[New Zealand]] company, Vortec Wind. The attempt to commercialize the Vortec 7 in New Zealand from 1998 to 2002 proved it to be economically untenable when compared to the dominant HAWT (horizontal axis wind turbine) technology.

==Economics==
Ultimately, any wind turbine design must be measured against economic realities.  It must positively answer the question, "is the cost to install and operate the system lower than the cost of other alternatives, including the local electric grid?"  Historically, CWAT/DAWT designs have failed to overcome this hurdle as compared to more conventional HAWT designs. However, there is reason to believe that this equation may be shifting towards these new designs. The two primary drivers of this equation have been the amount of augmentation and the structural implications of these additional design elements.

===Augmentation===
The first factor regards power increase and the method of comparison used by DAWT (and more recently CWAT) designers to determine whether the system is worth developing. Grumman and other attempts to commercialize these machines compare their machines to HAWTs based on a rotor area to rotor area comparison. As Van Bussel of Delft (The Science of Making More Torque from Wind: Diffuser Experiments and Theory Revisited, G.J.W. van Bussel, Delft, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A2f19000e-f2b5-468e-8d10-5e338e1be888/&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out, this is an inaccurate comparison and the comparison of power multiples should be made on the basis of the exit area of the diffuser or shroud not the rotor area. Grumman claimed a 4× increase over an unshrouded turbine based on an acceleration of 1.6 times the ambient wind velocity (An Investigation on Diffuser Augmented Turbines, D.G. Philips, 2003 (reference materials compiled from K.M. Foreman)). A 1.6 acceleration is in fact 2.6 times the power of a HAWT if the ratio of the shrouded rotor to the exit area is 1.6. If however the rotor to exit area ratio is 2.75 (as it was in the Grumman case), the actual power increase over a HAWT with the same swept area as the diffuser exit area is only 1.4× the power (a Cp of .34 related to the exit area, slightly better than a small unducted wind turbine and significantly worse than utility scale wind turbine Cp's). Given that the DAWTs with this ratio have roughly a solidity of 60+% when the blades and the diffuser are accounted for and the solidity of the HAWT is roughly 10%, the cost and amount of material needed to produce the 40% gain outweighs the increase in power.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Structural Implications===
Second is the structural requirement in terms of resisting overturning and bending in extreme wind events which all wind turbines must be designed for in accordance with the IEC 61400 series of standards [[International Electrotechnical Commission|(IEC)]] . The DAWT structure typically has poor drag characteristics (see D.G. Philips). That combined with higher solidity can lead to substantially greater structural costs than a HAWT in the support structure, the yaw bearing, and the foundation, when using conventional monopole designs.  However, the advent of new tower designs, flange geometries and foundation systems appear to be successfully challenging these historical norms but if so then these advances can be equally well applied to improving the economics of conventional HAWT designs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Optiwind==
In the case of Optiwind (now defunct), there appears to be a growing body of evidence that they believe have solved for both the acceleration and economic challenges posed by CWAT/DAWT designs.  Where previous attempts at new designs in this category have focused purely on acceleration magnitude, Optiwind appears to have taken a more holistic approach to their design, considering cost as much as acceleration benefit.  In addition, the ongoing operational and maintenance cost of the entire unit appears to be successfully addressed in this design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  It is absent the significant cost drivers of HAWT systems - large composite blades, gearbox, yaw motor, pitch control, lubrication, etc. In addition, the novel foundation geometry appears to have mitigated the structural challenges of the conventional monopole foundation design{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}, which was originally conceived to offset the counter-rotational effects ("wobbling") of large, three blade turbines.  As such, it is reasonable to assume that Optiwind's holistic approach to systemwide costs have led to a series of designs and discoveries that can realistically deliver the economic advantages of accelerated wind at a cost that is less than the net system cost.  This is accurate if the Optiwind system is compared to a HAWT purely on rating.  The problem therein is, if one compares the Optiwind design based on its stack height (the distance from its lowest turbine to the highest turbine) to a traditional HAWT of the same diameter, the overall power output of the machine is 20% less than that of the HAWT, with all the attendant material and structural expenses generally associated with a CWAT/DAWT.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  On average a CWAT/DAWT system would need to produce at least 2-3 times the energy a HAWT could produce from the maximum area used by the CWAT/DAWT in order to offset the substantially larger material costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  There is no evidence yet that there are any DAWT/CWAT designs capable of this level of increase when compared on an apples to apples basis with HAWT's.

==Ogin (formerly FloDesign Wind Turbine)==
Ogin's MEWT (mixer-ejector wind turbine, another CWAT variation) is differentiated from previous DAWT's by using a lobed two stage diffuser (Grumman and Vortec machine were also two stage, but conical instead of lobed) to equalize the pressure over the exit area of the diffuser. The theory is that creating a uniform pressure distribution with the lobes and the injection of external flow will prevent boundary layer separation in the diffuser thereby allowing the maximum acceleration through rotor. Werle and Presz's (Flodesign's chief scientists) paper, AAIA technical note Ducted Water/Wind turbines revisited - 2007, details the theory behind their design. Maximum acceleration detailed in their paper is 1.8× the ambient velocity from which they derive that 3 times more power is available at the rotor than for an unshrouded turbine. When referred to exit area this multiple drops to parity with the HAWT power. Ogin's turbine based on released images and CAD's appears to be substantially similar to the Vortec and Grumman machines except for the lobed inner annulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wind-works.org/cms/index.php?id=117 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140627151427/http://www.wind-works.org/cms/index.php?id=117 |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would indicate that its drag characteristics can be expected to be similar.  Newer information on the Ogin website (www.oginenergy.com) shows the lobes flattened out into 2D panels. A number of Ogin wind turbines have been taken down after less than six months, for undisclosed reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wind-works.org/cms/index.php?id=668&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4333&amp;cHash=c9d39ea82cd0aa0d9733357f5df6c93e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
The science of wind acceleration around a structure, as well as the vortex shedding benefits of a shroud/diffuser, are well understood and tested.  From Bernoulli forward, science has substantially vetted these concepts and there is general academic consensus as to their veracity and their potential impact on wind power production.  DAWT's however have the classic boundary layer separation problem experienced by airfoils at a "stall" angle of attack.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  This significantly reduces the acceleration achievable by a DAWT relative to the theoretical rate indicated by its exit to area ratio, per Flodesign paper mentioned above.  It is generally thought that since the amount of power produced by a wind turbine is proportional to the cube of the wind speed, any acceleration benefit is potentially statistically significant in the economics of wind.  As noted though this is an inaccurate as it ignores the impact of the exit to area ratio and is therefore an apples to oranges comparison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  In the case of a typical CWAT/DAWT the power result in perfect theoretical operation once adjusted for the area of the shroud is actually the square of the velocity at the rotor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} As the CWAT/DAWT diverges from theoretical function the power increase drops significantly according to the formula derived from mass conservation,

Power ratio &lt;sub&gt;DAWT to HAWT&lt;/sub&gt; = (A&lt;sub&gt;throat&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;intake&lt;/sub&gt;)(v&lt;sub&gt;throat&lt;/sub&gt;/v&lt;sub&gt;freestream&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Power ratio &lt;sub&gt;DAWT to HAWT&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2.75)(27.5&amp;nbsp;ms/10&amp;nbsp;ms)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 7.56 increase

So for example, a DAWT operating at theoretical function of 1.8 with a 2.75 area ratio per Flodesign,

Power ratio &lt;sub&gt;DAWT to HAWT&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2.75)(18&amp;nbsp;ms/10&amp;nbsp;ms)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.12 increase

For the highest claimed velocity increase in a DAWT of 1.6 × freestream,

Power ratio &lt;sub&gt;DAWT to HAWT&lt;/sub&gt; = (1/2.75)(16&amp;nbsp;ms/10&amp;nbsp;ms)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.48 increase

Not significant enough to offset the associated costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  The problem with optiwind is even more severe since the system only covers a fraction of the swept area available to a HAWT of the stack height.

The challenge has always been, and remains, installing, operating, and maintaining these structures for a cost that is less than the incremental value gained by their presence.  Recent developments in material science, installation methodology and overall system integration have led to the far more realistic view that we are very close to this advent and the dawn of a new, highly sustainable class of wind turbine if the issues elucidated above can be dealt with which still remains highly questionable{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} for the DAWT geometry.

Among the recent DAWT designs that appear to have a definitive positive power, if not cost, comparison to HAWTs is the Enflo turbine. Based on its rotor:exit ratio and the published power performance this turbine appears to have a confirmed 2 times increase in power output over a HAWT of the diameter of the exit area. It is still unlikely that this machine can scale to larger ratings but based on their published data (not confirmed by third party testing) the Enflo appears to be the best performing DAWT/CWAT yet built.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enflo-windtec.ch/english/turbine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''continuous cooling transformation''' ('''CCT''') phase diagram is often used when heat treating steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Transformation diagrams (CCT &amp; TTT) | url = http://www.matter.org.uk/steelmatter/metallurgy/7_1_2.html

These diagrams are often more useful than [[Isothermal transformation|time-temperature-transformation]] diagrams because it is more convenient to cool materials at a certain rate than to cool quickly and hold at a certain temperature.

==Types of Continuous Cooling Diagrams==

There are two types of continuous cooling diagrams drawn for practical purposes

* Type 1: This is the plot of transformation start, a specific transformation fraction and transformation finish temperature for all products against transformation time on each cooling curve.
* Type 2: This is the plot of transformation start, a specific transformation fraction and transformation finish temperature for all products against cooling rate or bar diameter of the specimen for each type of cooling medium.

A '''diamond simulant''', '''diamond imitation''' or '''imitation diamond''' is an object or material with [[gemology|gemological]] characteristics similar to those of a [[diamond]]. Simulants are distinct from [[synthetic diamond]]s, which are actual diamonds having the same [[material properties of diamond|material properties]] as natural diamonds. [[Diamond enhancement|Enhanced diamonds]] are also excluded from this definition. A diamond simulant may be artificial, natural, or in some cases a combination thereof. While their material properties depart markedly from those of diamond, simulants have certain desired characteristics—such as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and [[hardness]]—which lend themselves to imitation. Trained gemologists with appropriate equipment are able to distinguish natural and synthetic diamonds from all diamond simulants, primarily by visual inspection.

The most common diamond simulants are high-[[Flint glass|leaded glass]] (i.e., [[rhinestone]]s) and [[cubic zirconia]] (CZ), both artificial materials. A number of other artificial materials, such as [[strontium titanate]] and synthetic [[rutile]] have been developed since the mid-1950s, but these are no longer in common use. Introduced at the end of the 20th century, the lab-grown product [[moissanite]] has gained popularity as an alternative to diamond. The high price of [[gemstone|gem]]-grade [[diamond]]s, as well as significant [[blood diamond|ethical concerns of the diamond trade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopblooddiamonds.org/|title=Stop Blood Diamonds|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522121321/http://www.stopblooddiamonds.org/|archivedate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; have created a large demand for diamond simulants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diamonius.com/why-diamond-replicas|title=Why Diamond Replicas?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Desired and differential properties ==
{{see also|Material properties of diamond}}

In order to be considered for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a [[gemologist]], the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. Non-destructive testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in [[jewelry]], and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.

Following are some of the properties by which diamond and its simulants can be compared and contrasted.

=== Durability and density ===
The [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]] is a non-linear scale of common [[minerals]]' resistances to scratching. Diamond is at the top of this scale (hardness 10), as it is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as [[aggregated diamond nanorods]], are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of scratches. Diamond's hardness also is visually evident (under the [[microscope]] or [[loupe]]) by its highly [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]] [[facet]]s (described as ''adamantine'') which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond simulant to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external [[Diamond flaws|flaws]] and poor polish.

In the recent past, the so-called "window pane test" was commonly thought to be an assured method of identifying diamond. It is a potentially destructive test wherein a suspect diamond gemstone is scraped against a pane of glass, with a positive result being a scratch on the glass and none on the gemstone. The use of [[hardness point]]s and [[scratch plate]]s made of [[corundum]] (hardness 9) are also used in place of glass. Hardness tests are inadvisable for three reasons: glass is fairly soft (typically 6 or below) and can be scratched by a large number of materials (including many simulants); diamond has four directions of perfect and easy [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] (planes of structural weakness along which the diamond could split) which could be triggered by the testing process; and many diamond-like gemstones (including older simulants) are valuable in their own right.

The [[specific gravity]] (SG) or density of a gem diamond is fairly constant at 3.52. Most simulants are far above or slightly below this value, which can make them easy to identify if unset. High-density liquids such as [[diiodomethane]] can be used for this purpose, but these liquids are all highly [[toxin|toxic]] and therefore are usually avoided. A more practical method is to compare the expected size and  weight of a suspect diamond to its measured parameters: for example, a cubic zirconia (SG 5.6–6) will be 1.7 times the expected weight of an equivalently sized diamond.

=== Optics and color ===
Diamonds are usually cut into [[brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliant]]s to bring out their ''brilliance'' (the amount of light reflected back to the viewer) and ''fire'' (the degree to which colorful [[prism (optics)|prismatic]] flashes are seen). Both properties are strongly affected by the cut of the stone, but they are a function of diamond's high [[refractive index]] (RI—the degree to which incident light is bent upon entering the stone) of 2.417 (as measured by [[sodium light]], 589.3&amp;nbsp;nm) and high [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (the degree to which white light is split into its [[spectral color]]s as it passes through the stone) of 0.044, as measured by the sodium B and G line interval. Thus, if a diamond simulant's RI and dispersion are too low, it will appear comparatively dull or "lifeless"; if the RI and dispersion are too high, the effect will be considered unreal or even tacky. Very few simulants have closely approximating RI and dispersion, and even the close simulants can be separated by an experienced observer. Direct measurements of RI and dispersion are impractical (a standard gemological [[refractometer]] has an upper limit of about RI 1.81), but several companies have devised [[reflectivity]] meters to gauge a material's RI indirectly by measuring how well it reflects an [[infrared]] beam.

Perhaps equally as important is ''optic character''. Diamond and other [[cubic (crystal system)|cubic]] (and also [[amorphous]]) materials are ''[[isotropic]]'', meaning that light entering a stone behaves the same way regardless of direction. Conversely, most minerals are ''[[anisotropic]]'', which produces [[birefringence]], or double refraction of light entering the material in all directions other than an [[Optic axis of a crystal|optic axis]] (a direction of single refraction in a doubly refractive material). Under low magnification, this birefringence is usually detectable as a visual doubling of a cut gemstone's rear facets or internal flaws. An effective diamond simulant should therefore be isotropic.

Under longwave (365&amp;nbsp;nm) [[ultraviolet]] light, diamond may [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] a blue, yellow, green, mauve, or red of varying intensity. The most common fluorescence is blue, and such stones may also [[phosphorescence|phosphoresce]] yellow—this is thought to be a unique combination among gemstones. There is usually little if any response to shortwave ultraviolet, in contrast to many diamond simulants. Similarly, because most diamond simulants are artificial, they tend to have uniform properties: in a multi-stone diamond ring, one would expect the individual diamonds to fluoresce differently (in different colors and intensities, with some likely to be inert). If all the stones fluoresce in an identical manner, they are unlikely to be diamond.

Most "colorless" diamonds are actually tinted yellow or brown to some degree, whereas some artificial simulants are completely colorless—the equivalent of a perfect "D" in [[diamond color]] terminology. This "too good to be true" factor is important to consider; colored diamond simulants meant to imitate fancy diamonds are more difficult to spot in this regard, but the simulants' colors rarely approximate. In most diamonds (even colorless ones) a characteristic [[absorption spectrum]] can be seen (by a direct-vision [[spectroscope]]), consisting of a fine line at 415&amp;nbsp;nm. The [[dopant]]s used to impart color in artificial simulants may be detectable as a complex [[rare-earth]] absorption spectrum, which is never seen in diamond.

Also present in most diamonds are certain internal and external flaws or ''inclusions'', the most common of which are fractures and solid foreign crystals. Artificial simulants are usually internally flawless, and any flaws that are present are characteristic of the manufacturing process. The inclusions seen in natural simulants will often be unlike those ever seen in diamond, most notably [[liquid]] "feather" inclusions. The [[diamond cutting]] process will often leave portions of the original crystal's surface intact. These are termed ''naturals'' and are usually on the girdle of the stone; they take the form of triangular, rectangular, or square pits (''etch marks'') and are seen only in diamond.

=== Thermal and electrical ===

Diamond is an extremely effective [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductor]] and usually an [[electricity|electrical]] [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]. The former property is widely exploited in the use of an electronic ''thermal probe'' to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine [[copper]] tip. One thermistor functions as a [[heat]]ing device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. As most simulants are thermal insulators, the thermistor's heat will not be conducted. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. The only possible exception is moissanite, which has a thermal conductivity similar to diamond: older probes can be fooled by moissanite, but newer thermal and electrical conductivity testers are sophisticated enough to differentiate the two materials.
The latest development is nano diamond coating, an extremely thin layer of diamond material. If not tested properly it may show the same characteristics as a diamond.

A diamond's electrical conductance is only relevant to blue or gray-blue stones, because the interstitial [[boron]] responsible for their color also makes them [[semiconductor]]s. Thus, a suspected blue diamond can be affirmed if it completes an [[electric circuit]] successfully.

== Artificial simulants ==
Diamond has been imitated by artificial materials for hundreds of years; advances in technology have seen the development of increasingly better simulants with properties ever nearer those of diamond. Although most of these simulants were characteristic of a certain time period, their large production volumes ensured that all continue to be encountered with varying frequency in jewelry of the present. Nearly all were first conceived for intended use in [[high technology]], such as [[active laser medium]]s, [[varistor]]s, and [[bubble memory]]. Due to their limited present supply, collectors may pay a premium for the older types.

=== 1700 onwards ===
The formulation of [[flint glass]] using [[lead]], [[alumina]], and [[thallium]] to increase RI and dispersion began in the late [[Baroque]] period. Flint glass is fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or strass, glass simulants are a common feature of [[antique]] jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded and scratched. Together with [[conchoidal fracture]]s, and air bubbles or flow lines within the stone, these features make glass imitations easy to spot under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and mold marks or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.

=== 1900–1947 ===
The first [[crystal]]line artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white [[sapphire]] ([[aluminium|Al]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, pure corundum) and [[spinel]] (MgO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, pure [[magnesium]] aluminium [[oxide]]). Both have been synthesized in large quantities since the first decade of the 20th century via the [[Verneuil process|Verneuil]] or flame-fusion process, although spinel was not in wide use until the 1920s. The Verneuil process involves an inverted [[oxyhydrogen flame|oxyhydrogen]] [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]], with purified feed powder mixed with [[oxygen]] that is carefully fed through the blowpipe. The feed powder falls through the oxy-hydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or ''[[boule (crystal)|boule]]'' crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern [[Czochralski process]] may weigh several kilograms.

Synthetic sapphire and spinel are durable materials (hardness 9 and 8) that take a good polish; however, due to their much lower RI when compared to diamond (1.762–1.770 for sapphire, 1.727 for spinel), they are "lifeless" when cut. (Synthetic sapphire is also [[anisotropic]], making it even easier to spot.) Their low RIs also mean a much lower dispersion (0.018 and 0.020), so even when cut into brilliants they lack the ''fire'' of diamond. Nevertheless, synthetic spinel and sapphire were popular diamond simulants from the 1920s until the late 1940s, when newer and better simulants began to appear. Both have also been combined with other materials to create composites. Commercial names once used for synthetic sapphire include ''Diamondette'', ''Diamondite'', ''Jourado Diamond''', and ''Thrilliant''. Names for synthetic spinel included ''Corundolite'', ''Lustergem'', ''Magalux'', and ''Radiant''.

=== 1947–1970 ===
The first of the optically "improved" simulants was synthetic rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pure [[titanium]] oxide). Introduced in 1947–48, synthetic rutile possesses plenty of life when cut—perhaps too much life for a diamond simulant. Synthetic rutile's RI and dispersion (2.8 and 0.33) are so much higher than diamond that the resultant brilliants look almost [[opal]]-like in their display of prismatic colors. Synthetic rutile is also doubly refractive: although some stones are cut with the table perpendicular to the optic axis to hide this property, merely tilting the stone will reveal the doubled back facets.

The continued success of synthetic rutile was also hampered by the material's inescapable yellow tint, which producers were never able to remedy. However, synthetic rutile in a range of different colors, including blues and reds, were produced using various metal oxide dopants. These and the near-white stones were extremely popular if unreal stones. Synthetic rutile is also fairly soft (hardness ~6) and brittle, and therefore wears poorly. It is synthesized via a modification of the Verneuil process, which uses a third oxygen pipe to create a ''tricone burner''; this is necessary to produce a single crystal, due to the much higher oxygen losses involved in the oxidation of titanium. The technique was invented by Charles H. Moore, Jr. at the [[South Amboy, New Jersey|South Amboy]], [[New Jersey]]-based National Lead Company (later [[NL Industries]]). National Lead and [[Union Carbide]] were the primary producers of synthetic rutile, and peak annual production reached 750,000 carats (150&amp;nbsp;kg). Some of the many commercial names applied to synthetic rutile include: ''Astryl'', ''Diamothyst'', ''Gava'' or ''Java Gem'', ''Meredith'', ''Miridis'', ''Rainbow Diamond'', ''Rainbow Magic Diamond'', ''Rutania'', ''Titangem'', ''Titania'', and ''Ultamite''.

National Lead was also where research into the synthesis of another titanium compound—strontium titanate ([[Strontium|Sr]]TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, pure tausonite)—was conducted. Research was done during the late 1940s and early 1950s by Leon Merker and Langtry E. Lynd, who also used a tricone modification of the Verneuil process. Upon its commercial introduction in 1955, strontium titanate quickly replaced synthetic rutile as the most popular diamond simulant. This was due not only to strontium titanate's novelty, but to its superior optics: its RI (2.41) is very close to that of diamond, while its dispersion (0.19), although also very high, was a significant improvement over synthetic rutile's psychedelic display. Dopants were also used to give synthetic titanate a variety of colors, including yellow, orange to red, blue, and black. The material is also isotropic like diamond, meaning there is no distracting doubling of facets as seen in synthetic rutile.

Strontium titanate's only major drawback (if one excludes excess fire) is fragility. It is both softer (hardness 5.5) and more brittle than synthetic rutile—for this reason, strontium titanate was also combined with more durable materials to create [[#Composites|composites]]. It was otherwise the best simulant around at the time, and at its peak annual production was 1.5 million carats (300&amp;nbsp;kg). Due to [[patent]] coverage, all [[United States|US]] production was by National Lead, while large amounts were produced overseas by [[Nakazumi Company]] of [[Japan]]. Commercial names for strontium titanate included ''Brilliante'', ''Diagem'', ''Diamontina'', ''Fabulite'', and ''Marvelite''.

=== 1970–1976 ===
From about 1970 strontium titanate began to be replaced by a new class of diamond imitations: the "synthetic [[garnet]]s". These are not true garnets in the usual sense because they are oxides rather than [[silicate]]s, but they do share natural garnet's [[crystal structure]] (both are cubic and therefore isotropic) and the  general formula A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. While in natural garnets C is always [[silicon]], and A and B may be one of several common [[Chemical element|elements]], most synthetic garnets are composed of uncommon rare-earth elements. They are the only diamond simulants (aside from rhinestones) with no known natural counterparts: gemologically they are best termed ''artificial'' rather than ''synthetic'', because the latter term is reserved for human-made materials that can also be found in nature.

Although a number of artificial garnets were successfully grown, only two became important as diamond simulants. The first was [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] ([[YAG]]; Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) in the late 1960s. It was (and still is) produced by the Czochralski, or crystal-pulling, process, which involves growth from the melt. An [[iridium]] [[crucible]] surrounded by an [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere is used, wherein [[yttrium]] oxide and [[aluminium]] oxide are melted and mixed together at a carefully controlled temperature near 1980&amp;nbsp;°C. A small seed crystal is attached to a rod, which is lowered over the crucible until the crystal contacts the surface of the melted mixture. The seed crystal acts as a site of [[nucleation]]; the temperature is kept steady at a point where the surface of the mixture is just below the melting point. The rod is slowly and continuously rotated and retracted, and the pulled mixture crystallizes as it exits the crucible, forming a single crystal in the form of a cylindrical boule. The crystal's purity is extremely high, and it typically measures 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter and 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8&amp;nbsp;inches) in length, and weighs 9,000 carats (1.75&amp;nbsp;kg).

YAG hardness (8.25) and lack of brittleness were great improvements over strontium titanate, and although its RI (1.83) and dispersion (0.028) were fairly low, they were enough to give brilliant-cut YAGs perceptible fire and good brilliance (although still much lower than diamond). A number of different colors were also produced with the addition of dopants, including yellow, red, and a vivid green, which was used to imitate [[emerald]]. Major producers included [[Shelby Gem Factory]] of Michigan, [[Litton Systems]], [[Allied Chemical]], [[Raytheon]], and Union Carbide; annual global production peaked at 40 million carats (8000&amp;nbsp;kg) in 1972, but fell sharply thereafter. Commercial names for YAG included ''Diamonair'', ''Diamonique'', ''Gemonair'', ''Replique'', and ''Triamond''.

While market saturation was one reason for the fall in YAG production levels, another was the recent introduction of the other artificial garnet important as a diamond simulant, [[gadolinium gallium garnet]] (GGG; Gd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). Produced in much the same manner as YAG (but with a lower melting point of 1750&amp;nbsp;°C), GGG had an RI (1.97) close to, and a dispersion (0.045) nearly identical to diamond. GGG was also hard enough (hardness 7) and tough enough to be an effective gemstone, but its ingredients were also much more expensive than YAG's. Equally hindering was GGG's tendency to turn dark brown upon exposure to [[sunlight]] or other ultraviolet source: this was due to the fact that most GGG gems were fashioned from impure material that was rejected for technological use. The SG of GGG (7.02) is also the highest of all diamond simulants and amongst the highest of all gemstones, which makes loose GGG gems easy to spot by comparing their dimensions with their expected and actual weights. Relative to its predecessors, GGG was never produced in significant quantities; it became more or less unheard of by the close of the 1970s. Commercial names for GGG included ''Diamonique II'' and ''Galliant''.

=== 1976 to present ===
[[Cubic zirconia]] or CZ (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; [[zirconium dioxide]]—not to be confused with [[zircon]], a [[zirconium]] silicate) quickly dominated the diamond simulant market following its introduction in 1976, and it remains the most gemologically and economically important simulant. CZ had been synthesized since 1930 but only in [[ceramic]] form: the growth of single-crystal CZ would require an approach radically different from those used for previous simulants due to zirconium's extremely high melting point (2750&amp;nbsp;°C), unsustainable by any crucible. The solution found involved a network of water-filled copper pipes and [[radio-frequency induction]] [[Induction heating|heating coils]]; the latter to heat the zirconium feed powder, and the former to cool the exterior and maintain a retaining "skin" under 1 millimeter thick. CZ was thus grown in a crucible of itself, a technique called ''cold crucible'' (in reference to the cooling pipes) or ''[[skull crucible]]'' (in reference to either the shape of the crucible or of the crystals grown).

At [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]] zirconium oxide would normally crystallize in the [[monoclinic]] rather than cubic crystal system: for cubic crystals to grow, a stabilizer must be used. This is usually [[Yttrium(III) oxide]] or [[calcium oxide]]. The skull crucible technique was first developed in 1960s [[France]], but was perfected in the early 1970s by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientists under V. V. Osiko at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] in [[Moscow]]. By 1980 annual global production had reached 50 million carats (10,000&amp;nbsp;kg).

The hardness (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low material cost make CZ the most popular simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a thermal insulator). CZ is made in a number of different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic zirconia can be coated with [[diamond-like carbon]] to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.

CZ had virtually no competition until the 1998 introduction of [[moissanite]] (SiC; [[silicon carbide]]). Moissanite is superior to cubic zirconia in two ways: its hardness (8.5–9.25) and low SG (3.2). The former property results in facets that are sometimes as crisp as a diamond's, while the latter property makes simulated moissanite somewhat harder to spot when unset (although still disparate enough to detect). However, unlike diamond and cubic zirconia, moissanite is strongly birefringent. This manifests as the same "drunken vision" effect seen in synthetic rutile, although to a lesser degree. All moissanite is cut with the table perpendicular to the optic axis in order to hide this property from above, but when viewed under magnification at only a slight tilt the doubling of facets (and any inclusions) is readily apparent.

The inclusions seen in moissanite are also characteristic: most will have fine, white, subparallel growth tubes or needles oriented perpendicular to the stone's table. It is conceivable that these growth tubes could be mistaken for laser drill holes that are sometimes seen in diamond (see [[diamond enhancement]]), but the tubes will be noticeably doubled in moissanite due to its birefringence. Like synthetic rutile, current moissanite production is also plagued by an as yet inescapable tint, which is usually a brownish green. A limited range of fancy colors have been produced as well, the two most common being blue and green. 

== Natural simulants ==
Natural [[mineral]]s that (when cut) optically resemble white diamonds are rare, because the trace impurities usually present in natural minerals tend to impart color. The earliest simulants of diamond were colorless [[quartz]] (A form of [[silica]], which also form [[obsidian]], [[glass]] and [[sand]]), [[rock crystal]] (a type of quartz), [[topaz]], and [[beryl]] ([[goshenite]]); they are all common minerals with above-average hardness (7–8), but all have low RIs and correspondingly low dispersions. Well-formed quartz crystals are sometimes offered as "diamonds", a popular example being the so-called "[[Herkimer diamond]]s" mined in [[Herkimer County, New York]]. Topaz's SG (3.50–3.57) also falls within the range of diamond.

From a historical perspective, the most notable natural simulant of diamond is zircon. It is also fairly hard (7.5), but more importantly shows perceptible fire when cut, due to its high dispersion of 0.039. Colorless zircon has been mined in [[Sri Lanka]] for over 2,000 years; prior to the advent of modern [[mineralogy]], colorless zircon was thought to be an inferior form of diamond. It was called "Matara diamond" after its source location. It is still encountered as a diamond simulant, but differentiation is easy due to zircon's anisotropy and strong birefringence (0.059). It is also notoriously brittle and often shows wear on the girdle and facet edges.

Much less common than colorless zircon is colorless [[scheelite]]. Its dispersion (0.026) is also high enough to mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but it has never been widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic [[carbonate]] [[cerussite]], which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).

Due to their rarity fancy-colored diamonds are also imitated, and zircon can serve this purpose too. Applying heat treatment to brown zircon can create several bright colors: these are most commonly sky-blue, golden yellow, and red. Blue zircon is very popular, but it is not necessarily color stable; prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light (including the UV component in sunlight) tends to bleach the stone. Heat treatment also imparts greater brittleness to zircon and characteristic inclusions.

Another fragile candidate mineral is [[sphalerite]] (zinc blende). Gem-quality material is usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, and it is also isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are [[grossularite]] (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and [[andradite]]. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—[[topazolite]] (yellow), [[melanite]] (black), and [[demantoid]] (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the [[Ural Mountains]] in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique [[Russia]]n and [[Art Nouveau]] jewelry. [[Titanite]] or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).

Discovered the 1960s, the rich green [[tsavorite]] variety of grossular is also very popular. Both grossular and andradite are isotropic and have relatively high RIs (around 1.74 and 1.89 respectively) and high dispersions (0.027 and 0.057), with demantoid's exceeding diamond. However, both have a low hardness (6.5–7.5) and invariably possess inclusions atypical for diamond—the [[byssolite]] "horsetails" seen in demantoid are one striking example. Furthermore, most are very small, typically under 0.5 carats (100&amp;nbsp;mg) in weight. Their lusters range from vitreous to subadamantine, to almost metallic in the usually opaque melanite, which has been used to simulate black diamond. Some natural spinel is also deep black and could serve this same purpose.

== Composites ==
Because strontium titanate and glass are too soft to survive use as a ring stone, they have been used in the construction of composite or ''doublet'' diamond simulants. The two materials are used for the bottom portion (pavilion) of the stone, and in the case of strontium titanate, a much harder material—usually colorless synthetic spinel or sapphire—is used for the top half (crown). In glass doublets, the top portion is made of [[almandine]] garnet; it is usually a very thin slice which does not modify the stone's overall body color. There have even been reports of diamond-on-diamond doublets, where a creative entrepreneur has used two small pieces of rough to create one larger stone.

In strontium titanate and diamond-based doublets, an [[epoxy]] is used to adhere the two  halves together. The epoxy may fluoresce under UV light, and there may be residue on the stone's exterior. The garnet top of a glass doublet is physically fused to its base, but in it and the other doublet types there are usually flattened air bubbles seen at the junction of the two halves. A join line is also readily visible whose position is variable; it may be above or below the girdle, sometimes at an angle, but rarely along the girdle itself.

The most recent composite simulant involves combining a CZ core with an outer coating of laboratory created [[amorphous diamond]]. The concept effectively mimics the structure of a [[cultured pearl]] (which combines a core bead with an outer layer of pearl coating), only done for the diamond market.

In utility-scale [[electricity generation]], the '''duck curve''' is a graph of power production over the course of a day that shows the timing imbalance between [[peak demand]] and renewable energy production. In many energy markets the peak demand occurs after sunset, when [[solar power]] is no longer available. In locations where a substantial amount of solar electric capacity has been installed, the amount of power that must be generated from sources other than solar or wind displays a rapid increase around sunset and peaks in the mid-evening hours, producing a graph  that resembles the silhouette of a [[duck]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Paul Denholm, Matthew O’Connell, Gregory Brinkman, and Jennie Jorgenson.

Without any form of [[energy storage]], after times of high solar generation generating companies must rapidly increase power output around the time of sunset to compensate for the loss of solar generation, a major concern for grid operators where there is rapid [[growth of photovoltaics]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=What the Duck Curve Tells Us About Managing A Green Grid|url= https://www.caiso.com/Documents/FlexibleResourcesHelpRenewables_FastFacts.pdf |website=caiso.com |publisher=California ISO|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage can fix these issues if it can be implemented.

The term was coined in 2012 by the California Independent System Operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=David|title=Solar power’s greatest challenge was discovered 10 years ago.

==Mitigation strategies==
Methods for coping with the rapid increase in demand at sunset reflected in the duck curve, which becomes more serious as the penetration of solar generation grows, include:&lt;ref name=ducks2fly /&gt;
*Installing more [[dispatchable generation]]
*Orienting some solar collectors toward the west to maximize generation near sunset. 
*[[Energy storage]] including:
**[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]
**[[Battery storage power station]]s
**[[Solar thermal energy]] with [[thermal energy storage]]
**[[Ice storage air conditioning]]
**Use of batteries in electric vehicles for temporary storage ([[vehicle-to-grid]])
*[[Energy demand management]], including:
**Transitioning to more efficient lighting systems, such as [[compact fluorescent]] and [[LED lighting]]
**[[time-of-use pricing]] (TOU) and [[real-time pricing]]
**[[Smart grid]] technology

A major challenge is deploying mitigating capacity at a rate that keeps up with the growth of solar energy production. The effects of the duck curve have happened faster than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-california-duck-curve-is-real-and-bigger-than-expected |title=The California Duck Curve Is Real, and Bigger Than Expected|publisher= |date=3 November 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duck curve in California===
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has been monitoring and analyzing the Duck Curve and its future expectations for about a half a century now and their biggest finding is the growing gap between morning and evening hours prices relative to midday hours prices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to their last study, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, found that the wholesale energy market prices over the past six months during the 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. period (the “neck” of the duck) have increased to $60 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $35 per megawatt-hour in the same time frame in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, on the other side they have measured a drastic decrease in the midday prices, nearing $15 per megawatt-hour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These high peaks and deep valleys are only showing continues trends of going further apart making this Duck Curve even more prevalent as our renewable energy production continues to grow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A crucial part of this curve comes from the Net Load ("the difference between expected load and anticipated electricity production from the range of renewable energy sources").&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In certain times of the year (namely Spring and Summer), the curves create a “belly” appearance in the midday that then drastically increases portraying an “arch” similar to the neck of a duck, consequently the name “The Duck Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/eia-charts-californias-real-and-growing-duck-curve#gs.UByiMMo|title=EIA Data Reveals California’s Real and Growing Duck Curve|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;” During the midday, large amounts of solar energy is created and partially contributes to lower demand for additional electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21717365-wind-and-solar-energy-are-disrupting-century-old-model-providing-electricity-what-will|title=A world turned upside down|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing battery storage can mitigate the issues of solar abundance during the day. When excess solar energy is stored during the day and used in the evening, the price disparity between inexpensive midday and expensive evening energy can be reduced. Enough total solar technology exists to power the world, but there is a current lack of infrastructure to store solar energy for later use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An oversupply of energy during low demand coupled with a lack of supply during high demand explains the large disparity between midday and evening energy prices.

To understand these deep valleys and the high peaks we need to look at many different variables that go into the renewable energy grid. The green resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric are increasingly satisfying California’s total electricity needs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Green energy is abundant, which has become an economic issue on the time of use front.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, as of now, the technology that has been implemented puts a lot of control into consumers which leads to issues amongst different operating conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In order for it to run smoothly this would require flexible resource potentials to guarantee reliability from the renewable energy grid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The idea of reliability is one of the biggest issues facing the green energy market. Intermittency (“occurring at irregular intervals; not continuous or steady”) can lead to skepticism in consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-01|title=Intermittent energy source|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intermittent_energy_source&amp;oldid=812977399|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; If consumers are to transfer energy into the renewable grid, they must be guaranteed a constant stream of energy at a price/rate that can be maintained, but the Duck Curve issue is proving just the opposite.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5047">'''EPCARD''' ('''E'''uropean '''P'''rogram Package for the '''C'''alculation of '''A'''viation '''R'''oute '''D'''oses) is a software program that calculates [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] of aircrews.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_6hymYAgC6MC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Epcard#v=onepage&amp;q=Epcard&amp;f=false Jeffrey R. Davis, Robert Johnson, Jan Stepanek - '''Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine''' (2008) - Page 228-230] (Google Books Link 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The software code is based on the [[FLUKA]] transport code.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; EPCARD allows calculation of a simulated dose from most important components of penetrating cosmic radiation on any aviation route and for any flight profile at altitudes from 5 to 25&amp;nbsp;km.

Epcard helps airlines monitor radiation exposure, and comply with regulations relating to this area.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt;

==Development==
This software package was developed by scientists of the Institute of Radiation Protection of the [[Helmholtz Zentrum München]], German Research Center for Environmental Health (former GSF - National Research Center for Environment and Health) with support from the [[European Commission]] and University of Siegen, Germany.

==Simulation of radiation exposure==
The EPCARD program virtually simulates a flight (with time resolution of 1 min) in the “quasi-real” radiation field of cosmic secondary particles. It is based on the energy spectra of neutrons, protons, photons, electrons, positrons, muons, and pions, calculated by means of the FLUKA Monte Carlo code at various altitudes in the Earth’s atmosphere down to sea level, for all possible physical parameters of solar activity and geomagnetic shielding conditions. A large scale set of  “fluence-to-dose” conversion coefficients is employed, to calculate dose quantities (in units of microSievert) in terms of ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), and effective dose, E. EPCARD.Net is based on the same physical algorithms as the EPCARD program, but is currently ready to process some extended physical parameters giving more precise information about flight route doses. EPCARD.Net is a completely new code which can be run on many systems such as Microsoft Windows NT/2K/XP/Vista (using both .Net and Mono runtime platform) or ‘UNIX kernel type’ operating systems like Linux, Mac OS X or Solaris (using the Mono runtime platform).

==Approval==
The [[Luftfahrt-Bundesamt]] (German Aviation Authority; LBA, Federal Office for Aviation) and the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (National Metrology Institute; PTB) granted official approval for EPCARD version 3.34 in December 2003. EPCARD.Net Professional version 5.4.3 was approved for official use for aircrew dose assessment by LBA and PTB in April 2010.

==Usage==
Among the users of the software include major German airlines like [[Lufthansa]], [[Condor Flugdienst]], [[LTU International]] or the international airline service provider ASISTIM GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asistim.com/flight-operation/cosmic-radiation-reporting/''Cosmic Radiation Reporting on the ASISTIM website, accessed 2 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free of charge on-line dose calculations for any flights can be performed with a simplified version of EPCARD, on the EPCARD web site.

[[File:Rotary Dryer Flights.jpg|thumb|Rotary Dryer Flights]]

'''Flights''', also commonly referred to as “lifters,” are used in [[rotary dryer]]s and rotary coolers to shower material through the process gas stream. Affixed to the interior of the rotary drum, these fin-like structures scoop up material from the bed and shower it through the gas stream as the drum rotates. This showering creates a curtain of material spanning the width of the rotary dryer or cooler, helping to maximize the efficiency of heat transfer.

Depending on the needs of the material and the process, flights are engineered in a variety of designs and placement patterns in order to create a maximum efficiency curtain, while still retaining the integrity of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotary Dryer Flights Increase Efficiency of Heat Transfer|url=http://feeco.com/2012/11/28/rotary-dryer-flights-increase-efficiency-of-heat-transfer/|publisher=FEECO International, Inc.|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glass reinforced aluminium''' ('''GLARE''') is a [[fiber metal laminate]] (FML) composed of several very thin layers of metal (usually [[aluminium]]) interspersed with layers of [[glass-fiber]] ''[[pre-preg]]'', bonded together with a matrix such as [[epoxy]]. The uni-directional pre-preg layers may be aligned in different directions to suit predicted [[stress (physics)|stress]] conditions.

Though GLARE is a [[composite material]],&lt;ref name="orimaterial"&gt;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~smit0008/Publications_files/ORI-Aviation-Materials-2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; its material properties and fabrication are very similar to bulk aluminium metal sheets.  It has far less in common with composite structures when it comes to design, manufacture, inspection, or maintenance. GLARE parts are constructed and repaired using mostly conventional metal working techniques.

Its major advantages over conventional aluminium are:

* Better "[[damage tolerance]]" behavior (especially [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] and [[metal fatigue]], as the elastic strain is larger than other metal material it can consume more impact energy. It is dented easier but has a higher penetration resistance )
* Better [[corrosion]] resistance
* Better [[fire]] resistance
* Lower [[specific weight]]

Furthermore, it is possible to "tailor" the material during design and manufacture such that the number, type and alignment of layers can suit the local stresses and shapes throughout the aircraft. This allows the production of double-curved sections, complex integrated panels or very large sheets, for example.

While a simple manufactured sheet of GLARE is more expensive than an equivalent sheet of aluminium, considerable production savings can be made using the aforementioned optimization. A structure properly designed for GLARE is significantly lighter and less complex than an equivalent metal structure, requires less inspection and maintenance, and has a longer ''lifetime-till failure'', often making it cheaper, lighter, and safer in the long run.

== History ==
GLARE is a relatively successful FML, patented by [[Akzo Nobel]] in 1987. It has entered commercial application in the [[Airbus A380]]. The several patents mention among others as inventors Vogelesang, Schijve, Roebroeks and Marissen,&lt;ref&gt;Garesche, C. E., Roebroeks, G. H. J. J., Greidanus, V., Gunnink, J. W., Oost, R. C., &amp; Greidanus, B. (1994). Laminated panel for aircraft fuselage - comprises metal layers with splices in staggered relation in adjacent layers and fibre-reinforced adhesive layers between the metal layers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Schijve, J., Vogelesang, L., &amp; Marissen, R. (1982). Laminate aluminium contg. metal sheets and aramid fibre sheets - bonded together by thermosetting adhesives, used in spacecraft and aircraft.&lt;/ref&gt; then professors and researchers at the [[Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology]], where much of the {{nowrap|[[Research and development|R &amp; D]]}} on FML was done in the 1970s and 1980s.

The fruition of FML development marks a step in the long history of research that started in 1945 at [[Fokker]], where earlier bonding experience at [[DeHavilland|de Havilland]] inspired investigation into the improved properties of bonded aluminium laminates compared to monolithic aluminium. Later, [[NASA]] got interested in reinforcing metal parts with composite materials as part of the [[Space Shuttle]] program led to the introduction of fibers to the bond layers, and the concept of FMLs was born.

Further research and co-operation of [[Fokker]] with [[Delft University of Technology|Delft University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morinière|first=Freddy D.|author2=Alderliesten, René C. |author3=Tooski, Mehdi Yarmohammad |author4= Benedictus, Rinze |title=Damage evolution in GLARE fibre-metal laminate under repeated low-velocity impact tests|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=26 July 2012|volume=2|issue=4|pages=603–611|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0019-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dutch Aerospace Laboratory [[:nl:Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium|NLR]], [[3M]], [[Alcoa]] and various other companies and institutions led to the first FML, the [[Aramid fiber]] based ARALL. This proved to have some cost, manufacturing and application problems (while it had a very high tensile strength; compression, off-axis loading and cyclic loading proved problematic), which lead to an improved version with [[glass-fiber]] instead of aramid fibers.

Over the course of the development of the material, which took more than 30 years from start to the major application on the [[Airbus A380]], many other production and development partners have been involved, including [[Boeing]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]], and the [[US Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Berends, H., van Burg, E., &amp; van Raaij, E. M. (2011). [http://orgsci.journal.informs.org/content/22/4/940.full.pdf+html Contacts and contracts: Cross-level network dynamics in the development of an aircraft material.] Organization Science, 22(4), 940–960.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of time, companies withdrew from this involvement, sometimes to come back after a couple of years, like [[Alcoa]] who withdrew in 1995 to come back in 2004 and withdrew once again in 2010. These strategic decisions show the dynamic nature of innovation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Van Burg, E., Berends, H., &amp; van Raaij, E. M. (2014).

== Applications ==
Besides the applications on the [[Airbus A380]] fuselage, GLARE has multiple 'secondary' applications. GLARE is also the material used in the ECOS3 blast-resistant [[Unit Load Device]]. This is freight container shown to completely contain the explosion and fire resulting from a bomb such as that used over [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie]]. Other applications include among others the application in the [[Learjet 45]] and in the past also in cargo floors of the [[Boeing 737]].

== Current production ==
GLARE is currently produced by GKN-Fokker in the Netherlands and Airbus in Nordenham, Germany. GKN- Fokker opened a brand new facility next to its existing facilities in Papendrecht, the Netherlands where they produce Glare sheets of {{nowrap|4.5 x 11.5 m}}, including the milling of doors windows etc. on a 5-axis milling machine with a movable bed.

Glare has also been used to make cargo doors for later models of the [[C-17 Globemaster III]].

{{good article}}
{{Infobox gallium}}
'''Gallium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ga''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;31. It is in [[boron group|group 13]] of the periodic table, and thus has similarities to the other metals of the group, [[aluminium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]. Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but as gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in [[zinc]] ores and in  [[bauxite]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery blue metal at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], a brittle solid at low temperatures, and a liquid at temperatures greater than {{convert|29.76|°C|°F}} (above [[room temperature]], but below the normal human body temperature of {{convert|98.6|°F|°C}}, hence, the metal will melt in a person's hands).

The melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point. Gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non-toxic and [[environmentally friendly]] alternative to mercury, and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury. The alloy [[galinstan]] (70% gallium, 21.5% [[indium]], and 10% [[tin]]) has an even lower melting point of {{convert|-19|°C|°F}}, well below the freezing point of water.

Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has been used to make [[alloy]]s with low melting points. It is also used in [[semiconductor]]s as a [[dopant]] in semiconductor substrates.

Gallium is predominantly used in [[electronics]]. [[Gallium arsenide]], the primary [[chemical compound]] of gallium in electronics, is used in [[microwave]] circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and [[infrared]] circuits. Semiconducting [[gallium nitride]] and [[indium gallium nitride]] produce blue and violet [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and [[diode laser]]s. Gallium is also used in the production of artificial [[gadolinium gallium garnet]] for jewelry.

Gallium has no known natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves in a similar manner to [[Ferric#Ferric iron and life|ferric]] salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and [[radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceuticals]].

==Physical properties==
[[File:Gallium kristallisiert.JPG|thumb|left|Crystallization of gallium from the melt]]
Elemental gallium is not found in nature, but it is easily obtained by [[smelting]]. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures [[Conchoidal fracture|conchoidally]] like [[glass]]. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, it should not be stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes [[Properties of water|water]], [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]], and [[plutonium]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood222&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallium [[liquid metal embrittlement|attacks]] most other metals by [[diffusion|diffusing]] into the metal [[crystal structure|lattice]]. For example, it diffuses into the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] of [[aluminium]]-[[zinc]] [[alloy]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Grain boundary imaging, gallium diffusion and the fracture behavior of Al–Zn Alloy – An in situ study |author = Tsai, W.

Gallium easily alloys with many metals, and is used in small quantities in the [[plutonium-gallium alloy]] in the plutonium [[Plutonium pit|cores]] of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]] to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sublette, Cary |title=Section 6.2.2.1 |date=2001-09-09 |work=Nuclear Weapons FAQ |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html#nfaq6.2 |accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[melting point]] of gallium, at 302.9146&amp;nbsp;K (29.7646&amp;nbsp;°C, 85.5763&amp;nbsp;°F), is just above room temperature, and is approximately the same as the average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]] (ITS-90) established by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/its-90/ITS-90_metrologia.pdf |title= The International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) |last = Preston–Thomas |first = H. |journal = Metrologia |volume = 27 |issue= 1 |pages = 3–10 |date = 1990|doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/27/1/002|bibcode = 1990Metro..27....3P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/its-90.html |title=ITS-90 documents at Bureau International de Poids et Mesures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.05/papers/magnum90ITS90guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030704215942/http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.05/papers/magnum90ITS90guide.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-07-04 |title=Guidelines for Realizing the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) |last=Magnum |first=B.

The melting point of gallium allows it to melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong tendency to [[supercooling|supercool]] below its [[melting point]]/[[freezing point]]: Ga nanoparticles can be kept in the liquid state below 90 K.&lt;ref&gt;Parravicini, G. B.; Stella, A.; Ghigna, P.; Spinolo, G.; Migliori, A.; d’Acapito, F.; Kofman, R. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2006, 89, 033123&lt;/ref&gt; [[seed crystal|Seeding]] with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium is one of the four non-radioactive metals (with [[caesium]], [[rubidium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) that are known&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD FRANCIUM; ITS MELTING POINT IS ONLY CALCULATED, AND ITS INTENSE RADIOACTIVITY WOULD MEAN THAT SHOULD YOU HAVE ENOUGH AROUND TO FILL A THERMOMETER, MEASURING ITS TEMPERATURE SHOULD NOT BE YOUR GREATEST CONCERN--&gt; to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium is the only one that is neither highly reactive (rubidium and caesium) nor highly toxic (mercury) and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature [[thermometer]]s. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low [[vapor pressure]] at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673&amp;nbsp;K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the [[absolute scale]], the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element.&lt;ref name=Greenwood224&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal [[Wetting|wets]] glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and [[Teflon]]){{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror.&lt;ref name=Greenwood221&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.

Gallium does not [[crystal]]lize in any of the simple [[crystal structure]]s. The stable phase under normal conditions is [[orthorhombic]] with 8 atoms in the conventional [[unit cell]]. Within a unit cell, each atom has only one nearest neighbor (at a distance of 244&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]]). The remaining six unit cell neighbors are spaced 27, 30 and 39&amp;nbsp;pm farther away, and they are grouped in pairs with the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Bernascino |display-authors=etal |date=1995 |title=Ab initio calculations of structural and electronic properties of gallium solid-state phases |journal=Phys. Rev. B |volume=52 |issue=14 |pages=9988–9998 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.52.9988 |bibcode = 1995PhRvB..52.9988B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many stable and [[metastability in molecules|metastable]] phases are found as function of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/4010212-0BbwUC/4010212.pdf "Phase Diagrams of the Elements", David A. Young, UCRL-51902 "Prepared for the U.S. Energy Research &amp; Development Administration under contract No. W-7405-Eng-48".] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bonding between the two nearest neighbors is [[covalent]]; hence Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal. This explains the low melting point relative to the neighbor elements, aluminium and indium. This structure is strikingly similar to that of [[iodine]] and forms because of interactions between the single 4p electrons of gallium atoms, further away from the nucleus than the 4s electrons and the [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; core. This phenomenon recurs with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] with its "pseudo-noble-gas" [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration, which is liquid at room temperature.&lt;ref name=Greenwood223&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The 3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; electrons do not shield the outer electrons very well from the nucleus and hence the first ionisation energy of gallium is greater than that of aluminium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222/&gt;

The physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along the three major crystallographical axes ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' (see table), producing a significant difference between the linear (α) and volume [[thermal expansion]] coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting.&lt;ref name=anis&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosebury, Fred |title=Handbook of Electron Tube and Vacuum Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBmnnaODnHgC&amp;pg=PA26|date=1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-56396-121-2|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of gallium}}
Gallium has 31 known isotopes, ranging in [[mass number]] from 56 to 86. Only two isotopes are stable and occur naturally, gallium-69 and gallium-71. Gallium-69 is more abundant: it makes up about 60.1% of natural gallium, while gallium-71 makes up the remaining 39.9%. All the other isotopes are radioactive. The two longest-lived and only commercially important ones are gallium-67 (half-life 3.261&amp;nbsp;days) and gallium-68 (half-life 67.7&amp;nbsp;min). Isotopes lighter than gallium-69 usually decay through [[beta plus decay]] (positron emission) or [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[zinc]], although the lightest few (with mass numbers 56 through 59) decay through prompt [[proton emission]]. Isotopes heavier than gallium-71 decay through [[beta minus decay]] (electron emission), possibly with delayed [[neutron emission]], to isotopes of [[germanium]], while gallium-70 can decay through both beta minus decay and electron capture. Gallium-67 is unique among the light isotopes in having only electron capture as a decay mode, as its decay energy is not sufficient to allow positron emission.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Audi | first = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties | journal = Nuclear Physics A | volume = 729 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–128 | date = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 | bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A | last2 = Bersillon | first2 = O. | last3 = Blachot | first3 = J. | last4 = Wapstra | first4 = A.

{{Category see also|Gallium compounds}}
Gallium is found primarily in the +3 [[oxidation state]]. The +1 oxidation state is also found in some compounds, although it is less common than it is for gallium's heavier congeners indium and thallium. For example, the very stable GaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains both gallium(I) and gallium(III) and can be formulated as Ga&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Ga&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0&amp;nbsp;°C, [[disproportionation|disproportionating]] into elemental gallium and gallium(III) chloride. Compounds containing Ga–Ga bonds are true gallium(II) compounds, such as [[gallium(II) sulfide|GaS]] (which can be formulated as Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the [[dioxan]] complex Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood240&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong acids dissolve gallium, forming gallium(III) salts such as [[gallium sulfate|{{chem|Ga|2|(SO|4|)|3}}]] (gallium sulfate) and [[gallium(III) nitrate|{{chem|Ga(NO|3|)|3}}]] (gallium nitrate).

===Oxides and chalcogenides===
Gallium reacts with the [[chalcogen]]s only at relatively high temperatures. At room temperature, gallium metal is not reactive with air and water because it forms a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passive]], protective [[oxide]] layer.  At higher temperatures, however, it reacts with atmospheric [[oxygen]] to form [[gallium(III) oxide]], {{chem|Ga|2|O|3}}.&lt;ref name="eagleson"&gt;{{Cite book

Reacting a mixture of alkali metal carbonates and {{chem|Ga|2|O|3}} with {{chem|H|2|S}} leads to the formation of ''thiogallates'' containing the {{chem|[Ga|2|S|4|]|2-}} anion. Strong acids decompose these salts, releasing {{chem|H|2|S}} in the process.&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|104–105}} The mercury salt, {{chem|HgGa|2|S|4}}, can be used as a [[phosphor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Krausbauer, L.  | author2 = Nitsche, R.  | author3 = Wild, P.  | year = 1965 | title = Mercury gallium sulfide, {{chem|HgGa|2|S|4}}, a new phosphor | journal = Physica | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–121 | doi = 10.1016/0031-8914(65)90110-2|bibcode = 1965Phy....31..113K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallium also forms sulfides in lower oxidation states, such as [[gallium(II) sulfide]] and the green [[gallium(I) sulfide]], the latter of which is produced from the former by heating to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C under a stream of nitrogen.&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|94}}

The other binary chalcogenides, {{chem|Ga|2|Se|3}} and {{chem|Ga|2|Te|3}}, have the [[Zincblende (crystal structure)|zincblende]] structure. They are all semiconductors but are easily [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] and have limited utility.&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|104}}

Gallium reacts with ammonia at 1050&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[gallium nitride]], GaN. Gallium also forms binary compounds with [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]]: [[gallium phosphide]] (GaP), [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs), and [[gallium antimonide]] (GaSb). These compounds have the same structure as [[zinc sulfide|ZnS]], and have important [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] properties.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|1034}} GaP, GaAs, and GaSb can be synthesized by the direct reaction of gallium with elemental phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony.&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|99}} They exhibit higher electrical conductivity than GaN.&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|101}} GaP can also be synthesized by reacting {{chem|Ga|2|O}} with phosphorus at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Inorganic Chemistry| author = Michelle Davidson| publisher = Lotus Press| date = 2006| isbn = 978-81-89093-39-6

Gallium forms ternary [[nitride]]s; for example:&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|99}}

:{{chem|Li|3|Ga}} + {{chem|N|2}} → {{chem|Li|3|GaN|2}}

Similar compounds with phosphorus and arsenic are possible: {{chem|Li|3|GaP|2}} and {{chem|Li|3|GaAs|2}}. These compounds are easily hydrolyzed by dilute [[acid]]s and water.&lt;ref name="emeleus_sharpe"/&gt;{{rp|101}}

===Halides===
{{see also|Gallium halides}}
Gallium(III) oxide reacts with [[Halogenation|fluorinating agents]] such as [[hydrogen fluoride|HF]] or [[fluorine|{{chem|F|2}}]] to form [[gallium(III) fluoride]], {{chem|GaF|3}}. It is an ionic compound strongly insoluble in water. However, it dissolves in [[hydrofluoric acid]], in which it forms an [[adduct]] with water, {{chem|GaF|3|·3H|2|O}}. Attempting to dehydrate this adduct forms {{chem|GaF|2|OH·''n''H|2|O}}. The adduct reacts with ammonia to form {{chem|GaF|3|·3NH|3}}, which can then be heated to form anhydrous {{chem|GaF|3}}.&lt;ref name="downs"/&gt;{{rp|128–129}}

[[Gallium trichloride]] is formed by the reaction of gallium metal with [[chlorine]] gas.&lt;ref name="eagleson"/&gt; Unlike the trifluoride, gallium(III) chloride exists as dimeric molecules, {{chem|Ga|2|Cl|6}}, with a melting point of 78&amp;nbsp;°C. Eqivalent compounds are formed with bromine and iodine, [[gallium(III) bromide|{{chem|Ga|2|Br|6}}]] and [[gallium(III) iodide|{{chem|Ga|2|I|6}}]].&lt;ref name="downs"/&gt;{{rp|133}}

Like the other group 13 trihalides, gallium(III) halides are [[Lewis acid]]s, reacting as halide acceptors with alkali metal halides to form salts containing {{chem|GaX|4|-}} anions, where X is a halogen. They also react with [[haloalkane|alkyl halides]] to form [[carbocation]]s and {{chem|GaX|4|-}}.&lt;ref name="downs"/&gt;{{rp|136–137}}

When heated to a high temperature, gallium(III) halides react with elemental gallium to form the respective gallium(I) halides. For example, {{chem|GaCl|3}} reacts with Ga to form {{chem|GaCl}}:

:2 Ga + {{chem|GaCl|3}} {{eqm}} 3 GaCl (g)

At lower temperatures, the equilibrium shifts toward the left and GaCl disproportionates back to elemental gallium and {{chem|GaCl|3}}. GaCl can also be produced by reacting Ga with HCl at 950&amp;nbsp;°C; the product can be condensed as a red solid.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|1036}}

Gallium(I) compounds can be stabilized by forming adducts with Lewis acids. For example:

:GaCl + {{chem|AlCl|3}} → {{chem|Ga|+|[AlCl|4|]|-}}

The so-called "gallium(II) halides", {{chem|GaX|2}}, are actually adducts of gallium(I) halides with the respective gallium(III) halides, having the structure {{chem|Ga|+|[GaX|4|]|-}}. For example:&lt;ref name="eagleson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|1036}}&lt;ref name="arora"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:GaCl + {{chem|GaCl|3}} → {{chem|Ga|+|[GaCl|4|]|-}}

===Hydrides===
Like [[aluminium]], gallium also forms a [[hydride]], {{chem|GaH|3}}, known as ''[[gallane]]'', which may be produced by reacting lithium gallanate ({{chem|LiGaH|4}}) with [[gallium(III) chloride]] at −30&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|1031}}

:3 {{chem|LiGaH|4}} + {{chem|GaCl|3}} → 3 LiCl + 4 {{chem|GaH|3}}

In the presence of [[dimethyl ether]] as solvent, {{chem|GaH|3}} polymerizes to {{chem|(GaH|3|)|''n''}}. If no solvent is used, the dimer {{chem|Ga|2|H|6}} (''[[digallane]]'') is formed as a gas. Its structure is similar to [[diborane]], having two hydrogen atoms bridging the two gallium centers,&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|1031}} unlike α-[[aluminium hydride|{{chem|AlH|3}}]] in which aluminium has a coordination number of 6.&lt;ref name="wiberg_holleman"/&gt;{{rp|1008}}

Gallane is unstable above −10&amp;nbsp;°C, decomposing to elemental gallium and [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="sykes"&gt;{{Cite book

===Organogallium compounds===

Organogallium compounds are also less reactive than organoaluminum compounds. They do form stable peroxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W, Uhl and M. R.

Gallium(I) forms complexes with [[arene]] ligands such as [[hexamethylbenzene]]. Because this ligand is quite bulky, the structure of the [Ga(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is that of a half-[[sandwich compound|sandwich]]. Less bulky ligands such as [[mesitylene]] allow two ligands to be attached to the central gallium atom in a bent sandwich structure. [[Benzene]] is even less bulky and allows the formation of dimers: an example is [Ga(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] [GaCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·3C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood262/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gallium drops.ogv|thumbnail|Small gallium droplets fusing together]]
In 1871, the existence of gallium was first predicted by Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], who named it "[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka-aluminium]]" from its position in his [[periodic table]]. He also predicted several properties of eka-aluminium that correspond closely to the real properties of gallium, such as its [[density]], [[melting point]], oxide character and bonding in chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ingredients: A Guided Tour of the Elements |author=Ball, Philip |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=105 |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-284100-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendeleev further predicted that eka-aluminium would be discovered by means of the [[spectroscope]], and that metallic eka-aluminium would dissolve slowly in both acids and alkalis and would not react with air. He also predicted that M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; would dissolve in acids to give MX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; salts, that eka-aluminium salts would form basic salts, that eka-aluminium sulfate should form [[alum]]s, and that anhydrous MCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; should have a greater volatility than ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: all of these predictions turned out to be true.&lt;ref name=Greenwood217/&gt;

Gallium was discovered using [[spectroscopy]] by French chemist [[Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] in 1875 from its characteristic spectrum (two [[violet (color)|violet]] lines) in a sample of [[sphalerite]].&lt;ref name="Bois"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Caractères chimiques et spectroscopiques d'un nouveau métal, le gallium, découvert dans une blende de la mine de Pierrefitte, vallée d'Argelès (Pyrénées) |first = Lecoq |last = de Boisbaudran |page=493 |journal = Comptes Rendus |volume = 81 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3038w/f490.table |accessdate = 2008-09-23 |date = 1835–1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--{{doi|10.1002/andp.18762351216}}--&gt;  Later that year, Lecoq obtained the free metal by [[electrolysis]] of the [[hydroxide]] in [[potassium hydroxide]] solution. He named the element "gallia", from [[Latin]] ''Gallia'' meaning [[Gaul]], after his native land of France. It was later claimed that, in one of those multilingual [[pun]]s so beloved by men of science in the 19th century, he had also named gallium after himself: "Le coq" is French for "the [[rooster]]" and the [[Latin]] word for "rooster" is "''gallus''".  In an 1877 article, Lecoq denied this conjecture.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The discovery of the  elements. XIII.

From its discovery in 1875 until the era of semiconductors, the primary uses of gallium were high-temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting (some such being liquid at room temperature). The development of [[gallium arsenide]] as a [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct band gap semiconductor]] in the 1960s ushered in the most important stage in the applications of gallium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood221/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Gallium does not exist as a free element in the Earth's crust, and the few high-content minerals, such as gallite (CuGaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), are too rare to serve as a primary source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309583931|title=The distribution of gallium, germanium and indium in conventional and non-conventional resources - Implications for global availability (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.20956.18564|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abundance [[Earth#Chemical composition|in the Earth's crust]] is approximately 16.9&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0016-7037(59)90052-3 |title = The abundances of gallium and germanium in terrestrial materials|first = J.

Yet unlike these elements, gallium does not form its own ore deposits with concentrations of &gt; 0.1 wt.% in ore.

Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by the rate at which bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.

==Production and availability==
[[File:6N Gallium sealed in vacuum ampoule.jpg|thumb|left|99.9999% (6N) gallium sealed in vacuum ampoule]]
Gallium is produced exclusively as a [[by-product]] during the processing of the ores of other metals. Its main source material is [[bauxite]], the chief ore of [[aluminium]], but minor amounts are also extracted from sulfidic zinc ores ([[sphalerite]] being the main host mineral). In the past, certain coals were an important source.

During the processing of bauxite to [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] in the [[Bayer process]], gallium accumulates in the [[sodium hydroxide]] liquor. From this it can be extracted by a variety of methods. The most recent is the use of [[ion-exchange resin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenzel|first=Max|last2=Ketris|first2=Marina P.|last3=Seifert|first3=Thomas|last4=Gutzmer|first4=Jens|date=March 2016|title=On the current and future availability of gallium|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420715001233|journal=Resources Policy|volume=47|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2015.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15% of the contained gallium is extractable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The remainder reports to the [[red mud]] and [[aluminium hydroxide]] streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For [[semiconductor]] use, it is further purified with [[zone melting]] or single-crystal extraction from a melt ([[Czochralski process]]). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.&lt;ref name="Moskalyk"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moskalyk|first=R.

[[File:Bauxite Jamaica 1984.jpg|thumb|Bauxite mine in [[Jamaica]] (1984).]]
Its by-product status means that gallium production is constrained by the amount of bauxite, sulfidic zinc ores (and coal) extracted per year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials ''per year'' under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenzel|first=M|last2=Tolosana-Delgado|first2=R|last3=Gutzmer|first3=J|date=2015|title=Assessing the supply potential of high-tech metals - A general method|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420715000781|journal=Resources Policy|volume=46|pages=45–58|via=Elsevier Sciencedirect|doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2015.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they ''cannot'' be extracted independently from the main-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenzel|first=Max|last2=Mikolajczak|first2=Claire|last3=Reuter|first3=Markus A.|last4=Gutzmer|first4=Jens|date=June 2017|title=Quantifying the relative availability of high-tech by-product metals – The cases of gallium, germanium and indium|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420716303269|journal=Resources Policy|volume=52|pages=327–335|doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2017.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent estimates put the supply potential of gallium at a minimum of 2,100 t/yr from bauxite, 85 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores, and potentially 590 t/yr from coal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These figures are significantly greater than current production (375 t in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gallium/mcs-2017-galli.pdf|title=Gallium - In: USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries|last=|first=|publisher=United States Geological Survey|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of gallium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price.

==Applications==
Semiconductor applications dominate the commercial demand for gallium, accounting for 98% of the total.  The next major application is for [[gadolinium gallium garnet]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Greber, J. F. (2012) "Gallium and Gallium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a12_163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiconductors===
[[File:Blue LED and Reflection.jpg|thumb|Gallium-based blue LEDs]]
Extremely high-purity (&gt;99.9999%) gallium is commercially available to serve the semiconductor industry. [[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and [[gallium nitride]] (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the gallium consumption in the United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium is used in the U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium arsenide), such as the manufacture of ultra-high-speed logic chips and [[MESFET]]s for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% of this gallium is used in [[optoelectronic]]s.&lt;ref name=USGSCS2008&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gallium/mcs-2008-galli.pdf|title = Mineral Commodity Summary 2006: Gallium|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2008-11-20|first = Deborah A.|last = Kramer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, gallium arsenide makes up 95% of the annual global gallium consumption.&lt;ref name="Moskalyk"/&gt;

Gallium arsenide is used in a variety of optoelectronic infrared devices. [[Aluminium gallium arsenide]] (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and [[indium gallium nitride]] are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly [[laser diode]]s and [[light-emitting diode]]s. For example, gallium nitride 405&amp;nbsp;nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density [[Blu-ray Disc]] compact data disc drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pVkhYTzdXgoC&amp;pg=PA150 | pages = 150–151 | title = Advances in Semiconductor Lasers | isbn = 978-0-12-391066-0 | author1 = Coleman | first1 = James J. | last2 = Jagadish | first2 = Chennupati | last3 = Catrina Bryce | first3 = A. | date = 2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multijunction photovoltaic cell]]s, developed for [[satellite]] power applications, are made by [[molecular-beam epitaxy]] or [[metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy]] of [[thin film]]s of gallium arsenide, [[indium gallium phosphide]], or [[indium gallium arsenide]]. The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s and several satellites use triple-junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0094-5765(02)00287-4| title = The performance of gallium arsenide/germanium solar cells at the Martian surface |date = 2004| first = D.|last = Crisp |author2 = Pathare, A. |author3=Ewell, R.

===Galinstan and other alloys===
[[Image:Galinstan on glass.jpg|thumb|Galinstan from a broken thermometer, easily wetting a piece of glass.]]
Gallium readily [[alloy]]s with most metals, and is used as an ingredient in [[low-melting alloy]]s. The nearly [[eutectic]] alloy of gallium, [[indium]], and [[tin]] is a room temperature liquid used in medical thermometers. This alloy, with the trade-name ''[[Galinstan]]'' (with the "-stan" referring to the tin, ''stannum'' in Latin), has a low freezing point of −19&amp;nbsp;°C (−2.2&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00216-005-0069-7|date=Nov 2005|author=Surmann, P|author2=Zeyat, H|title=Voltammetric analysis using a self-renewable non-mercury electrode|volume=383|issue=6|pages=1009–13|issn=1618-2642|pmid=16228199|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this family of alloys could also be used to cool computer chips in place of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Hot chips chilled with liquid metal|date = 2005-05-05|first = Will|last = Knight|url =https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7348|accessdate = 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallium alloys have been evaluated as substitutes for mercury [[dental amalgam]]s, but these materials have yet to see wide acceptance.

Because gallium [[wetting|wets]] glass or [[porcelain]], gallium can be used to create brilliant [[mirror]]s. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in [[Galinstan]] glass thermometers), the glass must be protected with a transparent layer of [[gallium(III) oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2EZSAAAAMAAJ|title = Liquid-metals handbook|publisher = U.S. Govt.

===Biomedical applications===
Although gallium has no natural function in biology, gallium ions interact with processes in the body in a manner similar to [[Ferric#Ferric iron and life|iron(III)]]. Because these processes include [[inflammation]], a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] and [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceuticals]] in medicine. Interest in the anticancer properties of gallium emerged when it was discovered that &lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Ga(III) citrate injected in tumor-bearing animals localized to sites of tumor. Clinical trials have shown gallium nitrate to have antineoplastic activity against non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and urothelial cancers. A new generation of gallium-ligand complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46)
and gallium maltolate has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitambar|first1=Christopher R. |editor1-last=Sigel|editor1-first=Astrid|editor2-last=Sigel|editor2-first=Helmut|editor3-last=Freisinger|editor3-first=Eva|editor4-last=Sigel|editor4-first=Roland K.

Gallium is thought to interfere with [[osteoclast]] function, and the therapy may be effective when other treatments have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CDG/content/CDG_gallium_nitrate.asp| title=gallium nitrate |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-07-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608234315/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CDG/content/CDG_gallium_nitrate.asp |archivedate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gallium maltolate]], an oral, highly absorbable form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells, particularly cancer cells and some bacteria that accept it in place of ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). Researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment for a number of cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Bernstein, L.

When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/trojan-gallium.html|title = A Trojan-horse strategy selected to fight bacteria|date = 2007-03-16|publisher =INFOniac.com| accessdate = 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/tb/5266|title = Gallium May Have Antibiotic-Like Properties|first = Michael|last = Smith|publisher = MedPage Today|date = 2007-03-16|accessdate = 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complex [[amine]]-[[phenol]] Ga(III) compound MR045 is selectively toxic to parasites resistant to [[chloroquine]], a common drug against [[malaria]]. Both the Ga(III) complex and chloroquine act by inhibiting crystallization of [[hemozoin]], a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by the parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9045684|journal=J.

====Radiogallium salts====
[[Gallium-67]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as gallium [[citrate]] and gallium [[nitrate]] are used as [[radiopharmaceutical]] agents in the [[nuclear medicine]] imaging known as [[Gallium 67 scan|gallium scan]]. The [[radionuclide|radioactive isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in many ways as though it were Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.&lt;ref name=Nordberg/&gt;

[[Gallium-68]], a positron emitter with a half-life of 68 min, is now used as a diagnostic radionuclide in PET-CT when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as [[DOTATOC]], a [[somatostatin]] analogue used for [[neuroendocrine tumors]] investigation, and [[DOTA-TATE]], a newer one, used for neuroendocrine [[metastasis]] and lung neuroendocrine cancer, such as certain types of ''[[microcytoma]]''. Gallium-68's preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical, and the radionuclide is extracted by [[elution]] from germanium-68, a [[synthetic radioisotope]] of [[germanium]], in [[gallium-68 generator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banerjee |first=Sangeeta Ray |last2=Pomper |first2=Martin G. |date=June 2013 |title=Clinical Applications of Gallium-68 |pmc=3664132 |journal=Appl.

===Other uses===
Gallium is used for [[neutrino]] detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the [[SAGE (Soviet-American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]] experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes (~9 cubic metres) of liquid gallium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ewi.npl.washington.edu/sage/|title = Russian American Gallium Experiment|date = 2001-10-19|accessdate = 2009-06-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100705232418/http://ewi.npl.washington.edu/SAGE/|archive-date = 2010-07-05|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment was the [[GALLEX]] neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of &lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;Ga to become radioactive &lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;[[Germanium|Ge]], which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory|SNO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://wwwlapp.in2p3.fr/neutrinos/anexp.html#gallex|title = Neutrino Detectors Experiments: GALLEX|date = 1999-06-26|accessdate = 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallium is also used as a [[liquid metal ion source]] for a [[focused ion beam]]. For example, a focused gallium-ion beam was used to create the world's smallest book, ''[[Teeny Ted from Turnip Town]]''.&lt;ref name=pr&gt;[https://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/news_releases/archives/news04110701.htm "Nano lab produces world's smallest book"]. Simon Fraser University. 11 April 2007.

== History ==
After the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], President Obama announced a drilling moratorium on new permits for offshore wells and exploration in the Gulf of Mexico came to a standstill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama Offshore Drilling Moratorium: Administration Issues New Rule|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/12/obama-offshore-drilling-m_n_643568.html|accessdate=4 September 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Huffington Post|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the suspension, twenty-four deepwater operators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deepwater Horizon Spurs Development of Spill Prevention Systems|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/106319/Deepwater_Horizon_Spurs_Development_of_Spill_Prevention_Systems|website=Rigzone|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; came together to establish well containment resources and plans according to the guidelines set forth in BOEMRE’s (BSEE’s) Notice To Lessees No. 2010-N10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) of Federal Oil and Gas Leases, Outer Continental Shelf|url=http://www.bsee.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Notices-to-Lessees/2010/10-n10/|publisher=United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement|accessdate=4 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930171506/http://www.bsee.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Notices-to-Lessees/2010/10-n10/|archivedate=30 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These offshore oil and gas companies formed HWCG LLC with the common goal of establishing and maintaining the capability to quickly and comprehensively respond to a subsea blowout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOIA president talks safety|url=http://www.oedigital.com/component/k2/item/8702-noia-president-talks-safety|publisher=Offshore Engineer|date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response System Capabilities ==
The consortium’s response system builds on the equipment proven effective in the containment of the Deepwater Horizon blowout, including the [[Helix Fast Response System]] with the Q4000 intervention vessel and Helix Producer 1 from [[Helix Energy Solutions Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kratz|first1=Owen|title=Testimony on Offshore Drilling Safety and Response Technologies|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg65490/pdf/CHRG-112hhrg65490.pdf|publisher=Committee on Science, Space and Technology|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jindo–Jeju  HVDC system'''  is a 105&amp;nbsp;km [[HVDC]] [[submarine power cable|submarine cable]] connection in [[South Korea]] between the island of [[Jindo (island)|Jindo]], close to the [[Korean Peninsula]], and the more distant island of [[Jejudo|Jeju]].  The system has a capacity of 400&amp;nbsp;MW and transmission voltage of ±250&amp;nbsp;kV and was put into service in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2014/7/alstom-grid-energises-jeju-island-in-south-korea/Alstom Grid energises Jeju Island in South Korea]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Alstom Press Release, 7 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the second HVDC link to Jeju Island, after the [[HVDC Haenam–Cheju|Haenam–Cheju]] link completed in the late 1990s (the spelling of the island’s name was changed from Cheju to Jeju in 2000).

The Jindo–Jeju HVDC system is owned and operated by [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (KEPCO).  The cables were designed and built by [[LS Group|LS Cable and System]] and the converter stations were designed and built by [[Alstom]] Grid.

The scheme is [[High-voltage direct current#Bipolar|bipolar]] but unlike the Haenam–Cheju connection, which used a relatively conventional arrangement with two high-voltage cables and a sea return, Jindo–Jeju HVDC system uses metallic return with a total of four cables:  three high-voltage cables and one medium-voltage cable.    The high-voltage cables use mass-impregnated paper as the insulation material while the medium-voltage cable uses [[Cross-linked polyethylene]] (XLPE) insulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dii.unipd.it/~pesavento/download/ISH2009/Papers/Paper-C-46.pdf Development and type tests of HVDC ±250 MIsubmarine cable system], Tae-ho Lee et al,   Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on High Voltage Engineering.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the high-voltage cables are normally used as the respective high-voltage conductors for the two converter poles and the medium-voltage cable is normally used as the neutral return conductor, but the third high-voltage cable is capable of being connected in parallel with, or instead of, any of the other three cables, giving a large number of possible operating modes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.lscns.com/solution/solution0601.asp Project Overview], [[LS Group|LS Cable and System]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HVDC converter station|converter stations]] use Line-Commutated Converters with a conventional arrangement of a single [[HVDC converter#Twelve-pulse bridge|Twelve-pulse bridge]] per pole.

'''''Mad Max 2''''' (originally released in the United States as '''''The Road Warrior''''' and sometimes known as '''''Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior''''') is a 1981 Australian [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[action film]] directed by [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]]. The film is the second installment in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' film series]], with [[Mel Gibson]] reprising his role as [[Max Rockatansky|"Mad" Max Rockatansky]]. The film's tale of a community of settlers who moved to defend themselves against a roving band of [[Banditry|marauders]] follows an archetypical "[[western (genre)|Western]]" frontier movie motif, as does Max's role as a hardened man who rediscovers his humanity when he decides to help the settlers.&lt;ref name=Scheib /&gt; Filming took place in locations around [[Broken Hill]], in the outback of New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madmaxmovies.com/mad-max-2-the-road-warrior/filming-locations/index.html Mad Max 2 / The Road Warrior Filming Locations]. Madmaxmovies.com. Retrieved on 18 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mad Max 2'' was released on 24 December 1981, and received ample critical acclaim. Observers praised the visuals and Gibson's role. Noteworthy elements of the film also include cinematographer [[Dean Semler]]'s widescreen photography of Australia's vast desert landscapes; the sparing use of dialogue throughout the film; costume designer [[Norma Moriceau]]'s punk [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawked]], [[Leather subculture|leather bondage gear]]-wearing bikers; and its fast-paced, tightly edited and violent battle and chase scenes.

The film's comic-book post-apocalyptic/punk style popularized the genre in film and [[fiction]] writing. It was also a box office success, winning the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film|Best International Film]] from six nominations at the [[Saturn Award]] ceremony, including: [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Miller; [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Gibson; [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Bruce Spence]]; [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] for Miller, Hayes and Hannant; and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]] for [[Norma Moriceau]]. ''Mad Max 2'' became a [[cult film]], with fan clubs and "road warrior"-themed activities continuing into the 21st century, and is now widely considered to be [[List of films considered the best#Action|one of the greatest action movies ever made]], as well as one of the greatest sequels ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers polls|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-action-movies-of-all-time-20150114/mad-max-2-the-road-warrior-20150114|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was preceded by ''[[Mad Max]]'' in 1979 and followed by ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'' in 1985 and ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' in 2015.

==Plot==
&lt;!--  Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words.

We don't need a complete scene-by-scene description! :)--&gt;
Traumatised by the death of his family, Max Rockatansky roams the desert wilderness of a post-apocalyptic Australia in a scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special. Scavenging for food and petrol, Max's only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a sawed-off shotgun with scarce ammunition. After driving off a gang led by the unhinged biker warrior Wez, and taking petrol from one of their wrecked vehicles, Max finds a nearby [[gyrocopter]] and decides to collect its fuel. The gyrocopter is boobytrapped, but Max overpowers the pilot hiding nearby, sparing his life upon being told of a small oil refinery nearby in the wasteland. However, upon arriving, Max finds the compound under siege by the Marauders, a motley gang of racers and motorcyclists of which Wez is a member. The Marauders' leader, a large disfigured man called "Lord Humungus", has his gang swarm the complex daily.

Biding his time, Max makes his move when a group of settlers attempt to break out of the compound to find a means to take the fuel tank out of the complex. With the others captured and subjected to torture, rape and death, Max rescues the remaining survivor and offers to get him back to the complex in return for a tank of petrol. The man dies shortly from his wound after Max returns him, and the settlers' leader Papagallo reneges on the deal. The settlers are on the verge of killing Max when the Marauders return and, despite the death of Wez's partner by the metal boomerang of a feral child living within the complex, Humungus offers the settlers safe passage from the territory in exchange for the fuel supply.

Max offers another deal to Papagallo: provide him and the settlers with an abandoned Mack semi-truck found earlier in the film to haul the fuel tanker in exchange for petrol and his freedom. The settlers accept, but keep his car. Max sneaks out with the Feral Kid's help, employing the Gyro Captain's help in reaching the semi. With aerial support, Max drives the semi through the Marauders' encampment into the compound with a livid Humungus refortifying the siege. Though the settlers want Max to escape with them to a beach, Max opts to collect his petrol and leave. However, while attempting to break through the siege, Max is seriously wounded and his car wrecked after being run off the road by Wez in Lord Humungus's nitrous oxide-equipped car. One of Marauders kill Max's dog with a crossbow before Toady's attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special's tanks triggers the car self-destruct, which kills both Marauders during the explosion. Max is left for dead, but the Gyro Captain rescues him and flies him back to the compound.

Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired and now armored truck with the fuel tanker. He leaves the compound, accompanied by the Feral Kid with Papagallo and several of the settlers in armored vehicles to provide protection. Lord Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker, leaving the remaining settlers free to flee the compound in a ramshackle caravan, rigging the compound to explode. After Papagallo and the defenders are killed during the chase, and the Gyro Captain shot down, Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone against the Marauders as Wez boards the truck to kill the two.

However, the semi's head-on collision with Humungus' car kills both him and Wez as the out-of-control truck rolls off the road while the surviving Marauders leave. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees not oil, but sand, leaking from the tank, revealing it to be a decoy which allowed the other settlers to escape with the fuel in oil drums hidden inside their vehicles. With Papagallo dead, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast, where they establish the "Great Northern Tribe". Max remains alone in the desert, once again becoming a drifter while the Feral Kid (as an adult and the Northern Tribe's new leader) is revealed as the narrator, reminiscing about the Road Warrior.

==Cast==
&lt;!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits (6 credited), remaining order and role names per closing credits scroll ---&gt;
* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Max Rockatansky|Max]], a former member of the Australian highway patrol called the Main Force Patrol (MFP). However, after a biker gang kills his family, he leaves the force and hunts down and kills all of the gang members. The trauma transforms him into the embittered, "burnt out... shell of a man". The narration describes him as “the Road Warrior, the man we called Max”, who despite his acerbic nature, elects to assist the settlers in their plan. However once his part is complete, he becomes a drifter once again, choosing not to follow them north.
* [[Bruce Spence]] as the Gyro Captain, a wanderer who looks for fuel and supplies. However, instead of driving a car, the Captain flies in a ramshackle old [[gyrocopter]] powered by a VW air-cooled engine. He, too, decides to throw in his lot with the settlers, and help defend their compound. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s reviewer [[Richard Corliss]] called the Captain "a deranged parody of the World War I aerial ace: scarecrow skinny, gaily clad, sporting a [[James Coburn]] smile with advanced [[caries]]"; despite his quirks, however, the Captain proves to be wily and courageous. After the death of Pappagallo, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as the leader of the settlers.&lt;ref name=POW&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard | last=Corliss | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925397-2,00.html |title=Apocalypse... Pow! |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=10 May 1982 |accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michael Preston|Mike Preston]] as Pappagallo, the idealistic leader of the settlers in the barricaded oil refinery. Even though the settlers' compound is besieged by a violent gang, Pappagallo "...carries the weight of his predicament with swaggering dignity."&lt;ref name=POW /&gt;
* [[Max Phipps]] as the Toadie, the gang [[crier]]. He is an unkempt, bespectacled man. He wears a decorated [[mink]] [[stole (shawl)|stole]] as a hat and has many automobile badges and hood ornaments on his clothes. His behaviour with Lord Humungus and Wez make him a classic [[sycophant]]. Toadie takes pleasure in physically abusing helpless prisoners, but the gang has little respect for him.
* [[Vernon Wells (actor)|Vernon Wells]] as Wez, a mohawked, leather-clad biker who serves as Lord Humungus' lieutenant in the gang. [[Vincent Canby]], the ''New York Times'' reviewer, called the Wez character the "most evil of The Humungus's followers...[a] huge brute who rides around on his bike, snarling psychotically."&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"&gt;{{cite news |first=Vincent |last=Canby |authorlink=Vincent Canby |coauthors= |title=Road Warrior |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3DB103BF93BA15757C0A964948260 |quote=has a film's vision of the post-nuclear-holocaust world seemed quite as desolate and as brutal, or as action-packed and sometimes as funny as in George Miller's apocalyptic ''The Road Warrior,'' an extravagant film fantasy that looks like a sadomasochistic comic book come to life. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=28 April 1982 |accessdate=24 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same [[Danny Peary]] interview, Miller states the characters of Wez and Max are near mirror images of each other, with each being chained by the leaders of their respective camps, and who both find themselves spurred on by the death of a loved one somewhere in their past, in Wez's case the relatively recent death of The Golden Youth at the hand of the Feral Kid.&lt;ref name="thefilmist.wordpress.com" /&gt; In 2011, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine listed Wez as the greatest movie henchman of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/features/top10/movie_henchmen.asp?NID=22096 Top 10 Movie Henchmen]. Empireonline.com. Retrieved on 18 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Emil Minty]] as the [[Feral child|Feral]] Kid, a boy who lives in the wasteland near the refinery settlement. He speaks only in growls and grunts. The boy wears shorts and boots made from hide, and defends himself with a lethal metal boomerang which he can catch using an improvised mail glove.&lt;ref name=POW /&gt; The narration of the opening and closing sequences, provided by [[Harold Baigent]], proves in the closing sequence to be that of the Feral Kid, grown to adulthood by then, and remembering the circumstances of his youthful encounter with "Mad" Max.
* [[Kjell Nilsson (actor)|Kjell Nilsson]] as The Humungus, the violent yet charismatic and articulate leader of a "vicious gang of post-holocaust, motorcycle-riding vandals" who "loot, rape, and kill the few remaining wasteland dwellers". Announced by the Toadie as the "warrior of the wasteland, the Lord Humungus, [and] the ayatollah of rock-and-rollah", The Humungus' "malevolence courses through his huge pectorals, [and] pulses visibly under his bald, sutured scalp."&lt;ref name=POW/&gt; The Humungus' face is never seen, as he wears a hockey goalie's mask. In a 1985 interview with [[Danny Peary]], Miller posited that he thought the character "was a former military officer who suffered severe facial burns," and who "might have served in the same outfit as his counterpart, Pappagallo."&lt;ref name="thefilmist.wordpress.com"&gt;[http://thefilmist.wordpress.com/2009/09/19/danny-peary-on-mad-max-2the-road-warrior/ Danny Peary on "Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior."].

==Production==

===Development===
Following the release of ''[[Mad Max]]'', director [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] received a number of offers from Hollywood, including one to direct ''[[First Blood]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, Miller instead decided to pursue a [[rock and roll]] movie under the working title of ''Roxanne''. After working with writer [[Terry Hayes]] on the [[novelization]] of ''Mad Max'', Miller and Hayes teamed up to write ''Roxanne'' in [[Los Angeles]] but the script was ultimately shelved.&lt;ref name="Loder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loder|first1=Kurt|title=Mad Max: The Heroes of 'Thunderdome'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/the-heroes-of-thunderdome-19850829|accessdate=17 May 2015|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|issue=455|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|date=29 August 1985|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502035843/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/the-heroes-of-thunderdome-19850829|archivedate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then became more intrigued with the idea of returning to the world of ''Mad Max'', as a larger budget would allow him to be more ambitious. "Making ''Mad Max'' was a very unhappy experience for me," said Miller.

The original cut of the film was more bloody and violent, but it was cut down heavily by Australian censors. Entire scenes and sequences were deleted completely or edited to receive an "M" rating. When it was submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] in the United States, two additional scenes (Wez pulling an arrow out of his arm and a close-up shot of him pulling a boomerang out of his dead boyfriend's head) were shortened. Although there is a version of the film that includes the scenes trimmed down for the MPAA, no version without previous cuts exists.&lt;ref name="stratton2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max II / The Road Warrior (1982)|url=http://users.tpg.com.au/boschy69/chopping/titles_m.html#Mad_Max_II|website=[[TPG Telecom]]|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Mad Max 2 (soundtrack)}}

The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Mad Max 2'' was composed and conducted by Australian composer [[Brian May (composer)|Brian May]], who had previously composed the music for the first film. A soundtrack album was released in 1982 by [[Varèse Sarabande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Jerry|title=Movie/TV Soundtracks and Original Cast Recordings Price and Reference Guide|date=2010|publisher=Osborne Enterprises Publishing|location=[[Port Townsend, Washington]]|isbn=0932117376|page=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
When ''Mad Max'' was released in 1980 in the United States, it did not receive a proper release from its distributor, [[American International Pictures]]. AIP was in the final stages of a change of ownership after being bought by [[Filmways|Filmways, Inc.]] a year earlier. AIP's problems affected the release of the film and its box office in the US, although ''Mad Max'' proved much more successful when released internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Mad-Max#tab=summary |title=Mad Max - Box Office Data |work=The Numbers.com |year=2015 |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. decided to release ''Mad Max 2'' in the United States, but they recognised that the first film was not popular in North America. Although the original ''Mad Max'' was becoming popular through cable channel showings, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of its sequel to ''The Road Warrior''. The advertising for the film, including print ads, trailers, and TV commercials, did not refer to the Max character at all, and all shied away from the fact that the film was a sequel. For the majority of viewers, their first inkling of ''Road Warrior'' being a sequel to ''Mad Max'' was when they saw the black and white, archival footage from the previous film, during the prologue.

The film was a commercial success, earning $3.7 million in rentals in Australia. As ''The Road Warrior'' in North America, it was a greater success. The film earned $11.3 million in rentals and $23.6 million in grosses.&lt;ref name="stratton2"/&gt; [[Vestron Video]] capitalized by releasing ''Mad Max'' on video and subtitling it "the thrilling predecessor to ''The Road Warrior''." Despite the title change, grosses from the US release were on par with other countries. Warner Bros. felt comfortable to keep the title of the third ''Mad Max'' film, ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', intact for that film's American release.

===Critical reception===
''Mad Max 2'' received positive reviews and is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/1981.html |title=The Greatest Films of 1981 |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.films101.com/y1981r.htm |title= The Best Movies of 1981 by Rank |publisher=Films101.com |date= |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film holds a 98% rating based on 42 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] {{as of|2017|September|1|lc=y}} with and average rating of 8.4/10 and with the consensus, "''The Road Warrior'' is everything a bigger-budgeted Mad Max sequel should be: bigger, faster, louder, but definitely not dumber."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/road_warrior/ |title= ''The Road Warrior'' Movie Reviews, Pictures |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher = Flixster | date= |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praised its "skillful filmmaking," and called it "a film of pure action, of kinetic energy", which is "one of the most relentlessly aggressive movies ever made". While Ebert pointed out that the film does not develop its "vision of a violent future world ... with characters and dialogue", and uses only the "barest possible bones of a plot", he praised its action sequences. Ebert called the climactic chase sequence "unbelievably well-sustained" and states that the "special effects and stunts...are spectacular", creating a "frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating" effect.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | authorlink=Roger Ebert | coauthors = | title =The Road Warrior | newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = 1 January 1981 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010363/1023 | accessdate =24 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] wrote, "Never has a film's vision of the post-nuclear-holocaust world seemed quite as desolate and as brutal, or as action-packed and sometimes as funny as in George Miller's apocalyptic ''The Road Warrior'', an extravagant film fantasy that looks like a sadomasochistic comic book come to life".&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt; In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', Charles Michener praised Mel Gibson's "easy, unswaggering masculinity", saying that "[his] hint of Down Under humor may be quintessentially Australian but is also the stuff of an international male star".&lt;ref name="michener"&gt;{{cite news | last = Michener | first = Charles | coauthors = | title = ''Shane'' in Black Leather | newspaper = [[Newsweek]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = 31 May 1982 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Arnold, in his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "While he seems to let triumph slip out of his grasp, Miller is still a prodigious talent, capable of a scenic and emotional amplitude that recalls the most stirring attributes in great action directors like [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Sam Peckinpah|Peckinpah]] and [[Sergio Leone|Leone]]".&lt;ref name="arnold"&gt;{{cite news | last = Arnold | first = Gary | coauthors = | title = The ''Warrior'' Western Back on the Road Again | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = 20 August 1982 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] called ''Mad Max 2'' a "mutant" film that was "...sprung from virtually all action genres", creating "...one continuous spurt of energy" by using "jangly, fast editing". However, Kael criticized director George Miller's "attempt to tap into the universal concept of the hero", stating that this attempt "makes the film joyless", "sappy", and "sentimental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kael|first1=Pauline|title=Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior|url=http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/m1.html|website=Geocities.ws|accessdate=18 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328130111/http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/m1.html|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's depiction of a post-apocalyptic future was widely copied by other filmmakers and in science fiction novels, to the point that its gritty "junkyard society of the future look...is almost taken for granted in the modern science-fiction action film."&lt;ref name=Scheib&gt;{{cite web | first=Richard | last=Scheib | title=Mad Max 2 aka The Road Warrior | year=1990 | url=http://www.moria.co.nz/sf/madmax2.htm | accessdate=24 May 2010 | publisher=Moria}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' says that ''Mad Max 2'', "with all its comic-strip energy and vividness...is [[exploitation film|exploitation cinema]] at its most inventive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clute|first1=John|last2=Nicholls|first2=Peter|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|date=November 1995|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=[[London]]|isbn=031213486X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Scheib called ''Mad Max 2'' "one of the few occasions where a sequel makes a dramatic improvement in quality over its predecessor." He said that the film is a "kinetic comic-book of a film," an "exhilarating non-stop rollercoaster ride of a film that contains some of the most exciting stunts and car crashes ever put on screen." Scheib stated that the film transforms the "post-holocaust landscape into the equivalent of a Western frontier," such that "Mel Gibson's Max could just as easily be [[Clint Eastwood]]'s tight-lipped [[Man With No Name]]" helping "decent frightened folk" from the "marauding Redskins".&lt;ref name=Scheib /&gt;

===Awards===
The film received much recognition from the [[Saturn Awards|Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films]]. It won the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film]]. It received additional nominations for [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Director]], [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume Design]]. Mel Gibson and Bruce Spence received nods for [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], respectively. [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] won the Grand Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. ''Mad Max 2'' was also nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] and was awarded the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] award for [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]]. The film was also recognised by the [[1982 Australian Film Institute Awards|Australian Film Institute]], winning awards for best direction, costume design, editing, production design and sound. It received additional nominations for the cinematography and musical score. Despite receiving the most nominations and wins, it was not nominated for Best Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/awards |title= ''Mad Max 2'': Award Wins and Nominations |publisher=IMDb.com |date= |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
{{main|Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture}}
The ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]'' series of films, with their emphasis on [[dystopian]], [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], and [[post-apocalyptic]] themes and imagery, have inspired some artists to recreate the look and feel of some aspects of the series in their work. As well, fan clubs and "road warrior"-themed activities continue into the 21st century. In 2008, ''Mad Max 2'' was selected by ''[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]'' magazine as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/41.asp |title=''Empire's'' The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time |publisher=''Empire'' Magazine |date= |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[The New York Times]]'' placed the film on its ''Best 1000 Movies Ever'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html | newspaper=The New York Times | title=The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made | date=29 April 2003 | accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Mad Max 2'' 93rd on their 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list in 1999, 41st on their updated All-Time 100 Greatest Films in 2013 list, and the character Mad Max as 11th on their list of ''The All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20268279_10,00.html |title=''Entertainment Weekly's'' 20 All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |date= |accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, James Charisma of ''[[Playboy]]'' ranked the film #11 on a list of ''15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals''.&lt;ref name="Playboy"&gt;{{cite web | title = Revenge of the Movie: 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals | publisher = [[Playboy]] | url = http://www.playboy.com/articles/15-sequels-better-than-the-original | author = Charisma, James | date = March 15, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has a permanent legacy in the small town of [[Silverton, New South Wales|Silverton]], which is 25 kilometres from Broken Hill in [[New South Wales]], Australia. A museum dedicated to ''Mad Max 2'' was established in 2010 by Adrian and Linda Bennett, who developed the museum after moving to Silverton and building a collection of ''Mad Max'' props and memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max Museum|url=http://www.silverton.org.au/madmaxmuseum.html|website=Discover SIlverton|publisher=SIlverton Village Committee|accessdate=18 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104191354/http://www.silverton.org.au/madmaxmuseum.html|archivedate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Madden–Julian oscillation''' ('''MJO''') is the largest element of the intraseasonal (30- to 90-day) variability in the tropical atmosphere. It was discovered in 1971 by [[Roland Madden]] and [[Paul Julian (meteorologist)|Paul Julian]] of the American [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR). It is a large-scale coupling between atmospheric circulation and tropical [[deep convection]].&lt;ref name="agu1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first= Chidong |title=Madden-Julian Oscillation |doi=10.1029/2004RG000158 |journal=Rev. Geophys. |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=RG2003 |year=2005 |url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004RG000158|bibcode=2005RvGeo..43.2003Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UEA1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Madden-Julian oscillation forecast research |url=http://envam1.env.uea.ac.uk/mjo.html |publisher=[[University of East Anglia]] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a standing pattern like the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO), the Madden–Julian oscillation is a traveling pattern that propagates eastward at approximately 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;m/s (14 to 29&amp;nbsp;km/h, 9 to 18&amp;nbsp;mph), through the atmosphere above the warm parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. This overall circulation pattern manifests itself most clearly as anomalous [[rain]]fall.

The Madden–Julian oscillation is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of both enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall, observed mainly over the Indian and Pacific Ocean. The anomalous rainfall is usually first evident over the western Indian Ocean, and remains evident as it propagates over the very warm ocean waters of the western and central tropical Pacific. This pattern of tropical rainfall then generally becomes nondescript as it moves over the cooler ocean waters of the eastern Pacific (except over the region of warmer water off the west coast of Central America) but occasionally reappears at low amplitude over the tropical Atlantic and higher amplitude over the Indian Ocean. The wet phase of enhanced convection and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is followed by a dry phase where [[thunderstorm]] activity is suppressed.  Each cycle lasts approximately 30–60 days.  Because of this pattern, the Madden–Julian oscillation is also known as the '''30- to 60-day oscillation''', '''30- to 60-day wave''', or '''intraseasonal oscillation'''.

== Behavior ==
Distinct patterns of lower-level and upper-level atmospheric circulation anomalies accompany the MJO-related pattern of enhanced or decreased tropical rainfall across the tropics. These circulation features extend around the globe and are not confined to only the eastern hemisphere.  The Madden–Julian oscillation moves eastward at between 4&amp;nbsp;m/s (14&amp;nbsp;km/h, 9&amp;nbsp;mph) and 8&amp;nbsp;m/s (29&amp;nbsp;km/h, 18&amp;nbsp;mph) across the tropics, crossing the [[Earth]]'s [[tropics]] in 30 to 60 days—with the active phase of the MJO tracked by the degree of outgoing long wave radiation, which is measured by [[infrared]]-sensing [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[weather satellite]]s.  The lower the amount of outgoing long wave radiation, the stronger the thunderstorm complexes, or convection, is within that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/75949.pdf|title=P1.38 Radiative Energy Budget of African Monsoons: NASA Ceres Observations Versus NOAA NCEP Reanalysis 2 Data|author1=Takmeng Wong |author2=G. Louis Smith |author3=T. Dale Bess  |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enhanced surface (upper level) westerly winds occur near the west (east) side of the active convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap12/mjo.html |first=B. |last=Geerts  |first2=M. |last2=Wheeler |title=The Madden-Julian oscillation|date=May 1998|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocean currents, up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} in depth from the ocean surface, follow in phase with the east-wind component of the surface winds.  In advance, or to the east, of the MJO enhanced activity, winds aloft are westerly.  In its wake, or to the west of the enhanced rainfall area, winds aloft are easterly.  These wind changes aloft are due to the divergence present over the active thunderstorms during the enhanced phase.  Its direct influence can be tracked poleward as far as 30&amp;nbsp;degrees latitude from the equator in both northern and southern hemispheres, propagating outward from its origin near the equator at around 1&amp;nbsp;degree latitude, or {{convert|111|km|mi}}, per day.&lt;ref name="MJOreview"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=122 |pages=814–837 |title=Observations of the 40–50-Day Tropical Oscillation - A Review |author1=Roland A.

==Local effects==

=== Connection to the monsoon===
[[Image:India southwest summer monsoon onset map en.svg|thumb|Onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoon.]]
{{See also|Monsoon|Monsoon trough}}
During the [[Northern Hemisphere]] summer season the MJO-related effects on the Indian and West African summer [[monsoon]] are well documented. MJO-related effects on the North American summer monsoon also occur, though they are relatively weaker.  MJO-related impacts on the North American summer precipitation patterns are strongly linked to meridional (i.e. north–south) adjustments of the precipitation pattern in the eastern tropical Pacific. A strong relationship between the leading [[Mode of variability|mode of intraseasonal variability]] of the North American Monsoon System, the MJO and the points of origin of tropical cyclones is also present.

A period of warming sea surface temperatures are found five to ten days prior to a strengthening of MJO-related precipitation across southern Asia.  A break in the Asian monsoon, normally during the month of July, has been attributed to the Madden–Julian oscillation, after its enhanced phase moves off to the east of the region into the open tropical Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]] |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |title=Ocean Temperatures Affect Intensity of the South Asian Monsoon and Rainfall |work=NASA GSFC |url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20021015monsoon.html |date=2002-11-06 |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730071737/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20021015monsoon.html |archivedate=2009-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Influence on tropical cyclogenesis ===
{{See also|Tropical cyclogenesis}}
Tropical cyclones occur throughout the boreal warm season (typically May–November) in both the north Pacific and the north Atlantic basins—but any given year has periods of enhanced or suppressed activity within the season. Evidence suggests that the Madden–Julian oscillation modulates this activity (particularly for the strongest storms) by providing a large-scale environment that is favorable (or unfavorable) for development.  MJO-related descending motion is not favorable for tropical storm development.  However, MJO-related ascending motion is a favorable pattern for thunderstorm formation within the tropics, which is quite favorable for tropical storm development. As the MJO progresses eastward, the favored region for tropical cyclone activity also shifts eastward from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific and finally to the Atlantic basin.

An inverse relationship exists between tropical cyclone activity in the western north Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for this appears to be the phase of the MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.&lt;ref name="Mad-Jul"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Madden–Julian Oscillation, Barotropic Dynamics, and North Pacific Tropical Cyclone Formation. Part I: Observations |last=Maloney |first=E.D.  |first2=D.L. |last2=Hartmann   | journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]] |date=September 2001 | volume = 58 | issue = 17 | pages = 2545–58 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058&lt;2545:tmjobd&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode = 2001JAtS...58.2545M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While this relationship appears robust, the MJO is one of many factors that contribute to the development of tropical cyclones. For example, sea surface temperatures must be sufficiently warm and vertical wind shear must be sufficiently weak for tropical disturbances to form and persist.&lt;ref name="A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html|title=Subject: A15) How do tropical cyclones form?|accessdate=2008-06-08|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|date=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the MJO also influences these conditions that facilitate or suppress tropical cyclone formation. The MJO is monitored routinely by both the USA [[National Hurricane Center]] and the USA [[Climate Prediction Center]] during the Atlantic hurricane ([[tropical cyclone]]) season to aid in anticipating periods of relative activity or inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Monitoring Intraseasonal Oscillations| author=[[Climate Prediction Center]] |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/intraseasonal/index.html | date=2004-07-08 | accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downstream effects==

=== Link to the El Nino-Southern oscillation ===
{{See also|El Niño Southern Oscillation}}
There is strong year-to-year (interannual) variability in Madden–Julian oscillation activity, with long periods of strong activity followed by periods in which the oscillation is weak or absent. This interannual variability of the MJO is partly linked to the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) cycle. In the Pacific, strong MJO activity is often observed 6 – 12 months prior to the onset of an [[El Niño]] episode, but is virtually absent during the maxima of some El Niño episodes, while MJO activity is typically greater during a [[La Niña]] episode.  Strong events in the Madden–Julian oscillation over a series of months in the western Pacific can speed the development of an El Niño or La Niña but usually do not in themselves lead to the onset of a warm or cold ENSO event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/MJO_1page_factsheet.pdf|title=Madden Julian Oscillation Impacts|author1=Jon Gottschalck  |author2=Wayne Higgins |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2008-02-16|accessdate=2009-07-17|publisher=[[Climate Prediction Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, observations suggest that the 1982-1983 El Niño developed rapidly during July 1982 in direct response to a [[Kelvin wave]] triggered by an MJO event during late May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roundy |first=P.E. |first2=G.N. |last2=Kiladis |title=Analysis of a Reconstructed Oceanic Kelvin Wave Dynamic Height Dataset for the Period 1974–2005 |journal=J.

For example, the surface westerly winds associated with active MJO convection are stronger during advancement toward El Niño and the surface easterly winds associated with the suppressed convective phase are stronger during advancement toward La Nina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roundy |first=P.E. |first2=J.R. |last2=Kravitz |title=The Association of the Evolution of Intraseasonal Oscillations to ENSO Phase |journal=J.

=== North American winter precipitation ===
{{See also|Effects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation in the United States|United States rainfall climatology}}

The strongest impacts of intraseasonal variability on the [[United States]] occur during the winter months over the western U.S. During the winter this region receives the bulk of its annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Storms in this region can last for several days or more and are often accompanied by persistent [[atmospheric circulation]] features. Of particular concern are extreme precipitation events linked to [[flood]]ing. Strong evidence suggests a link between weather and climate in this region from studies that have related the El Niño Southern Oscillation to regional precipitation variability. In the tropical Pacific, winters with weak-to-moderate cold, or La Nina, episodes or ENSO-neutral conditions are often characterized by enhanced 30- to 60-day Madden–Julian oscillation activity. A recent example is the winter of 1996–97, which featured heavy flooding in California and in the Pacific Northwest (estimated damage costs of $2.0–3.0 billion at the time of the event) and a very active MJO. Such winters are also characterized by relatively small sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific compared to stronger warm and cold episodes. In these winters, there is a stronger link between the MJO events and extreme west coast precipitation events.

====Pineapple Express events ====
{{Main|Pineapple Express}}
[[File:Mjo north america rain.png|thumb|350px|The ''Pineapple Express'', an MJO effect on North American weather patterns.]]
The typical scenario linking the pattern of tropical rainfall associated with the MJO to extreme precipitation events in the Pacific Northwest features a progressive (i.e. eastward moving) circulation pattern in the tropics and a retrograding (i.e. westward moving) circulation pattern in the mid latitudes of the North Pacific. Typical wintertime weather anomalies preceding heavy precipitation events in the Pacific Northwest are as follows:&lt;ref name="PACNW"/&gt;

# ''7–10 days prior to the heavy precipitation event:'' Heavy tropical rainfall associated with the MJO shifts eastward from the eastern Indian Ocean to the western tropical Pacific. A moisture plume extends northeastward from the western tropical Pacific towards the general vicinity of the [[Hawaii]]an Islands. A strong blocking anticyclone is located in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] with a strong [[Jet stream|polar jet stream]] around its northern flank.&lt;ref name="PACNW"/&gt;
# ''3–5 days prior to the heavy precipitation event:'' Heavy tropical rainfall shifts eastward towards the date line and begins to diminish. The associated moisture plume extends further to the northeast, often traversing the Hawaiian Islands. The strong blocking high weakens and shifts westward. A split in the North Pacific [[jet stream]] develops, characterized by an increase in the amplitude and areal extent of the upper tropospheric westerly zonal winds on the southern flank of the block and a decrease on its northern flank. The tropical and extra tropical circulation patterns begin to "phase", allowing a developing mid latitude trough to tap the moisture plume extending from the deep tropics.&lt;ref name="PACNW"/&gt;
# ''The heavy precipitation event:'' As the pattern of enhanced tropical rainfall continues to shift further to the east and weaken, the deep tropical moisture plume extends from the subtropical central Pacific into the mid latitude trough now located off the west coast of North America. The [[jet stream]] at upper levels extends across the North Pacific with the mean jet position entering North America in the northwestern United States. The deep low pressure located near the Pacific Northwest coast can bring up to several days of heavy rain and possible flooding. These events are often referred to as [[Pineapple Express]] events, so named because a significant amount of the deep tropical moisture traverses the Hawaiian Islands on its way towards western North America.&lt;ref name="PACNW"/&gt;

Throughout this evolution, retrogression of the large-scale atmospheric circulation features is observed in the eastern Pacific–North American sector. Many of these events are characterized by the progression of the heaviest precipitation from south to north along the Pacific Northwest coast over a period of several days to more than one week. However, it is important to differentiate the individual [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]]-scale storms, which generally move west to east, from the overall large-scale pattern, which exhibits retrogression.&lt;ref name="PACNW"/&gt;

A coherent simultaneous relationship exists between the longitudinal position of maximum MJO-related rainfall and the location of extreme west coast precipitation events. Extreme events in the Pacific Northwest are accompanied by enhanced precipitation over the western tropical Pacific and the region of [[Southeast Asia]] called by meteorologists the [[Maritime Continent]], with suppressed precipitation over the Indian Ocean and the central Pacific. As the region of interest shifts from the Pacific Northwest to [[California]], the region of enhanced tropical precipitation shifts further to the east. For example, extreme rainfall events in southern California are typically accompanied by enhanced precipitation near 170°E. However, it is important to note that the overall link between the MJO and extreme west coast precipitation events weakens as the region of interest shifts southward along the west coast of the United States.&lt;ref name="PACNW"/&gt;

There is case-to-case variability in the amplitude and longitudinal extent of the MJO-related precipitation, so this should be viewed as a general relationship only.&lt;ref name="PACNW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/intraseasonal/intraseasonal_faq.html#usimpacts|title=What are the impacts of intraseasonal oscillations on the U.S.?

'''''Maritime Jewel''''' was a [[double-hulled]] [[oil tanker]] launched in 1999 and completed in 2000. Entering service that year, the ship was known as '''MV ''Limburg''''' unti 2003. The {{convert|332.0|m|ft|adj=on|1}} ship carried [[crude oil]] between ports in Iran and Malaysia. In 2002 ''Limburg'' was attacked by suicide bombers, causing roughly {{convert|90000|oilbbl}} to leak into the [[Gulf of Aden]]. One crew member was killed and twelve more wounded in the attack. Four days after the attack, the tanker was towed to [[Dubai]] where she was repaired and renamed ''Maritime Jewel''. ''Maritime Jewel'' was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap at [[Chittagong]], Bangladesh on 15 May 2018.

==History==
''Limburg''{{'}}s [[keel]] was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 24 May 1999 and the ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 28 August 1999. ''Limburg'' was completed on 5 January 2000 and entered service that year.&lt;ref name=miramar/&gt;

===Bombing===
On 6 October 2002, ''Limburg'' was carrying {{convert|397000|oilbbl|m3}} of [[crude oil]] from Iran to Malaysia, and was in the [[Gulf of Aden]] off Yemen to pick up another load of oil. She was [[Ship registry|registered]] under a French flag and had been chartered by the Malaysian petrol firm [[Petronas]]. While she was some distance offshore, suicide bombers rammed an explosives-laden [[dinghy]] into the [[starboard]] side of the tanker.&lt;ref name="savage.plea"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/us/guantanamo-detainee-ahmed-muhammed-haza-al-darbi.html?_r=0  |first=Charles |last=Savage |title=Guantánamo Detainee Pleads Guilty in 2002 Attack on Tanker Off Yemen |work=The New York Times |date=20 February 2014 |accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon detonation the vessel caught fire and approximately {{convert|90000|oilbbl}} of oil leaked into the Gulf of Aden.&lt;ref name=OilandGasIndustryTerrorismMonitorMVLimburg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ogi-tm.com/ogi_threats_st.php |title=A Synopsis of the Terrorist Threat Facing the O&amp;G Industry |work=[[Oil and Gas Industry Terrorism Monitor]] |accessdate=26 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325231204/http://www.ogi-tm.com/ogi_threats_st.php |archivedate=25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HomeOfficeLimburg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-publications/publication-search/prevention-terrorism-act-2005/Paper1?view=Binary  |title=International Terrorism: The Threat |publisher=[[Home Office|United Kingdom Home Office]]  |accessdate=26 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Yemeni officials initially claimed that the explosion was caused by an accident, later investigations found traces of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] on the damaged ship.

====Responsibility====
[[Al Qaeda]] claimed responsibility for the attack on the Jehad.net website, which has since been shut down. [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]], who allegedly also planned the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]], was thought{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have been the mastermind of the attack. [[Osama bin Laden]] issued a statement, which read:
{{quote|By exploding the oil tanker in Yemen, the holy warriors hit the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community, reminding the enemy of the heavy cost of blood and the gravity of losses they will pay as a price for their continued aggression on our community and looting of our wealth.&lt;ref name=MIPT2006/&gt;}} 

On 3 February 2006, [[Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeiee]], who had been sentenced to death for the ''Limburg'' attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harsher Sentences Awarded and Appeals Rejected in Yemen's Terrorism Trial|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/05SANAA276_a.html|website=wikileaks|accessdate=27 September 2016|date=12 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 22 other suspected or convicted Al-Qaeda members escaped from jail in Yemen. Among them was [[Jamal al-Badawi]], who masterminded the USS ''Cole'' bombing of 12 October 2000. Of the 23 escapees, 13 had been convicted of the ''Cole'' and ''Limburg'' bombings.&lt;ref name=Bbc20060204&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4682214.stm  | title=Hunt on for Yemeni jailbreakers | work=[[BBC News]] | date= 4 February 2006

One of al-Rabeiee's accomplices was also arrested during the raids. In February 2014 [[Ahmed al-Darbi]] pleaded guilty before the [[Guantanamo military commission]] to helping plan several maritime terrorist attacks including the ''Limburg'' attack. By the time of the attack, al-Darbi was already detained at Guantanamo.&lt;ref name="savage.plea"/&gt;

'''Millstones''' or '''mill stones''' are stones used in [[gristmill]]s, for grinding [[wheat]] or other grains.

Millstones come in pairs. The base or ''bedstone'' is stationary. Above the bedstone is the turning ''runner stone'' which actually does the grinding. The runner stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the "scissoring" or grinding action of the stones. A runner stone is generally slightly [[wikt:concave|concave]], while the bedstone is slightly [[wikt:convex|convex]]. This helps to channel the ground flour to the outer edges of the stones where it can be gathered up.

The runner stone is supported by a cross-shaped metal piece ([[millrind|rind]] or rynd) fixed to a "mace head" topping the main shaft or spindle leading to the driving mechanism of the mill ([[windmill|wind]], [[watermill|water]] (including [[tide mill|tide]]) or other means).

== History ==
[[File:A forgotten industry -Millstone Factory site - geograph.org.uk - 641950.jpg|thumb|Millstone factory site in Britain]]
[[Neolithic]] and [[Upper Paleolithic]] people used millstones to grind [[grain]]s, nuts, [[rhizomes]] and other vegetable food products for consumption.&lt;ref name="Revedin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Revedin | first1 = A | last2 = Aranguren | first2 = B | last3 = Becattini | first3 = R | last4 = Longo | first4 = L | last5 = Marconi | first5 = E | last6 = Lippi | first6 = MM | last7 = Skakun | first7 = N | last8 = Sinitsyn | first8 = A | last9 = Spiridonova | first9 = E | last10 = Svoboda | first10 = J. | year = 2010 | title = Thirty thousand-year-old evidence of plant food processing | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | issue = 44| pages = 18815–18819 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1006993107 | pmid = 20956317 | pmc=2973873 | bibcode=2010PNAS..10718815R|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These implements are often called '''grinding stones'''. They used either [[Quern-stone#Saddle_quern|saddle stones]]  or rotary [[Quern-stone|quern]]s turned by hand. Such devices were also used to grind pigments and metal ores prior to [[smelting]].

In India, grinding stones (''Chakki'') were used to grind grains and spices. These consist of a stationary stone cylinder upon which a smaller stone cylinder rotates. Smaller ones, for household use, were operated by two people. Larger ones, for community or commercial use, used livestock to rotate the upper cylinder.

== Material ==
[[Image:BuhrStone.JPG|thumb|right|Buhr stone with resurfacing instructions]]
The type of stone most suitable for making millstones is a [[siliceous rock]] called [[wikt:burrstone|burrstone]] (or buhrstone), an open-textured, porous but tough, fine-grained [[sandstone]], or a silicified, fossiliferous [[limestone]]. In some sandstones, the cement is [[calcareous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bucksch | first = Herbert | authorlink = | title = Dictionary Geotechnical Engineering, Vol. 1 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1997 | location = | pages = 80 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-3-540-58164-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millstones used in Britain were commonly of two types:

* [[Derbyshire]] Peak stones of grey [[Millstone Grit]], cut from one piece, used for grinding [[barley]]; imitation Derbyshire Peak stones are used as decorative signposts at the boundaries of the [[Peak District National Park]]. Derbyshire Peak stones wear quickly and are typically used to grind animal feed since they leave stone powder in the flour, making it undesirable for human consumption.
* French burrstones, used for finer grinding. French Burr comes from the [[Marne Valley]] in northern France. The millstones are not cut from one piece, but built up from sections of quartz cemented together, backed with [[plaster]] and bound with [[Shrink-fitting|shrink-fit]] iron bands. Slots in the bands provide attachments for lifting.  In southern England the material was imported as pieces of rock, only assembled into complete millstones in local workshops.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Geoff |title=Thorrington Tide Mill |date=2003 |publisher=Essex County Council |isbn=185281-232-X |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, a third type of millstone was used. These were uncommon in Britain, but not unknown:

* ''Cullen stones'', (stones from [[Cologne]]), a form of black [[lava]] quarried in the [[Rhine Province#Mineral resources|Rhine Valley]] at [[Mayen]] near Cologne, Germany.&lt;ref name=Cullen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakscan.freeuk.com/geology.htm |title=Peak District Millstones |publisher=Stephen N Wood |accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aikin |first1=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Aikin|title=On Corn Mills |journal=Transactions |date=1838 |volume=51 |page=121 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patterning==
[[Image:Walderveense molen steenbillen.jpg|upright|thumb|Dressing a millstone]]
The surface of a millstone is divided by deep grooves called ''furrows'' into separate flat areas called ''lands''. Spreading away from the furrows are smaller grooves called ''feathering'' or ''cracking''. The grooves provide a cutting edge and help to channel the ground flour out from the stones.

The furrows and lands are arranged in repeating patterns called ''harps''. A typical millstone will have six, eight or ten harps. The pattern of harps is repeated on the face of each stone, when they are laid face to face the patterns mesh in a kind of "scissoring" motion creating the cutting or grinding function of the stones. When in regular use stones need to be ''dressed'' periodically, that is, re-cut to keep the cutting surfaces sharp.

Millstones need to be evenly balanced, and achieving the correct separation of the stones is crucial to producing good quality flour. The experienced miller will be able to adjust their separation very accurately.

Grain is fed by gravity from the hopper into the feed-shoe. The shoe is agitated by a shoe handle running against an agitator (''damsel'') on the stone ''spindle'', the shaft powering the runner stone. This mechanism regulates the feed of grain to the millstones by making the feed dependent on the speed of the runner stone. From the feed shoe the grain falls through the ''eye'', the central hole, of the runner stone and is taken between the runner and the bed stone to be ground. The flour exits from between the stones from the side. The stone casing prevents the flour from falling on the floor, instead it is taken to the ''meal spout'' from where it can be bagged or processed further. 
[[File:Minalinpampangajf2520 05.JPG|thumb|right|Gilingang bato (ancient rice millstone, [[Minalin, Pampanga]], [[Philippines]])]]
The runner stone is supported by the [[millrind|rind]], a cross-shaped metal piece, on the spindle. The spindle is carried by the ''tentering gear'', a set of beams forming a lever system, or a [[Jackscrew|screw jack]], with which the runner stone can be lifted or lowered slightly and the gap between the stones adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2003) p 19&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the runner stone is significant (up to {{convert|1500|kg|lb}}) and it is this weight combined with the cutting action from the porous stone and the patterning that causes the milling process.

Millstones for some water-powered mills (such as [[Peirce Mill]]) spin at about 125 rpm.&lt;ref name="NPS Peirce Mill"&gt;NPS publication "Peirce Mill" GPO: 2004--304-337/00145 Reprint 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in the case of wind-powered mills the turning speed can be irregular. Higher speed means more grain is fed to the stones by the feed-shoe, and grain exits the stones more quickly because of their faster turning speed. The miller has to reduce the gap between the stones so more weight of the runner presses down on the grain and the grinding action is increased to prevent the grain being ground too coarsely. It has the added benefit of increasing the load on the mill and so slowing it down. In the reverse case the miller may have to raise the runner stone if the grain is milled too thoroughly making it unsuitable for baking. In any case the stones should never touch during milling as this would cause them to wear down rapidly. The process of lowering and raising the runner stone is called tentering and lightering. In many windmills it is automated by adding a [[governor (device)|centrifugal governor]] to the tentering gear.
Depending on the type of grain to be milled and the power available the miller may adjust the feed of grain to stones beforehand by changing the amount of agitation of the feed-shoe or adjusting the size of the hopper outlet.
Milling by millstones is a one-step process in contrast with roller mills in modern mass production where milling takes place in many steps. It produces wholemeal flour which can be turned into white flour by sifting to remove the bran.

The '''minor tetra''' (''Hyphessobrycon minor'') is a small fish from the [[Essequibo River]] in [[Guyana]] in South America, closely resembling its relative, the [[serpae tetra]], from the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] and [[Paraguay Basin|Paraguay]]. These two very similar species are separated geographically, so they would not interbreed.

'''Montan wax''', also known as '''lignite wax''' or '''OP wax''', is a hard [[wax]] obtained by [[solvent]] extraction of certain types of [[lignite]] or brown [[coal]]. Commercially viable deposits exist in only a few locations, including [[Amsdorf]], [[Germany]], and in the Ione Basin near [[Ione, California]]. High-graded lignite wax are also found in Yunnan and Jilin, China. 

==Properties==
Its color ranges from dark brown to light yellow when crude, or white when refined. Its composition is non-[[glyceride]] long-chain (C&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;–C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;) [[carboxylic acid]] [[ester]]s (62–68 weight %), free long-chain [[organic acid]]s (22–26%), long-chain [[alcohol]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[hydrocarbon]]s (7–15%), and [[resin]]s; it is in effect a [[fossil|fossilized]] plant wax. Its melting range is 82–95 °C.

==Uses==
It is used for making car and shoe polishes, paints, and [[phonograph]] records, and as [[lubricant]] for molding paper and plastics. About a third of total world production is used in car polish. Formerly, its main use was making [[carbon paper]]. Unrefined montan wax contains [[asphalt]] and resins, which can be removed by refining. Montan wax in polishes improves scuff resistance, increases water repellence, and imparts high gloss.

The larger combined project involves the construction of the Moragahakanda Dam and Reservoir, along with the separate [[Kalu Ganga Dam|Kalu Ganga Dam and Reservoir]], for [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectricity|power generation]] purposes. Both these sites would be located approximately {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart.&lt;ref name=Treasury.gov.lk&gt;{{cite web|title=Moragahakanda and Kaluganga Development Project|url=http://www.treasury.gov.lk/depts/npd/publications/projecpipeline-chap/Irrigation.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Finance and Planning (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Finance and Planning]]|accessdate=14 January 2014|page=2|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116084626/http://www.treasury.gov.lk/depts/npd/publications/projecpipeline-chap/Irrigation.pdf|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total development cost for both sites totals to approximately {{Nowrap|[[Sri Lankan rupees|Rs.]] 48.145 billion}} (approximately {{Nowrap|US$370 million}}) and is being carried out by [[SMEC Holdings]] and [[Sinohydro]].&lt;ref name=SMEC&gt;{{cite web|title=SMEC Wins Major Project with World’s Largest Hydroelectric Company|url=http://www.smec.com/about-smec/media/smec-wins-major-project-with-world-s-largest-hydroelectric-company|publisher=[[SMEC Holdings]]|accessdate=14 January 2014|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LankaNewspapers&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda project on schedule|url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2014/1/86327.html|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=LankaNewspapers.com|date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyNews1&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda multi purpose project construction on track|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2013/06/03/bus19.asp|accessdate=14 January 2014|date=3 June 2013|author=Shirajiv Sirimane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The original Moragahakanda reservoir was first constructed by King [[Vasabha of Anuradhapura|Wasaba]] in 111 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda : Biggest yahapalana hybrid project |url=http://www.pmdnews.lk/moragahakanda-biggest-yahapalana-hybrid-project/|publisher=President's media division|date=20 February 2017|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahaweli Development programme===
According to the [[Mahaweli Development programme|Mahaweli Master Plan]] of 1968, the development of Mahaweli was divided to three projects named A, B and C out of which the last 'C' project was the Moragahakanda Multi-Purpose Reservoir. In 1977 the project was modified and the Accelerated Mahaweli Scheme(AMS) started and was completed in 6 years. However Moragahakanda was not in the AMS. The J.R. Jayewardene Government would later secure funding for the project from Japan but communal violence delayed the project. The project finally commenced in January 2007 by President [[Mahinda_Rajapaksa]] and Construction of the dam was completed in 2018.

== Dam and reservoir ==
The Moragahakanda Dam, will be a {{Convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high [[gravity dam]]. The dam will create the Moragahakanda Reservoir, which will have an active storage capacity of {{Convert|521000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of water,&lt;ref name=SundayObserver1&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda project will be completed ahead of schedule|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/11/18/fea06.asp|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]|date=18 November 2012|author=Shirajiv Sirimane}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a surface elevation of {{Convert|185|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=TheNation1&gt;{{cite news|title=Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga development projects, the last phase of the Accelerated Mahaweli Programme|url=http://www.nation.lk/2007/01/28/newsfe3.htm|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Nation (Sri Lanka)|The Nation]]|date=28 January 2007|author=Ravi Ladduwahetty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two additional [[embankment dam|embankment]] [[saddle dam]]s will also be built to contain the Moragahakanda Reservoir. The reservoir of the [[Kalu Ganga Dam]] will be linked via tunnel.&lt;ref name=ITNnews.lk /&gt;&lt;ref name=TheNation1 /&gt;

== Primary uses ==
[[File:Moragahakanda reservoir at dam construction site.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Moragahakanda Reservoir in February 2017.]]

=== Irrigation ===
Water from both, the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoirs, will be primarily used to support agricultural needs to an area of at least {{Convert|81422|ha|km2|1|abbr=on}}. This will increase [[rice]] production by 81% or {{Convert|109000|MT|lb|abbr=on}}, amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of {{Nowrap|[[United States dollar|US$]]1.67 million}}, annually.&lt;ref name=SundayObserver1 /&gt;

=== Inland fishing ===
The reservoirs would also create a source of inland fishing, generating approximately {{Convert|4700|MT|lb|abbr=on}} or the monetary equivalent of {{Nowrap|US$1.67 million}}, annually.&lt;ref name=SundayObserver1 /&gt;

=== Water supply ===
Along with the reservoir of the Kalu Ganga Dam, an increase of {{Convert|64000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of [[drinking water|potable]] and industrial water supply could be ensured by 2032, to regions including [[Matale]], [[Anuradhapura]], [[Trincomalee]], and [[Polonnaruwa]].&lt;ref name=SundayObserver1 /&gt;

=== Power generation ===
Water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir will be used to power the {{Nowrap|25-[[megawatt]]}} Moragahakanda Hydroelectric Power Station, also currently under construction. The substitution of this hydropower with traditional [[fossil fuel]] power generation is estimated to save up to {{Nowrap|US$ 2.49 billion}} annually.&lt;ref name=SundayObserver1 /&gt;

Construction of the power station costs {{Nowrap|US$382 million}}, with an {{Nowrap|[[Economic Internal rate of return|EIRR]] (Economic Internal Rate of Return) of 22%}}.&lt;ref name=TheNation1 /&gt;

== Roads and bridges ==
The construction of the dam and reservoir also required the construction of multiple access roads and rerouting of existing main roads, as well as the construction of the {{Convert|300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long Moragahakanda Bridge costing {{Nowrap|[[Sri Lankan rupee|Rs.]] 308 million}}.&lt;ref name=Target.lk&gt;{{cite web|title=President inspects progress of Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga project|url=http://www.target.lk/article.php?article=759|publisher=Target.lk|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Rename==
On 23 July 2018, under the patronage of president Maithreepala Sirisena, the reservoir has been officially named as '''''Kulasinghe Reservoir''''', in memory of late Dr. A.N.S Kulasinghe. Deshabandu Dr. A.N.S Kulasinghe was a Sri Lankan Civil Engineer who served in several projects throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsfirst.lk/2018/07/23/morgahakanda-reservoir-named-kulasinghe-reservoir/ |title=Morgahakanda Reservoir named “Kulasinghe Reservoir” |publisher=Newsfirst|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''muon neutrino''' is a [[lepton]], an  [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[subatomic particle]] which has the symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and no net [[electric charge]]. Together with the [[muon]] it forms the second [[generation (physics)|generation]] of leptons, hence the name muon [[neutrino]]. It was first hypothesized in the early 1940s by several people, and was discovered in 1962 by [[Leon Lederman]], [[Melvin Schwartz]] and [[Jack Steinberger]]. The discovery was rewarded with the 1988 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

==Discovery==
In 1962 [[Leon M. Lederman]], [[Melvin Schwartz]] and [[Jack Steinberger]] established by performing an experiment at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]&lt;ref name="slac.stanford.edu"&gt;

==Speed==
{{Main|Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly}}
In September 2011 [[OPERA experiment|OPERA]] researchers reported that muon neutrinos were apparently traveling at [[faster-than-light|faster]] than [[lightspeed|light]] speed. This result was confirmed again in a second experiment in November 2011. These results have been viewed skeptically by the scientific community at large, and more experiments have/are investigating the phenomenon. In March 2012 the [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS]] team published results directly contradicting the results of OPERA.&lt;ref name=ICARUS&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1203.3433|last1 = Anicin|first1 = Ivan V.|last2 = Aprili|first2 = P.|last3 = Baiboussinov|first3 = B.|last4 = Baldo Ceolin|first4 = M.|last5 = Benetti|first5 = P.|last6 = Calligarich|first6 = E.|last7 = Canci|first7 = N.|last8 = Centro|first8 = S.|last9 = Cesana|first9 = A.|last10 = Cieślik|first10 = K.|last11 = Cline|first11 = D.B.|last12 = Cocco|first12 = A.G.|last13 = Dabrowska|first13 = A.|last14 = Dequal|first14 = D.|last15 = Dermenev|first15 = A.|last16 = Dolfini|first16 = R.|last17 = Farnese|first17 = C.|last18 = Fava|first18 = A.|last19 = Ferrari|first19 = A.|last20 = Fiorillo|first20 = G.|last21 = Gibin|first21 = D.|last22 = Gigli Berzolari|first22 = A.|last23 = Gninenko|first23 = S.|last24 = Guglielmi|first24 = A.|last25 = Haranczyk|first25 = M.|last26 = Holeczek|first26 = J.|last27 = Ivashkin|first27 = A.|last28 = Kisiel|first28 = J.|last29 = Kochanek|first29 = I.|last30 = Lagoda|first30 = J.|title = Measurement of the neutrino velocity with the ICARUS detector at the CNGS beam|journal = Physics Letters B|volume = 713|issue = 1|pages = 17–22|year = 2012|doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2012.05.033|displayauthors = 29|bibcode = 2012PhLB..713...17A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in July 2012, the apparent anomalous super-luminous propagation of neutrinos was traced to a faulty element of the fibre optic timing system in Gran-Sasso. After it was corrected the neutrinos appeared to travel with the speed of light within the errors of the experiment.&lt;ref name=Cern2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2011/09/opera-experiment-reports-anomaly-flight-time-neutrinos-cern-gran-sasso|title=OPERA experiment reports anomaly in flight time of neutrinos from CERN to Gran Sasso (UPDATE 8 June 2012)|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=8 June 2012|work=CERN press office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6143">The '''Natural Forest Standard''' (NFS) is a voluntary carbon standard designed specifically for medium- to large-scale [[REDD+]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.naturalforeststandard.com/|website=Natural Forest Standard|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard places equal emphasis on the combined carbon, social and biodiversity benefits of a project and requires a holistic approach to ensure compliance with the standards requirements and to achieve certification.  The NFS applies a standardised risk-based approach to carbon quantification for consistent and comparable baseline calculations and aims to link local actions into national frameworks for reducing the loss of natural forests.

The NFS excludes commercial resource extraction and focuses on promoting the conservation of natural forests and the biodiversity and social values within them.  The NFS requires projects to ensure no net [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and to establish an appropriate benefit distribution mechanism to deliver social benefits to communities within the project area.
The NFS demands annual verification by independent third-party carbon auditors using the ISO14064-3 and ISO 14065 frameworks.  The resulting certificates for fully verified projects are issued as Natural Capital Credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Credits|url=http://www.naturalforeststandard.com/about-us/features-of-the-nfs/natural-capital-credits/|website=Natural Forest Standard|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Standard==

The NFS was developed in 2011 by Ecosystem Certification Organisation Ltd (ECO), a UK-based not-for-profit organisation, and [[Ecometrica]], the sustainability and earth observation software company based in Edinburgh.  The development process included engaging independent expert reviewers for comment and contribution to the standard requirements and methodology.  The standard documentation was open for public consultation from 8 August to 12 October 2012 and again from 7 May to 31 July 2013.

==Natural Capital Credits==

Natural Capital Credits (NCCs) are the carbon units generated by NFS projects and represent the combination of net positive environmental impacts achieved by the project.  The carbon benefits are quantified using the programmatic risk-based methodology; as such NCCs are denoted in tonnes of CO2e, however the term Natural Capital Credit more accurately reflects the combined values and benefits of the all-encompassing approach of the NFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naturalforeststandard.com/about-us/features-of-the-nfs/natural-capital-credits/|title=Natural Capital Credits|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural Forest Standard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

The methodology adopted by the NFS is based on a standardised risk-based approach and is suitable for medium- to large-scale project application.  The methodology NFS AM001, does not involve predicting land use changes in specific places at specific times, but applies a risk-based approach to baseline quantification which allows for a programmatic approach to reducing emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tipper|first1=Richard|last2=Neha|first2=Joshi|last3=Clunas|first3=Catriona|title=Risk Based Methodology for Quantifying Natural Capital Credits Issued to Projects Operating under the Natural Forest Standard, with application in Amazonia|url=http://www.naturalforeststandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NFS-AM001.1b-Risk-Based-Methodology-for-NCC-Quantification-19062014.pdf|website=Natural Forest Standard|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows efficient, valid and comparable results to be produced akin to performance benchmarking, where projects within a given region can use a consistent set of baseline data and accounting methods which provides a standardised approach to quantification of carbon benefits and is based on forest at risk and not a percentage or absolute rate of loss.

The methodology allows a combination of remote sensing and ground-based data as monitoring sources for monitoring the emissions from the project areas, with emphasis placed on satellite monitoring, such as [[PRODES]] for application in Amazonia.

==Verification requirements==

The NFS requires that projects are independently, third-party validated and verified using [[ISO 14064]]-3 and ISO 14065 frameworks, carried out by industry-recognised, specialist VVB organisations.  Projects achieve certification following successful completion of this verification process, and upon confirmation of the carbon assertions by the VVB, in compliance with the standard’s requirements.

==Normative Biodiversity Metric==

The NFS requires project developers to use the Normative Biodiversity Metric to assess the biodiversity within a project area. The Normative Biodiversity Metric (NBM) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarrett|first1=David|title=Assessing Organisational Biodiversity Performance|url=http://ecometrica.com/assets/assessing_organisational_performance.pdf|website=Ecometrica|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a practical method of assessing the biodiversity value of a given area. The NBM is similar to the concepts of habitat hectares &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkes|first1=David|last2=Newell|first2=Graeme|last3=Cheal|first3=David|title=Assessing the quality of native vegetation: The ‘habitat hectares’ approach.|journal=Ecological  Management &amp; Restoration|date=2003|volume=4|page=S29-S38|doi=10.1046/j.1442-8903.4.s.4.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mean species abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alkemade|first1=Rob|last2=van Oorschot|first2=Mark|last3=Miles|first3=Lera|last4=Nellemann|first4=Christian|last5=Bakkenes|first5=Michel|last6=ten Brink|first6=Ben|title=GLOBIO3: A Framework to Investigate Options for Reducing Global Terrestrial Biodiversity Loss|journal=Ecosystems|date=2009|volume=12|issue=3|pages=374–390|doi=10.1007/s10021-009-9229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nordex SE''' is a European company that designs, sells and manufactures [[wind turbine]]s. The company's  headquarters is located in the German city of [[Rostock]] while management is situated in [[Hamburg]]. Production takes place in Rostock as well as in China and for a brief time in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[url=http://talkbusiness.net/2014/06/trinity-industries-re-open-nordex-factory-jonesboro/ Trinity Industries To Locate Railcar Facility At Nordex Factory In Jonesboro]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded in 1985 in [[Give (Denmark)|Give]], [[Denmark]]. Since then the company steadily grew. In 1995 Nordex was the first company to mass-produce a 1 MW turbine booster

== Wind turbines ==
[[File:Scout Moor Wind Turbine No 25 goes live - geograph.org.uk - 754136.jpg|thumb|left|Nordex N80, [[Scout Moor wind farm]]]]
Currently Nordex manufactures two platforms of wind turbines, rated at 2.4 and 3.3 MW.

In Europe, Africa and North America Nordex manufactures and sells the Gamma series, a product family comprising the N90/2500, the N100/2500 and the N117/2400. The N90/2500 is a turbine being developed for strong winds. The N100/2500 consists of two versions, Highspeed and Lowspeed, the first one for rather windy locations, the second for medium wind conditions. The N117/2400 was designed especially for low-wind regions (IEC 3). The [[hub height]] of the 2.4-2.5 MW windturbines reaches from 65 meters for the N90/2500 to 141 meters for the low wind version of the N117/2400.

=== Delta-Class ===
[[File:Windturbine HamburgWasser Steinwerder 01.jpg|thumb|Delta-Class-Turbine]]
In 2013 Nordex launched the Delta-Class-Series, entering series production in January 2014 with prototypes installed in mid-2013. There will be two new types of turbines, the N100/3300 strong-wind turbine and the N117/3000, which is designed for medium-wind sites. Both turbines feature the rotorblades already used in the Gamma-Series, with the rotorblades of the N117 being slightly upgraded to withstand the higher wind speeds in IEC wind class 2a. Both turbines are equipped with a three-stage gearbox and a doubly fed asynchronous generator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1169324/Close---Nordex-launches-Delta-turbine-series-EWEA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordex-online.com/fileadmin/MEDIA/Kundenzeitschrift/EN/Nordex-Magazin_360_01_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The established '''nuclear industry in South Australia''' is focused on [[uranium mining]], milling and the export of uranium oxide concentrate for use in the production of nuclear fuel for [[nuclear power plant]]s. The state is home to the world's largest known single deposit of uranium, which is worked by [[BHP Billiton]] at the [[Olympic Dam mine]]. Contaminated legacy sites exist at [[Maralinga]] and [[Emu Field, South Australia|Emu Field]], where nuclear weapons tests were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and at former uranium mines and milling sites. Nuclear waste is stored by CSIRO at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] and future waste storage prospects were considered during the deliberations of the [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] in 2016. The Commission has recommended that South Australia considers opportunities in nuclear waste storage (including developing a repository for spent nuclear fuel), the establishment of a nuclear fuel leasing scheme and the repeal of prohibitions which currently prevent future nuclear industrial development nationally.

In June 2017, former Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] acknowledged fellow former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]]'s support for expanding the nuclear industry and asserted that the "Australian Labor government under Premier Jay Weatherill would like to develop new industries to supplement the uranium mine at Roxby Downs. Why not have a nuclear submarine servicing facility in that state – and the industries that would inevitably spin-off?"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cis.org.au/commentary/articles/transcript-the-hon-tony-abbot-mp-submarines-why-settle-for-second-best/|title=TRANSCRIPT.

== Uranium mining ==
[[File:Radium Hill 1954.jpg|alt=Radium Hill uranium mine (1954)|thumb|Radium Hill uranium mine (1954)]]
[[Uranium mining in Australia|Uranium mining]] has occurred in [[South Australia]], since the early 20th century, when [[radium]] was the target mineral in uranium-bearing ore. During the Cold War, the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] government facilitated the development of the [[Radium Hill uranium mine]] and the associated Port Pirie uranium treatment complex. These closed in the early 1960s after a seven-year contract of supply had been fulfilled. In the 1970s, the discovery of a massive uranium-bearing [[iron oxide copper gold ore deposits|IOCG orebody]] near [[Roxby Downs, South Australia|Roxby Downs]] led to the eventual opening of the Olympic Dam mine in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110611186|title=Official opening of Roxby Downs – The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 – 1995) – 5 Nov 1988|website=Trove|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the sector expanded to include [[In situ leach|in-situ leach mining]] operations at [[Beverley Uranium Mine|Beverley]], [[Four Mile uranium mine|Four Mile]] and [[Honeymoon Uranium Mine|Honeymoon]]. As of May 2016, Beverley and Honeymoon mines are in care and maintenance mode&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/mining/mines_and_quarries|title=Mines and quarries|website=minerals.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; owing to weak uranium prices in the wake of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]].

Exploration for uranium in South Australia reached a record high in 2006 with forty companies exploring for the mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sarigbasis.pir.sa.gov.au/WebtopEw/ws/samref/sarig1/image/DDD/MESAJ080.pdf|title=20 Years of MESA Journal|website=MESA Journal 80 – 1|publisher=Government of South Australia|page=6|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uranium export ===
Uranium mined in South Australia is exported, where it is used in the production of nuclear fuel for use in nuclear power plants. In 2013, uranium oxide concentrate produced in South Australia was being exported to Britain, France, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill expressed his support for exporting uranium to India, despite its status as a non-signatory to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty/Treaty text|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3367260.htm|title=SA Premier supports uranium export to India|date=15 November 2011|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2015, no further barriers remained preventing such trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/12/19/australias-nuclear-deal-with-india_n_8824564.html|title=Australia Ready For Uranium Sales To India|website=Huffington Post Australia|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rowan Ramsey (2015).jpg|thumb|Rowan Ramsey (2015)]]
Concentrations of nuclear waste in South Australia exist in the tailings ponds at the Olympic Dam mine, at the site of the former Port Pirie uranium treatment works and in the tailings block at the former Radium Hill mine. [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] operates a nuclear waste storage facility at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] in the state's far north. Unsuccessful attempts were made by the [[Howard Government]] to establish further [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste storage]] facilities in South Australia between 1998 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-22/a-timeline-of-south-australia's-nuclear-dump-debate/6794606|title=A timeline of South Australia's nuclear dump debate|date=22 September 2015|publisher=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prospective nuclear waste storage site at Barndioota was announced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-13/government-releases-shortlist-sites-for-nuclear-waste-storage/6937244|title=Six sites shortlisted for nuclear waste storage facility|date=12 November 2015|publisher=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property is owned by [[Grant Chapman]], and the traditional owners are the [[Adnyamathanha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-29/nuclear-waste-dump-expected-south-australian-cattle-station/7369346|title=SA cattle station could be first nuclear waste dump site|date=28 April 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is a candidate for a future National Nuclear Waste Management Facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioactivewaste.gov.au/|title=National Radioactive Waste Management Facility|publisher=radioactivewaste.gov.au|dead-url=|access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where domestically produced nuclear waste, and repatriated, reprocessed [[spent nuclear fuel]] from Australia's research reactors at Lucas Heights would be stored. Two other candidate sites exist near [[Kimba, South Australia|Kimba]] on [[Eyre Peninsula]], and as of 2017, community consultation there is ongoing.

The Kimba sites are located in the federal electorate of Grey, for which [[Rowan Ramsey|Rowan Ramsay]] is the sitting member. Ramsey has publicly advocated for the establishment of nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia, and has stated that he would be comfortable storing it on his own property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/lib-mp-happy-to-store-nuclear-waste/news-story/9e93eed3f783657116093ff7d0af22a4|title=Lib MP happy to store nuclear waste|work=NewsComAu|access-date=3 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsay did not nominate his own property for the project after receiving advice that it would constitute a [[conflict of interest]]. Opinion on the benefits and risks associated with establishing a facility has divided the township of Kimba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-02-18/nuclear-dump-support-at-kimba-diifficult-to-determine/7181410|title=Kimba community divided over proposed nuclear dump|date=18 February 2016|work=ABC Rural|access-date=3 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the establishment of a new national facility for domestically produced nuclear waste believe that such waste should be stored long-term at Lucas Heights, where much of the waste was and continues to be generated. Spokespeople for the opposition include [[Jim Green (activist)|Jim Green]] of [[Friends of the Earth Australia|Friends of the Earth]] and [[Dave Sweeney|David Sweeney]] of the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/kimba-votes-yes-to-radioactive-waste-dump-in-eyre-peninsula/news-story/96ca27ddaa0f67519b60a366584156bc|title=Kimba votes yes to radioactive waste dump|access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of storing nuclear waste in the tunnels of the Olympic Dam mine has also been speculated upon by opinion writers, politicians and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themonitor.com.au/news-articles/160616-ramsey-visits-ahead-of-important-election|title=160616 – Ramsey visits ahead of 'important' Election|publisher=themonitor.com.au|access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the development of new nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia was expressed by the [[Committee for Adelaide]] on 6 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-06/nuclear-dump-investigation-committee-for-adelaide/7391554|title=Finland nuke trip convinces delegation to support SA waste dump plan|date=6 May 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report, which was delivered to the Governor of South Australia on 6 May 2016 recommended the consideration of the establishment of a repository for imported spent nuclear fuel in South Australia. The report was released in full on 9 May 2016.

The report was put before a Citizens Jury, which ultimately voted not to proceed with investigating the prospect of importing spent nuclear fuel for storage and disposal in South Australia. In December 2016, a group of prominent citizens signed an open letter expressing an opposing view. It stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We, the undersigned, call on South Australia’s elected representatives of all parties to continue to explore this opportunity. We request further investigations into issues that a) are essential for better understanding project feasibility and b) could be investigated at relatively low cost.

In March 2017, it was estimated that $30&amp;nbsp;million would need to be spent to manage nuclear waste stored at Woomera. Barrels containing the wastes were found to be rusting and deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/deteriorating-radioactive-waste-barrels-at-woomera-require-30-million-cleanup-by-csiro/news-story/35e145b33ce748406d46d892ade39e96|title=Deteriorating radioactive waste barrels at Woomera require $30&amp;nbsp;million clean-up by CSIRO|last=Jean|first=Peter|date=14 March 2017|work=The Advertiser|access-date=3 September 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear weapons ==
A series of British [[Nuclear weapons tests in Australia|nuclear weapons tests]] were conducted at [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga and Emu Field]] during the 1950s and early 1960s. Land remains contaminated at these sites and access is restricted.

Australia has no domestic nuclear weapons nor the capability to develop them. Australia is allied with countries which do maintain nuclear arsenals. As of 2016 the [[Liberal-National Coalition]] does not support a prospective ban on the possession of nuclear weapons, while the [[Australian Labor Party]] and [[Australian Greens]] do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/barack-obama-goes-to-hiroshima-while-australia-stops-worrying-and-loves-the-bomb-20160525-gp3gi2.html|title=Barack Obama makes history in Hiroshima, while Australia stops worrying and loves the bomb|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential expansion ==
In 2015, a [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] was initiated by the Government of South Australia. It was tasked with investigating opportunities and risks associated with potential expansion of the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. Commissioner [[Kevin Scarce]] delivered its final report to the Governor of South Australia on 6 May 2016. The Commission's final report recommended the repeal of prohibitions preventing nuclear industrial development in Australia, including the legalisation of nuclear power generation. The report recommended the establishment of a facility to store international stockpiled [[spent nuclear fuel]] and the consideration of a [[nuclear fuel leasing]] scheme to accompany it. The latter was also described by the Commission as a potential enabler for future [[Enriched uranium|enrichment]] and fuel processing activities, though such further processing developments were deemed to not be feasible within the next decade. The establishment of nuclear power generation in South Australia was also deemed inappropriate given the state's high penetration of solar and wind power.{{Main|Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission}}

=== 2016–17 ===
The Government of South Australia has allocated $3.6&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Department of the Premier and Cabinet (South Australia)|Department of the Premier and Cabinet]] for 2016–17 "to enable the government to engage with the community to develop an informed response to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Final Report."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://servicesa.cdn.on.net/budget201617/pdfs/budget/2016-17_budget_measures_statement.pdf|title=2016–17 STATE BUDGET – Budget Paper 5 – Budget Measures Statement|last=|first=|publisher=Government of South Australia|year=2016|isbn=|location=Adelaide, South Australia|pages=69–70|issn=1440-8589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Citizens' Jury process ====
[[File:Nigel McBride, Business SA at CEDA event in Adelaide (2016).jpg|alt=Nigel McBride, Business SA|thumb|Nigel McBride, Business SA]]
Following the conclusion of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet established a "YourSAy nuclear?" website, advertising campaign and Citizens' Jury process. Managed by the [[New Democracy Foundation]], the Citizens' Jury process randomly invited 25,000 South Australians to participate by post. Of those who accepted the invitation, a total of 350 jurors will be chosen to meet and discuss the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report, help produce a simplified version for further discussion, and ultimately express their support or rejection of its various recommendations. South Australian company DemocracyCo won the contract to facilitate the first Citizens' Jury. DemocracyCo spokesperson Emily Jenke described the process and its result as "one of the pieces the Premier and Government will be using to inform their thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indaily.com.au/news/local/2016/06/03/nuclear-jury-about-the-big-picture-not-manufacturing-consent/|title=Nuclear jury about the big picture, not manufacturing consent – InDaily|date=3 June 2016|website=InDaily|access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Citizens Jury produced a report after hearing witnesses and deliberating over four sitting days. Its publication was followed by the launch of a statewide community consultation program coordinated by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. The campaign carried the slogan "Get to know nuclear. Discover. Discuss. Decide" and included print, radio and television commercials, online discussions and community displays attended by DPC staff.

A second jury was later formed, expanding the cohort of jurors to approximately 350 people.

After hearing from a larger cohort of expert witnesses, the citizens' jury ultimately concluded, by a two-thirds majority vote, to not pursue to prospect of the importation of spent nuclear fuel to South Australia under any circumstances. A "lack of trust" was cited as a primary driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/citizens-jury-overwhelmingly-rejects-nuclear-waste-storage-facility-for-south-australia/news-story/8340c103234775fffcf9b88b2aea6906|title='No decision' on nuclear waste plan: Weatherill|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear submarines ===
[[File:Barracuda-Suffren.svg|alt=Profile of the Barracuda type submarine, with her pump-jet propeller and X-shaped stern planes.|thumb|Profile of the Barracuda type submarine, with her pump-jet propeller and X-shaped stern planes.]]
The prospect of constructing nuclear submarines in South Australia has been raised on various occasions during the 2010s.

In 2011, the CEO of [[Defence SA]], [[Andrew Fletcher (businessman)|Andrew Fletcher]] expressed his personal view that it would be unlikely for Australia's Future Submarine project to commit to producing nuclear powered submarines, unless a nuclear industry was established in Australia beforehand, or if their production was outsourced offshore. He expressed his belief that a commitment to 12 diesel-powered submarines was more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiandefence.com.au/news/from-the-source-andrew-fletcher-chief-executive-officer-of-defence-sa|title=From The Source: Andrew Fletcher Chief Executive Officer of Defence SA|access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors from [[UCL Australia]] have written opinion pieces and produced research papers on the topic. In 2016, the contract for the supply of Australia's Future Submarines Project was awarded to French company [[Direction des Constructions Navales Services]] (DCNS), and the [[French Barracuda-class submarine|Barracuda-class submarine]] was selected. The Barracuda-class submarine is currently a [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear powered submarine]], but the Australian Government has sought a modified design with diesel-powered pump jet propulsion. The other bidders which were competing for the tender do not make nuclear powered submarines. Australian Cabinet ministers have discussed the merits of keeping the nuclear propulsion option open by choosing the Barracuda-class design and the coalition government is supportive of nuclear industrial development in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/business/manufacturing/coalition-plans-nuclearpowered-submarine-fleet-over-long-term-20160429-goieal|title=Coalition plans nuclear-powered submarine fleet over long term|date=1 May 2016|website=Financial Review|access-date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, former [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls Royce]] [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear engineer]] and submarine expert [[Steve Ludlam (engineer)|Steve Ludlam]] was appointed to the [[Defence SA Advisory Board]].

in 2017, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke of the merits of considering nuclear propulsion for Australia's Future Submarine Project, claiming various advantages over diesel propulsion, including range and speed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Support ===
Support for expanding the nuclear industry in South Australia has been expressed by corporate uranium mining interests [[WMC Resources|Western Mining Corporation]] (the first owners of the Olympic Dam mine), BHP Billiton (their successors)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nuclearrc.sa.gov.au/app/uploads/2016/03/BHP-Billiton-03-08-2015.pdf|title=Submission to the Royal Commission into the Nuclear Fuel Cycle|date=8 March 2015|website=|publisher=BHP Billiton|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rio Tinto Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/a-nuclear-australia-is-inevitable-rio-chairman-20110505-1ea83.html|title=A nuclear Australia is inevitable: Rio chairman|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry representative bodies have also expressed their support, including the [[Minerals Council of Australia]] and its predecessors, the [[Uranium Information Centre]] and the [[Australian Uranium Association]]. Other spokespeople supporting nuclear industrial development in South Australia include [[Richard Yeeles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-16/nuclear-waste-has-potential-to-earn-sa-billions-ziggy-switkowski/6115694|title=Nuclear waste dump could earn SA billions of dollars: Switkowski|date=16 February 2015|publisher=ABC News|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel McBride]] from Business SA and Jason Kuchel from the [[South Australian Chamber of Mines &amp; Energy|South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy]]. Staff and students of [[UCL Australia]] have published research papers supporting the exploration of further nuclear industrial development in South Australia. Professor [[Stefaan Simons]] has advocated for the consideration of uranium enrichment&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/nuclear-enrichment-industry-could-lead-to-multibilliondollar-economic-bonanza-study-says/story-fni6uma6-1226699572009|title=Nuclear enrichment industry could lead to multi-billion-dollar economic bonanza, study says|last=Hough|first=Andrew|date=18 August 2013|newspaper=The Advertiser|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear-powered submarines.

In March 2017, eleven members of the [[Turnbull Government]] were listed as openly supporting the prospect of [[nuclear power in Australia]]. Listed politicians were: [[Andrew Broad]], [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]], [[Tony Pasin]], [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]], [[Chris Back]], [[Craig Kelly (politician)|Craig Kelly]], [[Eric Abetz]], [[Andrew Hastie (politician)|Andrew Hastie]], [[Warren Entsch]], [[Bridget McKenzie]] and Rowan Ramsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/put-nuclear-in-the-energy-mix-coalition-mps-tell-malcolm-turnbull-20170315-guylds.html|title=Put nuclear in the energy mix, Coalition MPs tell Malcolm Turnbull|last=Massola|first=James|date=15 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=3 September 2017|last2=Gartrell|first2=Adam|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
There has been considerable Australian resistance to [[uranium mining]] for some decades. There have been concerns that uranium drives the global nuclear weapons cycle, disturbs or degrades [[sacred sites]], releases carcinogenic [[radon gas]], and contaminates [[groundwater]]. Nuclear power is considered by opponents as an unsafe, centralised, and secretive energy option, which creates security risks. [[High-level radioactive waste management]] has also been another major concern.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Branagan. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/IntJlRuralLawP/2014/4.pdf The Australian Movement against Uranium Mining: Its Rationale and Evolution], ''International Journal of Rural Law and policy'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents to the expansion of nuclear industry in South Australia include the [[Australian Greens]] (whose spokespeople include [[Scott Ludlam]] and [[Mark Parnell]]), [[Friends of the Earth Australia|Friends of the Earth]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]. Opposition has also been expressed by Kevin Buzzacott, [[Eileen Kampakuta Brown]], [[Eileen Wani Wingfield]] and other elders of several indigenous peoples. The Desert Liberation Front has coordinated protest events at the gates of the Olympic Dam mine in 2012 and 2016 using the names The Lizard's Revenge and The Lizard Bites Back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sa-police-close-olympic-way-as-antiuranium-protesters-light-bonfire-in-the-middle-of-the-road/news-story/691b23d3a7991cf5b1b9688a1702de45|title=SA Police close Olympic Way as anti-uranium protesters light bonfire in the middle of the road|last=Jones|first=Erin|date=3 July 2016|newspaper=The Advertiser|access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">An '''order unit''' is an element of an [[ordered vector space]] which can be used to bound all elements from above.&lt;ref name="fuchssteiner+lusky"&gt;{{cite book|title=Convex Cones |last1=Fuchssteiner |first1=Benno |last2=Lusky |first2=Wolfgang |isbn=9780444862907 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way (as seen in the first [[#Examples|example]] below) the order unit generalizes the unit element in the reals.

== Definition ==
For the ordering cone &lt;math&gt;K \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; in the [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the element &lt;math&gt;e \in K&lt;/math&gt; is an order unit (more precisely an &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-order unit) if for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\lambda_x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_x e - x \in K&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x \leq_K \lambda_x e&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="aliprantis+tourky"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cones and Duality |author=Charalambos D. Aliprantis |author2=Rabee Tourky |isbn=9780821841464 |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equivalent definition ===
The order units of an ordering cone &lt;math&gt;K \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; are those elements in the [[algebraic interior]] of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(K)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="aliprantis+tourky" /&gt;

== Examples ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the real numbers and &lt;math&gt;K = \mathbb{R}_+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: x \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the unit element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is an ''order unit''.

Let &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K = \mathbb{R}^n_+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: \forall i = 1,\ldots,n: x_i \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the unit element &lt;math&gt;\vec{1} = (1,\ldots,1)&lt;/math&gt; is an ''order unit''.

The term '''pre-polymer''' refers to a [[monomer]] or system of monomers that have been reacted to an intermediate [[molecular mass]] state. This material is capable of further [[polymerization]] by reactive groups to a fully cured high molecular weight state. As such, mixtures of reactive polymers with un-reacted monomers may also be referred to as pre-polymers. The term “pre-polymer” and “polymer precursor” may be interchanged.

==Lactic acid as a polymer precursor==
{{Main|polylactic acid}}

Two [[molecule]]s of [[lactic acid]] can be dehydrated to [[lactide]], a cyclic [[lactone]]. A variety of [[catalyst]]s can polymerise lactide to either [[Heterotactis|heterotactic]] or [[syndiotactic]] [[polylactide]], which as biodegradable polyesters with valuable (inter alia) medical properties are currently attracting much attention.

Nowadays, lactic acid is used as a monomer for producing [[polylactic acid]] (PLA) which later has application as [[biodegradable plastic]]. This kind of [[plastic]] is a good option for substituting conventional plastic produced from [[petroleum oil]] because of low emission of [[carbon dioxide]]. The commonly used process in producing lactic acid is via [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]], and later to obtain the polylactic acid, the polymerization process follows.

[[Radium]] and [[radon]] are important contributors to [[environmental radioactivity]]. Radon occurs naturally in the environment as a result of decay of [[radioactive]] elements in the soil and it can accumulate in houses built on areas where such decay occurs. This radon is among major causes of cancer, estimated to contribute to about 2% of all cancer related deaths in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Radon in homes and risk of lung cancer: collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 European case-control studies|last = Darby|date = January 29, 2005|journal = British Medical Journal|volume = 330|issue = 7485|page = 223|doi = 10.1136/bmj.38308.477650.63|pmid = 15613366|pmc=546066|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radium, like radon, is a radioactive element and it is found in small quantities in nature and may thus be hazardous to life if concentrated. Radium has its origins as a decay product of certain isotopes of uranium and [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby et al. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Radium may also be released to the environment as a result of human activity, for example, in inproperly discarded products painted with radioluminescent paint.

== Radium ==

===In the oil and gas industries ===

Residues from the [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] industry often contain [[radium]] and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich. It is the case that the water inside an oil field is often very rich in [[strontium]], [[barium]] and [[radium]] while seawater is very rich in [[sulfate]] so if water from an oil well is discharged into the sea or mixed with seawater the radium is likely to be brought out of solution by the barium/strontium sulfate which acts as a [[Catalyst|carrier]] precipitate.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Toxicological Profile for Radon|last = Keith|first =S|publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (US)|date=May 2012|isbn = |location = Atlanta (GA) |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radioluminescent products, ie glow in the dark ===

Local contamination from radium-based [[Radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] paints having been improperly disposed of is not unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Radium Corp. |location=New Jersey |id=EPA ID#: NJD980654172 |title=EPA REGION 2, Congressional District(s): 10, Essex, City of Orange |date=February 5, 2010 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714234109/http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/0200772c.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In radioactive quackery ===

[[Eben Byers]] was a wealthy American socialite whose death in 1932 as a result of using an [[radioactive quackery]] product called [[Radithor]] is a prominent example of a death caused by radium. Radithor contained approximately 1 μCi (40 MBq) of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra and 1 μCi of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra per bottle. Radithor was taken by mouth and radium, being a [[calcium]] mimic, has a very long [[biological halflife]] in [[bone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/82/21/1667.extract#|title = Radiation Therapy Pursuit Leads to Unearthing of "Hot Bones"|last = Vanchieri|first = Cori|date = November 7, 1990|journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute|doi = 10.1093/jnci/82.21.1667|pmid = |access-date = January 31, 2015|volume=82|issue=21|page=1667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radon ==

[[File:Radon decay in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|[[Radon]] in air forms a part of the [[background radiation]], which can be observed in a [[cloud chamber]]]]
The majority of the dose is caused by the decay of the [[polonium]] (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po) and [[lead]] (&lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) daughters of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn.  By controlling exposure to the daughters the radioactive dose to the [[skin]] and [[lung]]s can be reduced by at least 90%. This can be done by wearing a dust mask, and wearing a suit to cover the entire body. Note that exposure to [[smoke]] at the same time as [[radon]] and radon daughters will increase the harmful effect of the radon. In [[uranium mining|uranium miner]]s radon has been found to be more [[carcinogenic]] in [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] than in non-smokers.&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;
[[Image:Decay chain(4n+2, Uranium series).svg|thumb|alt=Uranium series|The radium or uranium series.]]

=== Occurrence===

Radon concentration in the open air varies between 1 and 100 Bq per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Daily variation of the radon concentration indoors and outdoors and the influence of meteorological parameters.|last = Porstendörfer|first =J.|date = September 1994|journal = Health physics|doi = 10.1097/00004032-199409000-00011|pmid = 8056597|volume=67|issue=3|pages=283–287|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon can be found in some [[spring (water)|spring water]]s and [[hot spring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of the exposure levels to radioactivity in the hot-spring environment of the Island of Ischia during a year|last = Bartoli|first = G.|date = 1989|journal = Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunità|doi = |pmid = 2484503|volume=1|issue=6|pages=1781–1823|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towns of [[Misasa, Tottori|Misasa]], [[Japan]], and [[Bad Kreuznach]], [[Germany]] boast radium-rich springs which emit radon, as does [[Radium Springs, New Mexico]].

Radon exhausts naturally from the ground, particularly in certain regions, especially but not only regions with [[granite|granitic]] soils. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon, for instance while the rock which [[Aberdeen]] is on is very radium rich the rock lacks the cracks required for the radon to migrate. In other nearby areas of Scotland (to the north of Aberdeen) and in [[Cornwall]]/[[Devon]] the radon is very much able to leave the rock.

Radon is a decay product of [[radium]] which in turn is a decay product of uranium. It is possible to acquire maps of average radon levels in houses to assist in the planning of radon mitigation measures for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/IEP/high-radon/USgm.htm |title=Predicted median annual-average living-area concentration, by county |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231195400/http://eetd.lbl.gov/IEP/high-radon/USgm.htm |archivedate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while high uranium in the [[soil]]/[[Rock (geology)|rock]] under a house does not always lead to a high radon level in air, a positive correlation between the uranium content of the soil and the radon level in air can be seen.

===In air ===

Radon is related to [[indoor air quality]] as it blights many homes. (See "Radon in Houses" below.)

The radon (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn) released into the air decays to [[lead|&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]] and other radioisotopes and the levels of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb can be measured. It is important to note that the rate of deposition of this radioisotope is very dependent on the season. Here is a graph of the deposition rate observed in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X05002432 |title= Seasonal and spatial variation of atmospheric 210Pb and 7Be deposition: features of the Japan Sea side of Japan |last= Yamamoto |first= Masayoshi |date= September 21, 2005 |journal= Journal of Environmental Radioactivity |doi= 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.08.001 |pmid= 16181712 |access-date= January 31, 2015 |issue=1 |pages=110–131 |volume=86 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lead210inairatjapan.png|upright=2|thumb|Lead-210 deposition rate as a function of time as observed in Japan]]

===In groundwater===

Well water can be very rich in radon; the use of this water inside a house is an additional route allowing radon to enter the house. The radon can enter the air and then be a source of exposure to the humans, or the water can be consumed by humans which is a different exposure route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |title= Basic Information about Radon in Drinking Water |date= June 30, 2014 |accessdate= January 31, 2015 |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214054459/http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radon in rainwater===
Rainwater can be intensely radioactive due to high levels of radon and its decay progenies &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Bi and &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb; the concentrations of these [[radioisotope]]s can be high enough to seriously disrupt radiation monitoring at nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=Yamazawa&gt;{{Cite conference

===In the oil and gas industries ===

The water, oil and gas from a well often contains [[radon]]. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where [[propane]] is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Survey &amp; Identification of NORM Contaminated Equipment |url=http://www.enprotec-inc.com/Presentations/NORM.pdf |publisher=Enprotec / Hibbs &amp; Todd |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mines ===

Because uranium minerals emit [[radon]] gas, and their harmful and highly radioactive [[decay product|daughter products]], uranium mining is considerably more dangerous than other (already dangerous) [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]], requiring adequate ventilation systems if the mines are not [[open-pit mining|open pit]]. During the 1950s, a significant number of American uranium miners were [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] Indians, as many uranium deposits were discovered on Navajo [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. A statistically significant subset of these miners later developed [[small-cell lung cancer]], a type of cancer usually not associated with smoking, after exposure to uranium ore and [[radon]]-222, a natural decay product of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gottlieb |first=Leon S. |last2=Husen |first2=Luverne A. |title=Lung Cancer Among Navajo Uranium Miners |date=April 1982 |journal=Chest |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=449–452 |doi=10.1378/chest.81.4.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radon, which is produced by the uranium, and not the uranium itself has been shown to be the cancer causing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Harley |first=Naomi |date=1999 |last2=Foulkes |first2=Ernest |last3=Hilborne |first3=Lee H. |last4=Hudson |first4=Arlene |last5=Anthony |first5=C.

Currently the level of radon in the air of mines is normally controlled by [[law]]. In a working mine, the radon level can be controlled by [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], sealing off old workings and controlling the water in the mine. The level in a mine can go up when a mine is abandoned, it can reach a level which is able to cause the [[skin]] to become [[red]] (a mild [[radiation burn]]). The radon levels in some of the mines can reach 400 to 700 kBq m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of health risks to skin and lung of elevated radon levels in abandoned mines.|last = Denman|first = A.R.|date = December 2003|journal = Health Physics|doi = 10.1097/00004032-200312000-00018|pmid = 14626324|last2 = Eatough|first2 = J.P.|first3 = G.|first4 = P.S.|last3 = Gillmore|last4 = Phillips|issue = 6|pages = 733–739|volume=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common unit of exposure of lung tissue to [[alpha emitter]]s is the [[Working level|working level month]] ('''WLM'''), this is where the human [[lung]]s have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products). This is air which has the alpha dose rate of 1 [[working level]] ('''WL'''). It is estimated that the average person (''[[general public]]'') is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]]), while the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 μSv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation, and Nuclear Energy|last = Hala|first = Jiri|publisher = Konvoj|year = 2003|isbn = 9788073020538|location = |pages = |last2 = Navratil|first2 = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans a relationship between [[lung cancer]] and radon has been shown to exist (beyond all reasonable doubt) for exposures of 100 WLM and above. By using the data from several studies it has been possible to show that an increased risk can be caused by a dose as low as 15 to 20 WLM. Sadly these studies have been difficult as the random errors in the data are very large. It is likely that the miners are also subject to other effects which can harm their lungs while at work (for example dust and [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] fumes).

===In houses ===

The fact that radon is present in indoor air has been known at least since 1950s and research on its effects on human health started on early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol43/|title = Man-made Mineral Fibres and Radon|date = 1988|journal = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 31, 2015|issue = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of radon exposure in [[dwellings]] received more widespread public awareness after 1984, as a result of a case of [[Health effects of radon#Stanley Watras|Stanley Watras]], an employee at the [[Limerick nuclear power plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Indoor radon and lung cancer. Estimating the risks.|last = Samet|first = J.

They were shocked to find that the source was astonishingly high levels of radon in his [[basement]] and it was not related to the nuclear plant. The risks associated with living in his house were estimated to be equivalent to [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] 135 packs of [[cigarette]]s every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/wastes/radon_hotline/radonstory.htm|title = The Radon Story|date = 2001|accessdate = January 1, 2015|website = |publisher = The Radon Council|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150201024505/http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/wastes/radon_hotline/radonstory.htm|archivedate = February 1, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how houses are built and ventilated, radon may accumulate in basements and dwellings. The [[European Union]] recommends that [[Radon mitigation|mitigation]] should be taken starting from concentrations of 400&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for old houses, and 200&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for new ones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.polisproject.org/PDFs/Radon%20report%20DSF.doc|title = Radon The Unfamiliar Killer|last = Boyd|first = David R.|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = February 1, 2015|publisher = David Suzuki Foundation|year = 2006|series = Healthy Environment, Healthy Canadians Series, Report No.1|location = Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 8&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|pCi]]/L (300 Bq/m³).

The [[United States]] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 148&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (given as 4&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|pCi]]/L). Nearly one in 15 homes in the U.S. has a high level of indoor radon according to their statistics. The U.S. Surgeon General and EPA recommend all homes be tested for radon. Since 1985, millions of homes have been tested for radon in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By adding a crawl space under the ground floor, which is subject to forced ventilation the radon level in the house can be lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Design and Testing of Sub-Slab Depressurization for Radon Mitigation in North Florida Houses: Part I - Performance and Durability|last = Roessler|first = C.

A '''Refractory lined expansion joint''' is an assembly used in a pipe line to allow it to expand and contract&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/expansion-joint-catalog/expansion_joint-glossary.htm#EXPANSION%20JOINTS Expansion Joints] Glossary of Terms, (retrieved 30 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; as climate conditions move from hot to cold and helps to ensure that the system remains functional. The refractory-lining can be vibra cast insulation with anchors, abrasion resistant refractory in hex mesh, gunned insulating refractory, or poured insulating refractory. Refractory lined expansion joints can be hinged, in-line pressure balanced, gimbal, tied-universal depending on the temperature, pressure, movement and flow media conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/products/refractory-lined-expansion-joint.htm U.S. Bellows] Refractory Lined Expansion Joints (retrieved February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[image:Refractory-lined-joint.jpg|thumb|alt=Refractory Lined Expansion Joint|Expansion Joint with Refractory Lining - U.S. Bellows, Inc.]] 

Refractory lined [[Expansion joint]]s are used in extremely high temperature and high pressure applications and are designed to withstand extreme environments. The [[Refractory]] lining within the metallic [[Expansion joint]] bellows functions to reduce the 

pipe wall temperature by 300˚F to 450˚F, depending upon the thickness of the refractory lining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/products/refractory_joint.htm Refractory Lined Expansion Joints] U.S. Bellows, Inc., (retrieved 30 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The lining also helps to withstand the abrasive material from the catalyst in FCCU applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchoilandgas.com/maintenance-tips-critical-expansion-a8079-1.html Key Maintenance Tips for Critical Expansion Joint Applications] Touch Oil and Gas, (retrieved 30 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Guilbeault''', born on June 9, 1970 in La Tuque, Quebec, is a Canadian environmentalist, speaker and writer. A founding member of [[Équiterre]], Quebec’s leading environmental organization, he had a ten-year stint as director and campaign manager for [[Greenpeace]] Quebec chapter. He currently serves as Senior Director and spokesperson for [[Équiterre]].  

==Biography==
[[File:Steven Guilbeault, The Green Interview.webm|thumb|left|Steven Guilbeault in conversation with [[Silver Donald Cameron]] about his work.]]
When he was five years old in his hometown of La Tuque in Haute-Mauricie, Steven Guilbeault refused to get down from a tree that he had climbed, in an effort to block a land developer from clearing a wooded area behind his home. The tree was felled a few days later, but the event stands is cited by Steven Guilbeault as the genesis of his environmental activism.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Steven Guibeault has demonstrated great enthusiasm for nature and outdoor sports. A bike courier during his university days, his bike has been his principal mode of transportation, both in summer and in winter since 1989. A driven athlete, he was a competitive downhill skier and played various team sports during his youth. These days, you can find him participating in obstacle courses, marathons and half-marathons. He is also a science fiction lover.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

He is the father of four children.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Education===
After taking computer science in [[CEGEP]], he enrolled in industrial relations at l'Université de Montréal in 1989.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} A year later, he switched his major to political science finding himself attracted to international relations, the study of political systems and religion. He minored in theology, exploring questions of international morality, liberation theology, poverty and the environment.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Activism==
The activism and civic engagement for which Steven Guilbeault would become known took root during his university days. He became president of his faculty’s student association and also took part in activities organized by Equitas (known at the time as the Canadian Human Rights Foundation).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He was also active in the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), where he made the acquaintance of François Rebello and Nicolas Girard, who would later enter the world of politics.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He also joined the ''Groupe de recherche en intérêt public'' (GRIP), created out of the protest movement spearheaded by Ralph Nader, the renowned American consumer advocate. There he met Laure Waridel, Sydney Ribaux and François Meloche, with whom he would go on to found Équiterre a few years later.&lt;ref name="Globe"/&gt;

===Canadian Human Rights Foundation===
While in university, Steven Guilbeault worked for two years (1992-1993) with the Canadian Human Rights Foundation, an organization dedicated to educating people, both at home and abroad, about  human rights issues.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Équiterre===
&lt;!--[[File:StevenGroupeJeunesse 2018.png|thumb|© Équiterre]]--&gt;
After the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1993, in which François Meloche participated, that Guilbeault and a group of his friends had the idea of creating a citizen organization, leading to Steven Guilbeault, Laure Waridel, Elizabeth Hunter, Patrick Henn, François Meloche and Sidney Ribaux to found Action for Solidarity, Equity, Environment and Development (ASEED). It acquired not-for-profit status in 1995 and in 1998, it was rebranded as Équiterre. The organization's goal is to propose concrete solutions to make Canada a society where sustainable development and social economy would be central to the actions and concerns of its citizens, organizations and government. Steven Guilbeault was a member of Équiterre's board of directors for many years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} 

===Greenpeace===
In 1997, Steven Guilbeault joined Greenpeace Canada. He was put in charge of its climate change division and he managed the climate and energy campaign before being the organization's Quebec Bureau Chief in 2000. In 2005, he coordinated the climate campaign for Greenpeace International.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On four different occasions, Steven Guilbeault made headlines for Greenpeace.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  His best known feat was scaling Toronto’s CN Tower in 2001, accompanied by British militant Chris Holden. At the time the tower was the tallest in the world. After ascending to a height of 340m, they unfurled a banner that read: "Canada and Bush Climate Killers."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  The goal was to grab the world’s attention a week before the UN’s sixth conference on climate change, where the fate of the Kyoto Protocol would be decided.

Steven Guilbeault remained Greenpeace’s Quebec spokesperson until June 8, 2007, at which time he announced his resignation.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} 

In 2008, he returned to Équiterre, which he had cofounded fifteen years earlier, to work on climate change issues. He currently serves the organization as it's Senior Director and Spokesperson.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Government work===
Steven Guilbeault sat on the board of the ''Agence de l'efficacité énergétique'' from 2007 to 2009 and chaired the Committee on Emerging Renewable Energy from 2009 to 2011 for the Government of Quebec.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

He also sat on the climate change advisory committees of three successive Quebec governments: Jean Charest’s Liberals, Pauline Marois’ Parti Québécois, and subsequently co-chairing the committee formed by Philippe Couillard’s Liberal government starting in 2014.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 2016, he was invited by Justin Trudeau to an event with US Vice President Joe Biden, after having previously sat at the head table at an event honouring Al Gore in Montreal.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} 

Stéphane Dion, former federal Minister of the Environment and Climate Change (2004-2006), of Intergovernmental Affairs (1995-2003) and of Foreign Affairs (2015-2017), remakred that Guilbeaukt "is among the select few in the environmental community with whom it is important to remain in contact, because his reactions and his opinions will count".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Kalee Kreider, formerly with Greenpeace and former Communications Director for Al Gore, said that Steven Guilbeault "has at once gained the respect of those in government, NGOs and industry."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Steven Guilbeault has been courted by numerous political parties. He stated he recognized the importance of politics and has not closed the door to a role at the municipal, provincial or federal level, perhaps later on in his career.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Other activities ===
Recognized for his ability to make complex issues easier to understand, Steven Guilbeault is a sought-after speaker in Quebec and the rest of Canada. He is regularly solicited by the media to share his opinion on a variety of environmental issues.

'''West Durham Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] near [[Tow Law]], [[County Durham]], [[England]].

==History==
Developed by County Durham-based company the [[Banks Group]], the farm was planned as the largest wind farm in [[North East England]]. Construction of the farm began on the 11 July 2008. It was hoped that the commissioning of the turbines would make County Durham the first English county to hit its 2010 renewable energies target.&lt;ref name=so_far&gt;{{cite web
