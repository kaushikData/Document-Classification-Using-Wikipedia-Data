The effects of [[air pollution]] on our{{who|date=November 2017}} general life have been well documented, but a specific interest group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/edexcel/problems_in_environment/pollutionrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on gardens and wildlife have been researched by local organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/environment/air-quality/monitoring.html|title=Air pollution monitoring in Sheffield|last=|first=|date=|website=Sheffield City Council|publisher=Sheffield government|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/|title=UK-AIR: Air Information Resource|last=|first=|date=|website=Department for Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs|publisher=|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international organisations monitor air pollution also research its effects on people and vegetation.

== Forecasts ==
Public interest has necessitated the need for ready available pollution tools and a forecast map was published by DEFRA (Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/forecasting/|title=Pollution Forecast - Defra, UK|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site features a colour coded outlook forecast which can be viewed up to five days ahead.

== Research ==

A pilot project was undertaken in a Sheffield park to determine the effects of air pollution on plant life growth patterns. The project has since completed and was managed by a research graduate whose work is being verified.
This project and future comparative studies will show how air pollutants affect topical scorching on plant leaf and stunted growth as measured on [[cytokinin]]s. Some of the plants used in this project included [[Green bean|snap beans]], [[wheat]] and [[Trifolium repens|white clover]] whose surface structure is susceptible to [[pollutant]]s like [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]]. Medical symptoms like [[lung]] irritation can be observed with the increase in [[Air pollutant concentrations|air pollutants]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35629034|title=UK air pollution 'linked to 40,000 early deaths a year'|last=Roberts|first=Michelle|date=2016-02-23|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crop yield]]s are also [[Stunted growth|stunted]].

Hand held monitors that are able to monitor volatile organic compounds, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are increasingly been purchased by consumers in the expectation of citizen monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsi.com/air-quality-monitoring/|title=Air Quality Testing, Monitoring, Air Quality Measurement|website=www.tsi.com|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[indiegogo]] project also raised funds for a smaller more cost effective hand held device that can be linked to a mobile device for [[Push technology|push notifications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/atmotube-the-portable-air-pollution-monitor-environment#/|title=Atmotube: The Portable Air Pollution Monitor|website=Indiegogo|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Moore''' (born 18 November 1953) is an English writer known primarily for his work in [[comic books]] including ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]''.&lt;ref name="Alan Moore Bibliography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/HTML%20Bibliographies/Alan%20Moore%20Bibliography.htm |title=Alan Moore Bibliography |work=Enjolrasworld.com |accessdate=13 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqyn2B7h?url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/HTML%20Bibliographies/Alan%20Moore%20Bibliography.htm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarded by some as the best [[graphic novel writer]] in history,&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"&gt;{{cite book | last=Khoury | first=George | authorlink=George Khoury (author) | title=The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore | date=25 August 2003 | location=Raleigh, North Carolina| publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | isbn=978-1-893905-24-5}}{{rp|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"&gt;{{cite book | last=Parkin | first=Lance | authorlink=Lance Parkin | title=Alan Moore: The Pocket Essential | date=January 2002 | location=[[Hertfordshire]], England | publisher=[[Trafalgar Square Publishing]] | isbn=978-1-903047-70-5}}{{rp|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is widely recognised among his peers and critics. He has occasionally used such pseudonyms as '''Curt Vile''',  '''Jill de Ray''', and '''Translucia Baboon'''; also, reprints of some of his work have been credited to '''The Original Writer''' when Moore requested that his name be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/why-alan-moore-has-become-650954|title=Why Alan Moore Has Become Marvel's 'Original Writer'|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=25 October 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170810092627/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/why-alan-moore-has-become-650954|archivedate= 10 August 2017|deadurl= no|df= dmy-all|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore started writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s before achieving success publishing [[comic strip]]s in such magazines as ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' and ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. He was subsequently picked up by the American [[DC Comics]], and as "the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America",&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=7}} he worked on major characters such as [[Batman]] (''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'') and [[Superman]] (''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]''), substantially developed the character [[Swamp Thing]], and penned original titles such as ''[[Watchmen]]''. During that decade, Moore helped to bring about greater social respectability for comics in the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=11}} He prefers the term "comic" to "graphic novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html|title= The Alan Moore Interview|last= Kavanagh|first= Barry|publisher= Blather.net|date= 17 October 2000|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140226072653/http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html|archivedate= 26 February 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= 1 January 2013}} On the term "graphic novel": "It's a marketing term. I mean, it was one that I never had any sympathy with. The term "comic" does just as well for me. The term "graphic novel" was something that was thought up in the '80s by marketing people&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a while, working on experimental work such as the epic ''From Hell'' and the prose novel ''[[Voice of the Fire]]''. He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s, working for [[Image Comics]], before developing [[America's Best Comics]], an imprint through which he published works such as ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' and the occult-based ''[[Promethea]]''.

Moore is an [[occult]]ist, [[ceremonial magic]]ian,&lt;ref name="Babcock"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2007/05/10/1815/#more-1815|title= Magic is Afoot: A Conversation with Alan Moore about the Arts and the Occult|last= Babcock|first= Jay|journal=[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur Magazine]]|issue= 4|date= May 2003|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044139/http://arthurmag.com/2007/05/10/1815/|archivedate= 3 June 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name="Heidi, pt1"/&gt; and has featured such themes in works including ''Promethea'', ''From Hell'', and ''V for Vendetta'', as well as performing [[avant-garde]] spoken word occult "workings" with [[The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels]], some of which have been released on CD.

Despite his own personal objections, his works have provided the basis for a number of Hollywood films, including ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003), ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' (2005), and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009). Moore has also been referenced in popular culture, and has been recognised as an influence on a variety of literary and television figures including [[Neil Gaiman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Stephen P. |title=Neil Gaiman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jc9MaZrG3j8C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=gaiman%20-%20moore%20-%20friendship&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g-cuTfG1DsexhQeA7tHmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | year=2005 |location=New York|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |pages=16–18| isbn=978-1-4042-0285-6|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joss Whedon]], and [[Damon Lindelof]].&lt;ref name=EntertainmentWeekly&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854,00.html |title=Watchmen: An Oral History |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |date=21 October 2005 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214220508/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C1120854%2C00.html |archivedate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has lived a significant portion of his life in Northampton, England, and he has said in various interviews that his stories draw heavily from his experiences living there.

==Early life==
Moore was born on 18 November 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=John Jackson|authorlink= John Jackson Miller|url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=10 June 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw?url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; at St Edmund's Hospital in [[Northampton]] to a working-class family who he believed had lived in the town for several generations.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=11}} He grew up in a part of Northampton known as The Boroughs, a poverty-stricken area with a lack of facilities and high levels of illiteracy, but he nonetheless "loved it. I loved the people. I loved the community and&amp;nbsp;... I didn't know that there was anything else."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=13–16}} He lived in his house with his parents, brewery worker Ernest Moore, and printer Sylvia Doreen, with his younger brother Mike and his maternal grandmother.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=14}} He "read omnivorously" from the age of five, getting books out of the local library, and subsequently attended Spring Lane Primary School.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=17}} At the same time, he began reading comic strips, initially British strips, such as ''[[The Topper (comics)|Topper]]'' and ''[[The Beezer]]'', but eventually also American imports such as ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Detective Comics]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]''.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=31}} He later passed his [[11-plus]] exam, and was therefore eligible to go to [[Northampton School for Boys|Northampton Grammar School]],&lt;ref name="bigwords1"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Groth | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Groth | title=Big Words, Part 1 | journal=[[The Comics Journal]] | issue=138 | year=1990 | pages=56–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he first came into contact with people who were middle class and better educated, and he was shocked at how he went from being one of the top pupils at his primary school to one of the lowest in the class at secondary. Subsequently, disliking school and having "no interest in academic study", he believed that there was a "covert curriculum" being taught that was designed to indoctrinate children with "punctuality, obedience and the acceptance of monotony".&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=17–18}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote="LSD was an incredible experience. Not that I'm recommending it for anybody else; but for me it kind of – it hammered home to me that reality was not a fixed thing. That the reality that we saw about us every day was one reality, and a valid one – but that there were others, different perspectives where different things have meaning that were just as valid. That had a profound effect on me."|source=Alan Moore (2003)&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=19–20}}}}

In the late 1960s Moore began publishing his own poetry and essays in [[fanzine]]s, eventually setting up his own fanzine, ''Embryo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/alan-moore|title= Alan Moore|date= n.d.|publisher= [[British Council]]|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''Embryo'', Moore became involved in a group known as the [[Northampton Arts Lab]]. The Arts Lab subsequently made significant contributions to the magazine.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=33–34}} He began dealing the hallucinogenic [[LSD]] at school, being expelled for doing so in 1970 – he later described himself as "one of the world's most inept LSD dealers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7307303.stm | title=Comic legend keeps true to roots | last=Rigby | first=Nic|publisher=BBC News| date=21 March 2008 | accessdate=22 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311235237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7307303.stm| archivedate= 11 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headmaster of the school subsequently "got in touch with various other academic establishments that I'd applied to and told them not to accept me because I was a danger to the moral well-being of the rest of the students there, which was possibly true."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=18}}

Whilst continuing to live in his parents' home for a few more years, he moved through various jobs, including cleaning toilets and working in a [[tannery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13207942.Graphic_Content__from_the_archive___Alan_Moore/|title=Graphic Content: from the archive - Alan Moore|website=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1973, he met and began a relationship with Northampton-born Phyllis Dixon, with whom he moved into "a little one-room flat in the Barrack Road area in Northampton".&lt;ref name="Magic Words"&gt;{{cite book | last=Parkin | first=Lance | authorlink=Lance Parkin | title=Magic Words: The Extraordinary Life of Alan Moore | date=November 2013 | location=[[London]], England | publisher=[[Aurum Press]] | isbn=978-1781310779}}{{rp|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon marrying, they moved into a new [[council estate]] in the town's eastern district while he worked in an office for a [[Gas contractor|sub-contractor]] of the local gas board. Moore felt that he was not being fulfilled by this job, and so decided to try to earn a living doing something more artistic.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=34–35}}

==Career==

===Early career: 1978–1980===
Abandoning his office job, he decided to instead take up both writing and illustrating his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as ''Anon E. Mouse'' for the local paper ''Anon'', and ''St. Pancras Panda'', a parody of [[Paddington Bear]], for the Oxford-based ''Back Street Bugle''.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=16–17}} His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in ''[[NME]]'', and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as ''Roscoe Moscow'' published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer [[Kurt Weill]]) in the weekly music magazine ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter [[Leah Moore|Leah]], began claiming [[Jobseeker's Allowance|unemployment benefit]] to supplement this income.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=36}} Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as ''[[Maxwell the Magic Cat]]'' in the ''Northants Post'', under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child murderer [[Gilles de Rais]], something he found to be a "sardonic joke"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing ''Maxwell the Magic Cat'' until 1986.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=36–37}} Moore has stated that he would have been happy to continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of [[homosexual]]s in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Alan. ''Maxwell the Magic Cat'' (Northants Post, 1979–1986) [[Trade paperback (comics)|TPB]]. Acme Press. 1986–1987. Vol. 1: {{ISBN|978-1-870084-00-0}}. Vol. 2: {{ISBN|978-1-870084-05-5}}.

Vol. 4: {{ISBN|978-1-870084-20-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/moore.htm|title= Alan Moore|date= 16 July 2010|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213205039/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/moore.htm|archivedate= 13 December 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "After I'd been doing [it] for a couple of years, I realised that I would never be able to draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist."&lt;ref name="Baker, Bill"&gt;{{cite book | first=Bill | last=Baker | title=Alan Moore Spells It Out | date=28 December 2005 | publisher=Airwave Publishing | isbn=978-0-9724805-7-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=15}}

To learn more about how to write a successful comic-book script, he asked advice from his friend, comic-book writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]], whom he had known since he was fourteen.&lt;ref name="Baker, Bill"/&gt;{{rp|page=20}} Interested in writing for ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]'', one of Britain's most prominent comic magazines, Alan Moore then submitted a script for their long running and successful series ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. While having no need for another writer on ''Judge Dredd'', which was already being written by [[John Wagner]], ''2000AD'''s editor [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] saw promise in Moore's work – later remarking that "this guy's a really fucking good writer"&lt;ref name="TPO75"&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Bishop | authorlink=David Bishop | title=[[Thrill-Power Overload]] | pages=75–76 | date=15 February 2009 | publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]] | isbn=978-1-905437-95-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and instead asked him to write some short stories for the publication's ''[[Future Shocks]]'' series. While the first few were rejected, Grant advised Moore on improvements, and eventually accepted the first of many. Meanwhile, Moore had also begun writing minor stories for ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]'', and later commented that "I really, really wanted a regular strip. I didn't want to do short stories&amp;nbsp;... But that wasn't what was being offered. I was being offered short four or five-page stories where everything had to be done in those five pages. And, looking back, it was the best possible education that I could have had in how to construct a story."&lt;ref name="Baker, Bill"/&gt;{{rp|pages=21–22}}

===Marvel UK, ''2000AD'', and ''Warrior'': 1980–1984===

From 1980 through to 1984, Moore maintained his status as a freelance writer, and was offered a spate of work by a variety of comic book companies in Britain, namely [[Marvel UK]], and the publishers of ''2000AD'' and ''Warrior''. He later remarked that "I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals. So everybody was offering me things."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=57}} It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain, and according to [[Lance Parkin]], "the British comics scene was cohering as never before, and it was clear that the audience was sticking with the title as they grew up. Comics were no longer just for very small boys: teenagers – even A-level and university students – were reading them now."&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=20}}

During this three-year period, ''2000AD'' would accept and publish over fifty of Moore's one-off stories for their ''[[Future Shocks]]'' and ''Time Twisters'' science fiction series.&lt;ref name="TPO75"/&gt; The editors at the magazine were impressed by Moore's work and decided to offer him a more permanent strip, starting with a story that they wanted to be vaguely based upon the hit film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. The result, ''[[Skizz]]'', which was illustrated by [[Jim Baikie]], told the story of the titular alien who crashes to Earth and is cared for by a teenager named Roxy, and Moore later noted that in his opinion, this work "owes far too much to [[Alan Bleasdale]]."&lt;ref name="Bishop, David"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bishop | first=David | title=Thrill-Power Overload: The Official History of 2000AD | date=30 March 2007 | publisher=Rebellion Developments | isbn=978-1-905437-22-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=94}} Another series he produced for ''2000AD'' was ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', which was illustrated by [[Alan Davis]]. The story, which Moore described as "continuing the tradition of [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]], but giving him a [[thermonuclear]] capacity",&lt;ref name="Bishop, David"/&gt;{{rp|page=99}} revolved around two delinquent aliens, and was a science-fiction take on ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'''s characters [[O.C. and Stiggs]]. The work widely considered to be the highlight of his ''2000AD'' career,&lt;ref name="Bishop, David"/&gt;{{rp|pages=100–110}} and that he himself described as "the one that worked best for me"&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=58}} was ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]''.&lt;ref name="Bishop, David"/&gt;{{rp|pages=99–102}} Co-created with artist [[Ian Gibson (comics)|Ian Gibson]], the series was set in the 50th century. The series was discontinued after three books due to a dispute between Moore and Fleetway, the magazine's publishers, over the intellectual property rights of the characters Moore and Gibson had co-created.

Another comic company to employ Moore was Marvel UK, who had formerly purchased a few of his one-off stories for ''Doctor Who Weekly'' and ''Star Wars Weekly''. Aiming to get an older audience than ''2000AD'', their main rival, they employed Moore to write for the regular strip ''[[Captain Britain]]'', "halfway through a storyline that he's neither inaugurated nor completely understood."&lt;ref name="Moore, Alan 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last=Moore | first=Alan |author2=[[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]] | title=Captain Britain | date=1 February 2002 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | isbn=978-0-7851-0855-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced the former writer Dave Thorpe, but maintained the original artist, Alan Davis, whom Moore described as "an artist whose love for the medium and whose sheer exultation upon finding himself gainfully employed within it shine from every line, every new costume design, each nuance of expression."&lt;ref name="Moore, Alan 2002"/&gt;

The third comic company that Moore worked for in this period was Quality Communications, publishers of a new monthly magazine called ''Warrior''. The magazine was founded by [[Dez Skinn]], a former editor of both IPC (publishers of ''2000 AD'') and Marvel UK, and was designed to offer writers a greater degree of freedom over their artistic creations than was allowed by pre-existing companies. It was at ''Warrior'' that Moore "would start to reach his potential".&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=21}} Moore was initially given two ongoing strips in ''Warrior'': ''[[Marvelman]]'' and ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', both of which debuted in ''Warrior'''s first issue in March 1982. ''V for Vendetta'' was a dystopian thriller set in a future 1997 where a fascist government controlled Britain, opposed only by a lone [[anarchism|anarchist]] dressed in a [[Guy Fawkes]] costume who turns to terrorism to topple the government. Illustrated by [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]], Moore was influenced by his pessimistic feelings about the [[Thatcherite]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, which he projected forward as a fascist state in which all ethnic and sexual minorities had been eliminated. It has been regarded as "among Moore's best work" and has maintained a cult following throughout subsequent decades.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=22}}

''Marvelman'' (later retitled ''Miracleman'' for legal reasons) was a series that originally had been published in Britain from 1954 through to 1963, based largely upon the American comic ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''. Upon resurrecting ''Marvelman'', Moore "took a kitsch children's character and placed him within the real world of 1982".&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=23}} The work was drawn primarily by [[Garry Leach]] and Alan Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Khoury | first=George | title=Kimota!: The Miracleman Companion | date=1 September 2001 | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|location= Raleigh, North Carolina | isbn=978-1-893905-11-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series that Moore produced for ''Warrior'' was ''[[The Bojeffries Saga]]'', a comedy about a working-class English family of [[vampires]] and [[werewolves]], drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]]. ''Warrior'' closed before these stories were completed,&lt;ref name="OGWS"&gt;{{cite book | last=Knowles | first=Christopher | authorlink=Christopher Knowles (comics) | others=Illustrated by [[Joseph Michael Linsner]] | title=[[Our Gods Wear Spandex]] | publisher=[[Red Wheel Weiser Conari|Weiser]] | date=1 November 2007 | page=199 | isbn=978-1-57863-406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCMB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBTMP"&gt;{{cite book | last=Khoury | first=George | title=True Brit | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | date=July 2004|location= Raleigh, North Carolina | pages=23–25 | isbn=978-1-893905-33-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but under new publishers both ''Miracleman'' and ''V for Vendetta'' were resumed by Moore, who finished both stories by 1989. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin remarked that "reading them through together throws up some interesting contrasts – in one the hero fights a fascist dictatorship based in London, in the other an [[Aryan]] superman imposes one."&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=26}}

Although Moore's work numbered amongst the most popular strips to appear in ''2000 AD'', Moore himself became increasingly concerned at the lack of creator's rights in British comics.&lt;ref name="Bishop, David"/&gt;{{rp|pages=105–106}} In 1985, he talked to fanzine ''Arkensword'', noting that he had stopped working for all British publishers bar IPC, "purely for the reason that IPC so far have avoided lying to me, cheating me or generally treating me like shit."&lt;ref name="Heidi, pt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidi, pt2"/&gt; He did join other creators in decrying the wholesale relinquishing of all rights, and in 1986 stopped writing for ''2000 AD'', leaving mooted future volumes of the ''Halo Jones'' story unstarted.&lt;ref name="Bishop, David"/&gt;{{rp|pages=110–111}} Moore's outspoken opinions and principles, particularly on the subject of creator's rights and ownership, would see him burn bridges with a number of other publishers over the course of his career.&lt;ref name="Heidi, pt1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html  | last=MacDonald | first=Heidi | authorlink=Heidi MacDonald | title=A for Alan, Pt. 1: The Alan Moore interview | date=1 November 2005 | work=The Beat | publisher=[[Mile High Comics]]/Comicon.com | accessdate=26 September 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505034142/http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html |archivedate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidi, pt2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_2_the_further_ad.html | last=MacDonald | first=Heidi | title=A for Alan, Pt. 2: The further adventures of Alan Moore | date=1 November 2005 | work=The Beat | publisher=Mile High Comics/Comicon.com | accessdate=26 September 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419040811/http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_2_the_further_ad.html | archivedate=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, during this same period, he – using the pseudonym of Translucia Baboon – became involved in the music scene, founding his own band, The Sinister Ducks, with [[David J]] (of goth band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]) and Alex Green, and in 1983 released a single, ''March of the Sinister Ducks'', with sleeve art by illustrator [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]. In 1984, Moore and David J released a [[12-inch single]] featuring a recording of "This Vicious Cabaret", a song featured in ''V for Vendetta'', which was released on the Glass Records label.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=95}} Moore would write the song "Leopardman at C&amp;A" for David J, and it would be set to music by Mick Collins for the album ''[[We Have You Surrounded]]'' by Collins' group [[The Dirtbombs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/news/dirtbombs-shell-america.html | last=Graham | first=Ben | title=Dirtbombs drop shell on America, explode rep as one-trick pony | work=[[The Stool Pigeon (newspaper)|The Stool Pigeon]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117042808/http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-dirtbombs.html | archivedate=17 November 2012 | deadurl=yes | accessdate=31 January 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American mainstream and DC Comics: 1983–1988===
Moore's work in ''2000 AD'' brought him to the attention of [[DC Comics]] editor [[Len Wein]],&lt;ref name=WeinDaddy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=Richard|date=November 2004 |title=Who's Your Daddy?? |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |issue=140|pages=68–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; who hired him in 1983 to write ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', then a formulaic and poor-selling monster comic. Moore, with artists [[Stephen R. Bissette]], [[Rick Veitch]], and [[John Totleben]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 206|quote= Writer Alan Moore was creating a whole new paradigm&amp;nbsp;...

Moore would continue writing ''Swamp Thing'' for almost four years, from issue No.&amp;nbsp;20 (January 1984) through to issue No.&amp;nbsp;64 (September 1987) with the exception of issues No.&amp;nbsp;59 and 62.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=82}} Moore's run on ''Swamp Thing'' was successful both critically and commercially, and inspired DC to recruit British writers such as [[Grant Morrison]], [[Jamie Delano]], [[Peter Milligan]], and [[Neil Gaiman]] to write comics in a similar vein, often involving radical revamps of obscure characters.&lt;ref name="OGWS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RCMB"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bongco | first=Mila | title=Reading Comics: Language, Culture, and the Concept of the Superhero in Comic Books | publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | date=17 May 2000 | pages=182–183 | isbn=978-0-8153-3344-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These titles laid the foundation of what became the Vertigo line.

Moore began producing further stories for DC Comics, including a two-part story for ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'', which dealt with domestic abuse. He was eventually given the chance to write a story for one of DC's best-known superheroes, [[Superman]], entitled "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]", which was illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]] and published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 214: "The legendary writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons teamed up once again with the just-as-legendary Man of Tomorrow for a special that saw Superman&amp;nbsp;... held in the sway of the Black Mercy."&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]], and [[Jason Todd|Robin]] visit Superman on his birthday, only to find that he has been overcome by an alien organism and is hallucinating about his heart's desire.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=37}} He followed this with another Superman story, "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]", which was published in 1986. Illustrated by [[Curt Swan]], it was designed as the last Superman story in the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[DC Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 220: "In 'Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?', a two-part story written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Curt Swan, the adventures of the Silver Age Superman came to a dramatic close."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mohan|first= Aidan M.|title= Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? An Imaginary Story|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 62|pages= 76–80|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= February 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited series ''[[Watchmen]]'', begun in 1986 and collected as a trade paperback in 1987, cemented Moore's reputation. Imagining what the world would be like if costumed heroes had really existed since the 1940s, Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]] created a [[Cold War]] mystery in which the shadow of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] threatens the world. The heroes who are caught up in this escalating crisis either work for the US government or are outlawed, and are motivated to heroism by their various psychological hang-ups. ''Watchmen'' is non-linear and told from multiple points of view, and includes highly sophisticated self-references, ironies, and formal experiments such as the symmetrical design of issue 5, "Fearful Symmetry", where the last page is a near mirror-image of the first, the second-last of the second, and so on, and in this manner is an early example of Moore's interest in the human perception of time and its implications for free will. It is the only comic to win the [[Hugo Award]], in a one-time category ("Best Other Form").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=11 | title=The Hugo Awards: Ask a Question | date=23 February 2008 | accessdate=22 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228150704/http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=11| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely seen as Moore's best work, and has been regularly described as the greatest comic book ever written.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=39–40}} Alongside roughly contemporary works such as Frank Miller's ''Batman: [[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus]]'', and [[Jaime Hernandez|Jaime]] and [[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'', ''Watchmen'' was part of a late 1980s trend in American comics towards more adult sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 220: "The story itself was a masterful example of comic book storytelling at its finest&amp;nbsp;... Filled with symbolism, foreshadowing, and ahead-of-its-time characterization thanks to adult themes and sophisticated plotting, ''Watchmen'' elevated the super hero comic book into the realms of true modern literature."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comics historian]] [[Les Daniels]] noted that ''Watchmen'' "called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company|Bulfinch Press]]|year = 1995|page = 196|isbn = 0-8212-2076-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics writer and executive [[Paul Levitz]] observed in 2010 that "As with ''The Dark Knight Returns'', ''Watchmen'' set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim&amp;nbsp;... and would continue to be regarded as one of the most important literary works the field ever produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Dark Age 1984–1998|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= [[Taschen]]|year=2010|location= Cologne, Germany|isbn= 978-3-8365-1981-6|page= 563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore briefly became a media celebrity, and the resulting attention led to him withdrawing from [[fandom]] and no longer attending comics conventions (at one [[UKCAC]] in London he is said to have been followed into the toilet by eager autograph hunters).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | cartoonist=[[Eddie Campbell|Campbell, Eddie]] | title=Alec: How to be an Artist | date=1 August 2001 | publisher=[[Top Shelf Productions]] | page=108 | panel=9 | ID={{ISBN|978-0-9577896-3-0}}}} "The last straw may well go down as apocryphal."&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Gibbons had earlier created the character [[Mogo]] as part of DC's [[Green Lantern Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://io9.com/5812496/a-beginners-guide-to-everything-green-lantern|title= A beginner's guide to Green Lantern|first= Alasdair|last= Wilkins|date= 16 June 2011|publisher= [[io9]]|quote= ''DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore'' features three absolutely crucial Green Lantern stories: 'Mogo Doesn't Socialize', which introduced everyone's favorite sentient planet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a short story by Moore and artist [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] published in ''Green Lantern Corps Annual'' No. 2 (1986) was one of the inspirations for the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline in 2009-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/alan-moore-puts-on-red-lantern-ring-takes-a-potshot-at-blackes/ |title=Alan Moore Puts on Red Lantern Ring, Takes a Potshot at ''Blackest Night'' |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=22 September 2009 |publisher=[[Townsquare Media|ComicsAlliance]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914195122/http://comicsalliance.com/alan-moore-puts-on-red-lantern-ring-takes-a-potshot-at-blackes/ |archivedate=14 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |quote=Alan Moore criticized the dearth of new ideas in modern superhero comics, and then went after DC writer Geoff Johns by claiming that his ''Blackest Night'' storyline was a ripoff of Moore’s old ''Tales of the Green Lantern'' story. |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Moore submitted a proposal for a miniseries called ''[[Twilight of the Superheroes]]'', the title a twist on [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'' (meaning "Twilight of the Gods"). The series was set in the future of the DC Universe, where the world is ruled by superheroic dynasties, including the House of Steel (presided over by Superman and Wonder Woman) and the House of Thunder (led by the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] family). These two houses are about to unite through a dynastic marriage, their combined power potentially threatening freedom, and several characters, including John Constantine, attempt to stop it and free humanity from the power of superheroes. The series would also have restored the DC Universe's multiple earths, which had been eliminated in the continuity-revising 1985 limited series ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. The series was never commissioned, but copies of Moore's detailed notes have appeared on the Internet and in print despite the efforts of DC, who consider the proposal their property.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=43–44}} Similar elements, such as the concept of [[Hypertime (comics)|hypertime]], have since appeared in DC comics. The 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], was also set amid a superheroic conflict in the future of the DC Universe. Waid and Ross have stated that they had read the ''Twilight'' proposal before starting work on their series, but that any similarities are both minor and unintended.&lt;ref name="TBTMP"/&gt;

Moore wrote the lead story in ''Batman Annual'' No. 11 (1987) drawn by [[George Freeman (comics)|George Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|chapter= 1980s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 169|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote=  Alan Moore crafted yet another timeless tale in this annual.

Moore's relationship with DC Comics had gradually deteriorated over the issues of creator's rights and merchandising. Moore and Gibbons were not paid any royalties for a ''Watchmen'' spin-off badge set, as DC defined them as a "promotional item",&lt;ref name="vendettavendetta"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Vendetta Behind ''V for Vendetta''|last= Itzkoff|first= Dave|date= 12 March 2006 |work= The New York Times|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140403235535/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin&amp;|archivedate= 3 April 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to certain reports, he and Gibbons gained only 2% of the profits earned by DC for ''Watchmen''.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=44}} Meanwhile, a group of creators including Moore, Frank Miller, [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[Howard Chaykin]], fell out with DC over a proposed age-rating system similar to those used for films.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=44–45}} After completing ''V for Vendetta'', which DC had already begun publishing, thus enabling him to finish the final few episodes, in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 234: "A fable of revolution and a cautionary tale of lost freedoms, ''V For Vendetta'' was a triumph for Moore, this time aided by the shadowy pencils of David Lloyd."&lt;/ref&gt; Moore stopped working for DC.

===Independent period and Mad Love: 1988–1993===

Abandoning DC Comics and the mainstream, Moore, with his wife Phyllis and their mutual lover Deborah Delano, set up their own comics publishing company, which they named Mad Love. The works that they published in Mad Love turned away from the science fiction and superhero genres that Moore was used to writing, instead focusing on realism, ordinary people, and political causes. Mad Love's first publication, ''[[AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia)|AARGH]]'', was an anthology of work by a number of writers (including Moore) that challenged the Thatcher government's recently introduced [[Section 28|Clause 28]], a law designed to prevent councils and schools "promoting homosexuality". Sales from the book went towards the Organisation of Lesbian and Gay Action, and Moore was "very pleased with" it, stating that "we hadn't prevented this bill from becoming law, but we had joined in the general uproar against it, which prevented it from ever becoming as viciously effective as its designers might have hoped."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gravett | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Gravett | url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/alan_moore/ | title=Alan Moore: No More Sex|journal=[[Escape (magazine)|Escape]]|issue=15|year=1988|editor1-last=Gravett|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=Stanbury|editor2-first=Peter|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130706175957/http://paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/alan_moore|archivedate= 6 July 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore followed this with a second political work, ''Shadowplay: The Secret Team'', a comic illustrated by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] for [[Eclipse Comics]] and commissioned by the [[Christic Institute]], which was included as a part of the anthology ''[[Brought to Light]]'', a description of the [[CIA]]'s covert drug smuggling and arms dealing.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=47}}  In 1998 "[[Brought to Light]]" was adapted by Moore in collaboration with composer [[Gary Lloyd]] as a narrative and music work which was released on cd.

After prompting by cartoonist and self-publishing advocate [[Dave Sim]],&lt;ref name="bigwords1"/&gt; Moore then used Mad Love to publish his next project, ''[[Big Numbers (comics)|Big Numbers]]'', a proposed 12-issue series set in "a hardly-disguised version of Moore's native Northampton" known as Hampton, and deals with the effects of big business on ordinary people and with ideas of [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=48}} Illustration of the comic was begun by Bill Sienkiewicz, who left the series after only two issues in 1990, and despite plans that his assistant, [[Al Columbia]], would replace him, it never occurred and the series [[List of comics solicited but never published|remained unfinished]].&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=48–49}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gravett | first=Paul | url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/al_columbia/  | title=Al Columbia: Columbia's Voyage of Discovery | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=Special Edition | date=Winter 2002 | accessdate=22 March 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100826155216/http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/al_columbia/ |archivedate = 26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, in 1991 the company [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] published Moore's ''[[A Small Killing]]'', a full length story illustrated by [[Oscar Zárate]], about a once idealistic advertising executive haunted by his boyhood self. According to Lance Parkin, ''A Small Killing'' is "quite possibly Moore's most underrated work".&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=49}} Soon after this, Mad Love itself was disbanded as Phyllis and Deborah ended their relationship with Moore, taking with them much of the money that he had earned from his work in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=25}}

Meanwhile, Moore began producing work for ''[[Taboo (comics)|Taboo]]'', a small independent comic anthology edited by his former collaborator [[Stephen R. Bissette]]. The first of these was ''[[From Hell]]'', a fictionalised account of the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders of the 1880s. Inspired by [[Douglas Adams]]' novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Graydon|first= Danny|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/22/alan_moore_2001_interview.shtml | title=Interview – Alan Moore |publisher=[[BBC Films]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311011452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/22/alan_moore_2001_interview.shtml|archivedate= 11 March 2009|deadurl= no| accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore reasoned that to solve a crime [[holism|holistically]], one would need to solve the entire society it occurred in, and depicts the murders as a consequence of the politics and economics of the time. Just about every notable figure of the period is connected with the events in some way, including "Elephant Man" [[Joseph Merrick]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] writer [[Black Elk]], [[William Morris]], artist [[Walter Sickert]], and [[Aleister Crowley]], who makes a brief appearance as a young boy. Illustrated in a sooty pen-and-ink style by [[Eddie Campbell]], ''From Hell'' took nearly ten years to complete, outlasting ''Taboo'' and going through two more publishers before being collected as a trade paperback by Eddie Campbell Comics. It was widely praised, with comics author [[Warren Ellis]] calling it "my all-time favourite graphic novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis |first=Warren |authorlink=Warren Ellis |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,479890,00.html |title=Review of ''From Hell'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719090833/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C479890%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2013 |deadurl=no |date=5 September 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other series that Moore began for ''Taboo'' was ''[[Lost Girls]]'', which he described as a work of intelligent "pornography".&lt;ref name=SFW&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw13282.html | title=Alan Moore leaves behind his ''Extraordinary Gentlemen'' to dally with ''Lost Girls'' | accessdate=8 August 2006 | last=Schindler | first=Dorman T. | date=7 August 2006 | work=[[Science Fiction Weekly]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811174459/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw13282.html  | archivedate=11 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrated by [[Melinda Gebbie]], with whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship, it was set in 1913, where [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]] from ''[[Peter Pan]]'' – who are each of a different age and class – all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=49–50}} With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that "I had a lot of different ideas as to how it might be possible to do an up-front sexual comic strip and to do it in a way that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general. That it's mostly ugly, it's mostly boring, it's not inventive – it has no standards."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|pages=154–155}} Like ''From Hell'', ''Lost Girls'' outlasted ''Taboo'', and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006.

Meanwhile, Moore set about writing a prose novel, eventually producing ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'', which would be published in 1996. Unconventional in tone, the novel was a set of short stories about linked events in his hometown of Northampton through the centuries, from the [[Bronze Age]] to the present day, which combined to tell a larger story.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=92}}

===Return to the mainstream and Image Comics: 1993–1998===
In 1993 Moore declared himself to be a [[ceremonial magician]]. The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics. He did so through [[Image Comics]], widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style, graphic violence, and scantily clad large-breasted women, something that horrified many of his fans.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=55}} His first work published by Image, an issue of the series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', was soon followed by the creation of his own mini-series, ''[[1963 (comics)|1963]]'', which was "a pastiche of [[Jack Kirby]] stories drawn for [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] in the sixties, with their rather overblown style, colourful characters and cosmic style".&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=56}} According to Moore, "after I'd done the ''1963'' stuff I'd become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I'd been away [since 1988]. That all of a sudden it seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story, just lots of big, full-page pin-up sort of pieces of artwork. And I was genuinely interested to see if I could write a decent story for that market."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=173}}

He subsequently set about writing what he saw as "better than average stories for 13- to 15-year olds", including three mini-series based upon the ''Spawn'' series: ''[[Violator (comics)|Violator]]'', ''Violator/[[Badrock]]'', and ''Spawn: Blood Feud''.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=56}} In 1995, he was also given control of a regular monthly comic, [[Jim Lee]]'s ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.S.]]'', starting with issue No. 21, which he would continue to write for fourteen issues. The series followed two groups of superheroes, one of which is on a spaceship headed back to its home planet, and one of which remains on Earth. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin was critical of the run, feeling that it was one of Moore's worst, and that "you feel Moore should be better than this. It's not special."&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=56}} Moore himself, who remarked that he took on the series – his only regular monthly comic series since ''Swamp Thing'' – largely because he liked Jim Lee, admitted that he was not entirely happy with the work, believing that he had catered too much to his conceptions of what the fans wanted rather than being innovative.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=174}}

Next he took over [[Rob Liefeld]]'s ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'', about a character with many similarities with DC Comics' [[Superman]]. Instead of emphasising increased realism as he had done with earlier superhero comics he had taken over, Moore did the opposite, and began basing the series on the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Superman comics of the 1960s, introducing a female superhero Suprema, a super-dog Radar, and a [[Kryptonite]]-like material known as Supremium, in doing so harking back to the original "mythic" figure of the American superhero. Under Moore, Supreme would prove to be a critical and commercial success, announcing that he was back in the mainstream after several years of self-imposed exile.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=59–60}}

When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, split from the publisher and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore to create a new universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'' and ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'', as well as a three-part mini-series known as ''[[Judgment Day (Awesome Comics)|Judgment Day]]'' to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=60–61}} Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, [[Jim Valentino]] – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=175}}

===America's Best Comics: 1999–2008===
{{Main|America's Best Comics}}
Image partner Jim Lee offered to provide Moore with his own imprint, which would be under Lee's company [[WildStorm Productions]]. Moore named this imprint [[America's Best Comics]], lining up a series of artists and writers to assist him in this venture. Lee soon sold WildStorm – including America's Best Comics – to DC Comics, and "Moore found himself back with a company he'd vowed to never work with again". Lee and editor [[Scott Dunbier]] flew to England personally to reassure Moore that he would not be affected by the sale, and would not have to deal with DC directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://twistandshoutcomics.com/features/columns/rrevs0898.html  | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston | title=Lee Spotting | work=Rich's Ramblings '98 | date=31 August 1998 | accessdate=23 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013083745/http://twistandshoutcomics.com/features/columns/rrevs0898.html |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore decided that there were too many people involved to back out from the project, and so ABC was launched in early 1999.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=62}}

The first series published by ABC was ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', which featured a variety of characters from [[Victorian era|Victorian]] adventure novels, such as [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s [[Allan Quatermain]], [[H. G. Wells]]' [[The Invisible Man|Invisible Man]], [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Captain Nemo]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and Wilhelmina Murray from [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. Illustrated by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], the first volume of the series pitted the League against [[Professor Moriarty]] from the ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' books; the second, against the Martians from ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; A third volume entitled ''[[The Black Dossier]]'' was set in the 1950s. The series was well received, and Moore was pleased that an American audience was enjoying something he considered "perversely English", and that it was inspiring some readers to get interested in Victorian literature.&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=183}}

Another of Moore's ABC works was ''[[Tom Strong]]'', a post-modern superhero series, featured a hero inspired by characters pre-dating Superman, such as [[Doc Savage]] and [[Tarzan]]. The character's drug-induced longevity allowed Moore to include flashbacks to Strong's adventures throughout the 20th century, written and drawn in period styles, as a comment on the history of comics and [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. The primary artist was [[Chris Sprouse]]. ''Tom Strong'' bore many similarities to Moore's earlier work on ''Supreme'', but according to Lance Parkin, was "more subtle", and was "ABC's most accessible comic".&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=64–65}}

Moore's ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'', a deadpan [[police procedural]] drama set in a city called Neopolis where everyone, including the police, criminals, and civilians has super-powers, costumes, and secret identities, was drawn by [[Gene Ha]] and [[Zander Cannon]].&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|pages=65–66,71}} The series ended after twelve issues, but has spawned four spin-offs: a miniseries ''[[Smax]]'', which was set in a [[fantasy]] realm and drawn by Cannon; ''[[Top 10: The Forty-Niners]]'', a prequel to the main ''Top Ten'' series drawn by Ha;&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill "2000s" in Dolan, p. 320: "A graphic novel prequel to the award-winning ''Top 10'' series, ''The Forty-Niners'' proved to be one of the best books of the year."&lt;/ref&gt; and two sequel miniseries, ''[[Top 10: Beyond the Farthest Precinct]]'', which was written by [[Paul Di Filippo]] and drawn by [[Jerry Ordway]], and ''Top 10: Season Two'', written by Cannon and drawn by Ha.

Moore's series ''[[Promethea]]'', which told the story of a teenage girl, Sophie Bangs, who is possessed by an ancient pagan goddess, the titular Promethea, explored many occult themes, particularly the [[Qabalah]] and the concept of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], with Moore stating that "I wanted to be able to do an occult comic that didn't portray the occult as a dark, scary place, because that's not my experience of it&amp;nbsp;... [''Promethea'' was] more psychedelic&amp;nbsp;... more sophisticated, more experimental, more ecstatic and exuberant."&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=188}} Drawn by [[J. H. Williams III]], it has been described as "a personal statement" from Moore, being one of his most personal works, and that it encompasses "a belief system, a personal cosmology".&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=68}}

ABC Comics was also used to publish an anthology series, ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'', which featured a regular cast of characters such as [[Cobweb (comics)|Cobweb]], [[First American (comics)|First American]], [[Greyshirt (comics)|Greyshirt]], [[Jack B. Quick]], and [[Splash Brannigan]]. ''Tomorrow Stories'' was notable for being an anthology series, a medium that had largely died out in American comics at the time.&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=66}}

Despite the assurances that DC Comics would not interfere with Moore and his work, they subsequently did so, angering him. Specifically, in ''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' No. 5, an authentic vintage advertisement for a "Marvel"-brand [[douche]] caused DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] to order the entire print run destroyed and reprinted with the advertisement amended to "Amaze", to avoid friction with DC's competitor [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.recalledcomics.com/LeagueOfExtraOrdinaryGentlemen5RecalledMarvelAd.php | title=''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen No.&amp;nbsp;5 Recalled'' |publisher=Recalled Comics.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131031144213/http://recalledcomics.com/LeagueOfExtraOrdinaryGentlemen5RecalledMarvelAd.php|archivedate= 31 October 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Cobweb'' story Moore wrote for ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'' No.&amp;nbsp;8 featuring references to [[L. Ron Hubbard]], American occultist [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], and the "[[Babalon Working]]", was blocked by DC Comics due to the subject matter. DC had already published a version of the same event in their [[Paradox Press]] volume ''[[The Big Book of#Conspiracies|The Big Book of Conspiracies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cronin|first = Brian|title = Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher = [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]]|year = 2009|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SFgiXbVykSIC&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=DC+Comics+L+Ron+Hubbard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M7hKuxFLFt&amp;sig=ox8kEh9wmRPuaKFlJNwqoSJZWFk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9fk9U6KbHqbLsAT54IGwCA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=DC%20Comics%20L%20Ron%20Hubbard&amp;f=false|isbn = 978-0-452-29532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a documentary about him was made by Shadowsnake Films, titled ''[[The Mindscape of Alan Moore]]'', which was later released on DVD.&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"&gt;{{cite video | people=DeZ Vylenz (Director) | date=30 September 2008 | title=The Mindscape of Alan Moore | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410321/ | medium=Documentary | publisher=Shadowsnake Films}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to independence: 2009–present===
[[File:Alan Moore at the ICA on June 2nd 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Alan Moore at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 2009]]
With many of the stories he had planned for America's Best Comics brought to an end, and with his increasing dissatisfaction with how DC Comics were interfering with his work, he decided to once more pull out of the comics mainstream. In 2005, he remarked that "I love the comics medium. I pretty much detest the comics industry. Give it another 15 months, I'll probably be pulling out of mainstream, commercial comics."&lt;ref name="Baker, Bill"/&gt;{{rp|page=65}} The only ABC title continued by Moore was ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen''; after cutting ties with DC he launched the new ''League'' saga, ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century|Volume III: Century]]'', in a co-publishing partnership of [[Top Shelf Productions]] and [[Knockabout Comics]], the first part released in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third released in 2012.

In 2006, the complete edition of ''[[Lost Girls]]'' was published, as a slipcased set of three hardcover volumes. The same year Moore published an eight-page article tracing out the history of pornography in which he argued that a society's vibrancy and success are related to its permissiveness in sexual matters.

In 2016, Moore confirmed that after authoring a final ''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' book, he plans on retiring from regularly writing comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/08/alan-moore-confirms-he-is-retiring-from-creating-comic-books|title= Alan Moore confirms he is retiring from creating comic books|date= 8 September 2016|work= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2016, Moore has been curating a comic book anthology series entitled ''Cinema Purgatorio'' published by [[Avatar Press]], each issue opening with a story written by Moore and illustrated by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]].

In 2018 Moore contributed to the comic anthology ''24 Panels''.

==Work==

===Themes===
In a number of his comics, where he was taking over from earlier writers, including ''Marvelman'', ''Swamp Thing'', and ''Supreme'', he used the "familiar tactic of wiping out what had gone before, giving the hero amnesia and revealing that everything we'd learned to that point was a lie."&lt;ref name="Parkin, Lance"/&gt;{{rp|page=58}} In this manner he was largely able to start afresh with the character and their series and was not constrained by earlier canon. While commenting on the artistic restrictiveness of serialised comic books, artist [[Josef Rubinstein|Joe Rubinstein]] gave the example that a comics creator would be limited in what he could do with [[Spider-Man]], and added, "unless you're Alan Moore, who would probably kill him and bring him back as a real spider or something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Henderson, Chris | date = July 1986 | title = Joe Rubinstein | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 36 | page = 49 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a comics writer, Moore applies literary sensibilities to the mainstream of the medium as well as including challenging subject matter and adult themes.

===Recognition and awards===
Moore's work in the comic book medium has been widely recognised by his peers and by critics. Comics historian [[George Khoury]] asserted that "to call this free spirit the best writer in the history of comic books is an understatement"&lt;ref name="Khoury, George"/&gt;{{rp|page=10}} whilst interviewer Steve Rose referred to him as "the [[Orson Welles]] of comics" who is "the undisputed high priest of the medium, whose every word is seized upon like a message from the ether" by comic book fans.&lt;ref name="Moore's murderer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rose |first=Steve |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,6000,643500,00.html |title=Moore's murderer |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=2 February 2002 |accessdate=12 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219151930/http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0%2C6000%2C643500%2C00.html |archivedate=19 February 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Wolk observed: "Moore has undisputably made it into the Hall of Fame: he's one of the pillars of English language comics, alongside Jack Kirby and Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman and not many others. He's also the grand exception in that hall, since the other pillars are artists – and more often than not, writer/artists. Moore is a writer almost exclusively, though his hyper detailed scripts always play to the strengths of the artists he works with. That makes him the chief monkey wrench in comics author theory. The main reason that almost nobody's willing to say that a single cartoonist is ''categorically'' superior to a writer/artist team is that such a rule would run smack into Moore's bibliography. In fact, a handful of cartoonists who almost always write the stories they draw have made exceptions for Moore – [[Jaime Hernandez]], [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]] and most memorably Eddie Campbell."&lt;ref name="Wolk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wolk | first=Douglas | authorlink=Douglas Wolk | title=Reading Comics | year=2007 | location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] | publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] | isbn=978-0-306-81616-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=229}}

Among his numerous international prizes are the German [[Max &amp; Moritz Prize]] for an exceptional oeuvre (2008) and the British [[National Comics Awards|National Comics Award]] for Best Comics Writer Ever (in 2001 and 2002).

Moore also won two [[International Horror Guild Award]]s in the category Graphic Story/Illustrated Narrative (in 1995 with [[Eddie Campbell]] for ''From Hell'' and in 2003 with [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] for ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horroraward.org/prevrec.html |title=IHG Award Recipients |publisher=International Horror Guild |accessdate=1 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hhhbRuwD?url=http://www.horroraward.org/prevrec.html |archivedate=21 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore received a [[Bram Stoker Award]] in the category Best Illustrated Narrative for ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' in 2000, then again in 2012 for ''[[Neonomicon]]'' as Best Graphic Novel.

==Film adaptations==
Due to the success of his comics, a number of filmmakers have expressed a desire to make film adaptations over the years. Moore himself has consistently opposed such ventures, stating that "I wanted to give comics a special place when I was writing things like ''Watchmen''. I wanted to show off just what the possibilities of the comic book medium were, and films are completely different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/film/features/4187/alan-moore|title= Alan Moore – Writer of ''Watchmen''|last= Dent|first= Nick|work= [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Sydney]]|date= March 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120723003721/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/film/features/4187/alan-moore|archivedate= 23 July 2012|deadurl= yes|access-date= 5 April 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressing similar sentiments, he also remarked that "If we only see comics in relation to movies then the best that they will ever be is films that do not move. I found it, in the mid 80s, preferable to concentrate on those things that only comics could achieve. The way in which a tremendous amount of information could be included visually in every panel, the juxtapositions between what a character was saying and what the image that the reader was looking at would be. So in a sense&amp;nbsp;... most of my work from the 80s onwards was designed to be un-filmable."&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt;

The first film to be based upon Moore's work was ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' in 2001, which was directed by the [[Hughes Brothers]]. The film made a number of radical differences from the original comic, altering the main character from an older, conservative detective to a young character played by [[Johnny Depp]]. This was followed in 2003 with ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', a film that departed radically from the books, changing the ending from a mob war over the skies of London to the infiltration of a secret base in [[Tibet]]. For these two works, Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely. "As long as I could distance myself by not seeing them," he said, he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched, "assured no one would confuse the two. This was probably naïve on my part."&lt;ref name="Lying in Gutters"&gt;{{cite web|first=Rich|last= Johnston|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&amp;article=2153|title= Lying in the Gutters|publisher= Comic Book Resources|date= 23 May 2005|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106220427/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14937|archivedate= 6 January 2014|deadurl= yes|accessdate=7 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His attitude changed after producer [[Martin Poll]] and screenwriter [[Larry Cohen]] [[Cast of Characters vs. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen lawsuit|filed a lawsuit]] against [[20th Century Fox]], alleging that the film ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' plagiarised an unproduced script they had written entitled ''Cast of Characters''. According to Moore, "They seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox called me up and persuaded me to steal this screenplay, turning it into a comic book they could then adapt back into a movie, to camouflage petty larceny." Moore testified in a deposition, a process he found so unpleasant that he surmised he would have been better treated had he "molested and murdered a busload of retarded children after giving them heroin". Fox's settlement of the case insulted Moore, who interpreted it as an admission of guilt.&lt;ref name="Lying in Gutters"/&gt; In 2012 Moore claimed that he had sold the rights to these two works simply for the money; he did not expect the films ever to be made. He was simply "getting money for old rope". Moore said in an interview in 2012 that he had seen neither film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |first=Alan |last=Moore |interviewer=Tim Franks | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9711346.stm|title=Alan Moore: "Films don't reflect my books" |work= BBC News – Hardtalk|date= 10 April 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9711346.stm|archivedate= 22 February 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a film adaptation of Moore's ''V for Vendetta'' was released, produced by [[The Wachowskis]] and directed by [[James McTeigue]]. Producer [[Joel Silver]] said at a press conference for the [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' that fellow producer [[The Wachowskis|Lana Wachowski]] had talked with Moore, and that "[Moore] was very excited about what [Lana] had to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsarama.com/movies/VforPressConf.htm | title=''V for Vendetta's'' Press Conference |publisher=[[Newsarama]]| year=2005 | accessdate=7 January 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161343/http://newsarama.com/movies/VforPressConf.htm |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore disputed this, reporting that he told Wachowski "I didn't want anything to do with films&amp;nbsp;... I wasn't interested in Hollywood," and demanded that DC Comics force Warner Bros to issue a public retraction and apology for Silver's "blatant lies". Although Silver called Moore directly to apologise, no public retraction appeared. Moore was quoted as saying that the comic book had been "specifically about things like fascism and anarchy. Those words, 'fascism' and 'anarchy,' occur nowhere in the film. It's been turned into a [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/ | title=Alan Moore: The Last Angry Man | first=Jennifer| last=Vineyard | work=Movies on MTV.com | publisher=MTV | accessdate=30 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222014726/http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/| archivedate= 22 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore also publicly criticised details of the script before the film's release, pointing to apparent laziness in the writing. "They don't know what British people have for breakfast, they couldn't be bothered [to find out]. 'Eggy in a basket' apparently. Now the US have '[[eggs in the basket|eggs in a basket]],' which is fried bread with a fried egg in a hole in the middle. I guess they thought we must eat that as well, and thought 'eggy in a basket' was a quaint and Olde Worlde version", he stated.

This conflict between Moore and DC Comics was the subject of an article in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="vendettavendetta"/&gt; on 12 March 2006, five days before the US release. In the ''New York Times'' article, Silver stated that about 20&amp;nbsp;years prior to the film's release he had met with Moore and Dave Gibbons when Silver acquired the film rights to ''V For Vendetta'' and ''Watchmen''. Silver stated, "Alan was odd, but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this. I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today, not realising that he wouldn't." Moore did not deny this meeting or Silver's characterisation of Moore at that meeting, nor did Moore state that he advised Silver of his change of opinion in those approximately 20&amp;nbsp;years. The ''New York Times'' article also interviewed David Lloyd about Moore's reaction to the film's production, stating, "Mr Lloyd, the illustrator of ''V for Vendetta'', also found it difficult to sympathise with Mr Moore's protests. When he and Mr Moore sold their film rights to the comic book, Mr Lloyd said: "We didn't do it innocently. Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]."&lt;ref name="vendettavendetta"/&gt;

Moore has subsequently stated that he wishes his name to be removed from all comic work that he does not own, including ''Watchmen'' and ''V for Vendetta'', much as unhappy film directors often choose to have their names removed and be credited as "[[Alan Smithee]]". He also announced that he would not allow his name to be used in any future film adaptations of works he does not own, nor would he accept any money from such adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/alan_moore_asks_for_an_alan_smithee/ | title=Alan Moore Asks for an Alan Smithee | last=Spurgeon | first=Tom | authorlink=Tom Spurgeon | date=9 November 2005 | work=[[The Comics Reporter]] | accessdate=7 January 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051124004336/http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/alan_moore_asks_for_an_alan_smithee/| archivedate= 24 November 2005 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This request was respected by the producers of the subsequent adaptations of his work ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' (2005) (based on a character created by Moore) and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009).

In a 2012 interview with [[LeftLion]] magazine, Alan Moore was asked to put a figure on how much money he had turned down by refusing to be associated with these film adaptations. He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway. I'd advise everyone to do it, otherwise you're going to end up mastered by money and that's not a thing you want ruling your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/title/alan-moore/id/4861/|title= Alan Moore: one of the finest exponents of the comic book art form to have ever lived|first= Jared|last= Wislon|authorlink= Jared Wilson|date= May 2012|publisher= ''[[LeftLion]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120811235311/http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/title/alan-moore/id/4861|archivedate= 11 August 2012|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Since his teenage years Moore has had long hair, and since early adulthood has also had a beard. He has taken to wearing a number of large rings on his hands, leading him to be described as a "cross between [[Hagrid]] and Danny from ''[[Withnail And I]]''" who could be easily mistaken for "the village eccentric".&lt;ref name="Moore's murderer"/&gt; Born and raised in [[Northampton]], he continues to live in the town, and used its history as a basis for his novels ''Voice of the Fire'' and ''Jerusalem''. His "unassuming terraced" Northampton home was described by an interviewer in 2001 as "something like an occult bookshop under permanent renovation, with records, videos, magical artefacts and comic-book figurines strewn among shelves of mystical tomes and piles of paper. The bathroom, with blue-and-gold décor and a generous sunken tub, is palatial; the rest of the house has possibly never seen a vacuum cleaner. This is clearly a man who spends little time on the material plane."&lt;ref name="Moore's murderer"/&gt; He likes to live in his home town, feeling that it affords him a level of obscurity that he enjoys, remarking that "I never signed up to be a celebrity."&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt; He has spoken in praise of the town's former Radical MP, [[Charles Bradlaugh]] at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20151223160643/https://charlesbradlaughsociety.wordpress.com/about/ annual commemoration].

With his first wife Phyllis, whom he married in the early 1970s, he has two daughters, [[Leah Moore|Leah]] and Amber.

In 1993, on his fortieth birthday, Moore openly declared his dedication to being a [[ceremonial magic]]ian, something he saw as "a logical end step to my career as a writer".&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt; According to a 2001 interview, his inspiration for doing this came when he was writing ''[[From Hell]]'' in the early 1990s, a book containing much [[Freemasonry|Freemasonic]] and occult symbolism: "One word balloon in ''From Hell'' completely hijacked my life&amp;nbsp;... A character says something like, 'The one place gods inarguably exist is in the human mind'. After I wrote that, I realised I'd accidentally made a true statement, and now I'd have to rearrange my entire life around it. The only thing that seemed to really be appropriate was to become a magician."&lt;ref name="Moore's murderer"/&gt; Moore associates magic very much with writing; "I believe that magic is art, and that art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a [[shaman]]."&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote="[[Monotheism]] is, to me, a great simplification. I mean the [[Kabbalah|Qabalah]] has a great multiplicity of gods, but at the very top of the Qabalic Tree of Life, you have this one sphere that is absolute God, the [[Monism|Monad]], something which is indivisible. All of the other gods, and indeed everything else in the universe, is a kind of emanation of that God. Now, that's fine, but it's when you suggest that there is only that one God, at this kind of unreachable height above humanity, and there is nothing in between, you're limiting and simplifying the thing. I tend to think of [[paganism]] as a kind of alphabet, as a language, it's like all of the gods are letters in that language. They express nuances, shades of meaning or certain subtleties of ideas, whereas monotheism tends to just be one vowel and it's just something like 'oooooooo'. It's a monkey sound."|source=Alan Moore&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt;}}

Connecting his esoteric beliefs with his career in writing, he conceptualised a hypothetical area known as the "Idea Space", describing it as "...&amp;nbsp;a space in which mental events can be said to occur, an idea space which is perhaps universal. Our individual consciousnesses have access to this vast universal space, just as we have individual houses, but the street outside the front door belongs to everybody. It's almost as if ideas are pre-existing forms within this space&amp;nbsp;... The landmasses that might exist in this mind space would be composed entirely of ideas, of concepts, that instead of continents and islands you might have large belief systems, philosophies, [[Marxism]] might be one, [[Judeo-Christian]] religions might make up another." He subsequently believed that to navigate this space, magical systems like the [[tarot]] and the Qabalah would have to be used.&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt;

Taking up the study of the Qabalah and the writings of the notorious early 20th-century occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], Moore accepted ideas from Crowley's religion, [[Thelema]], about [[True Will]] being connected to the will of the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] universe.&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt; In some of his earlier magical rituals, he used mind-altering psychedelic drugs but later gave this up, believing that they were unnecessary, and stated, "It's frightening. You call out the names in this strange incomprehensible language, and you're looking into the glass and there appears to be this little man talking to you. It just works."&lt;ref name="Moore's murderer"/&gt;

Moore took as his primary deity the ancient Roman snake god [[Glycon]], who was the centre of a cult founded by a prophet known as [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]], and according to Alexander's critic [[Lucian]], the god itself was merely a puppet, something Moore accepts, considering him to be a "complete hoax",&lt;ref name="Babcock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SLATEDW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/sidebar/2092745/ |title=Sidebar: How Alan Moore transformed American comics |last=Wolk |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Wolk |date=17 December 2003 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ajJOBmav?url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/sidebar/2092745/ |archivedate=10 September 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but dismisses as irrelevant. According to Pagan Studies scholar Ethan Doyle-White, "The very fact that Glycon was probably one big hoax was enough to convince Moore to devote himself to the scaly lord, for, as Moore maintains, the imagination is just as real as reality."&lt;ref name="Doyle-White, Ethan 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Doyle-White | first=Ethan | date=Summer 2009 | title=Occultic World of Alan Moore | journal=[[Pentacle (magazine)|Pentacle]] | issue=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Friends and hobbies ===
Moore is a member of Northampton Arts Lab and takes walks with the novelist [[Alistair Fruish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lanceparkin.wordpress.com/page/2/|title=Alan Moore Interview, Part V: Underland, Hancock, Jerusalem, Literary Difficulty|last=Parkin|first=Lance|date=November 6, 2014 |website=Moore's biographer's official website|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Moore politically identifies as an [[Anarchism|anarchist]],&lt;ref name="Heidi, pt1"/&gt; and outlined his interpretation of anarchist philosophy, and its application to fiction writing in an interview with Margaret Killjoy, collected in the 2009 book, ''Mythmakers and Lawbreakers'':

{{quote|I believe that all other political states are in fact variations or outgrowths of a basic state of anarchy; after all, when you mention the idea of anarchy to most people they will tell you what a bad idea it is because the biggest gang would just take over. Which is pretty much how I see contemporary society. We live in a badly developed anarchist situation in which the biggest gang has taken over and have declared that it is not an anarchist situation – that it is a [[capitalist]] or a [[communist]] situation. But I tend to think that anarchy is the most natural form of politics for a human being to actually practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Killjoy | first=Margaret | others=Robinson, Kim Stanley (Introduction) | title=Mythmakers and Lawbreakers | publisher=[[AK Press]] | location=[[Stirling]], Scotland | date=1 October 2009 | page=42 | isbn=978-1-84935-002-0 | oclc=318877243}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 2011, Moore responded to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s attack on the [[Occupy movement]], calling his more recent work misogynistic, homophobic and misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.honestpublishing.com/news/the-honest-alan-moore-interview-part-2-the-occupy-movement-frank-miller-and-politics/|title= The Honest Alan Moore Interview – Part 2: The Occupy Movement, Frank Miller, and Politics|date= 2 December 2011|publisher= Honestpublishing.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131106150719/http://www.honestpublishing.com/news/the-honest-alan-moore-interview-part-2-the-occupy-movement-frank-miller-and-politics/|archivedate= 6 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 26 April 2013 |quote= Well, Frank Miller is someone whose work I've barely looked at for the past twenty years. I thought the ''Sin City'' stuff was unreconstructed misogyny, ''300'' appeared to be wildly ahistoric, homophobic and just completely misguided&amp;nbsp;... [The Occupy movement] is a completely justified howl of moral outrage and it seems to be handled in a very intelligent, non-violent way, which is probably another reason why Frank Miller would be less than pleased with it. I'm sure if it had been a bunch of young, sociopathic vigilantes with Batman make-up on their faces, he'd be more in favour of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, Occupy protesters have adopted the [[Guy Fawkes mask]] from ''V for Vendetta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Caron|first= Christina|url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/11/occupy-protesters-embrace-v-for-vendetta/ | title= Occupy Protesters Embrace ''V for Vendetta''|publisher= [[ABC News]]|date= 4 November 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001524/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/11/occupy-protesters-embrace-v-for-vendetta/|archivedate= 9 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Olson|first= Geoff| url= http://commonground.ca/?p=3120|title= Demonstrators don ''V for Vendetta'' masks in Occupy Everywhere|work= [[Common Ground (magazine)|Common Ground]]|location=Canada|date=November 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001619/http://commonground.ca/2011/11/demonstrators-don-v-for-vendetta-masks-in-occupy-everywhere/|archivedate= 9 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mask has also been adopted by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], [[WikiLeaks]], [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutionaries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/1723/v-for-vendetta_the-other-face-of-egypts-youth-move|title= ''V for Vendetta'': The Other Face of Egypt's Youth Movement|first= Linda|last= Herrera|date= 30 May 2011|publisher= Jadaliyya.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131107022311/http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/1723/v-for-vendetta_the-other-face-of-egypts-youth-move|archivedate= 7 November 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anti-globalization]] demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Lamont|first= Tom|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/27/alan-moore-v-vendetta-mask-protest|title= Alan Moore – meet the man behind the protest mask|work= The Observer|location= UK|date= 26 November 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205091521/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/27/alan-moore-v-vendetta-mask-protest |archivedate= 5 December 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore described Occupy as "ordinary people reclaiming rights which should always have been theirs"&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite web|last= Flood|first= Alison| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/alan-moore-frank-miller-row|title= Alan Moore attacks Frank Miller in comic book war of words|work= The Guardian|location= UK|date= 7 December 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131108144744/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/alan-moore-frank-miller-row|archivedate= 8 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added:

{{quote|I can't think of any reason why as a population we should be expected to stand by and see a gross reduction in the living standards of ourselves and our kids, possibly for generations, when the people who have got us into this have been rewarded for it – they've certainly not been punished in any way because they're too big to fail. I think that the Occupy movement is, in one sense, the public saying that they should be the ones to decide who's too big to fail. As an anarchist, I believe that power should be given to the people whose lives this is actually affecting.&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;}}

Moore is a member of [[The Arts Emergency Service]], a British charity working with 16- to 19-year-olds in [[further education]] from diverse backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-emergency.org/news/whats-the-point-of-arts-and-humanities/|title= What's the point of arts and humanities?|date= n.d.|publisher= Arts-emergency.org|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140405035503/http://www.arts-emergency.org/news/whats-the-point-of-arts-and-humanities/|archivedate=5 April 2014 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], Moore expressed guarded support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], mainly due to the left-wing socialist [[Jeremy Corbyn]] being elected leader, though he does not vote as a matter of political principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://momentumnorthants.org.uk/alan-moore-statement/|title=Alan Moore statement for Momentum in Northamptonshire|work=Momentum Northants|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161210200216/https://momentumnorthants.org.uk/alan-moore-statement/|archivedate= 10 December 2016|deadurl= no|df= dmy-all|access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On conspiracy theories===
Doing research into [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] for his work on ''[[Brought to Light]]'', Moore came to develop his own opinions on the subject of a global conspiracy, stating that "Yes, there is a conspiracy, indeed there are a great number of conspiracies, all tripping each other up&amp;nbsp;... the main thing that I learned about conspiracy theories is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in the conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jewish banking conspiracy]], or the [[grey alien]]s, or the twelve-foot [[Reptilian humanoid|reptiloids]] from another dimension that are in control, the truth is far more frightening; no-one is in control, the world is rudderless."&lt;ref name="Moore Documentary"/&gt;

'''Astronomy''' (from {{lang-el|ἀστρονομία}}) is a [[natural science]] that studies [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[celestial event|phenomena]]. It applies [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their [[chronology of the Universe|evolution]]. Objects of interest include [[planets]], [[natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[comet]]s; the phenomena include [[supernova]] explosions, [[gamma ray burst]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. More generally, all phenomena that originate outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject is [[physical cosmology]], which is the study of the [[Universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System – Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy is one of the oldest of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in [[recorded history]], such as the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]], [[Greek astronomy|Greeks]], [[Indian astronomy|Indians]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptians]], [[Nubians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and many ancient [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], performed methodical observations of the [[night sky]]. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as [[astrometry]], [[celestial navigation]], [[observational astronomy]], and the making of [[calendar]]s, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System|date=2001|pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional astronomy is split into [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astronomy|theoretical]] branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.

Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs still play an [[citizen science|active role]], especially in the discovery and observation of [[transient astronomical event|transient events]]. [[amateur astronomy|Amateur astronomers]] have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, such as finding new comets.

===Ancient times===

In early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these [[Observatory|observatories]] could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Forbes, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the [[geocentric model]] of the Universe, or the [[Ptolemaic system]], named after [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeWitt|first=Richard|title=Worldviews: An Introduction to the History and Philosophy of Science|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-1-4051-9563-8|page=113|chapter=The Ptolemaic System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among [[Babylonian astronomy|the Babylonians]], who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity|author=Aaboe, A. |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]|volume=276|issue=1257|date=1974|pages=21–42|jstor=74272|doi=10.1098/rsta.1974.0007|bibcode = 1974RSPTA.276...21A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]] discovered that [[lunar eclipses]] recurred in a repeating cycle known as a [[Saros cycle|saros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |title=Eclipses and the Saros |publisher=NASA |accessdate=28 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030225501/http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |archivedate=30 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AiKhanoumSunDial.jpg|thumb|Greek equatorial [[sundial]], [[Alexandria on the Oxus]], present-day Afghanistan 3rd–2nd century BCE]]

Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] world. [[Greek astronomy]] is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Krafft| first = Fritz| date = 2009| contribution = Astronomy| editor-last = Cancik| editor-first = Hubert| editor2-last = Schneider| editor2-first = Helmuth| title = Brill's New Pauly| ref = harv| title-link = Brill's New Pauly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|size and distance of the Moon and Sun]], and he proposed a model of the [[solar system]] where the Earth and planets rotated around the sun, now called the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aristarchus's On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and the Moon: Greek and Arabic Texts | journal = Archive for History of Exact Sciences | date = May 2007 | first = J.L. | last = Berrgren |author2= Nathan Sidoli | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 213–54 | doi = 10.1007/s00407-006-0118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century BC, [[Hipparchus]] discovered [[precession]], calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hipparchus.html|title=Hipparchus of Rhodes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of St Andrews]], Scotland|accessdate=28 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023062202/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hipparchus.html|archivedate=23 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the [[constellation]]s of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, H., [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNpHjqxQQ9oC&amp;pg=PA2 ''Early Astronomy.''] Springer, 1996. {{ISBN|0-387-94822-8}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antikythera mechanism]] (c. 150–80 BC) was an early [[analog computer]] designed to calculate the location of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planets]] for a given date.

===Middle Ages===

Medieval Europe housed a number of astronomers who made progress. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the [[Rectangulus]] which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astornomical bodies, as well as an [[equatorium]] called the ''Albion'' which could be used for astronomical calculations such as [[moon|lunar]], [[sun|solar]] and [[planet]]ary [[longitude]]s and could predict [[eclipse]]s. [[Nicole Oresme]] (1320-1382) and [[Jean Buridan]] (1300-1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of [[inertia]]) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels.&lt;ref&gt;Hannam, James. God's philosophers: how the medieval world laid the foundations of modern science. Icon Books Ltd, 2009, 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg von Peuerbach]] (1423-1461) and [[Regiomontanus]] (1436-1476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later. 

[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Astronomy flourished in the Islamic world]] and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of the first astronomical [[Observatory|observatories]] in the [[Muslim world]] by the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="Kennedy-1962"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Edward S. |date=1962 |title=Review: ''The Observatory in Islam and Its Place in the General History of the Observatory'' by Aydin Sayili |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–39 |doi=10.1086/349558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micheau-992-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Micheau|first=Francoise|year=|editor-last=Rashed|editor-first=Roshdi|editor2-last=Morelon|editor2-first=Régis|title=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|volume=3|pages=992–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nas |first=Peter J|title=Urban Symbolism|date=1993 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=978-90-04-09855-8|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 964, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], the largest [[galaxy]] in the [[Local Group]],  was described by the Persian astronomer [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi|Azophi]] in his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''.&lt;ref name="NSOG"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kepple |first= George Robert |author2=Glen W.

For over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Heilbron, ''The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories'' (1999) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific revolution===
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]]'s sketches and observations of the [[Moon]] revealed that the surface was mountainous.]]
[[File:Medieval Astronomy (f.4v).jpg|thumb|upright|An astronomical chart from an early scientific manuscript, c. 1000]]
During the [[Renaissance]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by [[Galileo Galilei]] and expanded upon by [[Johannes Kepler]]. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 49–58&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Isaac Newton]], with his invention of [[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]], who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="f58-64"&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 58–64&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]] catalogued over 3000 stars,&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1864) ''[[Chambers Book of Days]]''&lt;/ref&gt; More extensive star catalogues were produced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. The astronomer [[William Herschel]] made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet [[Uranus]], the first new planet found.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; The distance to a star was announced in 1838 when the [[parallax]] of [[61 Cygni]] was measured by [[Friedrich Bessel]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 147–50&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18–19th centuries, the study of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]], allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]] and [[Astrophotography|photography]]. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of [[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es, and sizes.&lt;ref name="short history" /&gt;

The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of "external" galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name=Belkora2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Belkora, Leila|title=Minding the heavens: the story of our discovery of the Milky Way|isbn=978-0-7503-0730-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qBM-wez94WwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|date=2003|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[blazar]]s, and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]. [[Physical cosmology]] made huge advances during the 20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the [[Big Bang]] theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], [[Hubble's law]], and the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|cosmological abundances of elements]]. [[Space telescope]]s have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In February 2016, it was revealed that the [[LIGO]] project had [[first observation of gravitational waves|detected evidence]] of [[gravitational waves]] in the previous September.&lt;ref name="Discovery 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News| url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=11 February 2016 |last=Castelvecchi |first=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361  |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Abbot'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger| authors=B.P.

==Observational astronomy==
{{Main|Observational astronomy}}

Our main source of information about [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] and other objects is visible [[light]], or more generally [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|title=Electromagnetic Spectrum|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905131651/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|archivedate=5 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the [[Earth]]'s surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.

===Radio astronomy===

Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

Although some [[radio wave]]s are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of [[black body radiation|thermal emission]], most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of [[synchrotron radiation]], which is produced when [[electron]]s orbit [[magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; Additionally, a number of [[spectral line]]s produced by [[interstellar gas]], notably the [[hydrogen]] spectral line at 21&amp;nbsp;cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.&lt;ref name="shu1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of [[infrared]] radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, [[circumstellar disk]]s or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their host [[star clusters]].&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/|title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission|last=|first=|date=30 September 2014|publisher=[[NASA]] [[University of California, Berkeley]]|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma2013&gt;Majaess, D.

With the exception of infrared [[wavelengths]] close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Main|Optical astronomy}}
Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.&lt;ref name="moore1997"&gt;{{cite book
|author=Moore, P.

|isbn=978-0-540-07465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 [[Ångstrom|Å]] to 7000 Å (400 [[nanometre|nm]] to 700&amp;nbsp;nm),&lt;ref name="moore1997"/&gt; that same equipment can be used to observe some [[near-ultraviolet]] and [[near-infrared]] radiation.

===Ultraviolet astronomy===
{{Main|Ultraviolet astronomy}}

Ultraviolet astronomy employs [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200&amp;nbsp;Å (10 to 320&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue [[star]]s ([[OB star]]s) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include [[planetary nebula]]e, [[supernova remnant]]s, and active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by [[interstellar dust]], an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

===X-ray astronomy===
{{Main|X-ray astronomy}}
[[File:B30727.jpg|thumb|X-ray jet made from a supermassive black hole found by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, made visible by light from the early Universe]]
X-ray astronomy uses [[X-radiation|X-ray wavelengths]]. Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by [[synchrotron emission]] (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), [[bremsstrahlung radiation|thermal emission from thin gases]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (10&amp;nbsp;million) [[kelvin]]s, and [[blackbody radiation|thermal emission from thick gases]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Kelvin.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; Since X-rays are absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], all X-ray observations must be performed from [[high-altitude balloon]]s, [[rocket]]s, or [[X-ray astronomy satellite]]s. Notable [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray sources]] include [[X-ray binaries]], [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[elliptical galaxies]], [[clusters of galaxies]], and [[active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

===Gamma-ray astronomy===
{{Main|Gamma ray astronomy}}
Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] or by specialized telescopes called [[atmospheric Cherenkov telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="spectrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&amp;style=feature|title=The electromagnetic spectrum|last=Penston|first=Margaret J.|date=14 August 2002|website=|publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908014227/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&amp;style=feature|archive-date=8 September 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Gamma ray|gamma-ray]] emitting sources are actually [[gamma-ray burst]]s, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]] candidates such as active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt;

===Fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrum===
In addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.

In [[neutrino astronomy]], astronomers use heavily shielded [[Neutrino observatory|underground facilities]] such as [[SAGE (ruSsian American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]], [[GALLEX]], and [[Kamioka Observatory|Kamioka II/III]] for the detection of [[neutrino]]s. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the [[Sun]], but 24 neutrinos were also detected from [[supernova 1987A]].&lt;ref name="cox2000"/&gt; [[Cosmic ray]]s, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] is an emerging field of astronomy that employs [[gravitational-wave detector]]s to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the ''Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory'' [[LIGO]]. LIGO made its [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection]] on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a [[binary black hole]].&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P.  |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

===Astrometry and celestial mechanics===
{{Main|Astrometry|Celestial mechanics}}
[[File:EmissionNebula NGC6357.jpg|upright|thumb|Star cluster [[Pismis 24]] with a nebula]]
One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in [[celestial navigation]] (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of [[calendar]]s.

Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as [[celestial mechanics]]. More recently the tracking of [[near-Earth object]]s will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Calvert|first = James B.|date = 28 March 2003|url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm|title = Celestial Mechanics|publisher = University of Denver|accessdate =21 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060907120741/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/orbits.htm| archivedate= 7 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurement of [[stellar parallax]] of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the [[radial velocity]] and [[proper motion]] of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|title=Hall of Precision Astrometry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[University of Virginia]] Department of Astronomy|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826104509/http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~rjp0i/museum/engines.html|archivedate=26 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, the measurement of the [[stellar wobble]] of nearby stars was [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|used to detect]] large [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting those stars.&lt;ref name="Wolszczan"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wolszczan, A.| author2=Frail, D.

==Theoretical astronomy==
{{Nucleosynthesis}}
{{Main|Theoretical astronomy}}
Theoretical astronomers use several tools including [[mathematical model|analytical models]] and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.|last=Roth|title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability|journal=Physical Review |volume=39|issue=3|pages=525–29|date=1932|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.S.|last=Eddington|title=Internal Constitution of the Stars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1926|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hJW3JbhnFQMC&amp;pg=PA182|isbn=978-0-521-33708-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale distribution]] of [[matter]] in the [[Universe]]; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] [[cosmology]] and [[astroparticle physics]]. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[Cosmic inflation]], [[dark matter]], and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the [[Sun]], a typical main-sequence [[dwarf star]] of [[stellar class]] G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a [[variable star]], but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the [[sunspot cycle]]. This is an 11-year oscillation in [[Wolf number|sunspot number]].

The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the [[photosphere]]. Above this layer is a thin region known as the [[chromosphere]]. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated [[corona]].

At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Above the core is the [[radiation zone]], where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the [[convection zone]] where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.&lt;ref name="solar FAQ" /&gt;

A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] ([[magnetosphere]]) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s that envelop the Earth. The [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines the descend into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Stern, D.P.|author2 = Peredo, M.|date = 28 September 2004|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html|title = The Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere|publisher = NASA|accessdate =22 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060824003619/http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html| archivedate= 24 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary science===
{{Main|Planetary science|Planetary geology}}
Planetary science is the study of the assemblage of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The [[Solar System]] has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.&lt;ref name="geology"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://marswatch.tn.cornell.edu/rsm.html|title=Remote Sensing for the Earth Sciences: Manual of Remote Sensing|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=|edition=3rd|location=|pages=|quote=|author=Bell III, J.

[[File:dust.devil.mars.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The black spot at the top is a [[dust devil]] climbing a crater wall on [[Mars]]. This moving, swirling column of [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] (comparable to a terrestrial [[tornado]]) created the long, dark streak. ''[[NASA]] image''.]]

The Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the [[asteroid belt]], and the outer planets. The inner [[terrestrial planet]]s consist of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]. The outer [[gas giant]] planets are [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="planets"&gt;{{cite web|author = Grayzeck, E.|author2 = Williams, D.R.| date = 11 May 2006|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/|title = Lunar and Planetary Science|publisher = NASA|accessdate =21 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060820173205/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/| archivedate= 20 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Neptune lies the [[Kuiper Belt]], and finally the [[Oort Cloud]], which may extend as far as a light-year.

The planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the [[protoplanetary disk]] that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The [[radiation pressure]] of the [[solar wind]] then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many [[impact crater]]s on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have [[giant impact hypothesis|formed the Moon]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montmerle|first=Thierry|author2=Augereau, Jean-Charles|author3= Chaussidon, Marc|title=Solar System Formation and Early Evolution: the First 100 Million Years|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|volume=98|issue=1–4|pages=39–95|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s11038-006-9087-5| bibcode=2006EM&amp;P...98...39M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during [[planetary differentiation]]. This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own [[magnetic field]], which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.&lt;ref&gt;Montmerle, 2006, pp. 87–90&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (''e.g.'' [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[Aluminium#Isotopes|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]]), or [[tidal acceleration|tidal heating]] caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as [[volcanism]] and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an [[atmosphere]] can also undergo surface [[erosion]] from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.&lt;ref name="new solar system"&gt;{{cite book| editor=Beatty, J.K.| editor2=Petersen, C.C.| editor3=Chaikin, A.|title=The New Solar System|publisher=Cambridge press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iOezyHMVAMcC&amp;pg=PA70|page=70edition = 4th|date=1999|isbn =978-0-521-64587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stellar astronomy===
[[File:Ant Nebula.jpg|thumb|[[Mz 3]], often referred to as the Ant planetary nebula. Ejecting gas from the dying central star shows symmetrical patterns unlike the chaotic patterns of ordinary explosions.]]
{{Main|Star}}
The study of stars and [[stellar evolution]] is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.&lt;ref name=Amos7&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 7–18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Star formation]] occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]]. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a [[protostar]]. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger [[nuclear fusion]], thus creating a [[main-sequence star]].&lt;ref name=Smith2004/&gt;

Almost all elements heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were [[nucleosynthesis|created]] inside the cores of stars.&lt;ref name=Amos7/&gt;

The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to [[Stellar evolution|evolve]]. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting [[red giant]] formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;Harpaz, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse [[supernova]]e;&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 173–78&lt;/ref&gt; while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a [[white dwarf]]. The ejection of the outer layers forms a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 111–18&lt;/ref&gt; The remnant of a supernova is a dense [[neutron star]], or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge atlas"&gt;{{cite book|editor= Audouze, Jean|editor2= Israel, Guy|title=The Cambridge Atlas of Astronomy|edition=3rd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-521-43438-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 189–210&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the  "[[metallicity|metals]]" produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 245–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galactic astronomy===
[[File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg|right|thumb|Observed structure of the [[Milky Way]]'s spiral arms]]
{{Main|Galactic astronomy}}
Our [[solar system]] orbits within the [[Milky Way]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is a prominent member of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.

In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a [[supermassive black hole]] at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, [[Stellar population|population I]] stars. The disk is surrounded by a [[Galactic spheroid|spheroid halo]] of older, [[population II]] stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as [[globular cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|title=The Galactic Centre|last=Ott|first=Thomas|date=24 August 2006|website=|publisher=Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904140550/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/GC/index.php|archivedate=4 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the stars lies the [[interstellar medium]], a region of sparse matter. In the densest regions, [[molecular cloud]]s of [[Hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]] and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact [[pre-stellar core]] or [[dark nebula]]e, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the [[Jeans length]]) to form compact protostars.&lt;ref name=Smith2004&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=53–86|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Cloud formation, Evolution and Destruction| publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1-86094-501-4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=UVgBoqZg8a4C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an [[H II region]] (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The [[Solar wind|stellar wind]] and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young [[open cluster]]s of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael David|last=Smith|date=2004| pages=185–99|title=The Origin of Stars|chapter=Massive stars
|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1-86094-501-4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=UVgBoqZg8a4C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A [[dark matter halo]] appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van den Bergh, Sidney|title=The Early History of Dark Matter|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|pages=657–60|doi=10.1086/316369|arxiv = astro-ph/9904251 |bibcode = 1999PASP..111..657V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrochemistry===

[[Astrochemistry]] is the study of the abundance and reactions of [[molecule]]s in the [[Universe]], and their interaction with [[radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/amp-rg/astrochemistry|title=Astrochemistry|date=2013-07-15|newspaper=www.cfa.harvard.edu/|access-date=2016-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120211934/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/amp-rg/astrochemistry|archive-date=2016-11-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and [[chemistry]].  The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the [[Solar System]] and the [[interstellar medium]]. The study of the abundance of elements and [[isotope]] ratios in Solar System objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, is also called [[cosmochemistry]], while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[molecular cloud|molecular gas clouds]] is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

Studies in this field contribute to the understanding of the [[formation of the solar system]], [[Earth]]'s origin and geology, [[abiogenesis]], and the origin of climate and oceans.

===Extragalactic astronomy===
[[File:grav.lens1.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|This image shows several blue, loop-shaped objects that are multiple images of the same galaxy, duplicated by the [[gravitational lens]] effect of the cluster of yellow galaxies near the middle of the photograph.

{{Main|Extragalactic astronomy}}
The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned with the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation and evolution of Galaxies]], their morphology (description) and [[Galaxy morphological classification|classification]], the observation of [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and at a larger scale, the [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters of galaxies]]. Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].

Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes. They are commonly divided into [[spiral galaxy|spiral]], [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and [[irregular galaxy|Irregular]] galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Keel|first = Bill|date = 1 August 2006|url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html|title = Galaxy Classification|publisher = University of Alabama|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901074027/http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html| archivedate= 1 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an [[ellipse]]. The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.

Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.

An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.

A [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the [[radio]] portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], [[Quasar]]s, and [[Blazar]]s. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html|title=Active Galaxies and Quasars|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831033713/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/active_galaxies.html|archivedate=31 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the [[supercluster]]s. The collective matter is formed into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and walls, leaving large [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] between.&lt;ref name="evolving universe"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Zeilik|title=Astronomy: The Evolving Universe|edition=8th|publisher=Wiley|date=2002|isbn=978-0-521-80090-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Nature timeline}}
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
[[Cosmology]] (from the Greek κόσμος (''kosmos'') "world, universe" and λόγος (''logos'') "word, study" or literally "logic") could be considered the study of the Universe as a whole.
[[File:Hubble Extreme Deep Field (full resolution).png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Hubble Extreme Deep Field]]]]

Observations of the [[large-scale structure of the Universe]], a branch known as [[physical cosmology]], have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the [[big bang]], wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] over the course of 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Cosmic Detectives

&lt;/ref&gt; to its present condition.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003/&gt; The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this expansion, the Universe underwent several evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid [[cosmic inflation]], which homogenized the starting conditions. Thereafter, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe.&lt;ref name=Dodelson2003/&gt; (See also [[nucleocosmochronology]].)

When the first neutral [[atom]]s formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation. The expanding Universe then underwent a Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.&lt;ref name="cosmology 101"&gt;{{cite web|last = Hinshaw|first = Gary|date = 13 July 2006|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html|title = Cosmology 101: The Study of the Universe|publisher = NASA WMAP|accessdate =10 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060813053535/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_uni.html| archivedate= 13 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the [[Population III stars]]. These massive stars triggered the [[reionization]] process and are believed to have created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.&lt;ref&gt;Dodelson, 2003, pp. 216–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into [[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters]] of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html|title = Galaxy Clusters and Large-Scale Structure|publisher = University of Cambridge|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061010041120/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/gal_lss.html| archivedate= 10 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various fields of physics are crucial to studying the universe. Interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of [[quantum mechanics]], [[particle physics]], [[plasma physics]], [[condensed matter physics]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[optics]], and [[nuclear physics]].

Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Preuss|first = Paul|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html|title = Dark Energy Fills the Cosmos|publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Berkeley Lab|accessdate =8 September 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060811215815/http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html| archivedate= 11 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. [[Archaeoastronomy]] is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] evidence. [[Astrobiology]] is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. [[Astrostatistics]] is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.

The study of [[chemical]]s found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called [[astrochemistry]]. These substances are usually found in [[molecular cloud]]s, although they may also appear in low temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. [[Cosmochemistry]] is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the [[isotope]] ratios. Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As "[[forensic astronomy]]", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history.

==Amateur astronomy==
{{Main|Amateur astronomy}}
[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment, and hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/|title = The American Meteor Society|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060822135040/http://www.amsmeteors.org/| archivedate= 22 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jerry|last=Lodriguss|url=http://www.astropix.com/|title = Catching the Light: Astrophotography|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185541/http://www.astropix.com/| archivedate= 1 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]], who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (''e.g.'' the [[One-Mile Telescope]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ghigo, F.|date = 7 February 2006|url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml|title = Karl Jansky and the Discovery of Cosmic Radio Waves|publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831105945/http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml| archivedate= 31 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~arcus/cara/|title = Cambridge Amateur Radio Astronomers|accessdate =24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm|title = The International Occultation Timing Association|accessdate =24 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060821180723/http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm| archivedate= 21 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbat.eps.harvard.edu/special/EdgarWilson.html |title=Edgar Wilson Award |publisher=IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams |accessdate=24 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024202325/http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/special/EdgarWilson.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/|title = American Association of Variable Star Observers|publisher = AAVSO|accessdate =3 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100202050715/http://www.aavso.org/| archivedate= 2 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsolved problems in astronomy==
{{Main|List of unsolved problems in astronomy}}
Although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.
* What is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum? That is, why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses—the [[initial mass function]]—apparently regardless of the initial conditions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Climate scientists protest CSIRO staff cuts AMOS conference.jpg|thumb|right|Climate scientists attending the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) climate science conference in Melbourne stage protest against cuts to CSIRO climate research programs. Photo: John Englart]]AMOS has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude, “Global [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] are real and observable…It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of [[greenhouse gases]] in the [[atmosphere]] have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] has increased by more than 30% since the start of the [[industrial age]] and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning [[fossil fuels]], broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amos.org.au/publications/cid/3/t/publications AMOS ''Statement on Climate Change'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5755">{{about|the physical phenomenon|the term as used in photochemistry|hypsochromic shift|other uses of "blueshift" or "blue shift"}}

A '''blueshift''' is any decrease in [[wavelength]], with a corresponding increase in frequency, of an [[electromagnetic wave]]; the opposite effect is referred to as [[redshift]]. In [[Light|visible light]], this shifts the color from the red end of the spectrum to the blue end.

== Doppler blueshift ==
[[File:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|Doppler redshift and blueshift]]
[[Doppler effect|Doppler]] blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength  and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the [[visible spectrum]]. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the [[naked eye]], but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Quest of the Universe|first=Karl F.|last=Kuhn|author2=Theo Koupelis|year= 2004|publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]|isbn=0-7637-0810-0|pages=122–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler blueshift is used in [[astronomy]] to determine relative motion:
* The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is moving toward our own [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] within the [[Local Group]]; thus, when observed from Earth, its light is undergoing a blueshift.
* Components of a [[binary star]] system will be blueshifted when moving towards Earth
* When observing spiral galaxies, the side spinning toward us will have a slight blueshift ''relative to'' the side spinning away from us (see [[Tully–Fisher relation]]).
* [[Blazar]]s are known to propel [[relativistic jet]]s toward us, emitting [[synchrotron radiation]] and [[bremsstrahlung]] that appears blueshifted.
* Nearby stars such as [[Barnard's Star]] are moving toward us, resulting in a very small blueshift.
* Doppler blueshift of distant objects with a high ''z'' can be subtracted from the much larger [[Hubble's law|cosmological redshift]] to determine relative motion in the [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].&lt;ref name="Aoki2005"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Largest Blueshifts of the [O III] Emission Line in Two Narrow-Line Quasars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | date = January 2005 | first = Kentaro | last = Aoki |author2=Toshihiro Kawaguchi|author3=Kouji Ohta | volume = 618 | issue = 2 | pages = 601–608 |arxiv = astro-ph/0409546 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...618..601A |doi = 10.1086/426075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gravitational blueshift ==
[[Image:Gravitional well.jpg|thumb|[[Matter waves]] (protons, electrons, photons, etc.) falling into a [[gravity well]] become more energetic and undergo observer-independent blueshifting.]]
Unlike the ''relative'' Doppler blueshift, caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon, gravitational blueshift is ''absolute'' and does not depend on the received angle of the photon:
{{Quote frame|Photons climbing out of a gravitating object become less energetic. This loss of energy is known as a "redshifting", as photons in the visible spectrum would appear more red. Similarly, photons falling into a gravitational field become more energetic and exhibit a blueshifting. ... Note that the magnitude of the redshifting (blueshifting) effect is not a function of the emitted angle or the received angle of the photon—it depends only on how far radially the photon had to climb out of (fall into) the potential well.&lt;ref name=R.N_1&gt;{{cite web| author=R.J. Nemiroff| title=Gravitational Principles and Mathematics| url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/nslens_math.html| date=1993| publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R.N_2&gt;{{cite journal| author=R.J. Nemiroff| title=Visual distortions near a neutron star and black hole| date=1993| journal=American Journal of Physics| volume=61| issue=7| pages=619–632| bibcode=1993AmJPh..61..619N| doi=10.1119/1.17224| arxiv=astro-ph/9312003v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is a natural consequence of [[conservation of energy]] and [[mass–energy equivalence]], and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]]. Gravitational blueshift contributes to [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) anisotropy via the [[Sachs–Wolfe effect]]: when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing, the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of [[gravitational redshift]] as it leaves the region.&lt;ref name="Bonometto2002"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bonometto | first1 = Silvio | last2 = Gorini | first2 = Vittorio | last3 = Moschella | first3 = Ugo | title = Modern Cosmology | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7503-0810-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue outliers ===
There are faraway [[active galaxies]] that show a blueshift in their [[Oxygen|[O III]]] emission [[Emission spectrum|lines]].  One of the largest blueshifts is found in the narrow-line [[quasar]], PG 1543+489, which has a relative velocity of -1150&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="Aoki2005" /&gt;  These types of galaxies are called "blue outliers".&lt;ref name="Aoki2005" /&gt;

==Cosmological blueshift==
In a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway [[big crunch]] contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted—the exact opposite of the actually observed [[cosmological redshift]] in the present [[expanding universe]].

Half a century later the interest to the breath-figure formation was revived in a view of study of atmospheric processes, and in particular the extended study of a dew formation which turned out to be a complicated physical process. The experimental and theoretical study of dew formation has been carried out by Beysens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beysens|first=D.|last2=Steyer|first2=A.|last3=Guenoun|first3=P.|last4=Fritter|first4=D.|last5=Knobler|first5=C.

Breakthrough in the application of the breath-figures patterns was achieved in 1994–1995 when Widawski, François and Pitois reported manufacturing of [[polymer]] films with a [[Self-organization|self‐organized]], micro-scaled, [[Honeycomb structure|honeycomb]] morphology using the breath-figures [[Condensation|condensation process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Widawski|first=Gilles|last2=Rawiso|first2=Michel|last3=François|first3=Bernard|date=1994|title=Self-organized honeycomb morphology of star-polymer polystyrene films|journal=Nature|volume=369|issue=6479|pages=387–389|doi=10.1038/369387a0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=François|first=Bernard|last2=Pitois|first2=Olivier|last3=François|first3=Jeanne|date=1995|title=Polymer films with a self-organized honeycomb morphology|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=7|issue=12|pages=1041–1044|doi=10.1002/adma.19950071217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reported process was based on the rapidly evaporated polymer solutions exerted to humidity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunz|first=U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1915">The '''Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center''' (CDIAC) was an organization within the [[United States Department of Energy]] that had the primary responsibility for providing the US government and research community with [[global warming]] data and analysis as it pertains to energy issues.  The CDIAC, and its subsidiary the World Data Center for Atmospheric Trace Gases, focused on obtaining, evaluating and distributing data related to climate change and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  

CDIAC was founded in 1982 and was located within the Environmental Sciences Division of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].  CDIAC closed September 30, 2017, and its data was distributed to a number of different repositories. The majority of the data was moved to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Environmental System Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem ([http://ess-dive.lbl.gov ESS-DIVE]) archive.   The Oceanic Trace Gas data have been transitioned to the new Ocean Carbon Data System (OCADS) operated by NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) at https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ocads/ &lt;ref&gt;https://news-oceanacidification-icc.org/2016/12/08/carbon-dioxide-information-analysis-center-cdiac-oceans-ceases-operation-all-activities-to-transition-to-noaa/&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''Chief green officer''' (CGO), or Chief environmental commitment officer (CECO), is a corporate officer responsible for implementing and managing the corporation's commitment to reducing its [[carbon footprint]] and protecting the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Typically, these functions are performed within the facility management group who has responsibilities for providing the basic resources necessary for the business operations.  Defining a corporate officer reinforces the facility management efforts historically performed to reduce the corporation's costs of ownership and operations.

The CGO is the highest-ranking corporate administrator of the organization's eco-friendly programs, initiatives, and education, and shares the responsibility with the CEO and COO for the Direction of Research and Development of new technologies

'''Collective Switching''' is where customers negotiate a group deal with a utility service such as gas or electricity. This is popular in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In the UK, collective switching has always been managed by a third party which gathers the consumers together into a grouping via a registration or membership model and then takes their collective demand to the supply base and obtains from a supplier preferential or bespoke rates for that group of consumers.

There is no set model for how individual schemes operate although a third party, such as an [[Energy broker|Energy Broker]], usually seeks to negotiate a better energy tariff with Energy Suppliers on behalf of the group. 

==Collective switching in the UK==

Collective switching schemes in the UK began in 2014 encouraged by the [[Department for Energy and Climate Change]] under the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government]]. DECC believed that collective switching had the ability to increase the competition for consumers within the energy market, particularly people who had never switched before and encouraging suppliers to innovate to acquire new customers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/253862/Helping_Customers_Switch_Collective_Switching_and_Beyond_final__2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The schemes are not directly regulated by energy industry regulator [[OFGEM]], but they are indirectly through the supplier which "wins" any particular collective switch; as that supplier has obligations to the consumer under its supply licence conditions. Collective switches may also be run by [[Price Comparison Websites]] which can be accredited by OFGEM's confidence code, but the collective switch itself falls outside of this confidence code.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/collective-switching-and-purchasing|title=Collective switching and purchasing - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective switching attempts to deliver the best tariff for a collection of disparate consumers that may have different usage patterns and priorities. It should not purport to deliver the cheapest deal to all participants as there are inevitably outliers that would obtain a better deal elsewhere. As the name suggests the emphasis is on collective rather than cheapest; although if the numbers of members are large enough and the remit of the collective switch is solely price then the associated deal may indeed be the cheapest deal at a point in time; but that is by no means certain. Collective switching can also apply to any type of tariff for which there is a collective need; green energy supply is an obvious example of a collective switch where the criteria that is not purely a function of cost.

'''Crowders Mountain State Park''' is a {{convert|5,126|acre|km2|sing=on}}&lt;ref name=ParkSize /&gt; [[List of North Carolina state parks|North Carolina state park]] in [[Gaston County, North Carolina|Gaston County]], [[North Carolina]] in the [[United States]]. It is near [[Kings Mountain, North Carolina]] and on the outskirts of [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], it includes the peaks of [[Crowder's Mountain]] and The Pinnacle. Crowders Mountain was named for Crowders Creek which originated near its base. Contrary to some historical information, Crowders Mountain was not named for Ulrick Crowder (Ulrich Krauter). There is no historical evidence that he was ever in the immediate area.[http://www.bridgesdna.com/millsbridges/crowder.htm] The cliffs are a popular destination for rock climbers.

==Features==
The mountain itself is a [[monadnock]], an isolated erosional remnant that rises abruptly from the surrounding plain. Geologically neither Crowders Mountain nor The Pinnacle are true mountains. Crowders Mountain sharply rises some {{convert|800|ft|m}} above the surrounding countryside, and presents sheer rock cliffs that are 100 - {{convert|150|ft|m}} in height. The mountain rises to {{convert|1625|ft|m}} above sea level. The peak is believed to be the remnant of a much higher mountain which formed some 400 - 500 million years ago and was gradually worn down by the elements. The park sets at the northeast end of the Kings Mountain Range, a {{convert|16|mi|km|sing=on}} long range of low peaks which include the site of the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] of the [[American Revolution]].[[File:King_Mountain,North_Carolina.jpg|thumb|right|The Pinnacle]]

The Park contains two peaks:
* [[Crowders Mountain]], 1,625 feet (495 m), is in the northeastern section of the park. {{coord|35.232350|-81.276439|display=inline}}
* The Pinnacle, 1,705 feet (520 m), is in the western section of the park. {{coord|35.207817|-81.312626|display=inline}}

The Visitors Center is located at 522 Park Office Ln, Kings Mountain, NC (704) 853-5375
*

==History==
Buffalo herds grazed much of the land, which was prairie, before European settlers arrived.The Cherokee Indians had a trading route that crossed Crowders Mountain, and the peaks marked boundaries between the hunting lands of the Catawba and Cherokee Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpedia.org/crowders-mountain-state-park|title=Crowders Mountain State Park|last=|first=|date=3 September 2015|website=NCPedia|publisher=|access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s a mining company conducted exploratory sampling on the mountain as preparation to purchase the mineral rights. Thanks to grassroots efforts by local citizens, educational institutions, and organizations the state government was convinced that the area should be set aside and protected due to significant natural communities, plants and animals, intrinsic beauty, and unique recreational opportunities. In 1973 the State of [[North Carolina]] officially designated the area as Crowders Mountain State Park and it opened to the public in 1974. The Pinnacle was added to the park in 1987. Another {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} was added in the year 2000 and officially connected the park with [[Kings Mountain State Park]] and [[Kings Mountain National Military Park]], both in [[South Carolina]].

==Trails==
Three hiking trails and one vehicle access trail lead to the summit of Crowders Mountain, and from the summit it is possible on a clear day to see the skyscrapers of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] to the east.

* Crowders Trail - Strenuous, {{convert|2.5|mi|km}}. This trail winds along the base of Crowders Mountain from the Visitor Center in the southwest and ultimately leads to the Backside Trail and the top of the mountain in the northeast of the park.
* Backside Trail - Strenuous, {{convert|0.8|mi|km}}.  From the Linwood Road Access Area this trail leads around the north side of the mountain where it first connects to the Crowders Trail and eventually to the top where it connects to the Rocktop Trail.
* Rocktop Trail - Strenuous, {{convert|1.4|mi|km}}.  Admittedly the most difficult and technical trail in the park. It travels along the ridge of Crowders Mountain from the southwest where it splits from the Crowders Trail at Sparrow Springs Road. Each side has steep drop offs and unseen cliffs.
* Tower Trail - Strenuous, {{convert|1.8|mi|km}}.  This trail begins at the Linwood Road Access Area and ends at the radio towers on Crowders Mountain. The trail is an old roadbed that begins with a gentle climb that becomes quite steep towards the end. Only official park vehicles can drive on this trail.

Two hiking trails lead to The Pinnacle.

* Pinnacle Trail - Strenuous, {{convert|2.0|mi|km}}. This trail begins at the Visitor Center and moves southwest to end at the summit of The Pinnacle, the highest point in Gaston County at 1,705 feet.
* Ridgeline Trail - Strenuous, {{convert|6.2|mi|km}}. Hikers must register before hiking this trail.  The longest trail in the park, it starts below The Pinnacle off of Pinnacle Trail, following the ridgeline south all the way to the South Carolina State line. The Ridgeline trail then continues for 2.5 miles into South Carolina through [[Kings Mountain State Park]], and terminates at the 16 mile Kings Mountain National Recreation Trail that goes through Kings Mountain State Park and Kings Mountain National Military Park.

Other park hiking trails.

* Family Camping Trail - Easy, {{convert|1.0|mi|km}}. This trail is accessed from the Pinnacle Trail and gives campers access to the family backpack camping area.
* Group Camping Trail - Easy, {{convert|1.1|mi|km}}. This trail is accessed from the Pinnacle Trail and gives campers access to the group backpack camping area.
* Fern Trail - Easy, {{convert|0.8|mi|km}}. This loop trail begins at picnic shelter number 1, connects with a portion of the Turnback Trail and follows a creek for some portions of the trail.
* Lake Trail - Easy, {{convert|0.8|mi|km}}. This loop trail circles the park lake and connects to Fern Trail.

[[File:Virgil Solis - Ovid Met 5 431ff - Cyane dissolving.jpg|thumb|300px|Cyane dissolves in tears, an [[engraving]] (1581) by [[Virgil Solis]] to illustrate Ovid's tale]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Cyane''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|ə|ˌ|n|iː}} (Κυανῆ ''Kuanē̂'' "dark blue" in [[Greek language|Greek]]) was a [[nymph]] who tried to prevent [[Pluto (deity)|Dis]] from abducting [[Proserpina]], her playmate. Upon failure, she dissolved away in tears and melted into her pool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 5. 407-464&lt;/ref&gt; In a slightly different version, Cyane was the [[Naiad]] (i.e. the fresh-water nymph) of a spring in the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] town of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. After witnessing Hades's abduction of the goddess Persephone and trying to prevent it, she was turned to liquid by Hades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'' 5. 2. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyane had as a partner the river god [[Anapos]] (or Anapis).&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], Historical Miscellany 2. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' 6. 129 ff&lt;/ref&gt; She cited their love as an example of consensual relationship while trying to convince Hades not to take Persephone by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 5. 418-419&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In the popular TV series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', ''Cyane'' is a recurring name of prominent [[Amazons|Amazon]] warriors, each considered the reincarnation of the former one: five different Cyanes (from different times) are shown in "Xenaverse", played respectively by [[Victoria Pratt]] as "Cyane III", [[Selma Blair]] as "Cyane I", [[Shelley Edwards]] as "Cyane IV" and [[Morgan Reese Fairhead]] as "Cyane V". "Cyane II" appears in ''[[Young Hercules]]'' series, played by Katrina Browne. There are probably some other Cyanes between "Cyane I" and "Cyane II", but they are not shown in the series. All shown Cyanes are powerful and charismatic, but "Cyane IV" is somewhat aphoristic, and "Cyane V" overly polite and shy. The first Cyane came from the future: she taught Amazons to tame horses and (in a strange time loop) gave them the name "Amazons".

A powerful person, "Cyane III" defeated both [[Xena]] (in a physical battle) and [[Alti]] (in a spiritual battle). She was trusting of Xena and even offered to let her join the tribe. Xena betrayed Cyane when Alti "offered her a better deal". Alti wanted Cyane's blood, and after she drank it she kept Cyane's soul and the souls of all the Amazons in the land of the dead. She then used their power for herself and made it evil. The souls of the Amazons were trapped in the land of the dead until the reformed Xena killed Alti and found the Amazon's new holy word, Love.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4456">[[Image:Darwin glass.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Assorted fragments of Darwin glass (scale in mm)]]

'''Darwin glass''' is a natural [[glass]] found south of [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] in [[West Coast, Tasmania]]. It takes its name from [[Mount Darwin (Tasmania)|Mount Darwin]] in the [[West Coast Range]], where it was first reported, and later gave its name to [[Darwin Crater]], a probable [[impact crater]], and the inferred source of the glass.

==Occurrence==
Fragments of Darwin glass are found scattered over a 410&amp;nbsp;km² (160 miles squared) area.  Such an area is called a [[strewn field]].  On slopes and flat ground between 250 and 500 m elevation, the glass occurs with [[quartzite]] fragments buried under [[peat]] and soil.  The peat is normally around 20&amp;nbsp;cm thick, and the quartzite fragment horizon is typically 30&amp;nbsp;cm thick.  On mountain peaks higher than 500 m, the bedrock is directly exposed to the air, and Darwin glass occurs occasionally on the surface.  In valleys below 220 m the Darwin glass is buried below peat and sediments.  The glass occurs north, west and south from the crater. Its distribution extends to [[Kelly Basin]] and the lower northeast shore of [[Macquarie Harbour]].  Northwards it extends almost to the [[Lyell Highway]] and [[Crotty Dam]].  Darwin glass is rare in the crater itself.

In controlled excavations of gravel deposits the abundance of Darwin glass was found to vary from 0.3 to 47&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.  The highest abundance was found about 2&amp;nbsp;km from the crater, with the average abundance estimated at 3.4&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ of gravel over a 50&amp;nbsp;km² study area near the crater. From this it can be estimated that about 25000 tons of Darwin glass, or about 10000 m³, occurs in this 50&amp;nbsp;km² area.  The amount of glass is large compared with the size of the crater. Preservation is helped by acid ground water which does not dissolve the glass, but this alone cannot explain the glass abundance.  There is so much glass present that the glass must have been more copiously produced than in other meteorite impacts of similar size.  
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/largeimpacts2003/pdf/4057.pdf Distribution and Abundance of Darwin Impact Glass]. KT Howard and PW Haines&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The glass is light to dark green, white or black.  The glass takes the form of twisted masses, fragments or chunks up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm.  Internally it has a flowing texture defined by lines of elliptical bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;Keiren T Howard, Peter Haines, 2004, ''Fire in the Sky above South West Tasmania''. 17th Australian Geological Conference&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two kinds of Darwin glass when composition is measured.  Type 1 is normally white or green whereas type 2 is normally black to dark green.  The dark glass contains less [[silica]] and more [[magnesium]] and [[iron]] than the light green glass.  The dark glass is also enriched in [[chromium]], [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]].  A possible explanation for the chemical differences is that, in addition to being mainly composed of melted local [[metamorphic rock]]s, the type 2 glass also contains a component of extraterrestrial material from the meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2003/pdf/5079.pdf K.T. Howard, ''Geochemical Systematics In Darwin Impact Glass'', 66th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Darwin glass has been dated at about 816,000 years old using [[Argon-argon dating|argon dating]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ching-Hua Lo et al., 2002, ''Laser Fusion argon-40/argon-39 ages of Darwin Impact Glasses'', Meteoritics and Planetary Science 37, p 1555-2002 [http://argonlab.gl.ntu.edu.tw/papers/Lo-MPS02.pdf paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crater==
The glass is an [[impactite]] resulting from the melting of local rocks due to the impact of a large [[meteorite]].  The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression known as [[Darwin Crater]].  The crater is filled with 230 m of [[sediment]]s and [[breccia]].  A crater of that size would be created by a meteorite 20 to 50 m in diameter and its impact with Earth would release 20 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] of energy.

== History ==
The Araz hydroelectric power station with a total capacity of 22 MW was constructed in 1970, Tartar hydroelectric power station with a total capacity of 50 MW in 1976 and Shamkir hydroelectric power station with a total capacity of 380 MW in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12619535/index.pdf|title=ROLE OF ENERGY IN AZERBAIJAN’S FOREIGN POLICY DURING ILHAM ALIYEV ERA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, along with the construction of power stations, electrical networks were systematically developed and the country's sustainable energy system was created. In those years, "Ali Bayramli" Thermal power station with 330 kV – “Aghdam – Ganja – Aghstafa”, “Ali Bayramli – Yashma – Derbent”, 5th Mingachevir, 500kV 1st and 2nd Absheron, “Mukhranis – Vali” and other power lines, "Yashma", "Ganja", "Agstafa" with 330/110/10 kV, Imishli with 330/110/10 kV, Absheron with 500/330/220 kV, "Hovsan", "Nizami", "Mushfig", "Sangachal", "Masalli", "Agsu" and "Babek" with 220/110/10 electrical substations have been put into operation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

$ 53 million loan was granted to Azerbaijan by the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] for the construction of the Yenikend hydroelectric power station in December 1995, and constructed a Yenikend HPP with a total capacity of 150 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/publications/annual-report|title=EBRD Annual Report 1995|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconstruction of the Mingachevir hydroelectric power station, 330 kV Aghjabadi, 110 kV Barda substantions and the 330kV Azerbaijan Thermal Power Station - 330 kV “Agjabadi-Imishli” transmission lines were implemented at the expense of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] and the [[Islamic Development Bank]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/work-with-us/projects/psd/mingechaur-power-project.html|title=MINGECHAUR POWER PROJECT|website=www.ebrd.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two gas-turbine units with a capacity of 53.5 MW each at Baku thermal power station at the expense of German bank - Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale, and a 400MW steam gas plant at the “Shimal” power plant at the expense of the Japanese International Cooperation Bank's loan were commissioned in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibar.az/site/assets/files/1654/iba_annual_report_31122002.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AZERBAIJAN-annual report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2005, the head of state approved the State Program on “Development of the Fuel and Energy Complex (2005-2015) in the Republic of Azerbaijan”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inogate.org/documents/AZ_2005_02_14_State_Programme_on_Fuel_and_Energy_Sector_Eng.pdf|title=STATE PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENT OF FUEL AND ENERGY SECTOR IN AZERBAIJAN (2005-2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity demand of the economy of country has completely been paid by 12 thermal power stations such as Azerbaijan TPP, Shirvan TPP, Shimal TPP, Baku TPP, Nakhchivan TPP, [[Astara District|Astara]], [[Khachmaz District|Khachmaz]], [[Shaki District|Sheki]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Baku]], [[Quba]], [[Sanqaçal|Sangachal]] power stations, and 6 water power stations such as, Mingechevir, Shamkir, Yenikend, Varvara, Araz, Vaykhir HPP. Their total capacity was about 5900 megawatts. 90 percent of electricity production in Azerbaijan accounts for TPPs, and 10 percent for hydroelectric power stations. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Energy Regulatory Agency under the [[Ministry of Energy (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Energy]]  was established on the basis of the Department for State Energy And Gas Supervision of the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the Decree of president dated December 22, 2017, and its charter was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/work-with-us/procurement/pn-73118.html|title=Azerbaijan - Support for the Functioning of the Energy Regulatory Agency|website=www.ebrd.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Energy Trilemma İndex, compiled by the [[World Energy Council]] for 2017, Azerbaijan has taken the 31st place (BBA) among 125 countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us-cdn.creamermedia.co.za/assets/articles/attachments/71966_world-energy-council_world-energy-trilemma-index-2017.pdf|title=World Energy Trilemma Index {{!}} 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Global Energy Architecture Performance Index report 2017, compiled by the [[World Economic Forum]], [[Azerbaijan]] ranked 36th out of 127 countries with 0.67 score. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Energy_Architecture_Performance_Index_2017.pdf|title=Global Energy Architecture Performance Index Report 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil==
*'''Production:''' - {{convert|931990|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2008)
*'''Consumption:''' - {{convert|160000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2007)

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Azerbaijan]] accounted for half of the world’s [[oil]] production {{Balayev, S.G. 1969, Oil of the Country of Eternal Fire: Baku, Azerneshr Publishing House, 160 p.}}. Oil wells have been operating in [[Baku]] since the 1840s. Well before the famous discovery of oil in a drilled well in Pennsylvania by Edwin Drake in 1859, Azerbaijan had drilled its first oil well in Bibi-Heybat (settlement of Baku) in 1846. As of the early 21st century, almost all production came from off shore in the [[Caspian Sea]]. Azerbaijan was one of only four former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s (along with Russian, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) to be self-sufficient in [[petroleum]]. However, production declined following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union until foreign investment provided the capital for new development, turning this trend around in 1998. Production rose from {{convert|194000|oilbbl/d}} in 1998 to an average of {{convert|318000|oilbbl/d}} in 2004.

According to industry journals and government sources, proven oil reserves as of 2004 totaled between 7 billion and {{convert|13|Goilbbl}}. The [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan]] (SOCAR) has planned for joint development of the off shore fields (which are now largely untapped) and has entered into several agreements to build oil pipelines. For instance, a project with the [[Caspian Pipeline Consortium]] would carry oil from the Caspian Sea to the Russian [[Black Sea]] port of [[Novorossiysk]]. Another deal with [[Turkey]] involved the construction of a 1,760&amp;nbsp;km pipeline, the symbolic first length of which was installed in September 2002, to carry crude oil from Baku to [[Ceyhan]], Turkey. In 1995 Azerbaijan had 17 offshore oil fields in production. [[Guneshli]], about 96&amp;nbsp;km off the Azeri coast, currently accounts for more than half the annual production. By the end of 2002, 33 companies in 15 foreign countries had signed agreements to develop 21 major oil fields in Azerbaijan. As of 2003 disputes over off shore oil rights in the Caspian Sea continued to hinder development of those reserves. 

From 1987 to 1993, production deceased from 13.8 million tons of oil and 12.5 billion cubic meters gas to 10.3 million tons of oil and 6.8 billion cubic meters of gas. The annual rate of decline in production was 7.1% for oil and 13.5% for gas. The exploratory drilling decreased by 17 times, or by 170,000 meters, was 10,000 meters in 1995 compared to 1970. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anl.az/down/meqale/azerbaycan/azerbaycan_oktyabr2009/93256.htm|title=Azerbaijan has an independent energy system|last=Official webpage of Azerbaijan National library|first=|date=|website=anl.az|language=az|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transparency===
The 2013 report by UK-based Global Witness NGO revealed that companies working in Azerbaijan’s oil industry have no transparency and accountability. It has been documented that millions of dollars of revenue disappear into the hands of obscurely owned private companies that cooperate with SOCAR.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/azerbaijan-oil-corruption-transparency/25196298.html New Report Highlights Lack Of Transparency In Azerbaijan's Oil Industry. RFE/RL Dec. 10, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=global/&gt;

The report concluded that the opacity of the deals struck by Socar "is systemic" and added, 
“These findings should be of great concern to the international community as a whole. Oil and its derivative products are central to the Azerbaijani economy, making up 95% of exports in 2011. It is important for Europe that Azerbaijan keeps the oil and gas flowing and maintains a transparent and well-run energy industry. Yet this briefing shows that much of the oil business in Azerbaijan remains opaque, and corruption is still perceived to be at epidemic levels…"&lt;ref name=global&gt;[http://www.globalwitness.org/library/azerbaijan-anonymous ''Azerbaijan Anonymous'' Global Witness]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural Gas==
[[Natural gas]] production has become more important in recent years, especially in Baku, where some of the oil wells have been exhausted. Proven reserves as of late 2004 totaled 1.37 trillion cubic metres. Production of natural gas in 2011 totaled 17.66 billion cubic metres. [[Ukraine]] and [[Iran]] are interested in running a natural gas pipeline through Azerbaijan en route to Eastern Europe.

On March 10, 2016, Natiq Aliyev, Azerbaijani energy minister, publicly said that Azerbaijan has enough gas reserves to fill the  [[Southern Gas Corridor]] (SGC). The SGC is an energy project whose goal is to move 10 billion cub meters of gas from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.az/articles/economy/105740|title=News.Az -   Minister: Azerbaijan’s gas reserves enough to fill Southern Gas Corridor|website=news.az|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
*''production:'' 19.44 billion kWh (2011)
*''consumption:'' 13.57 billion kWh (2011)

In 2011, net electricity generation was estimated at 19.44 billion kWh. In 2011, consumption of electricity was estimated at 13.57 billion kWh. Total installed capacity at the beginning of 2011 was 6.392 million kW. Eight thermal plants supply more than 80% of capacity, and the rest comes from 5 hydroelectric plants. The main power plants (both are [[thermal power|thermal]]) were near [[Ali Bairamly]] (1,100 MW) and [[Mingechaur]] (2,100 MW).

== Report of 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minenergy.gov.az/upload/files/%C4%B0llik_hesabatlar/Illik_Hesabat_2017.pdf|title=Report on Fuel and Energy Complex Activity|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=az|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stat.gov.az/news/index.php?id=3738|title=Allocations directed to fixed assets|last=|first=|date=|website=Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dövlət Statistika Komitəsi|language=az|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The power of the country's electroenergy system has reached 7,172.6 MW. Currently, the system's capacity is 5200 MW and the peak power required is around 3750-3900 MW. In 2017, the production of electricity amounted to 22 209.8 million kWh including 20 445.4 million kWh at thermal power plants and 1 732.8 million kWh of electricity at hydroelectric power stations and totally decreased by 2.0% compared to the corresponding period of 2016 (22 665.7 million kWh).

Totally 4778.8 million cubic meters of natural gas and 311.5 thousand tons of mazut were used for electricity generation during the year.

50 MVA transformer with 110/35 kV, two 110 kV circuit breakers and 35 kV electrical equipment were installed at Hoca Hasan substation of Binagadi district. 110 kV double-circuit transmission line between 110 kV "Liman" and "White City" substations, three transformer substations with 35 / 0,4 kV were constructed.

In 2017, oil production amounted to around 38.7 million tons in the country. 28.9 million tons of extracted oil belonged to the [[Azeri–Chirag–Gunashli|Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli]], 2.4 million tons to Shah deniz (condensate) and 7.4 million tons to the [[SOCAR|State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic]].

In 2017, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] took part in the opening of the following substations:

==Refineries==
Petroleum and natural gas resources are the basis for an extensive system of refineries, which produce [[gasoline]], [[herbicide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, [[kerosene]], [[synthetic rubber]], and [[plastics]].

==Foreign investment competition with non-energy sectors==
In January 2015, the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, announced that he would direct his government to create programs to bring investment dollars to industries other than oil. Specifically, President Aliyev cited industrial and agricultural industries as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=CISTran Finance Reports|title=Azerbaijan seeks foreign investment for non-oil sector|url=http://cistranfinance.com/news/azerbaijan-seeks-foreign-investment-for-non-oil-sector/5934/|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=CISTran Finance|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliyev cited Azerbaijani’s economy by saying, “That’s why it’s much easier to attract investments to stable countries with socio-political stability and information growth.” He said that the banking industry will become more important in helping develop the country’s non-energy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan Seeks to Attract Foreign Investors to its Non-Oil Sector|url=https://www.usacc.org/news-a-publications/investment-news/1146-azerbaijan-seeks-to-attract-foreign-investors-to-its-non-oil-sector.html|website=United States-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy production in Greece''' is dominated by the state owned [[Public Power Corporation of Greece|Public Power Corporation]] (known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ, or in English DEI). In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6% of all electric energy demand in Greece,&lt;ref name="DEI 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dei.gr/Images/ENG%20REPORT%202010%20FINAL.pdf |title=Public Power Corporation S.A. Financial Report (January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2010) |year=2010 |publisher=[[Public Power Corporation of Greece]] |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number fell to 77.3% in 2010.&lt;ref name="DEI 2010" /&gt; Almost half (48%) of DEI's power output is generated using [[lignite]], a drop from the 51.6% in 2009.&lt;ref name="DEI 2010" /&gt;

12% of Greece's electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants&lt;ref name="Invest in Greece energy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investingreece.gov.gr/default.asp?pid=36&amp;sectorID=38&amp;la=1 |title=Energy |publisher=Invest in Greece Agency |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another 20% from [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="Invest in Greece energy" /&gt; Between 2009 and 2010, independent companies' energy production increased by 56%,&lt;ref name="DEI 2010" /&gt; from 2,709 [[Kilowatt hour|Gigawatt hour]] in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010.&lt;ref name="DEI 2010" /&gt;

In line with the [[European Commission]]'s Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its overall &lt;i&gt;energy&lt;/i&gt; from renewable sources by 2020.&lt;ref name="Directive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/targets_en.htm |title=Renewable energy &gt;&gt; Targets by 2020 |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, according to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (ΑΔΜΗΕ) more than 20% of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric powerplants. This percentage in April reached 50%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admie.gr/fileadmin/groups/EDRETH/Monthly_Energy_Reports/Energy_Report_201512_v1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The same trend was the case also for 2016 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admie.gr/fileadmin/groups/EDRETH/Monthly_Energy_Reports/Energy_Report_201611_v1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The contribution of RES (non-hydroelectric) to the &lt;i&gt;gross final electricity consumption&lt;/i&gt; accounted for 24.5% in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece Energy Situation|url=https://energypedia.info/wiki/Greece_Energy_Situation|website=energypedia.info/|publisher=energypedia|accessdate=2 May 2018|ref=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while hydroelectric power represented approximately 25% by installed capacity. According to the Greek Electricity Market Operator (LAGIE), the total installed capacity in the Greek interconnected system at the end of 2016 accounted for almost 16,615 MW, including 3,912 MW lignite, 4,658 MW natural gas, 3,173 MW large hydro-power and 4,873 MW RES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece Energy Situation|url=https://energypedia.info/wiki/Greece_Energy_Situation|website=energypedia.info/|publisher=energypedia|accessdate=2 May 2018|ref=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Greece currently does not have any [[nuclear power plant]]s in operation, however in 2009 the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.&lt;ref name="Academy of Athens nuclear power"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academyofathens.gr/Documents/christoforou_porismata.pdf |title=Πορίσματα της Ομάδας Εργασίας της Επιτροπής Ενέργειας της Ακαδημίας Αθηνών επί του θέματος "Πυρηνική Ενέργεια και Ενεργειακές Ανάγκες της Ελλάδος" |publisher=[[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122125502/http://www.academyofathens.gr/Documents/christoforou_porismata.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mattress.jpg|220px|right|alt=Foam rubber yoga mat.]]
'''Foam rubber''' (also known as cellular, sponge, or expanded rubber) refers to [[rubber]] that has been manufactured with a [[foaming agent]] to create an air-filled matrix structure. Commercial foam rubbers are generally made of either [[polyurethane]] or natural [[latex]]. Latex foam rubber, used in mattresses, is well known for its endurance. Polyurethane is a thermosetting polymer that comes from combination of Methyl di-isocyanate and [[polyethylene]] and some other chemical additives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=انواع فوم چیست؟|url=https://www.foamiran.com/%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B4%DB%8C/%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%81%D9%88%D9%85-%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA|website=Foamiran|accessdate=22 January 2018|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing history==
Foam rubber was first produced in 1929 by [[Dunlop Rubber]] researcher chemists [[Edward A. Murphy (chemist)|E. A. Murphy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacture of rubber goods|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US1929603|website=Google Patents|publisher=Dunlop Rubber Co|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eric Owen]] using whipped [[latex]]. In 1937 isocyanate based materials were first used for the formation of foam rubbers, after World War II [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber replaced many natural types of foam. Foam rubbers have been used commercially for a wide range of applications since around the 1940s. 

Polyether [[polyurethane]] rubber was discovered and patented in the 1950s by [[Charles C. Price]].&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyether polyurethane rubber US 2866774 A|url=https://www.google.com.pg/patents/US2866774|website=United States Patents|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, polyurethane-based foams make up over 90%, by weight, of the entire market for polyurethanes. The largest amount of polyurethane is used by these industries: construction, transportation, home furniture, noise and vibration reduction, and carpet.  Construction uses 27% of polyurethane, and transportation uses 21%. Flexible foam is the leading material usage at 44% total volume, and rigid foam material at 28% of the United States market.&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Sheppard [http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Foam-Rubber.html Manufacturing history FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing process==
Rates of polymerization can range from many minutes to just a few seconds. Fast reacting polymers feature short cycle periods and require the use of machinery to thoroughly mix the reacting agents. Slow polymers may be mixed by hand, but require long periods on mixing, as a result industrial application tends to use machinery to mix products. Product processing can range from a variety of techniques including, but not limited to spraying, open pouring, and molding.
* '''Material preparation''' Liquid and solid material generally arrive on location via rail or truck, once unloaded liquid materials are stored in heated tanks.  When producing slabstock typically two or more polymers streams are used.
* '''Mixing''' Open pouring, better known as continuous dispensing is used primarily in the formation of rigid, low density foams. Specific amounts of chemicals are mixed into a mixing head, much like an industrial blender. The foam is poured onto a conveyor belt, where it then cures for cutting.
* '''Curing and Cutting''' After curing on the conveyor belt the foam is then forced through a horizontal band saw. This band saw cuts the pieces in a set size for the application. General contracting uses 4’x12’x2’’.
* '''Further processing''' Once cut and cured the slabstock can either be sold or a lamination process can be applied. This process turns the slabstock into a rigid foam board known as boardstock. Boardstock is used for metal roof insulation, oven insulation, and many other durable goods.

==Physical properties==
The main physical properties of foam rubber are generalized as being “Lightweight, buoyant, cushioning performance, thermal and acoustic insulation, impact damping and cost reduction”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infosys.korea.ac.kr/PDF/JIEC/IE12/IE12-5-0795.pdf Joon-Hyung Kim ,et al] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031012301/http://infosys.korea.ac.kr/PDF/JIEC/IE12/IE12-5-0795.pdf |date=2014-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosslinking technology is used in the formation of [[Ethylene-vinyl_acetate|EVA]] based foams, including [[LLDPE]], [[LDPE]], [[HDPE]], PP, and TPE. Crosslinking is the most important characteristic in the production of foam rubber to obtain the best possible foam expansion and physical properties. Crosslinking is defined as chemical bonding between polymer chains, and is used for foam rubber manufacturing to stabilize bubble expansion, enhanced resistance to thermal collapse and improve physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/32682/1/Chen_Nan_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling==
Due to the variety in polyurethane chemistries, it is difficult to recycle foam materials using a single method. Reusing slab stock foams for carpet backing is how the majority of recycling is done. This method involves shredding the scrap and bonding the small flakes together to form sheets. Other methods involve breaking the foam down into granules and dispersing them into a polyol blend to be molded into the same part as the original. The recycling process is still ever developing for foam rubber and the future will hopefully unveil new and easier ways for recycling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polymer-search.com/rubberfoam.html No Author]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Forest and Stream''''' was a magazine featuring [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and other outdoor activities in the [[United States]]. The journal was founded in August 1873 by [[Charles Hallock]]. At the time of its 1930 cancellation it was the ninth oldest magazine still being issued in the US.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,739586,00.html ''Time''. (1930, June 16). "Forest, Field &amp; Stream".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in [[New York City]] by Hallock in newspaper format measuring 16" x 11", it published many articles by "Nessmuk" ([[George W. Sears]]) in the 1880s that helped to popularize [[canoe]]ing, the [[Adirondacks|Adirondack]] lakes, self-guided canoe [[camping]] tours and ultralight camping. 

An early vehicle for [[conservationism]],&lt;ref&gt;McMartin, Barbara. (2004). ''The Privately Owned Adirondacks'', Lake View Press, Canada Lake, NY. {{ISBN|1-888374-20-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forest and Stream'' was dedicated to wildlife conservation, helped to launch the [[National Audubon Society]], was an early sponsor the national park movement, and supported the U.S.-Canadian [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; 

Naturalist [[George Bird Grinnell]] was editor for 35 years, and contributors included [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Another notable contributor was [[Theodore Gordon]], long considered "the father of American [[dry fly fishing]]," who began writing for the magazine in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, Terry.

'''Frøy Aagre''' (born 8 June 1977 in [[Tønsberg]], [[Norway]]) is a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] jazz musician (saxophone).&lt;ref name=discogs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Fr%C3%B8y+Aagre |title=Frøy Aagre Discography |publisher=[[Discogs.com]] |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aagre is one of the leading saxophonists of Norway, playing tenor and soprano saxophone with an individual sound that builds on inspirations by such saxophonists as [[Dave Liebman]] and [[Wayne Shorter]]. She has studied saxophone and composition in [[Oslo]], Birmingham, London, New York and [[Buenos Aires]]. Aagre was awarded the Norwegian Government scholarship for the year 2005/2006.&lt;ref name=wangarattajazz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2013.wangarattajazz.com/artist/froy-aagre-electric-norway |title=Frøy Aagre Electric (Norway) |publisher=Wangarattajazz.com |date=3 November 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aagre released her first album ''Katalyze'' in 2004 with '''Frøy Aagre Offbeat''', including [[Andreas Ulvo]], [[Freddy Augdal]] and [[Roger Williamsen]], and attracted notice throughout Europe, and soon found herself invited to perform at major festivals in Europe, North America and India. There after followed ''Countryside'' (2006) and ''Cycle of Silence'' (2010) both receiving great reviews. When attending the Banff Jazz Workshop in Canada, in 2005, Aagre started a collaboration with the [[Brisbane]] band Misinterprotato (now known as Trichotomy). This led to touring with the trio, including an appearance at Wangaratta Jazz Festival in 2009.&lt;ref name=wangarattajazz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mela.no/artister/froy-aagre |title=Frøy Aagre Biography |publisher=Mela.no |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is the liner notes for the latest album Frøy Aagre Electric: The name Frøy Aagre Electric refers to the new setup with Fender Rhodes Electric Piano, effects and bass synth as opposed to the previous setup of merely acoustic instruments.  This album is divided into two parts; following is a description of part 1, the main section of the album (track 1–6). Part 2 is the three duo pieces at the end (track 7–9).

Whilst the previous album, "Cycle of Silence" explored the use of silence in music, this album goes in the opposite direction, exploring energy, vitality, rhythmic drive and musical playfulness.
 
The focus during the compositional process, the rehearsal period, recording session and the mixing process was to create musical momentum; by making the music constantly move and flow between different sections and contrasting moods, creating tension and relief by using various instrumentations, electronic sounds and dynamics. The focus during the recording session itself was to capture the electric live energy in the studio.

Whereas previous albums have been acoustic, melodic jazz with occasional hints of classical and world music, my change of musical preferences and the entry of electronic sounds have added influence from pop and electronica to the music.
This album is groundbreaking and a game changer for me. Entering the world of electronic sounds has broadened my musical horizon and opened doors to new genres to mix and play with as part of my musical pallet, yet not being totally devoted to any.

I strive to maintain a balance between spontaneity and structure, bridging the gap between the composed and the improvised by making it part of the same overall form. As always I care a lot about the melodies, but this time in combination with a stronger focus on rhythmic drive. Choosing the right musicians for your music is important to make your music blossom and Andreas and Jonas have contributed tremendously to the musical expression of this album. I would also like to mention the wonderful guests who has lifted the music further and broadened the range of sounds.

The album itself is a journey, like snapshots of my life; "Berlin", composed in this thrilling city, one of my favourites in Europe and "City Lights" inspired by the urban pulse and uplifting energy of big capital cities. “Castle in the Air”, is written to Andreas Ulvo, my musical soul mate over the last 10 years, and was a tune that created spontaneous energetic moments in the recording studio.
“Birds, Bees and Forest Trees” is inspired by a particularly beautiful walk in the woods,  "Entanglement" is about the close relationships in life and the playful "African Wig", with African music influences recalls moments from my African tour.
The album ends in quiet contemplation with three duo pieces, of which Youth and Loss 77 is heavily influenced in the aftermath of the national tragedy of 22 July 2011.

This is the inspiration behind the compositions, but I hope you make the music your own and connect it to your life and experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The Green Globe certification is a structured assessment of the sustainability performance of travel and tourism businesses and their supply chain partners. Businesses can monitor improvements and document achievements leading to certification of their enterprises’ sustainable operation and management.

The Green Globe Standard includes 44 core criteria supported by over 380 compliance indicators. The applicable indicators vary by type of certification, geographical area as well as local factors. The entire Green Globe Standard is reviewed and updated twice per calendar year.

The Green Globe Standard is available to all Green Globe Members and covers all areas of sustainability: 

Sustainable Management, Social and Economic, Cultural Heritage, Environment.

Each section includes: 

a complete set of indicators, certification policies and procedures, as well as auditor guidelines.

==Green Globe Standard==

Green Globe is active in harmonizing with other established sustainability certification programs around the world. The process of harmonization contributes to maintaining core criteria and at the same time addresses regional issues through the adoption of locally developed standards.

'''The Green Globe Standard is based on the following international standards and agreements:'''

* Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria
* Global Partnership for Sustainable Tourism Criteria (STC Partnership)
* Baseline Criteria of the Sustainable Tourism Certification Network of the Americas
* Agenda 21 and principles for Sustainable Development endorsed by 182 Governments at the United Nations Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992
*  ISO 9001 / 14001 / 19011 (International Standard Organization)

To guarantee compliance to the highest international standards, a third-party independent auditor is appointed to work with clients on-site. The international standard ISO 19011 provides guidance on the management of audit programs, the conduct of internal and external management systems as well as the competence and evaluation of auditors. Green Globe has drawn on ISO 19011:2002 in the development of its audit program.

'''Ground vibration boom''' is a phenomenon of very large increase in [[ground vibrations]] generated by high-speed railway trains travelling at speeds higher than the velocity of [[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh surface waves]] in the supporting ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ground-vibration-boom.html "Ground vibration boom"], ''Railway Gazette'', 1 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical background ==

[[File:Swedish high-speed train X2000 at Ledsgard.jpg|thumb|Swedish high-speed train X 2000 approaching Ledsgard.]]

This phenomenon, which is similar to a [[sonic boom]] from [[supersonic aircraft]], was theoretically predicted in 1994. Its first experimental observation took place in 1997-1998 on the newly built high-speed railway line in Sweden (from Gothenburg to Malmo) for high-speed trains [[X 2000]]. At some locations along this line characterised by very soft ground (near Ledsgard) the Rayleigh wave velocity was as low as 45&amp;nbsp;m/s, and train speeds of only 165–170&amp;nbsp;km/h were sufficient to observe the effect. In particular, the increase in train speeds from 140 to 180&amp;nbsp;km/h was accompanied by about tenfold increase in generated ground vibration level, which agrees with the theory. It is now understood that, with the increase of operating train speeds, this phenomenon represents a major environmental problem associated with building new high-speed railway lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/writev/rail/m53.htm "The Application and Effect of the Rayleigh Wave Speed Principle on High Speed Rail travel - Written evidence from David Rayney"], ''UK Parliament Website'', 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mitigation measures ==

The most efficient way to mitigate ground vibration boom is to reduce train speeds at locations where Rayleigh wave velocities in the ground are very low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stophs2.org/news/15268-railing-rayleigh-waves "Railing against Rayleigh Waves"], ''STOP HS2 Website'', 14 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is not desirable, e.g. for economic reasons, some mitigation measures can be applied, such as stiffening of railway embankments or building protective trenches and barriers between railways and residential or industrial buildings. Any mitigation measures would involve the specific ground investigation works along the route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/HS2/hs2-defends-itself-against-derailment-claims "HS2 defends itself against derailment claims"], ''Rail Technology Magazine'', 14 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HUMARA Assay''' is one of the most widely used methods to determine the clonal origin of a tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Barbara L.|date=2008-10-01|title=Many different tumor types have polyclonal tumor origin: evidence and implications|journal=Mutation Research|volume=659|issue=3|pages=232–247|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2008.05.004|issn=0027-5107|pmid=18614394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comertpay|first=Sabahattin|last2=Pastorino|first2=Sandra|last3=Tanji|first3=Mika|last4=Mezzapelle|first4=Rosanna|last5=Strianese|first5=Oriana|last6=Napolitano|first6=Andrea|last7=Baumann|first7=Francine|last8=Weigel|first8=Tracey|last9=Friedberg|first9=Joseph|date=2014-01-01|title=Evaluation of clonal origin of malignant mesothelioma|journal=Journal of Translational Medicine|volume=12|pages=301|doi=10.1186/s12967-014-0301-3|issn=1479-5876|pmc=4255423|pmid=25471750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is based on [[X chromosome inactivation]] and it takes the advantage of having different [[methylation]] status of a gene called HUMARA (short for Human [[Androgen receptor]]) that is located on [[X chromosome]]. Considering the fact that once one X chromosome is inactivated in a cell,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gartler|first=S. M.|last2=Riggs|first2=A. D.|date=1983-01-01|title=Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=17|pages=155–190|doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001103|issn=0066-4197|pmid=6364959}}&lt;/ref&gt; all other cells derived from it will have the same X chromosome inactivated, this approach becomes a great tool to differentiate a monoclonal population from a polyclonal  one in a female tissue. HUMARA gene, in particular, has three important features that make it highly convenient for the purpose.

1-) The gene is located on X chromosome and it goes through inactivation by methylation in normal [[embryogenesis]] of a female infant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fact that most-but not all-genes on X chromosome undergo inactivation, this feature becomes an important one.

2-) Human Androgen Receptor gene [[allele]]s have varying numbers of CAG repeats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=R. C.|last2=Zoghbi|first2=H. Y.|last3=Moseley|first3=A. B.|last4=Rosenblatt|first4=H. M.|last5=Belmont|first5=J. W.|date=1992-12-01|title=Methylation of HpaII and HhaI sites near the polymorphic CAG repeat in the human androgen-receptor gene correlates with X chromosome inactivation|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1229–1239|issn=0002-9297|pmc=1682906|pmid=1281384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[DNA]] from a healthy female tissue is amplified by [[PCR]] for a specific region of the gene, two separated bands can be seen on the gel.

3-) The region that is amplified by PCR also has certain base orders that make it susceptible to be digested by [[HpaII]] (or HhaI) enzyme when it is not methylated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This detail gives the opportunity to researchers to differentiate a methylated allele from the unmethylated one.

Thanks to these qualities of HUMARA gene, clonal origin of any tissue from a female mammalian organism can be determined.

The basic process is performed as the following :

1-) DNA from the tissue is isolated.

2-) The isolated DNA is treated with the suitable enzyme (such as HpaII) in optimal conditions for a suggested amount of time (i.e. overnight).

3-) DNA is cleaned and the certain region of HUMARA gene is amplified by PCR using "suitable" primers (as an example, please see:Ref.2)

4-) After running PCR products through a gel, the gel is visualized and the results are analyzed accordingly. If two bands are apparent, the tissue studied is most likely of polyclonal origin. If a single band is observed, the tissue is monoclonal unless two alleles have exactly the same numbers of CAG repeats or different cells with the same inactivated initiated the tumor; so, seemingly monoclonal although it is actually polyclonal.

In order to make a conclusion about the clonality of a tumor, it is best to use the DNA from a normal tissue of the same person, and a sample without enzyme treatment must also be amplified as a control. If, even in normal tissues without enzyme treatment, a single band is observed, it may be explained as follows; this person has the genetic pattern as XO (this possibility can be excluded to see a band after enzyme treatment because, if indeed XO is the genetic pattern of the sample, then, there will be NO methylation, therefore no band should be visible after digesting with the enzyme. In the case of seeing a band after enzyme treatment, the observation is most likely to mean that the person has two X chromosomes with exact CAG repeats.) When you see two bands for normal tissue (both enzyme treated and untreated), and you see two bands for enzyme treated tumor sample but two bands for untreated tumor DNA, then you are surely looking at a polyclonal tumor. However, if you see the same number of bands only with a single band after enzyme treatment, there is a rather high chance for the tumor of your interest to be monoclonal. In this last case, monoclonality is not for sure because, as stated earlier, there is the possibility of having exact same -CAG- repeats on both alleles.

The '''High Arctic Large Igneous Province''' ('''HALIP''') is a [[Cretaceous]] [[large igneous province]] in the Arctic. The region is divided into several smaller magmatic provinces. [[Svalbard]], [[Franz Josef Land]], [[Sverdrup Basin Magmatic Province|Sverdrup Basin]], [[Amerasian Basin]], and northern [[Greenland]] ([[Peary Land]]) are some of the larger divisions. Today, HALIP covers an area greater than {{Convert|1000000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, making it one of the largest and most intense magmatic complexes on the planet. However, eroded volcanic sediments in sedimentary strata in Svalbard and Franz Josef Land suggest that an extremely large portion of HALIP volcanics have already been eroded away.&lt;ref name="Dossing-Abs"&gt;{{Harvnb|Døssing|Jackson|Matzka|Einarsson|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic evolution==
The HALIP event lasted from 130 million years ago to approximately 60 million years ago. During its active period, there were two distinct phases of volcanism. The first phase lasted from 130 million years ago to 80 million years ago and was characterized by [[Tholeiitic magma series|tholeiitic]] igneous activity. During this time, numerous [[dike (geology)|dikes]] and [[sill (geology)|sills]] formed, and there were eruptions of [[basalt]]ic flow. The basalts formed at this time are relatively rich in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and have a similar composition to continental [[flood basalt]]s. The second phase lasted from approximately 85 million years ago to 60 million years ago and was characterized by mildly alkaline igneous activity and the eruption of flood basalts. The [[igneous rock]]s formed during the second phase have a similar geochemical makeup as the intra-plate composition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jowitt|first=S. M.|last2=Williamson|first2=M.-C.|last3=Ernst|first3=R. E.|date=2014-03-01|title=Geochemistry of the 130 to 80 Ma Canadian High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP) Event and Implications for Ni-Cu-PGE Prospectivity|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259571856_Geochemistry_of_the_130_to_80_Ma_Canadian_High_Arctic_Large_Igneous_Province_HALIP_Event_and_Implications_for_Ni-Cu-PGE_Prospectivity|journal=Economic Geology|volume=109|issue=2|pages=281–307|doi=10.2113/econgeo.109.2.281|issn=0361-0128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arctic Ocean]] is a few hundred million years old, making it the youngest ocean on Earth.  In the [[Precambrian]], when the Arctic was located south of the Equator, the continent [[Arctica]] (or Arctida) filled the gap between the [[craton]]s that today surround the Arctic region.  Arctica [[rift]]ed apart in the Late Precambrian (950&amp;nbsp;Ma) and was reassembled in a new configuration in the Late Paleozoic (255&amp;nbsp;Ma).&lt;ref name="VerniDobre"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernikovsky|Dobretsov|2015|loc=pp. 206–208; fig. 2, p. 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Jurassic-Cretaceous --&gt;
[[File:Kap tegethoff gross.jpg|thumb|Cape Tegethoff, a [[basalt]]ic [[headland]] of [[Franz Josef Land]]]]
During the [[Jurassic]]-Cretaceous this second continent, known as [[Pangaea|Pangea]], broke apart, opening the [[Amerasian Basin]] and the Arctic Ocean.  HALIP dispersed the components of this second continent around the margins of the Arctic Ocean where they are now [[terrane]]s and microplates embedded into fold belts or overlain by sediments. As the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and Arctic oceans opened during the [[Mesozoic]] and into the [[Cenozoic]], the Arctic Region underwent several stages of rifting, sedimentation, and magmatism.&lt;ref name="Corfu-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Corfu|Polteau|Planke|Faleide|2013|loc=Introduction, pp. 1127–1128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dolerite]]s collected from Svalbard and elsewhere in the Arctic are [[mafic]] intra-plate [[tholeiite]]s characteristic of HALIP, which indicated that the LIP formed during the opening of the Arctic Ocean around 148–70&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Seismic and magnetic analyses of the seafloor produced ages of 118–83&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nejbert|Krajewski|Dubińska|Pécskay|2011|loc=Discussion and conclusions, pp. 16, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HALIP is widely thought to have originated from a [[mantle plume]], and the igneous activity of the province often tracked along a similar path as the [[Iceland hotspot|Icelandic hotspot]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Magmatic provinces ==
The HALIP is divided into several magmatic provinces. These provinces are divided by location, igneous rock composition, and the formations present.

=== Svalbard ===
In the Svalbard province, the HALIP is expressed as an extensive system of alkaline intrusive [[doleritic]] rocks. The [[intrusion]]s largely appear in the form of sills that can reach thicknesses of {{Convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} and continuously extend for up to {{Convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} laterally. The basaltic rocks found in Svalbard have an intra-plate composition and are though to originate from a source near the [[Alpha Ridge]]. The Svalbard province is also closely associated with the Franz Josef Land province (discussed below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maher Jr.|first=H. D.|date=2001|title=Manifestations of the Cretaceous high Arctic large igneous province in Svalbard|url=http://ic.ucsc.edu/~acr/BeringResources/Articles%20of%20interest/Central%20Artic/Maher%202001.pdf|journal=The Journal of Geology|doi=10.1086/317960|pmid=|access-date=April 2016|bibcode=2001JG....109...91M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two provinces combined cover an area of approximately {{Convert|750000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Franz Josef Land ===
The [[Barents Sea dike swarm|Franz Josef Land province]] is closely associated with the Svalbard province. Franz Josef Land is located approximately {{Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Svalbard and contains igneous rocks of very similar composition to those of Svalbard. However, the archipelago is scattered with a prominent swarm of southeast trending dikes. Extensive sills and volcanic flows can also be found in the region, as well as a few dikes of other trends. The timing of the Franz Josef Land formations and the Svalbard formations is thought to be nearly identical, furthering the evidence for a large initial plume head model for the HALIP.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.largeigneousprovinces.org/06apr|title=April 2006 LIP of the Month {{!}} Large Igneous Provinces Commission|website=www.largeigneousprovinces.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sverdrup Basin ===
[[Image:Dragon Cliffs, Nunavut.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flood basalt]] layers exposed in [[Dragon Cliffs]]  on western [[Axel Heiberg Island]], [[Nunavut]], Canada]]
The Sverdrup Basin province spreads across the [[Canadian Arctic Islands]]. The region is characterized by the presence of a radiating [[dike swarm]] across the [[Queen Elizabeth Islands]] that seems to suggest the presence of a mantle plume beneath the Alpha Ridge. This province contains igneous rocks of both tholeiitic and alkaline composition. There are also a respectable number of sills and flood basalts in the province.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The flood basalts in the Canadian Arctic Islands are similar to those of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia River flood basalts]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States. The Sverdrup Basin Magmatic Province covers an area of {{Convert|550000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Amerasian Basin ===
The Amerasian Basin’s most prominent feature is the Alpha Ridge – which is thought to be the location of the mantle plume that fed the HALIP. The ridge reaches a height of {{Convert|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the seafloor. Also in the region are a few basaltic dikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Døssing|first=A.|last2=Jackson|first2=H. R.|last3=Matzka|first3=J.|last4=Einarsson|first4=I.|last5=Rasmussen|first5=T. M.|last6=Olesen|first6=A. V.|last7=Brozena|first7=J. M.|date=2013-02-01|title=On the origin of the Amerasia Basin and the High Arctic Large Igneous Province—Results of new aeromagnetic data|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12006991|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=363|pages=219–230|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.12.013|bibcode=2013E&amp;PSL.363..219D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amerasian Basin extends over {{Convert|200000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Northern Greenland (Peary Land) ===
The northern Greenland province, also known as Peary Land, contains three dike swarms. The Nansen Land swarm trends SSE-SE and is the oldest of the swarms. The middle-aged swarm is known as the Erlandsen Swarm and trends SE-ESE. The J. P. Koch Swarm is the youngest of the three and trends eastward. The two younger swarms tend to have igneous rocks of alkaline composition, while the Nansen Land swarm tends to have more tholeiitic composition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Peary Land province covers an area of over {{Convert|80000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Barents Sea ===
The Barents Sea province is characterized by igneous intrusions with much similarity to Svalbard and Franz-Josef Land. This region is well known for being petroleum-rich. The Barents Sea province covers an area of {{Convert|15000|to|20000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Climatic impact==
Large igneous provinces such as HALIP are thought to have caused global climate change. [[Late Cretaceous]] (92–86 Ma) vertebrates, including {{Convert|2.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[champsosaur]]s, a crocodile-like reptile, found in the Canadian Arctic suggests that polar climate was much warmer during the Cretaceous when average annual temperature must have exceeded 14&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tarduno|Brinkman|Renne|Cottrell|1998b|loc=Abstract; Fig. 4, p. 2243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BLIP intrusions could have released perhaps {{Convert|9000|Gt|abbr=on}} of carbon from the [[contact aureole]]s which could have triggered the [[Aptian]] [[Anoxic event#Cretaceous|oceanic anoxic event]] (OAE1a) at 120&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="Polteau-2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Polteau|Planke|Faleide|Svensen|2010|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Continental Scientific Drilling Program''' is a multinational program to further and fund [[geosciences]] in the field of Continental Scientific Drilling.  [[Scientific drilling]] is a critical tool in understanding of Earth processes and structure. It provides direct insight into Earth processes and critically tests geological models. Results obtained from drilling projects at critical sites can be applied to other areas worldwide. It is, therefore, believed that international cooperation in continental scientific drilling is an essential component for a responsible management strategy for the Earth's natural resources and environment.

The ICDP was founded in February 1996 in the German Embassy in Tokyo as a result of the [[German Continental Deep Drilling Program]] (KTB; 1987-1995). The [[:de:Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum|GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]] serves as the headquarters for both the current ICDP and the former KTB project.

== Motivation ==
ICDP supports international science teams with a proven need for continental-based drilling. The proposed projects help to answer societal challenges related to dynamics of planet Earth, contributing to major advances in understanding Earth’s environment and life, sustainable geo- and [[energy resources]], as well as safeguarding from [[natural disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Continental Scientific Drilling Program|url=http://www.icdp-online.org/profile/societal-challenges/motivation/|publisher=GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Areas ==
=== Climate &amp; Ecosystems ===
ICDP proposals seek to help understand how both the climate and the environment have changed on global and regional scales.  Areas of research within this theme include [[paleoclimate]] studies investigating the manner in which Earth’s past climate has changed, the reasons for such changes, as well as the role of environmental forcing in human evolution, for example in the [[East African Rift#Discoveries in human evolution|Eastern Rift Valley]] of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drilling Projects|url=http://homininsitedrilling.icdp-online.org|publisher=International Continental Scientific Drilling Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ICDP proposals focus on the effects of [[volcanism]] and [[impact events|major impacts]] on climate and [[mass extinctions]]. Deep biosphere research has also become an important component of drilling projects to help get a better understanding of evolution and extent of life on Earth.&lt;ref name=Horsfield2014 &gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Horsfield|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Knebel|editor2-first=C|editor3-last=Ludden|editor3-first=J|editor4-last=Hydman|editor4-first=R|title=Unraveling the Workings of Planet Earth|journal=International Continental Scientific Drilling Program|date=2014|doi=10.2312/icdp.2014.001|location=Potsdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of deep-life that coincide with ICDP goals include addressing metabolic rates, [[carbon cycling]], and energy sources of subsurface microbial activity, how microbial life has adapted to the more extreme conditions of subsurface habitats, and the role of the deep biosphere on the [[geosphere]] and [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kieft|first1=T.L.|last2=Onstott|first2=T.C.|last3=Ahonen|first3=L.|last4=Aloisi|first4=V.|last5=Colwell|first5=F.S.|last6=Engelen|first6=B.|last7=Fendrihan|first7=S.|last8=Gaidos|first8=E.|last9=Harms|first9=U.|last10=Head|first10=I.|last11=Kallmeyer|first11=J.|last12=Kiel Reese|first12=B.|last13=Lin|first13=L.-H.|last14=Long|first14=P.E|last15=Moser|first15=D.P.|last16=Mills|first16=H|last17=Sar|first17=P.|last18=Schulze-Makuch|first18=D.|last19=Stan-Lotter|first19=H.|last20=Wagner|first20=D.|last21=Wang|first21=P.-L.|last22=Westall|first22=F.|last23=Wilkins|first23=M.J.|title=Workshop to develop deep-life continental scientific drilling projects|journal=Scientific Drilling|date=2015|volume=19|pages=43–53|url=https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-19-43-2015|doi=10.5194/sd-19-43-2015|bibcode=2015SciDr..19...43K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable Georesources ===
There is a rise in demand for renewable and clean energy resources to reduce dependence on [[fossil fuel]]s. Knowing the composition, structure and evolution of Earth’s crust can help to understand how best to manage and use Earth's resources and environment. Research is needed in this area to determine [[sustainable]] practices in exploring and exploiting [[natural resource]]s. ICDP undertakes a variety of scientific drilling projects to study the origin of [[mineral]] resources and to discover new unconventional resources such as [[gas hydrates]] and [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref name=Horsfield2014 /&gt;

Research areas within sustainable georesources include the nature of the deep biosphere and its relation to geologic processes such as [[hydrocarbon]] maturation, [[ore deposit]]ion and energy resources, the origin and evolution of sedimentary basins and hydrocarbon resources, and the role of various geologic settings, including volcanoes and [[plate boundaries]], in ore deposit formation. Other georesource studies include understanding the stresses, such as [[urbanization]] and [[sea level rise|sea-level-rise]], on freshwater resources and heat and mass transfer. The transfer of heat and mass, i.e. [[magma]], hot fluids, [[groundwater]] and sediment, controls the concentration of metals and hydrocarbons as well as providing renewable [[geothermal energy]] resources.&lt;ref name=Horsfield2014 /&gt;

=== Natural Hazards ===
ICDP has accepted many proposals related to formation, potential hazard, and mitigation associated with fault boundaries, volcanoes, impact structures and plate margins. Topics include, but are not limited to, earthquakes generated on [[Fault (geology)|fault]] boundaries like [[San Andreas Fault]] and [[North Anatolian Fault Zone]], geophysical and geochemical properties of different volcanic sources, impact basin evolution and effect on Earth’s environment and ecology, and [[tsunami]]s generation.&lt;ref name=Horsfield2014 /&gt;

== Proposal Procedure ==
The International Continental Scientific Drilling Program accepts proposals each year by Jan 15th from individual or groups of scientists from member countries (See [[International Continental Scientific Drilling Program#Members|Members]]). Proposals are selected based primarily on scientific merits and expected impacts. The steps from project to proposal include submission of a pre-proposal letter by the Principal Investigators followed by the development of Workshop Proposal and Full Proposal if the pre-proposal is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposals|url=http://www.icdp-online.org/proposals/|publisher=International Continental Scientific Drilling Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
Currently, [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[China]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norwegian Geological Survey|Norway]], [[Poland]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[UNESCO]] are members of the ICDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icdp-online.org/membership/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030143/http://www.icdp-online.org/membership/ |archivedate=2014-03-22 |df= }} Membership&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">The '''International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations''' ('''ISCSC''') is an international scholarly organization dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of [[civilizations]].  Based at [[Western Michigan University]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/11217607.0001.204/--politics-in-a-world-of-civilizations-long-term-perspectives?rgn=main;view=fulltext| title=Politics in a World of Civilizations: Long-term Perspectives on Relations between Peoples|author=Brett Bowden|publisher=''Human Figurations: Long-term Perspectives on the Human Condition'', Volume 1, Issue 2|date=July 2012|accessdate=August 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ISCSC holds an annual conference and publishes the journal ''[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]''.

==Brief history==
In October 1961, in Salzburg, Austria, an extraordinary group of scholars gathered to create the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations. Among the 26 founding members from Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, England, Russia, the United States, China and Japan were such luminaries as Pitirim Sorokin and Arnold Toynbee.  For six days, the participants debated such topics as the definition of “civilization,” problems in the analysis of complex cultures, civilizational encounters in the past, the Orient versus the Occident, problems of universal history, theories of historiography, and the role of the “human sciences” in “globalization.”  The meeting was funded by the Austrian government, in cooperation with UNESCO, and received considerable press coverage.  Sorokin was elected the Society’s first president.  After several meetings in Europe, the advancing age of its founding members and the declining health of then president, Othmar F. Anderle, were important factors in the decision to transfer the Society to the United States.   Between 1968 and 1970 Roger Williams Wescott of Drew University facilitated that transition.  In 1971, the first annual meeting of the ISCSC (US) was held in Philadelphia.  Important participants in that meeting and in the Society’s activities during the next years included Benjamin Nelson (the Society’s first American president), Roger Wescott, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, David Wilkinson, Rushton Coulborn and C.P. Wolf.  In 1974, the Salzburg branch was formally dissolved, and from that year to the present there has been only one International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC). 

	The presidents of the ISCSC are, in order: In Europe, Pitirim Sorokin and Othmar Anderle; in the United States, Benjamin Nelson, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, Michael Palencia-Roth, Roger Wescott, Shuntaro Ito (from Japan), Wayne Bledsoe, Lee Daniel Snyder, Andrew Targowski, David Rosner and the current president Toby Huff.  To date, the Society has held 46 meetings, most of them in the United States but also in Salzburg, Austria; Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic; Dublin, Ireland; Chiba, Japan; Frenchman’s Cove, Jamaica; St. Petersburg, Russia; Paris, France; New Brunswick, Canada; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  More than 30 countries are represented in the Society’s membership.  Its intellectual dynamism and vibrancy over the years have been maintained and enhanced through its annual meetings, its publications, and the participation of such scholars as Talcott Parsons, Hayden White, Immanuel Wallerstein, Gordon Hewes, André Gunder Frank, Marshall Sahlins, Lynn White Jr., and Jeremy Sabloff.  The Society is committed to the idea that complex civilizational problems can best be approached through multidisciplinary analyses and debate by scholars from a variety of fields.  The Comparative Civilizations Review, which welcomes submissions from the Society’s members as well as other scholars, has been published continually since its inaugural issue in 1979.

==Activities==
The ISCSC is a multidisciplinary scholarly organization that has connections with comparative studies programs throughout the world. The society holds an annual conference, often with the cooperation of other scholarly organizations based in the conference locale. One example of this is the 1998 conference held at [[Reitaku University]] in Japan together with the Japan Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations; the two organizations continue to have a close relationship.

The ISCSC publishes the bi-annual ''''Comparative Civilizations Review'''', a peer-reviewed journal. The blog Civilitas: https://civilitasblog.blogspot.com/ has been active since 2011.

'''International communication''' (also referred to as the ''[[study of global communication]]'' or '''transnational communication''') is the communication practice that occurs across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for international communication was due to the increasing effects and influences of globalization. As a field of study, international communication is a branch of [[communication studies]], concerned with the scope of "government-to-government", "business-to-business", and "people-to-people" interactions at a global level.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication "encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

===Communication and empire===
Efficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innis|first=H.|title=Empire and communications|year=1972|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S.|title=News and society in the Greek pols|year=1996|publisher=Duck worth|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voltmeter|first=Ingrid|title=International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The advent of telegraph and time–space compression===
{{see also|time space compression}}
In 1837, [[Samuel Morse]] invented [[telegraph]]. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

===The era of news agencies===
The newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, [[news agencies]] were established successively. [[The French Havas Agency]] was founded in 1835, the German agency [[Wolff]]in 1849 and the British [[Reuters]] in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
Western countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, [[the Radio Act of 1927]] confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]], which ran a global network to indoctrinate "American dream" to its international audience.

===Demanding a new communication order===
Since the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data – pictures, words, sounds – via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=D.K.|title=International Communication: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Hodder Education|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations for international communication ===
When communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.

As a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Robert. "Intercultural Business Communication". Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari &amp; Jackson, 1995; Cushner &amp; Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Robert|title=Intercultural Business Communication|url=http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/information/tesl-ej/ej33/r8.html|website=Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=16 November 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Douglas|title=International Communication|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913937|publisher=Journalism Quarterly|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.

== Scope and approaches of international communication research ==
International communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R.|title=Defining international communication as a field|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1992|issue=69|pages=543–553}}&lt;/ref&gt; International communication is 'a topic field rather than a discipline field' and international communication studies is a mode of 'organizing inquiry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=J.|title=Genealogical notes on "the field"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=132–139|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. H. Downing]] proposed ten categories within which international communication should be conducted
# [[theories of international communication]]
# [[core international communication processes]]
# [[global media firms]]
# [[global media policies]]
# [[Global news flow]]s
# [[world cinema]]
# [[development communication]]
# [[the Internet]]
# [[intellectual property law]]
# [[non-hegemonic communication flows]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downing|first=John D.

One of the most obvious manifestations of international communication are [[world news]], when the media of one country cover news from abroad. But, apart from journalism, international communication also occurs in other areas (culture, technology, sciences) and the nature of the "information" that is circulated can be classified in a wide variety of categories, such as cultural (music, films, sports, TV shows from one country to another), scientific (research papers published abroad, scientific exchange or cooperation), and intelligence (diplomacy reports, international espionage, etc.).

Typically the study of international communication includes a deep attention to the circulation of news among different countries (and the resulting imbalances, from which came the concept of [[news flow]]), the power of media organizations (such as [[media conglomerate|conglomerates]] and news agencies), issues such as [[cultural imperialism]] and [[media imperialism]], and the political role that international cooperation can have in enhancing the media industry (and society as a whole) in a given region, such as proposed by [[development communication]] or [[communication for development]].

Some renowned scholars in international communication include [[Wilbur Schramm]], [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Anthony Smith (producer)|Anthony Smith]], Robert Stevenson, [[Jeremy Tunstall]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]], Ali Mohammadi, [[Annabelle Sreberny]], [[Cees J. Hamelink]], [[Daya Kishan Thussu]] and [[Chris Paterson]]. The ''[[International Communication Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Journal of International Communication]]'' are reference journals in this field.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

__NOTOC__
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Irving-exy-1973.jpg|frame|right]] --&gt;
'''Irving McClure Johnson''' (July 4, 1905 &amp;ndash; January 2, 1991) was an American [[sail training]] pioneer, adventurer, lecturer, and author.

Johnson was born in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]], the fifth child of the author [[Clifton Johnson (author)|Clifton Johnson]] and Anna Tweed McQueston. Early home movies show him training for a life at sea, climbing a telephone pole in his backyard, and wrestling &amp; Jiu Jitsu to prepare for the inevitable fights he believed would occur due to his reading the novels of [[Jack London]] and [[Joseph Conrad]].

==Sailing==
Johnson became a professional sailor (joining the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] in 1926) working summers as crew and captain of various yachts including the "Charmian" for Newcomb Carlton (President of [[Western Union]].), which led to the opportunity to sail on the ''[[Peking (ship)|Peking]].''  He was an amateur filmmaker and his footage on the [[barque]] ''Peking'' in 1929 would become the now famous film ''Around Cape Horn''.

While serving as [[Shipmate|mate]] on board the ''Wanderbird'', Johnson met (Harriet) [[Electa Johnson|Electa "Exy" Search]] whom he married in 1932. The Johnsons [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world seven times on two vessels, both named ''Yankee'', each trip with a new crew and each taking approximately 18 months. The first ''Yankee'', bought in 1933, was a Dutch North Sea pilot schooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Westward Bound in the Schooner Yankee
|author=Captain and Mrs. Irving Johnson
|publisher=W.W.Norton, New York

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Before becoming an actor, [[Sterling Hayden]] served as mate aboard the first ''Yankee''.)&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Sterling.  ''Wanderer''.  New York:  W.W. Norton 1958&lt;/ref&gt;
The second ''[[Brigantine Yankee|Yankee]]'', bought in 1947, was a retired German North Sea pilot schooner which the Johnsons rerigged as a brigantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Yankee's Wander World
|author=Irving and Electa Johnson
|publisher=W.W.Norton, New York
|date=1949
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They then retired from circumnavigation and, in 1958-9, had the last ''Yankee'' built at Westhaven in Zaandam, the Netherlands. She was a steel ketch for sailing the inland waterways of Europe, designed by Irving Johnson and [[Olin Stephens]] of [[Sparkman &amp; Stephens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Yankee Sails Across Europe
|author=Irving and Electa Johnson
|publisher=W.W.Norton, New York |date=1962
|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Johnsons' voyages have been documented in their own books and many articles and videos produced by the [[National Geographic Society]] and others throughout their sailing career. With an amateur crew, they traveled hundreds of thousands of miles to the islands of the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South Pacific]], ports of call in Southeast Asia, around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and home to [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]] without incident 18 months later seven times.

==World War II==
Upon the urging of [[William Joseph Donovan|Bill Donovan]], then head of the predecessor to the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], Johnson joined the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], and was at Pearl Harbor on the day of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]]. His intimate knowledge of the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South Pacific]] made him a natural choice to advise the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] on the [[tide]]s, swells, [[Ocean current|currents]], depths and [[shoal]]s around the treacherous [[reef]]s and [[atoll]]s of the South Seas. He was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander, and joined the [[USS Sumner (AGS-5)|USS ''Sumner'']], finishing the war as her commanding officer. On board they created and printed five-color charts, scouted out potential harbours for US Navy vessels, and conducted underwater demolition to improve the suitability of some of the harbours. Johnson also dove on recently sunken Japanese vessels, searching for classified Japanese documents. One success was a chart of the minefields surrounding Japanese harbors.

==Ashore==
Much like his colleague [[Alan Villiers]], Johnson educated the public about the majestic age of sail throughout his life, personally narrating showings of ''Around Cape Horn'' on board the ''[[Peking (ship)|Peking]]'', docked at [[South Street Seaport]] in New York City from 1974-2016 and working with [[Mystic Seaport]] and the [[Sea Education Association]], serving as a trustee of both until his death in 1991.

The Los Angeles Maritime Institute has recently honored [[Irving Johnson (ship)|'''Irving''' and '''Exy''']] by naming their twin [[brigantine]]s for use in their award-winning Topsail Youth program after them.

The doyenne of modern sail training, Exy Johnson personally oversaw the [[Ship naming and launching#United States|christening]] ceremonies of the vessels whose construction she was instrumental in until her death in 2004.

Former crew members of their voyages include actor [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon]]. Dr. Sheldon's experience on board the ill-fated brigantine ''[[Albatross (1920 schooner)|Albatross]]'' served as the basis for the film ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'' (1996). Capt. Johnson also mentored yachtsman Jim Stoll, who became one of the directors of the [[Flint School]].

The '''Late Cretaceous''' (100.5–66 [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]) is the younger of two [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] into which the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] is divided in the [[geologic timescale]]. Rock strata from this epoch form the '''Upper Cretaceous''' [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. The Cretaceous is named after the white [[limestone]] known as [[chalk]] which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the [[White Cliffs of Dover|white cliffs of south-eastern England]], and which dates from this time.

==Climate==
During the Late Cretaceous, the climate was warmer than present, although throughout the period a cooling trend is evident.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; The tropics became restricted to equatorial regions and northern latitudes experienced markedly more seasonal climatic conditions.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:LateCretaceousMap.jpg|thumb|Map]]
Due to plate tectonics, the Americas were gradually moving westward, causing the Atlantic Ocean to expand. The [[Western Interior Seaway]] divided North America into eastern and western halves; [[Appalachia (Mesozoic)|Appalachia]] and [[Laramidia]].&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; India maintained a northward course towards Asia.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia and Antarctica seem to have remained connected and began to drift away from Africa and South America.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"&gt;"Dinosaurs Ruled the World: Late Cretaceous Period." In: Dodson, Peter &amp; Britt, Brooks &amp; Carpenter, Kenneth &amp; Forster, Catherine A. &amp; Gillette, David D. &amp; Norell, Mark A. &amp; Olshevsky, George &amp; Parrish, J. Michael &amp; Weishampel, David B. ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International, LTD. Pp. 103-104. {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe was an island chain.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; Populating some of these islands were endemic [[Insular dwarfism|dwarf]] dinosaur species.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt;

==Vertebrate fauna==

===Dinosaurs===
In the Late Cretaceous, the [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurs]], [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaurs]], and [[ceratopsia]]ns experienced success in [[Asiamerica]] (Western North America and eastern Asia). [[Tyrannosaur]]s dominated the large predator niche in North America.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; They were also present in Asia, although were usually smaller and more primitive than the North American varieties.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; [[Pachycephalosaur]]s were also present in both North America and Asia.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; [[Dromaeosaur]]s shared the same geographical distribution, and are well documented in both Mongolia and Western North America.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt; Additionally [[therizinosaur]]s (known previously as segnosaurs) appear to have been in North America and Asia. [[Gondwana]] held a very different dinosaurian fauna, with most predators being [[abelisaur]]s and [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurs]]; and [[titanosaur]]s being among the dominant herbivores.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt;
Spinosaurids were also present during this time. 
===Birds===
Birds became increasingly common and diverse, diversifying in a variety of [[Enantiornithes|enantiornithe]] and [[Ornithurae|ornithurine]] forms. Early [[Neornithes]] such as ''[[Vegavis]]'' co-existed with forms as bizarre as ''[[Yungavolucris]]'' and ''[[Avisaurus]]''. Though mostly small, marine [[Hesperornithes]] became relatively large and flightless, adapted to life in the open sea.

===Pterosaurs===
Though primarily represented by [[Azhdarchidae|azhdarchids]], other forms like [[Pteranodontidae|pteranodontids]], [[Tapejaridae|tapejarids]] (''[[Caiuajara]]'' and ''[[Bakonydraco]]''), [[Nyctosauridae|nyctosaurids]] and uncertain forms (''[[Piksi]]'', ''[[Navajodactylus]]'') are also present. Historically, it has been assumed that pterosaurs were in decline due to competition with birds, but it appears that neither group overlapped significantly ecologically, nor is it particularly evident that a true systematic decline was ever in place, especially with the discovery of smaller pterosaur species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prondvai E., Bodor E. R., Ösi A. | year = 2014 | title = Does morphology reflect osteohistology-based ontogeny? A case study of Late Cretaceous pterosaur jaw symphyses from Hungary reveals hidden taxonomic diversity | url = | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 288–321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals===
Several old mammal groups began to disappear, with the last [[eutriconodont]]s occurring in the [[Campanian]] of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/z69-196 | volume=47 | title=Studies of Late Cretaceous vertebrates. III. A triconodont mammal from Alberta | year=1969 | journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology | pages=1253–1256 | author=Fox Richard C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern hemisphere, [[cimolodont]], [[multituberculates]], [[metatheria]]ns and [[eutherian]]s were the dominant mammals, with the former two groups being the most common mammals in North America. In the southern hemisphere there was instead a more complex fauna of [[dryolestoid]]s, [[gondwanathere]]s and other multituberculates and basal [[eutherian]]s; [[monotreme]]s were presumably present, as was the last of the [[haramiyida]]ns, ''Avashishta''.

Mammals, though generally small, ranged into a variety of ecological niches, from carnivores ([[Deltatheroida]]), to mollusc-eater ([[Stagodontidae]]), to [[herbivores]] (multituberculates, ''[[Schowalteria]]'', [[Zhelestidae]] and [[Mesungulatidae]]) to highly atypical cursorial forms ([[Zalambdalestidae]], [[Brandoniidae]]).

True [[placental]]s only evolved at the very end of the epoch; the same can be said for true [[marsupial]]s. Instead, nearly all known eutherian and metatherian fossils belong to other groups.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/brv.12242 | title=Resolving the relationships of Paleocene placental mammals | year=2015 | journal=Biological Reviews | author=Halliday Thomas J. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine life===
In the seas, [[mosasaur]]s suddenly appeared and underwent a spectacular evolutionary radiation. Modern sharks also appeared and giant-penguin-like [[Polycotylidae|polycotylid]] [[plesiosaur]]s (3 meters long) and huge long-necked [[Elasmosauridae|elasmosaurs]] (13 meters long) also diversified. These predators fed on the numerous [[teleost]] fishes, which in turn evolved into new advanced and modern forms ([[Neoteleostei]]). [[Ichthyosaur]]s and [[pliosaur]]s, on the other hand, became extinct during the [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]].

==Flora==
Near the end of the Cretaceous Period, [[flowering plant]]s diversified. In temperate regions, familiar plants like [[magnolia]]s, [[sassafras]], [[rose]]s, [[redwood]]s, and [[willow]]s could be found in abundance.&lt;ref name="ageofdinosaurscretaceous"/&gt;

==Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction==
{{main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}
The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was a large-scale [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time, approximately {{Ma|Tertiary}} (Ma). It is widely known as the ''K–T extinction event'' and is associated with a geological signature, usually a thin band dated to that time and found in various parts of the world, known as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). ''K'' is the traditional abbreviation for the Cretaceous Period derived from the German name ''Kreidezeit'', and ''T'' is the abbreviation for the [[Tertiary]] Period (a historical term for the period of time now covered by the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods). The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.&lt;ref name="Fortey"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fortey R |title=Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth |publisher=Vintage |year=1999 |pages=238–260 |isbn=978-0375702617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tertiary" being no longer recognized as a formal time or rock unit by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], the K-T event is now called the Cretaceous—Paleogene (or K-Pg) extinction event by many researchers.

Non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]] [[fossils]] are only found below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary and became extinct immediately before or during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fastovsky DE, Sheehan PM |year=2005 |url=http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1130%2F1052-5173%282005%29015%3C4%3ATEOTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |title=The extinction of the dinosaurs in North America |journal=GSA Today |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=4–10 |accessdate=2007-05-18 |doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2005)015&lt;4:TEOTDI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209150342/http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1130%2F1052-5173%282005%29015%3C4%3ATEOTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |archivedate=2011-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A very small number of dinosaur fossils have been found above the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, but they have been explained as reworked fossils, that is, fossils that have been eroded from their original locations then preserved in later [[sedimentary]] layers.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sloan RE |author2=Rigby K |author3=Van Valen LM |author4=Gabriel Diane |year=1986 |title=Gradual dinosaur extinction and simultaneous ungulate radiation in the Hell Creek formation |journal=Science |volume=232 |issue=4750 |pages=629–633 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/232/4750/629 |doi= 10.1126/science.232.4750.629|accessdate=2007-05-18 |pmid=17781415|bibcode = 1986Sci...232..629S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fassett"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3139.pdf |format=PDF |title=Compelling new evidence for Paleocene dinosaurs in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone San Juan Basin, New Mexico and Colorado, USA |vauthors=Fassett JE, Lucas SG, Zielinski RA, Budahn JR |year=2001 |journal=International Conference on Catastrophic Events and Mass Extinctions: Impacts and Beyond, 9–12 July 2000, Vienna, Austria  |volume=1053 |pages=45–46 |accessdate=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sullivan RM |title=No Paleocene dinosaurs in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003RM/finalprogram/abstract_47695.htm |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=15 |year=2003 |accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s and many [[species]] of plants and [[invertebrate]]s also became extinct.  [[Mammals|Mammalian]] and bird [[clade]]s passed through the boundary with few extinctions, and [[evolutionary radiation]] from those [[Maastrichtian]] clades occurred well past the boundary.  Rates of extinction and radiation varied across different clades of organisms.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacLeod N, Rawson PF, Forey PL, Banner FT, Boudagher-Fadel MK, Bown PR, Burnett JA, Chambers, P, Culver S, Evans SE, Jeffery C, Kaminski MA, Lord AR, Milner AC, Milner AR, Morris N, Owen E, Rosen BR, Smith AB, Taylor PD, Urquhart E, Young JR |title=The Cretaceous–Tertiary biotic transition |year=1997 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=265–292 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3721/is_199703/ai_n8738406/print |doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.2.0265 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525151736/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3721/is_199703/ai_n8738406/print |archivedate=2013-05-25 |df= |bibcode=1997JGSoc.154..265M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have hypothesized that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinctions were caused by one or more catastrophic events such as massive [[impact event|asteroid impacts]] or increased [[volcano|volcanic activity]].  Several [[impact craters]] and massive volcanic activity in the [[Deccan Traps]] have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event. These geological events may have reduced sunlight and hindered [[photosynthesis]], leading to a massive disruption in Earth's [[ecology]].  Other researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in [[sea level]] or [[climate]].&lt;ref name="MacLeod"/&gt;

hold the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]. Magnolias are shrubs or trees which put on a showy display of tulip-like flowers, often scented, in early to late spring. Many are slow-growing and may take several years to start flowering. They are suitable for cultivation in parks or gardens in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions.&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M. stellata'' is suitable for smaller gardens.  All are [[deciduous]] except for ''M. grandiflora'', which is [[evergreen]]. The AGM citation includes a hardiness rating:&lt;ref name=RHSAGMHrating&gt;{{cite web|title=RHS hardiness rating|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/trials-awards/plant-awards/rhs-hardiness-rating|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=21 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of the plants listed here are rated H6 (hardy down to -20&amp;nbsp;°C to -15&amp;nbsp;°C) or H5 (hardy down to -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -10&amp;nbsp;°C). This is indicated in the column marked '''H'''. Nevertheless magnolias prefer a sheltered spot, and flower buds may be damaged by late frosts. The maximum size (height and spread) is shown in metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16149">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Arkansas''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 26, 2010, there were nine Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt; Six sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

[[File:Badwater elevation sign.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Badwater Basin]] in [[Death Valley]], [[California]], the nadir of the [[North America|North American Continent]]]]

In topography, a '''nadir''' is a point on a surface that is lower in [[elevation]] than all points immediately adjacent to it. [[Mathematics|Mathematically]], a nadir is a local [[Maxima and minima|minimum]] of elevation. A nadir may be the lowest point of a [[Depression (geology)|dry basin]] or [[Depression (geology)|depression]], or the deepest point of a [[body of water]] or [[Glacier|ice]]. The nadir of a body of water is often called a "deep", as in the [[Challenger Deep]], the nadir of the Earth's oceans.

The '''National Museum of Natural History''' ({{lang-lb|Nationalmusée fir Naturgeschicht}}, {{lang-fr|Musée national d'histoire naturelle}}) is a [[natural history museum]] in [[Luxembourg City]], in southern [[Luxembourg]].  The museum is located in the [[Grund, Luxembourg|Grund]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]] on the eastern bank of the [[Alzette]] river, next to the [[Neumünster Abbey]] cultural centre.

The museum is composed of eight separate scientific sections, spanning the [[natural science]]s: [[botany]], [[ecology]], [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]], [[geophysics]] and [[astrophysics]], [[paleontology|palaeontology]], [[vertebrate zoology]], and [[invertebrate]] zoology.

== History ==

The Society of the Natural Sciences was established in 1850, under the patronage of [[Prince William Frederick Henry of the Netherlands|Prince Henry]], the newly appointed Governor of Luxembourg representing [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]] [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]].&lt;ref name="Histoire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnhn.lu/naturmusee/historique.htm |title=Historique |accessdate=2006-12-24 |work= |publisher=Musée national d'histoire naturelle |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210090704/http://www.mnhn.lu/naturmusee/historique.htm |archivedate=2006-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The society's primary aim was the promotion of the [[natural sciences]] and [[natural history]] to the general population.  To achieve this, the government put at the society's disposal a section of the city Athenaeum, now the [[Bibliothèque nationale de Luxembourg|National Library]].  Opening its doors in 1854, this area hosted a number of cabinets displaying [[fossil]] specimens, spread across three rooms.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;  After almost four decades of this arrangement, pressure for display area caused the museum to move into its own premises, at the Vauban Barracks in [[Pfaffenthal]], in 1892.  However, these were criticised for being unattractive to visitors, hence undermining the museum's attempts to promote natural history to the general public.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;

In 1922, the museum moved once again.  The new site was the Old Gendarmerie, on the [[Fishmarket]], in the historic heart of Luxembourg City, which the museum shared with the [[National Museum of History and Art]].&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;  Purchased by the government, the building, along with a neighbouring house, were initially unsuitable for the housing of the museum, and the state embarked upon a renovation programme, during which time, the collections were closed to the general public, causing much public anger.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;  The renovations had almost been completed by the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but the [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|German occupation]] caused the museum to move again temporarily to protect its collections.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;  Despite the war, the building in Fishmarket was virtually undamaged, allowing the museum to re-occupy the premises immediately.  In 1946, a temporary installation was opened, marking the museum's return to its original purpose, thirty-four years after its closure.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;  By 1952, the last room had been opened, marking a return to normal operation.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;

It was in the decades following the war that the museum diversified away from its core activities, engaging in fields such as [[geophysics]] and [[astrophysics]]; such was the museum's commitment to these fields that it was the owner of the first [[electron microscope]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;  However, the expansion of the museum into these additional fields put added pressure on the space of the museum in Fishmarket, particularly as the National Museum of History and Art was also expanding.  After a decade-long search for a suitable new site,&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt; on 11 January 1990, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] agreed to restore Saint Jean's Hospice, in [[Grund, Luxembourg|Grund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1990/0021801/0021801.pdf#page2 | title=Mémorial A, 1990, No. 2 | accessdate=2006-12-24 | format=PDF | publisher=Service central de législation |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new site was opened in June 1996, spread across three buildings, each dedicated to a different aspect of the museum's functions: collection displays, teaching classrooms, and research laboratories.&lt;ref name="Histoire" /&gt;

The '''Neogene''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|n|iː|ə|ˌ|dʒ|iː|n}})&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Neogene}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Neogene}}&lt;/ref&gt; (informally '''Upper Tertiary''' or '''Late Tertiary''') is a [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|geologic period and system]] that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the [[Paleogene]] Period {{period end|Paleogene}} million years ago ([[annum|Mya]]) to the beginning of the present [[Quaternary]] Period {{period start|quaternary}} Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]s, the earlier [[Miocene]] and the later [[Pliocene]]. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the [[Quaternary]]. The term "Neogene" was coined in 1853 by the Austrian palaeontologist [[Moritz Hoernes|Moritz Hörnes]] (1815–1868).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hörnes |first1=Moritz |title=Mittheilungen an Professor Bronn gerichtet |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Mineralogie, Geognosie, Geologie und Petrefakten-kunde [New Yearbook for Mineralogy, Geognosy, Geology, and the Study of Fossils] |date=1853 |pages=806–810 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044106271273;view=1up;seq=828 |trans-title=Reports addressed to Professor Bronn |language=German|quote=From p. 806:  ''"Das häufige Vorkommen der Wiener Mollusken … im trennenden Gegensatze zu den eocänen zusammenzufassen."'' (The frequent occurrence of Viennese mollusks in typical Miocene as well as in typical Pliocene deposits motivated me – in order to avoid the perpetual monotony [of providing] details about the deposits – to subsume both deposits provisionally under the name "Neogene" (νεος new and γιγνομαι to arise) in distinguishing contrast to the Eocene.)|hdl=2027/hvd.32044106271273}} &lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s continued to evolve into roughly modern forms, while other groups of life remained relatively unchanged. Early [[hominid]]s, the ancestors of humans, appeared in Africa near the end of the period.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Some continental movement took place, the most significant event being the connection of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] at the [[Isthmus of Panama]], late in the Pliocene. This cut off the warm ocean currents from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, leaving only the [[Gulf Stream]] to transfer heat to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The global climate cooled considerably over the course of the Neogene, culminating in a series of continental [[Quaternary glaciation|glaciations]] in the [[Quaternary]] Period that follows.

==Divisions==
In ICS terminology, from upper (later, more recent) to lower (earlier):

The [[Pliocene]] Epoch is subdivided into 2 ages:

* [[Piacenzian]] Age, preceded by
* [[Zanclean]] Age

The [[Miocene]] Epoch is subdivided into 6 ages:
* [[Messinian]] Age, preceded by
* [[Tortonian]] Age
* [[Serravallian]] Age
* [[Langhian]] Age
* [[Burdigalian]] Age
* [[Aquitanian (stage)|Aquitanian]] Age
 
In different geophysical regions of the world, other regional names are also used for the same or overlapping ages and other timeline subdivisions.

The terms ''Neogene System'' (formal) and ''upper Tertiary System'' (informal) describe the rocks deposited during the ''Neogene Period''.

==Geography==

The continents in the Neogene were very close to their current positions. The [[Isthmus of Panama]] formed, connecting [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. The [[Indian subcontinent]] continued to collide with [[Asia]], forming the [[Himalayas]]. Sea levels fell, creating [[land bridge]]s between [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]] and between Eurasia and North America.

==Climate==
The global climate became seasonal and continued an overall drying and cooling trend which began at the start of the [[Paleogene]]. The ice caps on both poles began to grow and thicken, and by the end of the period the first of a series of glaciations of the [[Quaternary glaciation|current Ice Age]] began.

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Miocene.jpg|thumb|Scene featuring Miocene (Early Neogene) fauna]]
Marine and continental flora and fauna have a modern appearance. The reptile group [[Choristodera]] became extinct in the early part of the period, while the amphibians known as [[Albanerpetontidae|Allocaudata]] disappeared at the end. [[Mammal]]s and [[bird]]s continued to be the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, and took many forms as they adapted to various habitats. The first [[Hominini|hominin]]s, the ancestors of humans, may have appeared in southern Europe and migrated into Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-05-scientists-million-year-old-pre-human-balkans.html|title=Scientists find 7.2-million-year-old pre-human remains in the Balkans|website=Phys.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/9-7-million-year-old-teeth-fossils-raise-questions-about-human-origin|title=9.7 million-year-old teeth found in Germany resemble those of human ancestors in Africa|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the cooler, seasonal climate, tropical plant species gave way to [[deciduous]] ones and grasslands replaced many forests. Grasses therefore greatly diversified, and herbivorous mammals evolved alongside it, creating the many grazing animals of today such as [[horse]]s, [[antelope]], and [[bison]]. [[Eucalyptus]] fossil leaves occur in the [[Miocene]] of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but have been introduced from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mikepole.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/eucalyptus-fossils-in-new-zealand-the-thin-end-of-the-wedge/|title=Eucalyptus fossils in New Zealand - the thin end of the wedge - Mike Pole|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disagreements==
The Neogene traditionally ended at the end of the Pliocene Epoch, just before the older definition of the beginning of the [[Quaternary]] Period; many time scales show this division.

However, there was a movement amongst geologists (particularly [[marine geologist]]s) to also include ongoing geological time (Quaternary) in the Neogene, while others (particularly terrestrial geologists) insist the Quaternary to be a separate period of distinctly different record. The somewhat confusing terminology and disagreement amongst geologists on where to draw what hierarchical boundaries is due to the comparatively fine divisibility of time units as time approaches the present, and due to geological preservation that causes the youngest sedimentary geological record to be preserved over a much larger area and to reflect many more environments than the older geological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=M.E. |authorlink1=Tucker, M. E. |title=Sedimentary petrology : an introduction to the origin of sedimentary rocks |date=2001 |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Osney Nead, Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-632-05735-1 |edition=3rd |language=en|accessdate=21 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By dividing the [[Cenozoic]] Era into three (arguably two) periods ([[Paleogene]], Neogene, [[Quaternary]]) instead of seven epochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of periods in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras.

The [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) once proposed that the Quaternary be considered a sub-era (sub-erathem) of the Neogene, with a beginning date of 2.58 Ma, namely the start of the [[Gelasian|Gelasian Stage]].  In the 2004 proposal of the ICS, the Neogene would have consisted of the [[Miocene]] and  [[Pliocene]] epochs.&lt;ref&gt;Lourens, L., Hilgen, F., Shackleton, N.J., Laskar, J., Wilson, D., (2004) “The Neogene Period”. In: Gradstein, F., Ogg, J., Smith, A.G. (Eds.), ''Geologic Time Scale'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] (INQUA) counterproposed that the Neogene and the Pliocene end at 2.58 Ma, that the Gelasian be transferred to the Pleistocene, and the Quaternary be recognized as the third period in the Cenozoic, citing  key changes in Earth's climate, oceans, and biota that occurred 2.58 Ma and its correspondence to the [[Gauss-Matuyama reversal|Gauss-Matuyama magnetostratigraphic boundary]].&lt;ref name="INQUA-16-1"&gt;[http://www.inqua.tcd.ie/documents/QP%2016-1.pdf Clague, John ''et al.''

Following formal discussions at the 2008 International Geological Congress in Oslo, Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.33igc.org/coco/LayoutPage.aspx|title=Geoparks and Geotourism - Field Excursion of South America|website=33igc.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ICS decided in May 2009 to make the Quaternary the youngest period of the Cenozoic Era with its base at 2.58 Mya and including the Gelasian age, which was formerly considered part of the Neogene Period and Pliocene Epoch.&lt;ref name="ICS2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaternary.stratigraphy.org.uk/correlation/GSAchron09.jpg|title=See the 2009 version of the ICS geologic time scale|website=Quaternary.stratigraphy.org.uk|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Neogene Period ends bounding the succeeding Quaternary Period at 2.58 Mya.

[[File:KuroshioOyashio.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The North Pacific Current.]]

The '''North Pacific Current''' (sometimes referred to as the North Pacific Drift) is a slow warm water current that flows west-to-east between [[40th parallel north|30]] and [[50th parallel north|50 degrees north]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The current forms the southern part of the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre and the northern part of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The North Pacific Current is formed by the collision of the [[Kuroshio Current]], running northward off the coast of Japan, and the [[Oyashio Current]], which is a cold subarctic current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise along the western North Pacific Ocean. In the eastern North Pacific off southern [[British Columbia]], it splits into the southward flowing [[California Current]] and the northward flowing [[Alaska Current]].

==Flows &amp;                                            Temperature==

Originating from the eastward directed flow occurring east of the island of Honshu, Japan, the North Pacific Current extends over 40° of longitude. According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the NPC may be considered to be a part or an extension of the Kuroshio current. The current covers a large area and transports warmer water from the subtropics to the sub-polar latitudes. Average sea surface temperature along the NPC can range in the winter from 45-61°F (7.2-16.1°C) and in the summer months 64°F-74°F (17.8-23.3°C).

As it flows from west to east, the latitudinal extent of the NPC increases such that it spans some 20 degrees of latitude east of the dateline. This is associated with a decrease in the speed of current; eastward directed speeds at the surface are typically less than 0.05 m/s (5 cm/s) in the central Pacific. As the NPC approaches the west coast of North America, it divides into two broad currents: the northward flowing Alaska Current and the southward flowing California Current.This splitting of flow is referred to as the [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] of the NPC. 

The Gulf of Alaska and the California Current receive different volumes and flows of warm water from the North Pacific Current. The [[Gulf of Alaska]] receives about 60% of the flow of the NPC while the [[California Current]] receives the remaining 40%. These values may fluctuate, resulting in changes in the volume and the speed of the NPC water entering into the Alaska and California Currents.

==Gyre Contribution==

The NPC forms the northward portion of the [[North Pacific Subtropical Gyre]]. As the eastward extension of the Kuroshio, the westward flow of the NPC can lead to the transport of material from the western Pacific to the coast of North America. For example, some of the marine debris from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011 was transported by the NPC across the Pacific, leading to deposition of tsunami debris along the shores of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.

'''Oceanic and Atmospheric Research''' ('''OAR''') is a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  OAR is also referred to as '''NOAA Research'''.

NOAA Research is the research and development arm of NOAA and is the driving force behind NOAA [[Natural environment|environmental]] products and services aimed at protecting life and property and promoting sustainable economic growth. [[Research]], conducted by programs within NOAA and through collaborations outside NOAA, focuses on enhancing the understanding of environmental phenomena such as [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s, [[climate]] variability, changes in the [[ozone layer]], [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño/La Niña]] events, [[Fishery|fisheries]] productivity, [[ocean current]]s, deep sea [[thermal vent]]s, and [[Coastal ecosystems|coastal ecosystem]] health. 

The origins of NOAA Research date back more than 200 years with the creation of the Survey of the Coast in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson. The Coast Survey, which became the U.S. Lake Survey office in 1841, was developed to undertake "a hydrographic survey of northwestern [Great] lakes." Research executed by the scientists of this group was innovative and holistic: the first current meters were developed to understand water flow rates, and forecasting techniques were greatly enhanced to predict water levels and the relationship to  lakefront property. The same traits of world class, long-term research continue to define NOAA Research today.

The science and technology that NOAA Research produces is not only relevant to society, it anticipates and responds to partners’ needs to demonstrates the value of technologies so that partners can deploy them into their applications. OAR works with end-users to integrate mature technologies (and associated expertise) into larger systems, either in NOAA operations or partner applications, via testbeds, patents, etc.

==Organization==
NOAA Research is an open research network consisting of seven federal research laboratories, six program offices, sixteen Cooperative Institutes (which are non-federal, non-profit research institutions in 5-10 year collaborative partnerships with NOAA), and 33 university based Sea Grant programs. OAR also relies on work performed at numerous public, private, and academic institutions. Through its laboratories, programs, and external partners, OAR seeks to balance the activities that benefit from the long-term, dedicated capabilities of federal facilities with those that require the diverse expertise of our university partners.

The components and programs of NOAA Research are:
* 7 NOAA [[Laboratory|laboratories]]
* [http://ci.noaa.gov/ 16 Cooperative Institutes]
* [http://cpo.noaa.gov/ NOAA Climate Program Office]
* [http://owaq.noaa.gov/ Office of Weather and Air Quality]
* [[Office of Ocean Exploration|NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research]]
* [[National Sea Grant Program|NOAA National Sea Grant Program]]

==What NOAA Research does==
Working under the broad themes of Climate, [[Atmosphere]], and Oceans, NOAA scientists study the ocean's depths and the highest reaches of [[Outer space|space]]. NOAA's long-term commitment to conducting preeminent research includes engaging in-house and external talent to: 
* Continue to conduct [[experiment]]s to understand natural processes (physical, geochemical, ecological) 
* Build predictive models for use in [[weather]], climate, [[Sun|solar]], ocean, and coastal assessments and [[prediction]]s.
* Develop and deploy new observing technologies to provide data to support predictive models and to document natural variability.
* Develop new analytical and forecast tools to improve weather services and earlier warnings for [[natural disaster]]s.
* Use new [[information technology]] to share information with other federal and academic scientists.
* Prepare scientific assessments and information products to enhance [[public education]] and guide [[government]]al action. 
Research plans and products are developed in partnership with [[academia]] and other [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], and are peer-reviewed and widely distributed. A high premium is placed on external collaboration both domestically and internationally.

NOAA Research has three primary research areas: Climate, Weather and Air Chemistry, and Oceans, Coasts &amp; the Great Lakes.

===Climate Research===
NOAA's research laboratories, the Climate Program Office, and research partners conduct research into complex [[climate system]]s and how they work. The aim of this research is to predict climate variation in the shorter term, for example, cold spells or periods of [[drought]], and over longer terms, such as centuries and beyond.

NOAA scientists are at the forefront of studying climate change and modeling what the effects will be on the Earth. Researchers at NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have developed the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) to enable a valid assessment of the impact of how [[climate change]] might affect the climate and [[ecology]] of the [[Great Lakes]]. The CHARM model provides a realistic surface-atmosphere feedback portrayal, and accounts for runoff from land surfaces. It allows researchers to predict that [[global warming]] likely will bring higher [[temperature]]s and increased [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to the Great Lakes. Development of a second generation of CHARM is underway to help answer questions about [[greenhouse warming]] effects on Great Lakes water quantity.

NOAA researchers closely monitor the Earth's atmosphere searching for clues about long-term changes in the global climate. The data collected worldwide by NOAA researchers contributes to the understanding of complex climatic systems and the ability to forecast changes.

===Weather and Air Chemistry Research===
NOAA Research organizations conduct research on the upper and lower atmosphere as well as the space environment. Their findings form the basis for NOAA's contributions to major national and international environmental programs and agreements.

For instance, improvements in forecast and warning services provided by the National Weather Service are a direct result of NOAA research.  Improvements in numerical modeling, observations gathered by satellites and Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD), and sophisticated weather warning and information processing and communications systems, have collectively led to significantly improved severe weather forecasts and warnings.

Other research programs focus on observation and study of the chemical and physical processes of the atmosphere, detecting the effects of pollution on those processes and monitoring and forecasting the phenomena affecting the Sun-Earth environment.

===Oceans, Coasts &amp; the Great Lakes Research===
NOAA Research, in cooperation with its research partners, explores and investigates ocean habitats and resources. The findings of NOAA researchers contribute to the management of fisheries, conservation of coastlines, and development of a stronger economy through marine products and businesses, such as biotechnology and sustainable aquaculture.

NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in [[Seattle, Washington]], designed Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART-II) technology, which provides two-way communication capabilities, allowing engineers the ability to troubleshoot these systems from the lab and repair them remotely when possible. This capability minimizes system downtime, especially in the harsh winter conditions of the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]], and reduces costs by not having to deploy a ship to make repairs.

==Benefits of NOAA Research==
Most environmental questions are not easily answered. NOAA is committed to tackling the complex issues that only advanced scientific knowledge can adequately address. NOAA Research seeks to:
* Provide comprehensive knowledge to guide national environmental policy decisions, including better predictions of the climate response to emissions changes, choices for protection of the ozone layer, and alternatives for developing coastal communities; 
* Improve environmental services to the nation, including reliable predictions and assessments; and
* Promote economic growth through science for decision-making, new technology, and partnerships with academia and industry.

==NOAA Research laboratories==
The 7 laboratories that are part of NOAA Research are located throughout the United States near their areas of focus.

* [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] (AOML) - [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida|FL]]
* [[Air Resources Laboratory]] (ARL) - [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland|MD]]

* [[Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory]] (PMEL) - [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|WA]] and [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]], [[Oregon|OR]]

The NOAA Research Laboratories conduct an integrated program of research, technology development, and services to improve the understanding of Earth's atmosphere, oceans and inland waters, and to describe and predict changes occurring to them. The laboratories and their field stations are located across the country and around the world.

The laboratories have established formal collaborative agreements with universities/non-profit research institutions to form joint research institutes that are centers of scientific excellence pertaining to the earth's oceans, inland waters, intermountain west, atmosphere, and arctic environment.

Scientific reviews are conducted every five years to evaluate the quality, relevance, and performance of research conducted at the OAR laboratories. These reviews help to strategically position laboratories in their planning of future science and are intended to ensure that OAR laboratory research is linked to the NOAA Next Generation Strategic Plan, remains relevant to the NOAA research mission and its priorities, and is consistent with NOAA planning, programming, and budgeting processes.

In [[physics]], '''photon-induced electric field poling''' is a phenomenon whereby a pattern of local electric field orientations can be encoded in a suitable [[ferroelectric material]], such as [[perovskite]]. The resulting encoded material is conceptually similar to the pattern of magnetic field orientations within the magnetic domains of a [[ferromagnet]], and thus may be considered as a possible technology for [[computer storage]] media.  The encoded regions are optically active (have a varying [[index of refraction]]) and thus may be "read out" optically.

==Encoding process==
The encoding process proceeds by application of [[ultraviolet]] light tuned to the [[absorption band]] associated with the transition of electrons from the [[valence band]] to the  [[conduction band]]. During UV application, an external [[electric field]] is used to modify the electric [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] of regions of the ferroelectric material that are exposed to UV light. By this process, a pattern of local electric field orientations can be encoded.

Technically, the encoding effect proceeds by the creation of a [[population inversion]] between the valence and conduction bands, with the resulting creation of [[plasmon]]s. During this time, [[ferroelectric]] [[perovskite]] materials can be forced to change geometry by the application of an electric field. The encoded regions become optically active due to the [[Pockels effect]].

==Decoding process==
The pattern of ferroelectric domain orientations can be read out optically. The [[refractive index]] of the ferroelectric material at wavelengths from near-[[infrared]] through to near-ultraviolet is affected by the electric field within the material. A changing pattern of electric field domains within a ferroelectric substrate results in different regions of the substrate having different refractive indices. Under these conditions, the substrate behaves as a [[diffraction grating]], allowing the pattern of domains to be inferred from the [[interference pattern]] present in the transmitted readout beam.

The '''pulse vaccination strategy''' is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk, over a defined age range, until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped. It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Nokes, DJ., Swinton, J.

== Mathematical model ==
Where T= time units is a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects vaccinated in a relatively short time. This yields the differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects as
:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N  - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S, S(n T^+) = (1-p) S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = - \mu V,   V(n T^+) = V(n T^-) + p S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Blowing The Shofar on Rosh Hashanah (4974050267).jpg|thumbnail|Blowing the shofar]]
A '''shofar''' (pron. {{IPAc-en|ʃ|oʊ|ˈ|f|ɑr}}, from {{lang-he-a|שׁוֹפָר|Shofar.ogg|link=yes}}, {{IPA-he|ʃoˈfaʁ|pron}}) is an ancient musical [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] typically made of a [[Ram (sheep)|ram]]'s [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], used for [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious purposes. Like the modern [[bugle]], the shofar lacks [[pitch (music)|pitch]]-altering devices, with all pitch control done by varying the player's [[embouchure]]. The shofar is blown in [[synagogue]] services on [[Rosh Hashanah]] and at the very end of [[Yom Kippur]], and is also blown every weekday morning in the month of [[Elul]] running up to Rosh Hashanah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jewish prayer-book|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00662/127 |publisher=Cambridge Digital Library |access-date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shofars come in a variety of sizes and shapes, depending on the choice of animal and level of finish.

== Bible and rabbinic literature ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:AlphonseLévy Shofar.jpg|left|thumb|Shofar (by {{ill|Alphonse Lévy|fr}} Caption says: "To a good year"]]
The shofar is mentioned frequently in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]] and [[rabbinic literature]]. In the first instance, in {{bibleverse|Exodus|19|16}}, the blast of a shofar emanating from the thick cloud on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] makes the [[Israelites]] tremble in awe.

The shofar was used to announce the new moon&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 81:3 (4)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee year]].&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 25:9&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of the seventh month ([[Tishrei]]) is termed "a memorial of blowing",&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 23:24&lt;/ref&gt; or "a day of blowing",&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 29:1&lt;/ref&gt; the shofar. They were used for signifying the start of a war.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 6:4; Judges 3:27; 7:16, 20; 1 Samuel. 8:3&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they were also employed in processions&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 6:15; 1 Chronicles 15:28&lt;/ref&gt; as musical accompaniment,&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 98:6; compare Psalm 47:5&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually were inserted into the temple orchestra by [[David]].&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 150:3&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the "trumpets" described in Numbers 10 are a different instrument, described by the Hebrew word for 'trumpet' ({{lang-he|חצוצרה|ḥaṣoṣrah}}), not {{transl|he|shofar}} ({{lang-he|שופר}}).

The [[Torah]] describes the first day of the seventh month (the first of Tishrei, or Rosh Hashanah) as a ''zikron teruˁah'' ({{lang-he|זכרון תרועה||memorial of blowing}}; Lev. 23:24) and as a ''yom teruˁah'' ({{lang-he|יום תרועה||day of blowing}}; Num. 29). This was interpreted by the Jewish sages as referring to the blowing of the shofar.

In the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the shofar was sometimes used together with the [[trumpet]]. On New Year's Day the principal ceremony was conducted with the shofar, which instrument was placed in the center with a trumpet on either side; it was the horn of a [[wild goat]] and straight in shape, being ornamented with gold at the [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]. On fast days the principal ceremony was conducted with the trumpets in the center and with a shofar on either side. On those occasions the shofarot were [[Domestic Sheep|rams']] horns curved in shape and ornamented with silver at the mouthpieces. On Yom Kippur of the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|jubilee year]] the ceremony was performed with the shofar as on New Year's Day.

On Rosh Hashanah and other full holidays ([[Day of Atonement]], [[Sukkot]], [[Passover]] and the [[Feast of Weeks]]) a single priest perfected two sacrifices in honor of the full holiday. On Rosh Hashanah, something special occurred during the special sacrifice. Arguably two Shofar sounders played the long notes and one trumpet player played the short note. Accordingly, Rosh Hashanah is called Yom Teruah (the day of the blast). Otherwise, the trumpets had "top billing". Rosh Hashanah 27a, supports this claim: "Said Raba or it may have been R. Joshua B. Levi: What is the scriptural warrant for this? – Because it is written, 'With trumpets and the sound of the Shofar shout ye before the King in the Temple, we require trumpets and the sound of the Shofar; elsewhere not.'"&lt;ref&gt;Sidney B. Hoenig, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1453499 Origins of the Rosh Hashanah Liturgy]", ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', New Series, Vol. 57, ''The Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Volume of the Jewish Quarterly Review'' (1967), pp.&amp;nbsp;312–331. • Published by University of Pennsylvania Press. Accessed 31 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, on Yom Kippur, the Shofar was sounded to announce the [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee Year]] (every 50 years, Jews were granted forgiveness, debts were forgiven, indentured Israelites were granted freedom, and the fields "shall become owned by the priests". Shofar first indicated in Yovel (Jubilee Year—Lev. 25:8–13). Indeed, in Rosh Hashanah 33b, the sages ask why the Shofar sounded in Jubilee year. Rosh Hashanah 29a indicates that in ordinary years both Shofars and trumpets are sounded, but in the Jubilee Year only the Shofar blasts. The Rabbi's created the practice of the Shofar's sounding every Yom Kippur rather than just on the Jubilee Year (once in 50 years).

Otherwise, for all other special days, the Shofar is sounded shorter and two special silver Trumpets announced the sacrifice. When the trumpets sound the signal, all the people who were within the sacrifice prostrate themselves, stretching out flat, face down and on the ground.

The shofar was blown in the times of [[Joshua]] to help him capture [[Jericho]]. As they surrounded the walls, the shofar was blown and the Jews were able to capture the city. The shofar was commonly taken out to war so the troops would know when a battle would begin. The person who would blow the shofar would call out to the troops from atop a hill. All of the troops were able to hear the call of the shofar from their position because of its distinct sound.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Post-Biblical times ===
[[File:Old Jerusalem Yochanan ben Zakai Synagogue Oil and Shofar for the Messiah.jpg|thumb|Old Jerusalem [[Yochanan ben Zakkai]] synagogue—A flask of oil and a shofar for the anointing of the eagerly-awaited [[Mashiach]].&lt;ref&gt;It has been said that when the mashiach comes, the Sephardic community will be ready to anoint him and blow the shofar to announce his arrival. Legend has it there is a tunnel from under the Yohanan Ben Zakkai synagogue that leads directly to the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At the inception of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], during the short-lived ban on playing musical instruments, the shofar was enhanced in its use, as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the temple. The declaration of the ban's source was in fact set to music itself as the lamentation "Al Naharoth Bavel" within a few centuries of the ban. (A full orchestra played in the temple. The ban was so that this would not be taken for granted, hence the wording of the ban, "if I forget thee O Jerusalem, over my chiefest joy...".) The shofar continues to announce the Jewish year,&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 128:2&lt;/ref&gt; and the sighting of the new moon,&lt;ref&gt;Arakhin 11a–b; Shabbos 35&lt;/ref&gt; to introduce [[Shabbat]],&lt;ref&gt;Shabbos 35&lt;/ref&gt; to carry out the commandment to sound it on [[Rosh Hashanah]], and to mark the end of the day of fasting on Yom Kippur, once the services have been completed in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 133:26&lt;/ref&gt; Secular uses have been discarded (see a notable exception in a section [[#National liberation|further down]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Kaplan Eisenstein]], ''Heritage of Music'', New York: UAHC, 1972, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shofar is primarily associated with Rosh Hashanah; indeed, Rosh Hashanah is called {{transl|he|Yom Teruah}} (or {{transl|he|Yom T'ruah}} 'day of the shofar blast'). In the [[Mishnah]] (book of early rabbinic laws derived from the [[Torah]]), a discussion centers on the primacy of the shofar in the time before the [[destruction of the second temple]] (70 CE). Indeed, the shofar was the center of the ceremony, with two silver trumpets playing a lesser role. On other solemn holidays, fasts, and new moon celebrations, two silver trumpets were featured, with one shofar playing a lesser role. The shofar is also associated with the [[Jubilee (biblical)|jubilee year]] in which, every fifty years, Jewish law provided for the release of all slaves, land, and debts. The sound of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah announced the jubilee year, and the sound of the shofar on Yom Kippur proclaimed the actual release of financial encumbrances.

The [[halakha]] (Jewish law) rules that the shofar may not be sounded on Shabbat, due to the potential that the {{transl|he|ba'al tekiah}} (shofar sounder) may inadvertently carry it, which is in a class of forbidden Shabbat work.&lt;ref&gt;Rosh Hashanah 29b&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Israel, the shofar was sounded on Shabbat in the temple located in Jerusalem. After the temple's destruction, the sounding of the shofar on Shabbat was restricted to the place where the great [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish legislature and court from 400 BCE to 100 CE) was located. However, when the Sanhedrin ceased to exist, the sounding of the shofar on Shabbat was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Kieval, ''The High Holy Days'', p.&amp;nbsp;114&lt;/ref&gt;

According to rabbinic literature, the shofar says, "Awake, sleepers from your sleep, and slumberers arise from your slumber!"&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 3:4, via – {{cite web |url= http://www.divreinavon.com/pdf/Anticipation_Consummation.pdf |title=Anticipation and Consummation: a Perspective on the Shofar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mitzvah ===
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - “Slichot” Prayer (2).jpg|thumb|right|Jewish "[[Slichot]]" prayer service with shofar during the Days of Repentance preceding [[Yom Kippur]] at the [[Western Wall]] in Jerusalem's Old City, 2008.]]
The Sages indicated that the [[mitzvah]] was to hear the sounds of the shofar. They went so far as to consider a shofar blown into a pit or cave and to decide whether a person who hears the original sound or the echo has fulfilled the mitzvah. Mishnah (Rosh Hashanah 27b). The Shulchan Aruch sums up that if the hearer hears the reverberation, the mitzvah is not valid. However, if the listener perceives the direct sounds, he fulfils the mitzvah.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Berurah 587:1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, most modern halakhic authorities hold that hearing a shofar on the radio or the Internet would not be valid to satisfy the mitzvah because "electronically reproduced sounds do not suffice for mitzvot that require hearing a specific natural sound.... However, one should consult a competent rabbi if an unusually pressing situation arises, as some authorities believe that performing mitzvot through electronically reproduced sound is preferable to not performing them at all."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080511204358/http://www.yasharbooks.com/grayexcerpt2.pdf "Fulfilling Mitzvot Through Electronic Hearing Devices"], Chaim Jachter and Ezra Frazer, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155806/http://www.yasharbooks.com/Gray.html Gray Matter volume 2] pp.&amp;nbsp;237–244. {{ISBN|1-933143-10-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[halakha|Jewish law]] women and minors are exempt from the commandment of hearing the shofar blown (as is the case with any positive, time-bound commandment), but they are encouraged to attend the ceremony.

If the {{transl|he|ba'al tekiah}} (shofar sounder) blows with the intention that all who hear will perform the mitzvah, then anyone listening—even someone passing by—who intends to hear the Shofar can perform the mitzvah because the community blower blows for everybody. If the listener stands still, it is presumed he intends to hear.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Berurah 590:9&lt;/ref&gt; If one hears the blast but with no intention of fulfilling the mitzvah, then the mitzvah has not been fulfilled.

=== Qualifications ===
[[File:Shofar for the Sabbath from the Matson Collection, ca. 1934-39 (LOC).jpg|thumbnail|Yemenite Jew blowing the shofar, late 1930's]]
The expert who blows (or "blasts" or "sounds") the shofar is termed the {{transl|he|ba'al tokeah}} or {{transl|he|ba'al tekiah}} (lit. "master of the blast"). Being a {{transl|he|ba'al tekiah}} is an honor. Every male Jew is eligible for this sacred office, providing he is acceptable to the congregation. The one who blows the shofar on Rosh Hashanah should be learned in the Torah and shall be God-fearing.

The Shulchan Aruch discusses who is fit to blow the shofar on behalf of a congregation:
* Anyone not obligated to fulfill the mitzvah of sounding the shofar cannot fulfill the commandment for (cover) another whose duty it is to perform the mitzvah.
* Although a woman (who is exempt from this mitzvah because it is time bound) may not blow the shofar for men (whose duty it is to perform the mitzvah), a woman may intone the shofar for herself and other women. Similarly, she may say a blessing over the mitzvah even though it is not mandatory (the requisite blessing contains the words "asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu", "who sanctified us with His commandments [mitzvot] and commanded us to ...", but women are not commanded in this mitzvah).
* Only a freeman (not even a slave who will become free in the next month) can be a Ba'al Tekiah.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 589:1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shape and material ==

=== Choice of animal ===
According to the Talmud, a shofar may be made from the horn of any animal from the [[Bovidae]] family except that of a cow,&lt;ref&gt;Rosh Hashanah, 26a&lt;/ref&gt; although a ram is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Berurah 586:1&lt;/ref&gt; Bovidae horns are made of a layer of [[keratin]] (the same material as human toenails and fingernails) around a core of bone, with a layer of cartilage in between, which can be removed to leave the hollow keratin horn. An [[antler]], on the other hand, is made of solid bone, so an antler cannot be used as a shofar because it cannot be hollowed out.

There is no requirement for ritual slaughter (shechita), and theoretically, the horn can come from a non-kosher animal because under most, but not all, interpretations of Jewish law the shofar is not required to be {{transl|he|muttar be-fikha}} ('permissible in your mouth'); the [[mitzvah]] is hearing the shofar, not eating the animal it came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navon|first1=Mois|title=The Ḥillazon and the Principle of "Muttar be-Fikha"|journal=The Torah u-Madda Journal|date=2001|volume=10/2001|pages=142–162|url=http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU10_Navon.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2016}} ''see pages 147-148 ff.''&lt;/ref&gt; The shofar falls into the category of {{transl|he|tashmishei mitzvah}} – objects used to perform a mitzvah that do not themselves have inherent holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Megillah 26b&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because horn is always inedible, it is considered {{transl|he|afra be-alma}} ('mere dust') and not an unkosher substance.&lt;ref&gt;Avot 67b&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elef Hamagen (586:5) delineates the order of preference: 1) curved ram; 2) curved other sheep; 3) curved other animal; 4) straight—ram or otherwise; 5) non-kosher animal; 6) cow. The first four categories are used with a ''bracha'' (blessing), the fifth without a ''bracha'', and the last, not at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Elef Hamagen'', Rabbi Shemarya Hakreti, edited by Aharon Erand, Jerusalem: Mekitzei Nirdamim, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Construction ===
In practice two species are generally used: the [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sefardi]] shofar is made from the horn of a domestic [[sheep|ram]], while a [[Yemenite Jews|Yemeni]] shofar is made from the horn of a [[Greater Kudu|kudu]]. A Moroccan shofar is flat, with a single, broad curve.
A crack or hole in the shofar affecting the sound renders it unfit for ceremonial use. A shofar may not be painted in colors, but it may be carved with artistic designs ([[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Orach Chayim]], 586, 17). Shofars (especially the Sephardi shofars) are sometimes plated with silver across part of their length for display purposes, although this invalidates them for use in religious practices.

The horn is flattened and shaped by the application of heat, which softens it. A hole is made from the tip of the horn to the natural hollow inside. It is played much like a European [[brass instrument]], with the player blowing through the hole, causing the air column inside to vibrate. [[Sephardi]] shofars usually have a carved mouthpiece resembling that of a European [[trumpet]] or [[French horn]], but smaller. Ashkenazi shofars do not.

Because the hollow of the shofar is irregular in shape, the [[harmonic]]s obtained when playing the instrument can vary: rather than a pure perfect fifth, [[interval (music)|intervals]] as narrow as a fourth, or as wide as a sixth may be produced.

== Sounds ==

=== Foundations in Talmud and Torah ===
The ''tekiah'' ({{rtl-lang|he|תקיעה}}) and ''teruah'' ({{rtl-lang|he|תרועה}}) sounds mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] were respectively [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[Treble (sound)|treble]].{{speculation inline}} The ''tekiah'' (or ''t'kiah'' or ''t'qiah'') was a plain, deep sound, ending abruptly; the ''teruah'' (or ''t'ruah''), a [[trill (music)|trill]] between two tekiahs. These two sounds, constituting a single unit of shofar sounding, were rendered three times during a service added specially for [[Rosh HaShanah]]: first in honor of [[God]]'s kingship (''malchiyot'' or ''malchuyot'')); next to recall the [[Binding of Isaac]], in order to cause the congregation to be remembered before [[God]] (zichronot); and a third time to comply with the precept regarding the shofar (shofrot).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The word ''teruah'' (a broken sound) appears three times in the Bible in the context of the shofar, from which the Talmud&lt;ref name="Rosh Hashanah 34a"&gt;Rosh Hashanah 34a&lt;/ref&gt; derives the rule that three such sounds must be made. In addition, other verses connect the word ''tekiah'' (an unbroken sound) to teruah twice, thus leading the Talmud to rule that each ''teruah'' must be preceded and followed by a ''tekiah'', leading to a total of nine blasts (''tekiah-teruah-tekiah'' three times).

Over time doubts arose as to the correct sound of the teruah. The [[Talmud]] is uncertain whether it means a moaning/groaning or a [[staccato]] beat sound.&lt;ref name="Rosh Hashanah 34a"/&gt; A system of three sounds was therefore devised to account for all the possibilities:
* ''Shevarim'' (or ''sh'varim'') ({{rtl-lang|he|שברים}}) is composed of three connected short sounds.
* ''Teruah'' is a series of nine very short notes divided into three disconnected or broken sequences of three notes each. The nine notes of the teruah is equal the three notes of the shevarim in duration.
* ''Tekiah'' is slightly longer than the length of either the shevarim or the teruah.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Berurah 590:13&lt;/ref&gt;

The doubt as to the nature of the Biblical teruah, whether it was simply a broken moan (shevarim), a staccato (teruah) or both (shevarim-teruah), necessitates three near-repetitions to make sure of securing the correct sound. The sequence of the [[shofar blowing]] is thus:
# Tekiah, shevarim-teruah, tekiah
# Tekiah, shevarim, tekiah
# Tekiah, teruah, and then a final blast of tekiah gedolah, which means "big tekiah", held as long as possible.

This series is also known by its acronyms: ''[[Shofar blowing#Three series|TaShRaT, TaShaT, TaRaT]],'' respectively.

When blowing the ''shevarim-teruah'', the ''tekiah'' is lengthened to be slightly longer than the duration of the ''shevarim'' and the ''teruah'' together.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah Berurah 590:14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 129:13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opinions require trebling the series, based on the mention of ''teruah'' three times in connection with the seventh month (Lev. xxiii, xxv; Num. xxix), and also on the above-mentioned division of the service into ''malchiyot'', ''zichronot'', and ''shofarot''.

To fulfill all of the opinions and criteria above, a total of thirty blasts are sounded, the minimum number required today:
* Tashrat three times, yielding twelve blasts
* Tashat three times, yielding nine
* Tarat three times, yielding nine

Alternatively, although fewer opinions are satisfied, some communities sound a single series of ''tashrat-tashat-tarat'' without trebling. This may also fulfill the required total of thirty blasts, if tekiah is counted as one note, shevarim three, and teruah nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shofar-Call to Action |publisher=Chabad |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4837/jewish/Shofar.htm |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, all halachic authorities&lt;ref&gt;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 129:17, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; teach that one should follow one's community's custom.

=== Modern practice ===
[[File:The National Library of Israel - Shofar Prayer, Ashkenazi version - 1785188 SHOFAR78.ogg|thumb|right|Shofar sound for Rosh Hashana, Ashkenaz version]]
It is customary to hear 100 or 101 sounds in the synagogue, although the minimum requirement is to hear 30 sounds.

The shofar is sounded just before, during and after the [[Musaf]] prayer on [[Rosh Hashanah]]. For the sounding just before Musaf, after the Torah reading, relevant verses from the Bible are recited, followed by two blessings: one on the Biblical commandment of "hearing the sound of the shofar" and the blessing of [[Shehecheyanu]]. After that, thirty shofar blasts are sounded. In the [[Musaf]] prayer itself, the shofar is sounded three times during the silent prayer, and then again three times during the leader's repetition. For each of these soundings, ten appropriate selections from the Bible are recited, followed by a benediction, followed finally by a series of ten shofar blasts. After leader's repetition of the Musaf prayer is completed, a final series of ten (or eleven, depending on the community's custom) shofar blasts are sounded, yielding a total of 100 or 101 blasts. (Some communities do not blow the shofar during the silent Musaf prayer, instead blowing the 30 blasts after the leader's repetition.) After the service is over, it is customary to blow another series of thirty blasts "to confuse the [[Satan]]".
 
According to the Sephardic tradition, a full 101 blasts are sounded, corresponding to the 100 cries of the [[mother of Sisera]], the captain of [[Jabin]]'s army who did not return home after being killed by [[Yael]] (Judges 5:28). One cry is added to symbolize the legitimate love of a mother mourning her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kitov |first=Eliyahu |title=One Hundred Sounds |publisher=Chabad.org |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4387/jewish/100-Sounds.htm |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur L. Finkle, ''Shofar: History, Technique and Jewish Law'', (Saarbrücken, Germany: Hadassah Word Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in modern times ==

=== Religion ===
The shofar is used mainly on [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]. It is blown in [[synagogue]]s to mark the end of the fast at Yom Kippur, and blown at four particular occasions in the prayers on Rosh Hashanah. Because of its inherent ties to the Days of Repentance and the inspiration that comes along with hearing its piercing blasts, the shofar is also blown after morning services for the entire month of [[Elul]], the last month of the Jewish civil year and the sixth of the Jewish ecclesiastical year. It is not blown on the last day of month, however, to mark the difference between the voluntary blasts of the month and the mandatory blasts of the holiday. Shofar blasts are also used during penitential rituals such as [[Yom Kippur Katan]] and optional prayer services called during times of communal distress. The exact modes of sounding can vary from location to location.

In an effort to improve the skills of shofar blowers, an International Day of Shofar Study is observed on [[Rosh Chodesh Elul]], the start of the month preceding Rosh Hashanah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shofarcorps.org International Day of Shofar Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National liberation ===
During the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Ottoman]] and the [[Mandatory Palestine|British rule]] of [[Jerusalem]], Jews were not allowed to sound the shofar at the [[Western Wall]]. After the [[Six-Day War]], Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] famously approached the Wall and sounded the shofar. This fact inspired [[Naomi Shemer]] to add an additional line to her song "[[Jerusalem of Gold]]", saying, "a shofar calls out from the Temple Mount in the Old City."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalemofgold.co.il/ Jerusalem of Gold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991129052748/http://www.jerusalemofgold.co.il/ |date=29 November 1999}} accessed 9 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-religious musical usage ===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4104 Shlomo Bar.JPG|thumb|A musician blows the shofar during a performance by [[Shlomo Bar]], 2009.]]

In pop music, the shofar is used by the Israeli [[Oriental metal]] band [[Salem (Israel band)|Salem]] in their adaptation of "''Al Taster''" ([[Psalm 27]]). The late trumpeter [[Lester Bowie]] played a shofar with the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]]. In the film version of the musical ''[[Godspell (film)|Godspell]]'', the first act opens with cast member [[David Haskell]] blowing the shofar. In his performances, Israeli composer and singer [[Shlomo Gronich]] uses the shofar to produce a very wide range of notes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamfund.org/main/siteNew/index.php?page=129&amp;action=sidLink&amp;stId=1131 The Abraham Fund Initiatives: Press Clips - Crossing the Middle Eastern Tightrope&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609190823/http://www.abrahamfund.org/main/siteNew/index.php?page=129&amp;action=sidLink&amp;stId=1131 |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988 Rome-based American composer [[Alvin Curran]]'s project ''Shofar'' features the shofar as a virtuoso solo instrument and in combination with sets of natural and electronic sounds. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] used a shofar played by [[Yitzhak Sinwani]] on the [[Confessions Tour]] and the album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' for the song "Isaac", based on [[Im Nin'alu]]. In 2003, The [[Howard Stern Show]] featured a contest called "Blow the Shofar", which asked callers to correctly identify popular songs played on the shofar.  The shofar is sometimes used in [[European classical music|Western classical music]]. [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[oratorio]] ''[[The Apostles (Elgar)|The Apostles]]'' includes the sound of a shofar, although other instruments, such as the [[flugelhorn]], are usually used instead.

The shofar has been used in a number of films, both as a sound effect and as part of musical underscores. [[Elmer Bernstein]] incorporated the shofar into several cues for his score for [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''; one of the shofar calls recorded by Bernstein was later reused by the sound editors for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' for the Ewoks' horn calls. [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s scores to the films ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and ''Planet of the Apes'' also incorporate the shofar in their orchestration.

=== Celebration and protest ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The Shofar has been sounded as a sign of victory and celebration. Jewish elders were photographed blowing multiple shofars after hearing that the Nazis surrendered on May 8, 1945. The shofar has played a major role in the pro-Israel movement and often played in the [[Salute to Israel Parade]] and other pro-Israel demonstrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">'''[[Soil]]s''' can process and hold considerable amount of '''[[water]]'''. They can take in water, and will keep doing so until they are full, or until the rate at which they can transmit water into and through the pores is exceeded. Some of this water will steadily drain through the soil (via [[gravity]]) and end up in the [[waterway]]s and [[stream]]s, but much of it will be '''retained''', despite the influence of gravity. Much of this retained water can be used by [[plant]]s and other [[organism]]s, thus contributing to land productivity and [[soil health]].

==Soil water retention==
Pores (the spaces that exist between soil [[particle]]s) provide for the passage and/or retention of [[gas]]ses and [[moisture]] within the [[soil profile]]. The soil's ability to retain water is strongly related to particle size; water molecules hold more tightly to the fine particles of a [[clay]] soil than to coarser particles of a [[sand]]y soil, so clays generally retain more water.&lt;ref name=LeeperUren1993&gt;Leeper, G.W. &amp; Uren, N.C., 1993. ''Soil Science: An Introduction'', 5th edn. [[Melbourne University Press]], [[Melbourne]].&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, sands provide easier passage or transmission of water through the profile. Clay type, [[Soil organic matter|organic content]], and [[soil structure]] also influence soil water retention.&lt;ref&gt;Charman, P.E.V. &amp; Murphy, B.W., 1998. ''Soils: Their Properties and Management'', 5th edn. Oxford University Press, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum amount of water that a given soil can retain is called [[field capacity]], whereas a soil so dry that plants cannot liberate the remaining moisture from the soil particles is said to be at [[wilting point]].&lt;ref name=LeeperUren1993/&gt; Available water is that which the plants can utilize from the soil within the range between [[field capacity]] and [[wilting point]].  Roughly speaking for agriculture (top layer soil), soil is 25% [[water]], 25% [[air]], 45% [[mineral]], 5% other; water varies widely from about 1% to 90% due to several retention and drainage properties of a given soil.

The role of soil water retention is profound; its effects are far reaching and relationships are invariably complex. This section focuses on a few key roles and recognizes that it is beyond the scope of this discussion to encompass all roles that can be found in the literature.{{Tone-inline|date=May 2014}}

The process by which soil absorbs water and water drains downwards is called [[percolation]].

===Soil water retention and organism===
Soil water retention is essential to life. It provides an ongoing supply of water to plants between periods of replenishment ([[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]), so as to allow their continued growth and survival. For example, over much of temperate [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], this effect is seasonal and even inter-annual; the retained soil water that has accumulated in preceding wet [[winter]]s permits survival of most perennial plants over typically dry [[summer]]s when monthly [[evaporation]] exceeds [[rain]]fall. Soils generally contain more [[nutrient]]s, moisture, and [[humus]].

===Soil water retention and climate===
Soil moisture has an effect on the thermal properties of a soil profile, including conductance and heat capacity.&lt;ref name=Oke1987&gt;Oke, T.R., 1987. ''Boundary Layer Climates'', 2nd edn. [[Methuen &amp; Co.]] in association with Methuen, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of soil moisture and soil thermal properties has a significant effect on temperature-related biological triggers, including seed [[germination]], [[flowering]], and [[fauna]]l activity.&lt;ref name=Oke1987/&gt;  (more water causes soil to more slowly gain or lose temperature given equal heating; water has roughly double the [[Heat capacity]] of soil)

Recent climate modelling by Timbal et al. (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Timbal, B., Power, S., Colman, R., Viviand, J., &amp; Lirola, S., 2002. [http://www.cawcr.gov.au/staff/sbp/journal_articles/JClim_soilm.pdf "Does Soil Moisture Influence Climate Variability and Predictability over Australia?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213004656/http://www.cawcr.gov.au/staff/sbp/journal_articles/JClim_soilm.pdf |date=2014-02-13 }} ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', Volume 15, pp.1230 – 1238. Viewed May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a strong linkage between soil moisture and the persistence and variability of surface temperature and [[precipitation]]; further, that soil moisture is a significant consideration for the accuracy of "inter-annular" predications regarding the [[Climate of Australia|Australian climate]].

===Soil water retention, water balance, and other influences===
The role of soil in retaining water is significant in terms of the [[hydrological cycle]]; including the relative ability of soil to hold moisture and changes in soil moisture over time:
*Soil water that is not retained or used by plants may continue downward through the profile and contribute to the [[water table]] (the permanently saturated zone at the base of the profile); this is termed "recharge". Soil that is at field capacity (among other reasons) may preclude infiltration so to increase overland flow.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Both effects are associated with ground and surface water supplies, [[erosion]], and [[salinity]].
*Soil water can affect the structural integrity or coherence of a soil; saturated soils can become unstable and result in structural failure and mass movement. Soil water, its changes over time and management are of interest to geo-technicians and [[soil conservation]]ists with an interest in maintaining soil stability.

'''Spikenard''', also called '''nard''', '''nardin''', and '''muskroot''', is a class of aromatic amber-colored [[essential oil]] derived from ''[[Nardostachys jatamansi]]'', a [[flowering plant]] of the [[Valerian (plant)|valerian]] family which grows in the [[Himalayas]] of [[Nepal]], [[China]], and [[India]]. The oil has been used over centuries as a perfume, a [[traditional medicine]], or in religious ceremonies across a wide territory from India to Europe.

[[Catholic Church]] [[iconography]] uses spikenard to represent [[Saint Joseph]]. With this meaning, [[Pope Francis]] has included the spikenard in his [[coat of arms]].

==Plant sources==
[[Image:SpikenardEssentialOil.png|thumb|130px|right|Spikenard, ''[[Nardostachys jatamansi]]'', essential oil in a clear glass vial]]

''[[Nardostachys jatamansi]]'' is a [[flowering plant]] of the [[Valerian (plant)|valerian]] family that grows in the [[Himalayas]] of Nepal, China, and India.  The plant grows to about 1 meter (3&amp;nbsp;ft) in height and has pink, bell-shaped flowers. It is found in the altitude of about {{convert|3000|to|5000|m|abbr=on}}. [[Rhizome]]s (underground stems) can be crushed and distilled into an intensely aromatic amber-colored [[essential oil]] with thick consistency. Nard oil is used as a [[perfume]], an [[incense]], and an [[herbal medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname = Dalby|given = Andrew|authorlink = Andrew Dalby|title = Dangerous Tastes: the story of spices|publisher = British Museum Press|place = London|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7141-2720-0}} (US {{ISBN|0-520-22789-1}}) pp.&amp;nbsp;83–88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lavender]] (genus ''Lavandula'') was also known by the [[ancient Greeks]] as ''nardos'', nard, after the Sanskrit "narada" or "nalada".

== Historical use ==
[[File:Coat of arms of Franciscus.svg|thumb|right|upright|140px|[[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]] of Pope Francis. According to the Vatican, the flowering plant is a representation of the spikenard and symbolises St Joseph.]]

The oil was known in ancient times and was part of the [[Ayurvedic]] herbal tradition of India.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} It was obtained as a luxury in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], the Near East. In  [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], it was the main ingredient of the perfume ''nardinum'' ([[Old Latin|O.L.]] ''náladam''), derived from the Hebrew שבלת נֵרד (''shebolet nerd'', head of nard bunch),&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A Comprehensive [[Etymology|Etymological]] Dictionary of the [[Hebrew Language]] for Readers of English'', The [[University of Haifa]], Carta, Jerusalem, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the [[Ketoret]] used when referring to the consecrated [[incense]] described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[Talmud]]. It is also referred to as the HaKetoret (the incense). 

It was offered on the specialized incense altar when the [[Tabernacle]] was located in the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple period|Second]] Jerusalem Temples. The ketoret was an important component of the Temple service in [[Jerusalem]]. Nard is mentioned a number of times in the [[Tanakh]], and as part of incense in reference to ''hilchot shabbat'' in [[Shabbat|Tractate Shabbat]] 78b as well as Maimonides Hilchot Shabbat 18:16. It is mentioned twice in the [[Song of Solomon]] (1:12 and 4:13).

Nard was used to perfume the body of Patroklos by Achilles in Book 18 of Homer's ''Iliad''. Pliny's [[Natural History (Pliny) |''Natural History'']] lists twelve species of "nard", identifiable with varying assurance, including ''[[Lavandula stoechas]]'' and tuberous valerian as well as true nard (in modern terms ''Nardostachys jatamansi'').

It was a common flavouring in Ancient Roman foods and occurs frequently in the recipes of [[Apicius]], though it tends to be used sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apicius; De Re Coquinaria|url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/apicius-coquinaria.php|publisher=Nemeton|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spikenard was used to season foods in [[Medieval cuisine|Medieval]] European cuisine, especially as a part of the spice blend used to flavor [[hypocras]], a sweetened and spiced wine drink.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} From the 17th century, it was one of the ingredients for a strong beer called [[Beer in England#Archaic styles|stingo]].

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called the lavender herb ''nardus'', after the [[Syria]]n city of Naarda (possibly the modern town of [[Dohuk, Iraq]]). It was also commonly called ''nard''.&lt;ref&gt;The origin of most of these quotes comes from Dr. William Thomas Fernie, in his book "Herbal Simples" (Bristol Pub., 1895. ASIN: B0014W4WNE). A [https://books.google.com/books?id=KYUfAAAAYAAJ&amp;ots=FWTB-6ofVF&amp;dq=William%20Thomas%20Fernie%20%22Herbal%20Simples%22&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false digital copy of the book] can be read online via google books.
'By the Greeks the name Nardus is given to Lavender, from Naarda, a city of Syria near the Euphrates, and many persons call the plant "Nard." St. Mark mentions this as Spikenard, a thing of great value. In Pliny's time, blossoms of the Nardus sold for a hundred Roman denarii (or L.3 2s. 6d.) the pound. This Lavender or Nardus was called Asarum by the Romans, because it was not used in garlands or chaplets. It was formerly believed that the asp, a dangerous kind of viper, made Lavender its habitual place of abode, so that the plant had to be approached with great caution.'&lt;/ref&gt; The species originally grown was ''[[Lavandula stoechas|L. stoechas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvgq-6VAX8kC |title=Upson T, Andrews S.

== Religion ==

In the [[hispanic]] iconographic tradition of the [[Catholic Church]], the spikenard is used to represent [[Saint Joseph]].&lt;ref name= Vatican&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html |title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco |author= |date= |website= |publisher=L'Osservatore Romano (Vatican website) |accessdate=18 March 2013}} (In Italian: ''...il fiore di nardo indica San Giuseppe...Nella tradizione iconografica ispanica, infatti, San Giuseppe è raffigurato con un ramo di nardo in mano'', translates as "...the spikenard represents Saint Joseph...In the Hispanic iconographic tradition, in fact, St Joseph is depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand").&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See|Vatican]] has said that the [[coat of arms of Pope Francis]] includes the spikenard in reference to Saint Joseph.&lt;ref name= Vatican/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vatican releases Pope Francis' coat of arms, motto and ring  |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9937813/Vatican-releases-Pope-Francis-coat-of-arms-motto-and-ring.html|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope stresses simplicity, ecumenism in inaugural Mass plans |url= http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-stresses-simplicity-ecumenism-inaugural-mass-plans|newspaper= [[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nard (Italian ''[[:wikt:nardo|nardo]]'') is also mentioned in of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' book of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', such as (in the translation of [[Henry Francis Cary|H. F. Cary)]]:
:He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone
:And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
:And myrrh his funeral shroud.

'''Variable-range hopping''' is a model used to describe carrier transport in an [[amorphous solid]] by hopping in an extended temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=R. M.|date=1976-04-16|title=Variable-range hopping|journal=Physica Status Solidi A|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=601–613|doi=10.1002/pssa.2210340223|issn=0031-8965}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a characteristic temperature dependence of

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma= \sigma_0e^{-(T_0/T)^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter dependent on the model under consideration.

== Mott variable-range hopping ==
The '''[[Nevill Francis Mott|Mott]] variable-range hopping''' describes low-temperature [[Electrical conduction|conduction]] in strongly disordered systems with [[Anderson localization|localized]] charge-carrier states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mott, N.F.|title=Conduction in non-crystalline materials|journal=Phil. Mag.|volume=19|page=835|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a characteristic temperature dependence of

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma= \sigma_0e^{-(T_0/T)^{1/4}}&lt;/math&gt;

for three-dimensional conductance (with &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; = 1/4), and is generalized to ''d''-dimensions

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma= \sigma_0e^{-(T_0/T)^{1/(d+1)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hopping conduction at low temperatures is of great interest because of the savings the semiconductor industry could achieve if they were able to replace single-crystal devices with glass layers.&lt;ref&gt;P.V.E. McClintock, D.J. Meredith, J.K. Wigmore. ''Matter at Low Temperatures''. Blackie. 1984 {{ISBN|0-216-91594-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivation===
The original Mott paper introduced a simplifying assumption that the hopping energy depends inversely on the cube of the hopping distance (in the three-dimensional case). Later it was shown that this assumption was unnecessary, and this proof is followed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Apsley, N.  |author2=Hughes, H.P. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Temperature-and field-dependence of hopping conduction in disordered systems|journal=Phil. Mag.|volume=30|page=963|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the original paper, the hopping probability at a given temperature was seen to depend on two parameters, ''R'' the spatial separation of the sites, and ''W'', their energy separation.  Apsley and Hughes noted that in a truly amorphous system, these variables are random and independent and so can be combined into a single parameter, the ''range'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; between two sites, which determines the probability of hopping between them.

Mott showed that the probability of hopping between two states of spatial separation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle R&lt;/math&gt; and energy separation ''W'' has the form:
:&lt;math&gt;P\sim \exp \left[-2\alpha R-\frac{W}{kT}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where α&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the attenuation length for a hydrogen-like localised wave-function. This assumes that hopping to a state with a higher energy is the rate limiting process.

We now define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{R} = 2\alpha R+W/kT&lt;/math&gt;, the ''range'' between two states, so &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P\sim \exp (-\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt;.  The states may be regarded as points in a four-dimensional random array (three spatial coordinates and one energy coordinate), with the "distance" between them given by the range &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Conduction is the result of many series of hops through this four-dimensional array and as short-range hops are favoured, it is the average nearest-neighbour "distance" between states which determines the overall conductivity.  Thus the conductivity has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \sim \exp (-\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn}&lt;/math&gt;is the average nearest-neighbour range. The problem is therefore to calculate this quantity.

The first step is to obtain &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt;, the total number of states within a range &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; of some initial state at the Fermi level. For ''d''-dimensions, and under particular assumptions this turns out to be
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R}) = K \mathcal{R}^{d+1}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle K = \frac{N\pi kT}{3\times 2^d \alpha^d}&lt;/math&gt;.
The particular assumptions are simply that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn}&lt;/math&gt; is well less than the band-width and comfortably bigger than the interatomic spacing.

Then the probability that a state with range &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the nearest neighbour in the four-dimensional space (or in general the (''d''+1)-dimensional space) is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{nn}(\mathcal{R}) = \frac{\partial \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})}{\partial \mathcal{R}} \exp [-\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})]&lt;/math&gt;
the nearest-neighbour distribution.

For the ''d''-dimensional case then
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn} = \int_0^\infty (d+1)K\mathcal{R}^{d+1}\exp (-K\mathcal{R}^{d+1})d\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be evaluated by making a simple substitution of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t=K\mathcal{R}^{d+1}&lt;/math&gt; into the [[gamma function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty  t^{z-1} e^{-t}\,\mathrm{d}t&lt;/math&gt;

After some algebra this gives
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn} = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{d+2}{d+1})}{K^{\frac{1}{d+1}}}&lt;/math&gt;
and hence that
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \propto \exp \left(-T^{-\frac{1}{d+1}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Non-constant density of states===
When the [[density of states]] is not constant (odd power law N(E)), the Mott conductivity is also recovered, as shown in [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/ccsd-00004661 this article].

&lt;!-- '''Sadly''', it is still not widely recognised that the "simplifying assumption" (as it is described above) in the Mott derivation is actually a serious fundamental error, in that it simultaneously employs a distance R to represent two very different parameters - the '''''actual''''' distance hopped and the radius of the sphere '''''within which''''' hopping occurs! Simple averaging of the hopping distance to yield 3/4 of the sphere radius (N.F.Mott and E.A.Davis, ''Electronic Processes in Non-Crystalline Materials'', 2nd Edition (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1979)) is also inappropriate, since it fails to apply the necessary weightings to tunnelling over various distances within the sphere.

The above derivation, albeit in a more complex 4-dimensional formulation, contains a corresponding error in respect of the phrase "the total number of states '''''within''''' a range R of some initial state at the Fermi level". A more appropriate approach would be to consider the states within a '''''surface''''' element (dR) of a sphere of radius R, (i.e. 4.pi.R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.dR) and then (possibly?) include their resulting average energy spacing in maximizing the hopping probability. Of course, (a) this would not lead to a T&lt;sup&gt;−1/4&lt;/sup&gt; dependence, due to the R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rather than R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; term, and (b) the resulting value would be subject to some arbitrary assumption regarding an appropriate value of dR.

As a consequence of these errors, values of the density of hopping states (DOS) close to the Fermi level, and of other associated parameters (as calculated using the parameter ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' above) have often been totally physically unreasonable (DOS values in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; /cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/eV have been obtained, and values of 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; are not untypical! - D.K.Paul and S.S.Mitra, Phys. Rev. Lett., '''31''', 1000 (1973) is a good example). (Actual DOS values are not expected to exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; /cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/eV without metallic conduction becoming dominant (N.F.Mott and E.A.Davis, as referenced above, p.359)). It has also frequently been observed that a T&lt;sup&gt;−1/4&lt;/sup&gt; relationship is by no means the best fit to experimental data.

This does not mean that the underlying '''''qualitative''''' concept of "variable-range hopping" (i.e. the obvious tendency to favour a more spatially distant site with a smaller hopping-energy requirement at sufficiently low temperatures) is invalid. It simply means that the ('''''unfortunately still''''') unquestioning application of the Mott model to infer the associated material properties is entirely inappropriate.

J.M.Marshall and C.Main, J. Physics: Condensed Matter '''20''', 285210 (2008) provides extensive further detail and examples, and also advances an alternative model which eliminates these massive discrepancies.--&gt;

== Efros–Shklovskii variable-range hopping ==
{{See also|Coulomb gap}}
The '''Efros–Shklovskii (ES) variable-range hopping''' is a conduction model which accounts for the [[Coulomb gap]], a small jump in the [[density of states]] near the [[Fermi level]] due to interactions between localized electrons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Efros|first=A. L.|last2=Shklovskii|first2=B. I.|date=1975|title=Coulomb gap and low temperature conductivity of disordered systems|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0022-3719/8/i=4/a=003|journal=Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=L49|doi=10.1088/0022-3719/8/4/003|issn=0022-3719}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after [[Alexei L. Efros]] and [[Boris Shklovskii]] who proposed it in 1975.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The consideration of the Coulomb gap changes the temperature dependence to

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma= \sigma_0e^{-(T_0/T)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

for all dimensions (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; = 1/2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhaoguo|date=2017|others=et. al|title=Transition between Efros–Shklovskii and Mott variable-range hopping conduction in polycrystalline germanium thin films|journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology|volume=32|issue=3|pages=035010|doi=10.1088/1361-6641/aa5390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=Ralph|date=1991|title=Crossover from Mott to Efros-Shklovskii variable-range-hopping conductivity in InxOy films|journal=Physical Review B|volume=44|issue=8|pages=3599–3603|doi=10.1103/physrevb.44.3599|issn=0163-1829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''WBSC World Rankings''' is a ranking system for [[National sports team|national teams]] in [[baseball]] and [[softball]]. The teams of the member nations of the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC), baseball's world governing body, are ranked based on their tournament results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of WBSC-recognized international tournaments. Under the existing system, rankings are based on a team's performance over the last four years, with major international tournaments awarded a higher weighting compared to minor international and continental tournaments.

== History ==
In January 2009, the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) first published a listing in rank order of its member associations to provide a basis for comparison of the relative strengths of these teams. Though primarily focused on the respective men's senior teams of member nations, the current ranks also include points awarded based on results at the IBAF [[World Junior Baseball Championship|'AAA' (Under 18) Junior]] and [[World Youth Baseball Championship|'AA' (Under 16) Youth Championships]] held during the tracking period. Beginning in 2015, the rankings also determine which twelve teams participate in the [[WBSC Premier12]] tournament.

The initial women's baseball rankings were based upon results from past [[Women's Baseball World Cup]]s. While the calculations of the women's rankings are similar to that of the men's, one main difference is that they are inclusive of the three most recent IBAF Women's Baseball World Cups whereas the men's rankings only include the last two. Points are weighted in favor of the more recent results.&lt;ref name="ibaf women's rankings"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibaf.org/index.php?id=10&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=311&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=9&amp;cHash=e4d61fbf48 | title=IBAF Releases First-Ever Women’s World Rankings | date=13 August 2009 | accessdate=13 August 2009 | publisher=International Baseball Federation | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sBX8m4lp?url=http://www.ibaf.org/en/article-detail.aspx?id=7cdb8cdb-525d-4501-8f40-2d59622392e6 | archivedate=23 August 2010 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Softball rankings==
In the wake of the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s decision to cut baseball from the [[2012 Olympics]] program, the IBAF pushed the growth of women's baseball as to include a women's component in its bid for a reinstatement of the sport in future Olympics. The effort to unify the sports resulted in the merger of the IBAF with the [[International Softball Federation]] in 2013 to create the WBSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT THE WORLD BASEBALL SOFTBALL CONFEDERATION|url=http://wbsc.org/en/about|publisher=[[World Baseball Softball Confederation]]|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the WBSC is also responsible for ranking international men's and women's softball teams.&lt;ref name="sb2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=WBSC launches first-ever Softball World Rankings: Japan Women’s No. 1, New Zealand Men’s No. 1|url=http://www.mister-baseball.com/wbsc-launches-firstever-softball-world-rankings-japan-womens-1-zealand-mens-1/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=Mister Baseball|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=March 2016}}
Under the current system used, points are awarded to member nations based purely on their final position in recognised international tournaments.{{IBAF World Rankings ref/Notes}} This is opposed to other international sports ranking systems such as the [[ICC Test Championship]] for [[cricket]], that is based on both individual matches and the results of series, or the [[FIFA World Rankings]] for [[association football|football]], that is based solely on individual matches.

Points are awarded according to the following table:

''{{note|*|*}}'' - If more than 32 teams compete, points are only awarded to the first 32 teams. (i.e. the spread is from 5th - 31st, Last gets 1 point.)
{{refend}}

The points awarded after 4th place are spread evenly in an attempt to ensure balance between tournaments with different-sized fields: finishing 6th out of 20 teams is considered to be a higher accomplishment than finishing 6th out of 8 teams. Given that points are not fixed beyond 4th place, a calculation is used to determine how many points are awarded to each position. The calculation gives the difference between any two consecutive positions from 4th through to last (e.g. 4th and 5th, 7th and 8th, 21st and 22nd, etc.). The calculation is:

:&lt;math&gt;Points\ difference\ = \frac{14}{No\ of\ teams\ -\ 4}&lt;/math&gt;

This is illustrated in the following table:

A multiplier is used in awarding points, based on the prestige of the tournament and the quality of the teams involved. The table below reflects the changes in the international baseball schedule recently approved by the WBSC. Below are the multipliers that will be used beginning in 2012.

[[World Baseball Classic]]            6x  (Winner receives 50 points, multiplied by 6 for a total of 300 points)

Premier 12                                  6x

WBC Qualifiers                          *    (Pool winner receives 50 points, 2nd – 40 pts, 3rd – 30 pts, 4th – 15 pts)

21U and 18U                              2x

15U and 12U                              1x

Continental Championships, Continental Qualifiers, and all other WBSC-sponsored events will receive a multiplier based on the number of top-10 teams from the previous year-end rankings that are entered in the tournament. (See below)

1.00× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 3 or more competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10

0.75× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 2 competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10

0.50× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where 1 competing team is in the previous year-end top 10

0.25× - Continental Championships/Qualifying Tournaments, where no competing teams are in the previous year-end top 10

After each tournament where ranking points are awarded, the WBSC re-releases the ranking list with the points from the most recent tournament added, and points from tournaments more than four years old removed.

'''Yuri Fyodorovich Lisyansky''' (also spelled as '''Urey Lisiansky''' and '''Lisianski''' and '''Lysyansky''') ({{lang-uk|Юрій Федорович Лисянський}}, {{lang|uk-latn|Jurij Fedorovyč Lysjanskyj}}; {{lang-ru|Ю́рий Фёдорович Лися́нский}}, {{lang|ru-latn|Jurij Fëdorovič Lisjanskij}}, 1(13) April 1773 – 6 March 1837) was an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and [[explorer]] of Ukrainian origin.

Lisyansky was born in [[Nizhyn]] (now [[Ukraine]], then [[Russian Empire]]) in the family of the orthodox priest and was a descendant of old [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossack]] family. In 1786 he graduated from the [[Navy Cadet Corps]] and took part in the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790)]]. During 1790-1793 he served in the [[Baltic Fleet]]. During 1793-1799 he sailed British ships all over the globe. Between 1793 and 1795 he served as a volunteer aboard the 36-gun [[French frigate Cléopâtre|HMS ''Oiseau'']], under her captain, [[Robert Murray (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Murray]]. Lisyansky recalled in his memoirs his experiences on the [[North American Station]] operating against French convoys and privateers, and how while in the [[West Indies]] he was struck by [[yellow fever]], recalling how Murray had helped his recovery, even giving up part of his own accommodation for the sick Lisyansky.&lt;ref name="Lisyansky"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lisyansky|title=A Voyage Round the World in 1803, 4, 5 &amp; 6 ... in the Ship Neva|pages=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803-1806 Lisyanski as the commanding officer of the [[Russian-American Company]]'s merchant [[sloop]] ''[[Neva (1802 Russian ship)|Neva]]'' took part in the first Russian [[circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth]]. The expedition was under the command of Count Nikolay Petrovich Rezanov, Plentipotentiary of Alexander I for the Far Eastern and Western colonies of the Russian Empire,  and Captain Adam Johann von Krusenstern in [[Nadezhda (1802 Russian ship)|''Nadezhda'']]. They started from [[Kronstadt]], but the ships split after visiting [[Hawaii]], and Count Nikolay Rezanov and Lisianski headed to [[Russian America|Russian America (Alaska)]]. In 1804 ''Neva'' visited [[Easter Island]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Routledge]] refers to page 58 of his book "Voyage round the world in the Ship ''Neva'' Lisiansky", London 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year, was essential in defeating the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] in the [[Battle of Sitka]], Alaska. In 1805 he met Krusenstern again in [[Macau]], but they soon separated. Also in 1805, he was the first to describe the [[Hawaiian monk seal]] on the island which now bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/hawai01.htm Monachus Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, ''Neva'' was the first to return to Kronstadt on 22 July 1806. For his feats Lisyanski received several rewards, including the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]] of 3rd degree.
