In 1904, there was no [[World Series]] played between the champions of the two [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]], the [[American League]] (AL) and the [[National League]] (NL). The champions were the Boston Americans (now the [[Boston Red Sox]]), who repeated their 1903 AL championship, and the NL's New York Giants (now the [[San Francisco Giants]]).

==Background==
[[File:America's National Game 0451.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|New York Giants owner [[John T. Brush]]]]
Due to a business rivalry between the two leagues, especially in New York, and to personal animosity between Giants manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] and American League president [[Ban Johnson]], the Giants declined to meet the champions of the "junior" (or "minor") league. McGraw said his Giants were already the world champions because they were the champions of the "only real major league".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vass|first=George|date=January 1995|title=Baseball's Shrunken Seasons: What Might Have Been...|journal=[[Baseball Digest]]|publisher=Lakeside Publishing Co|volume=54|issue=1|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[spring training]] in March 1904, Giants owner [[John T. Brush]] said "there will never be a series" between 
the New York-based teams—his Giants of the National League and the American League's [[New York Highlanders]]—in response to a preseason offer from Highlanders co-owner [[Frank J. Farrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25295341/brush_declines/ |title=Brush Declines |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=8 |date=March 8, 1904 |accessdate=November 11, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1904, as reported in ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'', Brush stated that his NL club would not play the AL club "if each wins the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in its respective league", in contradiction of a preseason agreement for a championship series between the leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24735450/baseball_notes/ |title=Baseball Notes |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=8 |date=July 6, 1904 |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scrapbook/&gt;{{rp|57}} At that point in the season, the Giants were comfortably on top of the NL standings, and the Highlanders (now the [[New York Yankees]]) were just {{frac|1|1|2}} games behind the [[Boston Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1904/07041904.htm |title=Standings At Close of Play of July 4, 1904 |website=[[Retrosheet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AL race went down to the wire, and the Highlanders temporarily took over first place on October 7 when they defeated Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1904/10071904.htm |title=Standings At Close of Play of October 7, 1904 |website=[[Retrosheet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Americans won three of their four remaining games to clinch the AL pennant, and finished {{frac|1|1|2}} games ahead of the Highlanders (who lost three of their final four games) in the final standings of October 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1904/10101904.htm |title=Standings At Close of Play of October 10, 1904 |website=[[Retrosheet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants, who had won the NL by a wide margin (13 games), stuck to and broadened their plan, refusing to play ''any'' AL club, either the champion Boston team or the crosstown New York team, in the proposed "exhibition" series (as they considered it).&lt;ref name=Scrapbook&gt;{{cite book |title=The Scrapbook History of Baseball |first=Jordan A. |last=Deutsch |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |date=1975 |isbn=0672520281 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Scrapbook-history-baseball-Jordan-Deutsch/dp/0672520281/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}}

==Summary==

===Boston Americans===
Boston had defeated National League champion [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh]] in the [[1903 World Series]], a contest arranged by the two champion clubs, not by the leagues themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24736863/worlds_series_on_again/ |title=World's Series On Again |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=6 |date=September 26, 1903 |accessdate=October 22, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Giants===
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2010}}
The Giants maintained that the rules for the World Series were haphazardly defined. In the 1903 series, as well as postseason series between the National League and the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in the 1880s, the rules for a given season's "World's Championship Series" had been whatever the two participating clubs had agreed upon. The World Series was not a compulsory event and was not governed by an authoritative body, thus the Giants were free to refuse to participate in such an event.

Stung by criticism from fans and writers, Brush drafted rules that both leagues adopted in mid-February 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://research.sabr.org/journals/files/SABR-Baseball_Research_Journal-31-Bevis.pdf |title=The Evolution of World Series Scheduling |first=Charlie |last=Bevis |journal=The Baseball Research Journal |volume=31 |pages=21–28 |date=2003 |accessdate=October 22, 2018 |via=[[Society for American Baseball Research|SABR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules compelled the two winning clubs to participate and governed the annual determination of sites, dates, ticket prices and division of receipts.  These new rules essentially made the World Series the premier annual [[Major League Baseball]] event.

==Aftermath==
Boston slumped in 1905, while New York repeated its NL championship and won the [[1905 World Series]] against the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. The two teams eventually met in the [[1912 World Series]] with the Red Sox winning in seven games. The Series has been played every year since except {{wsy|1994}}, when a 232-day players' [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] ended the season in mid-August.

[[Topps]] joined the sports cards market in the 1950s becoming a rival to [[Bowman Gum|Bowman]]. After competing with each other for five years Topps bought out Bowman in 1956. Competition still remained however, in the form of [[Parkhurst Products|Parkhurst]] [[hockey cards]]. Topps produced cards of the United States-based [[National Hockey League]] teams while Parkhurst covered the Canadian teams. Topps had produced multi-sport photo cards prior to 1950, namely the 1948 Topps Magic Photos but each set was very small and not considered a major set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psacard.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=5071&amp;universeid=314&amp;type=1 |title=The Battle for Football Card Supremacy Begins: A Look at the 1950 Bowman Football Set – PSA Library |publisher=Psacard.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was consistent with their first baseball and college football issues: the 1950 Feltbacks resembled college pennants; 1951 Magic football included a scratch-off game on the reverse; Red/Blue Backs intended to be a card game; Connie Mack/Current All-Stars are foldable stand-ups. It was in 1952 that Topps released their first truly major card set. In the autumn of 1951, [[Woody Gelman]] and [[Sy Berger]], then a 28-year-old veteran of World War II, designed the 1952 [[Topps]] [[baseball card]] set on the kitchen table of Berger's apartment on Alabama Avenue in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p. 90, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 1957 Topps set featured dimensions of 2½ by 3½&amp;nbsp;inches which has become known as the standard card size. Below is a list with brief descriptions of Topps [[trading card]] products for the 1950s.

===Licensed sets===
Beginning in 1959, Topps began permitting the printing of cards by a printer (Benco) in Venezuela on account of it being a viable baseball market. The most significant difference from the U.S. issue was the card stock quality used for the Venezuelan cards.  Two distinctly different card stocks were used (one with gray backs, the other with cream backs), and both were of much lower grade.  Cards from this set have a duller finish on the front due to no gloss being applied. Approximately half of the set has a copyright designation which states the card was printed in the US, while the other half state 'Impreso en Venezuela por Benco CA'. The 1959 Venezuelan set features cards 1-198 &lt;ref&gt;[http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj262/josh48067/198C-Davenport-4.jpg 1959 Venezuela Topps Jim Davenport #198 image]&lt;/ref&gt; from their U.S. counterpart. (It has been long believed that the set consisted of only 196 cards, however, it has been found to have been incorrectly documented for years with card #198 having been validated by independent third-party agency PSA as being from the set). Size: 2.5 × 3.5&amp;nbsp;inches.

==Basketball==
Topps' first basketball issue was released for 1957-58. The set has 80 cards of [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players and was issued in 5-cent packs. Over half the set is rookies with 47. There were also 22 cards in the set that were double printed. The player's name and team appear in the lower portion of the photo in adjacent long and short trapezoid shaped bars respectively. The backs offer biographical player data with year and career statistics. Also on the backs, the card number appears on a backboard style design and a drawing of a player standing in front of a ruler indicates the player's height. After this issue, Topps did not release another basketball set until 1969. Size: 2.5 × 3.5&amp;nbsp;in.

'''Albert (Bert) Henry Baskerville''' (born as '''"Baskiville"'''&lt;ref name=SeanFaganBaskerville&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Sean Fagan]]|title=Albert Baskerville – Or Baskiville?|url=http://www.rl1908.com/articles/Baskerville.htm|accessdate=28 June 2008|work=rl1908.com/index.htm RL1908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517144647/http://www.rl1908.com/articles/Baskerville.htm|archivedate=17 May 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (15 January 1883 &amp;ndash; 20 May 1908) was a [[Wellington]] postal clerk, a [[rugby union]] forward, author of the book "''Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods; Points for the Beginner, the Player, the Spectator''" and a pioneer of [[rugby league]].

==Rugby football==
Prior to becoming the administrator of the 1908 tour Baskerville played rugby for the Oriental club in Wellington and was said to be on the verge of [[Wellington Rugby Union|provincial selection]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;John Haynes ''From All Blacks to All Golds: Rugby League's Pioneers'', Christchurch, Ryan and Haynes, 1996. {{ISBN|0-473-03864-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had been killed in 1903 and Bert had been the main [[income earner]] for the family since then.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; His book, ''Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods; Points for the Beginner, the Player, the Spectator'', was published in 1907 and gave him somewhat of a national profile. After the success of this project he moved on to his next ambitious idea, a professional rugby tour of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://allgolds.net/ |title=The All Golds |access-date=4 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010124413/http://www.allgolds.net/ |archive-date=10 October 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tour==
{{Main|1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain}}
Baskerville wrote to the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] and asked if they would host a touring party of New Zealand rugby players. The Northern Union were excited by this proposal and quickly agreed. After this Baskerville began to work on organising the tour full-time, leaving his job at the Postal Department and severing his connection with the Oriental Football Club. The [[Wellington Rugby Union]] moved quickly to attempt to stop him from attending their grounds and he received a life ban from the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]]. Despite this he managed to put together an impressive touring party that included eight [[All Blacks]], including four from the 1905 [[The Original All Blacks|tour of Great Britain]]. The team was dubbed the [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain|All Golds]] by the Sydney press, a derogatory play on the New Zealand rugby union team's nickname the [[All Blacks]].

The tour was a great success both financially, each player earned roughly £300, and on the field, where the touring side won consecutive Test series against Great Britain and Australia. For most of the tour Baskerville was busy with the administration work and it was not until the final game of the British leg, against [[St Helens R.F.C.]], that Baskerville played, scoring a try. On arriving in Australia he then played in the [[1907–08 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain#1908 in Australia|first ever trans-Tasman test]] which was the debut match of the [[Australia national rugby league team]], again scoring a try. Tragically that was to be the only time that Baskerville would represent [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand]] in a Test match. Baskerville contracted [[pneumonia]] on the ship taking the touring party from Sydney to Brisbane and, after several days in hospital, died aged 25 in [[Brisbane]], Australia on 20 May 1908.&lt;ref name=SeanFaganCentenaryUpdates&gt;{{cite web|author=[Sean Fagan Sean Fagan]|title=2008 RUGBY LEAGUE CENTENARY NEWS &amp; UPDATES|url=http://www.rl1908.com/Centenary/nz-allgolds-august17th.htm|accessdate=28 June 2008|work=rl1908.com/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506140540/http://www.rl1908.com/Centenary/nz-allgolds-august17th.htm|archive-date=6 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was taken by manager Harry Palmer and a group of players from each province back to Wellington. The rest of the touring party stayed in Australia to complete their remaining fixtures. Like five other members of the touring party Baskerville is buried at Karori Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=29312 Relatives and Teams to remember Original All Golds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012183957/http://rleague.com/db/article.php?id=29312 |date=12 October 2007}} ''NZRL Press Release'', 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Courtney Goodwill Trophy]], international rugby league′s first, was presented for the first time in 1936 and depicted Baskiville, along with other pioneering greats of the code, [[Jean Galia]] (France), [[James Lomas (rugby league)|James Lomas]] (England) and [[Dally Messenger]] (Australia).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090914123213/http://www.nsm.org.au/Whats%20On/Latest%20News/2009/April/~/media/Files/Rugby_League_Fast_Facts.ashx “League Legends: fast facts about rugby league”] at ''nsm.org.au''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Columbia''''' was one of the two yachts to successfully defend the second [[America's Cup]] race in 1871 against English challenger [[Livonia (yacht)|''Livonia'']].

==Design==

''Columbia'' was a wooden [[centerboard]] [[schooner]] designed and built in 1871 by [[Joseph B. Van Deusen]] in [[Chester, PA]] for owner [[Franklin Osgood]] of the [[New York Yacht Club]]. She was later purchased by [[Henry Flagler]].

==Career==

Skippered by [[Andrew J. Comstock]], ''Columbia'' won the first two 1871 best-of-seven races against ''Livonia''. She was beaten by ''Livonia'' in the third race, in which ''Columbia,'' damaged from the second race, was skippered by Horatio Nelson "Nelse" Comstock. She was the first America's Cup defender to concede a win to the challenger. As ''Columbia'' was further damaged in this third race, she was unable to compete in the final races. The yacht ''[[Sappho (yacht)|Sappho]]'' substituted and won the America's Cup for the second time for the U.S.

''Columbia'' ended her racing career in 1908, when she was dismasted and used as a [[houseboat]] in [[Brooklyn#Transportation|Brooklyn Harbor]] on the [[East River]]. Three years later she was rebuilt and sailed as a cruiser out of [[Newport News, VA]]. In 1920, ''Columbia'' was bought by a fisherman. She was declared lost in 1923.

[[Image:Ichiro3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ichiro Suzuki]] is one of baseball's best contact hitters, consistently among the [[American League|AL]]'s leaders in [[at bats]] per [[strikeout]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/s/suzukic01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com - Ichiro Suzuki]. Retrieved October 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[baseball]], a '''contact hitter''' is a hitter who does not [[strikeout|strike out]] often. Thus, they are usually able to use their bats to make contact with the ball (hence the name ''contact'' hitter) to put it in play, and then run fast to reach base. As a result of their focus on putting the ball in play, they usually have fewer [[home run]]s than [[power hitter]]s.

[[Tony Gwynn]] is the leading example of a modern contact hitter. Although he had 135 career home runs, Gwynn accurately described himself as a contact hitter who could hit to all fields. He rarely struck out (just 434 times, once every 21 at-bats) and his goal was to put the ball in play and move baserunners over. Gwynn's success as a contact hitter landed him in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].

[[File:DenmanArena Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Denman Arena from the southwest]]

'''Denman Arena''' was an indoor [[arena]] located in downtown [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. The arena was located at 1805 [[Georgia Street|West Georgia Street]] at the northwest corner with Denman Street. It opened in December 1911 and was destroyed by fire in 1936. Its primary use was for ice sports such as [[ice hockey]]. It was the home [[ice rink]] of the [[Vancouver Millionaires]] professional ice hockey team, and was the location of 1915 [[Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup championships]]. The arena was also used for other sports, musical performances and public assemblies. It was an assembly point for Canadian servicemen during [[World War I]]. The 10,500 seat arena was the largest in Canada at the time, and introduced mechanically frozen or "artificial" ice to Canada.{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=234}}

==Construction==
In January 1911, Joe Patrick sold his [[Nelson, British Columbia]] lumber business for $440,000.{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=233}} The Patrick family moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and the decision was made to use the proceeds of the company sale to go into the business of professional ice hockey. The family built the Denman Arena to support the new [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] professional ice hockey league, to be run by Joe's sons [[Frank Patrick (hockey)|Frank]] and [[Lester Patrick]]. Both Frank and Lester were professional ice hockey players and had played in the [[National Hockey Association]] and other early professional leagues in Eastern Canada. Simultaneously, the Patricks also built the 4000-seat [[Patrick Arena]] in Victoria.

To build the Vancouver arena, the Patricks bought a parcel of land consisting of thirteen lots from the water's edge of Coal Harbour to Georgia Street, bounded by Denman and Chilco Streets. The location was near [[Stanley Park]] to the west, and was connected to the downtown business district by a streetcar line along Georgia Street.{{sfn|Wong|2009|pp=234–235}} The site was previously the location of the Kanaka Ranch, which was settled in the 1860s by Hawaiian families, who grew fruit and vegetables, and produced charcoal, on the site.&lt;ref name="vhs-marker"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Vancouver Historical Society |title=Historical Markers in Vancouver Parks |url=http://www.vancouver-historical-society.ca/historical_markers.htm |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finance the construction of the Arena, the Patricks formed the Vancouver Arena Company Limited, capitalized at $200,000. The company was divided into 1000 preferred shares and 1000 common shares, with a 10% annual dividend. The company issued an initial share offering, but by September 1911, the offering had only raised $1400. Two more investors signed on, but it was up to the Paticks to take the rest.{{sfn|Wong|2009|pp=235–236}} To facilitate the playing of ice hockey in Vancouver's moderate climate, the Patricks imported mechanical ice freezing equipment that Frank and Lester Patrick had seen in operation at New York's [[St. Nicholas Arena]]. The Denman Arena opened on December 20, 1911, attracting 1500 people for a session of public [[ice skating]].{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=236}} Denman Arena held 10,500 people, making it at the time, the largest indoor arena in Canada, one of the world's largest indoor arenas, and the second largest indoor arena in [[North America]], after the second [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=236}} The Arena was built at a cost of $226,382.{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=236}}

In 1927, the Patricks built the 2,500 seat Denman Auditorium next to the Arena. The Auditorium, which was multi-purpose, survived the fire of 1936 and was renovated in 1952. It re-opened on September 10, 1952 as the Georgia Auditorium concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Vancouver Sun |date=September 11, 1952 |title=Auditorium Changes Achieve Purpose |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only lasted seven years before it was demolished in 1959,&lt;ref name="vhs-marker"/&gt; after the construction of the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]].

==Usage==
The Arena was the permanent home of the professional [[Vancouver Millionaires]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. The Arena was also the home of the [[New Westminster Royals]] from 1911 until 1914. The Patricks had hoped to set up teams in [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] in the PCHA for the opening season, but the plans fell through. To avoid having a two-team league, the Patricks formed the Royals, to represent the neighbouring town of [[New Westminster]] and encourage fans to come to the Arena. Although the Royals were an unexpected necessity, the Royals were the winners of the first PCHA championship. The Royals were disbanded in 1914, when the PCHA formed a team in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The Millionaires were later renamed the Maroons and were disbanded in 1926 when the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] discontinued operations.

The Arena hosted the [[Stanley Cup]] "World Series" championship series four times. The [[1915 Stanley Cup Finals|1915 series]] pitted the Millionaires versus the [[National Hockey Association]]'s [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], the first Stanley Cup series held west of [[Winnipeg]]. The series was won by the Millionaires, and remains the only Stanley Cup won by a Vancouver team. The Arena also hosted Stanley Cup series in [[1921 Stanley Cup Final|1921]], won by Ottawa, the [[1923 Stanley Cup Final|1923]] series won by Ottawa and game two of the [[1925 Stanley Cup Final|1925 series]], won by the [[Victoria Cougars]].

During construction, the Patricks organized a four-team amateur ice hockey league, the Vancouver Amateur Hockey League, composed of the Vancouver Athletic Club, the Bankers, the Columbians and the Vancouver Rowing Club.{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=239}} In 1921, the Arena hosted the first international women's championship of ice hockey, organized by the PCHA.{{sfn|Norton|2009|p=115}} After the collapse of the Western Canada league, a new [[Pacific Coast Hockey League]] was organized, with the  [[Vancouver Lions]] playing out of the Arena.{{sfn|Whitehead|p=178}} The PCHL lasted three years. In 1933, the Lions were revived in the [[North West Hockey League]]. The Lions continued after the destruction of the Arena, and a reconstituted PCHL began operations with the Lions as a member.

Two other ice sports clubs had their start at the Denman Arena. The Arena also had four [[curling]] rinks in the basement and the [[Vancouver Curling Club]] was established in December 1911.{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=240}} Curling was discontinued during World War I to make way for the armed forces. The Club re-organized in 1931 at the [[Pacific National Exhibition]]'s Forum. The Club built its own facility in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Vancouver Curling Club |title=History |url=http://www.vancouvercurlingclub.com/history |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connaught Skating Club also was established in December 1911,{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=240}} and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011.&lt;ref name="connaught-100"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Richmond Review |title= Skaters celebrate 100 years|url=http://www.richmondreview.com/sports/119356754.html |first=Don |last=Fennell |accessdate=December 1, 2013 |date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, the Club held competitions and an annual "Carnival" show at the Arena.&lt;ref name="connaught-100"/&gt; After the Arena burned down, Connaught moved to the Forum as well, and in 1965 moved to [[Richmond, British Columbia]] to Richmond's Minoru Arena.&lt;ref name="connaught-100"/&gt;

The Arena and Auditorium were also used for boxing and wrestling matches.&lt;ref name="vhs-marker"/&gt; The North Shore Indians of the Inter-City League played [[box lacrosse]] in the Arena in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Vancouver Sun |title=A loving look at lacrosse |first=Archie |last=McDonald |date=August 14, 1982 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the Arena was used to house over 1,000 soldiers who were assembling to form the 23rd Infantry Brigade. The soldiers left Vancouver in August 1914 to be deployed as the first Canadian troops in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greetings from British Columbia: A Journey in Vintage Postcards |page=162 |first1=Fred |last1=Thirkell |first2=Bob |last2=Scullion |year=2009 |publisher=Heritage House Publishing Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1924, the Arena was the site of a political radio broadcast by Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], who spoke at Denman Arena during a tour of the west. It may have been the first political broadcast in Canada. Later that year, the telephone line installed was used for the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game in British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sound Heritage Series, Issues 35-38 |pages=15, 53 |author=Provincial Archives of British Columbia, Sound and Moving Image Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 1935, over 16,000 assembled at the Arena for a political rally by the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|CCF]], the largest indoor gathering in Vancouver up until that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vancouver Past: Essays in Social History |editor-first=Robert A. J. |editor-last=McDonald |page=265 |publisher=UBC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Denman Auditorium was taken over during World War II by the Canadian navy, then used as storage by Boeing Aircraft. It was bought in 1945 by H. M. Singer, who converted it back to a venue.&lt;ref name="rlp-closing"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Regina Leader-Post |title=Georgia auditorium shuts down |page=4 |date=June 22, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two notable [[rock and roll]] concerts took place in 1957, by a touring group of musicians known as "The Biggest Show of Stars." The lineup included [[Paul Anka]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Fats Domino]], [[The Drifters]], [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Buddy Knox]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tomhawthorn.blogspot.ca/2009_02_01_archive.html |title=A Vancouver legend's brush with Buddy Holly  |first=Tom |last=Hawthorne |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]] regularly played at the venue during the 1950s. The final event at the Georgia Auditorium took place on June 19, 1959. It was a free show by the CBC Talent Caravan.&lt;ref name="rlp-closing"/&gt;

Other musical performances at the Arena and Auditorium included performances by [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Glenn Gould]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]], [[Margaret Truman]] and others.&lt;ref name="vhs-marker"/&gt;

==Destruction by fire==
The Arena was built of wood in 1911. Not long before 1936, the Arena was clad in brick to reduce its risk of burning due to fire. On the night of August 19, 1936, 4,000 fans had attended a boxing match by [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]]. By 1:30 AM that night, a fire had broken out in the adjacent Coal Harbour area. Despite the recently added brick veneer, the fire spread to inside the Arena. The interior exploded into flame and the Arena could not be saved by Vancouver firemen. Stan Patrick, the youngest brother of Frank and Lester Patrick, and manager of the auditorium,{{sfn|Whitehead|1980|p=213}} attended the fire and was quoted as saying "You think this is a good fire? You should have seen the one in Victoria. That was a pip!" A lack of wind prevented the huge fire from spreading into downtown Vancouver. The overall damage of the fire was estimated at $500,000.&lt;ref name="prov-2013-08-17"/&gt; Two persons were killed and three firemen injured. The Arena was destroyed, along with seven industrial buildings, two homes and fifty-eight small boats.{{sfn|Whitehead|1980|p=213}} The concrete floor of the Arena was not destroyed, and it was adapted into an outdoor dance floor named the Starlight.&lt;ref name="prov-2013-08-17"/&gt;

In 1945, the site of the arena was sold by Lester Patrick to Vancouver theatre owner H. M. Singer for $80,000. Singer planned to build a $1 million sports arena on the site, but the arena was never built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Edmonton Journal |title=Vancouver Plans New Sports Arena |date=November 5, 1945 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer managed the Auditorium as a concert venue until 1959.

==Site today==
The site today is now part of Devonian Harbour Park. A historical marker has been placed at the foot of Denman Street, with information about the Arena, the Georgia Auditorium and Coal Harbour.&lt;ref name="vhs-marker"/&gt;

'''Fun Fair Positive Soccer (FFPS)''' is a 501(c)3 [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Houston, Texas]]. FFPS promotes non-competitive [[soccer]] in a fun, safe and positive environment 
.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ffps.org/Welcome.aspx#mission&lt;/ref&gt;
To ensure this, FFPS was designed with special rules and policies to enable equal play for every child in all positions. Founded in 1986 in [[Katy, Texas]], by Jack Hendrie, FFPS believes that every child should be accepted and included without a requirement to try out or perform.

==History==
Fun Fair Positive Soccer was founded in 1986 by Jack Hendrie and a group of dedicated parents in Katy, Texas, who believed there was a better way to provide every youth with a positive soccer experience. Rules and procedures were designed to give children the opportunity to play and enjoy soccer without the demands from adults to win or perform.

Five-a-side soccer rules were chosen, equal play rules with a unique equal substitution system were designed, balanced teams were instituted, and parent training was set up to ensure that games would be fair and positive. Parents were asked to “behave” and be positive toward their children.

In 1995, Jack began expanding FFPS beyond Katy to other areas of Houston. Since then, FFPS has grown to encompass 22 new leagues throughout the Greater Houston area and more than 15,000 players.

==Philosophy==
FFPS believes that each child has the desire to play, to be treated with respect and to be safe. The goal is for everyone to be successful: belong to a team, build self-esteem, have positive coaches and be positively involved parents. The FFPS system enables everyone to realize these values.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''The International Range Officers Association (IROA)''' is a part of [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]] with the responsibility to train and certify their own dedicated range officials ([[referee]]s),&lt;ref name="WhatIs"/&gt; who are responsible for conducting matches [[Gun safety|safely]], fair and according to the rules. In addition, each IPSC region have their own National Range Officers Institute (NROI) under the IROA.

[[File:Stage brief at the 2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot.jpg|thumb|right|A squad of shooters get their stage brief by an IROA Range Officer on stage 11 of the [[2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot]] in Russia.]]

In matches, range officials from IROA and NROI can work alongside in the ranks:

* '''Range Officer (RO)''' - The Range Officer gives the competitors stage briefings, issue range commands and follows the competitor through the conduction of the stage to monitor time, scores and safe firearms handling.
* '''Chief Range Officer (CRO)''' - In case there are several Range Officers, a Chief Range Officer will be assigned to have the primary authority over the particular course. Like the RO, the CRO will oversee fair and consistent application of the rules.
* '''Range Master (RM)''' - The Range Master has the overall authority over the [[Shooting range|entire range]] during the match, including all Match Officials and the overall safety.

Foy, V-ODK Sportsmanship Trophy''', more commonly known as the Foy-ODK Sportsmanship Trophy, is awarded annually to the winner of the [[Iron Bowl]] football [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalry]] game between the [[University of Alabama]] and [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref name="ODK1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/odk/Trophy.htm |title=The James E. Foy, V ODK Sportsmanship Trophy |author=ODK Auburn Chapter |publisher=Auburn.edu |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy's namesakes are Dean James E. Foy, V, who served at both Auburn and Alabama and the father of photojournalist [[Mary Lou Foy]], and [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] (ODK) National Leadership Honor Society, which has circles at both universities.&lt;ref name="ODK1"/&gt; In years of Auburn victories, the trophy is displayed at the [[Auburn Arena]] in the Jonathan B. Lovelace Hall of Honor, and following Alabama victories, the trophy resides in the [[Paul W. Bryant Museum]].&lt;ref name="ODKTCL"&gt;{{cite news |title=After 6-year hiatus, Iron Bowl trophy returns to UA |url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090303/NEWS/903021893/0/ENTERTAINMENT |first=Adam |last=Jones |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy was established in 1948 by the two circles of Omicron Delta Kappa to signify a good relationship between the two schools despite the bitter rivalry.&lt;ref name="ODK1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODKTCL"/&gt; In 1978, upon his retirement from Auburn University, the trophy was dedicated to Dean James Foy because of his importance to both schools.&lt;ref name="ODK1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODKBHM"&gt;{{cite news |title=James Edgar Foy, beloved Auburn dean, dies at 93 |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/10/james_edgar_foy_beloved_auburn.html |agency=Associated Press |publisher=al.com |date=October 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foy graduated from the University of Alabama and served there as the Assistant Dean of Students before serving as Dean of Students at Auburn University. Foy also served as the Faculty Secretary, the key faculty officer for ODK, for both circles.

Each year, the trophy is presented to the winning school by the losing school at the winners' home basketball game in the [[Iron Bowl of Basketball]], and then resides at the winning university through the following year.&lt;ref name="ODKTCL"/&gt; The ODK president from the losing school presents the trophy to the ODK president of the winning school during halftime of the basketball game, and tradition dictates that the presenter also sing the fight song of the winning school. This tradition is seen at University of Alabama SGA as President James Fowler sings the Auburn fight song in 2011.&lt;ref name="ODKTCL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bavYYAMXRxg|title=Auburn presented Iron Bowl trophy, fight song sung|first=|last=Michael Casagrande|date=22 January 2011|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circle from the losing school also treats the circle from winning school to dinner.&lt;ref name="ODK1"/&gt;

'''Jong Tae-se''' (romanization used by [[FIFA]], otherwise spelled as {{Nihongo|'''Chong Tese'''|鄭大世; チョン・テセ}} in [[J-League|Japan]] and [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga|Germany]]; [[hangul]]: 정대세, [[hanja]]: 鄭大世; {{Birth date|df=yes|1984|3|2||}}) is a [[Koreans in Japan|Japanese-born]] [[North Korea]]n [[Association football|football]]er, being one of a few North Koreans mainly played in the Japanese [[J-League]] or the German [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. He is most remembered for his key performance at [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] representing the [[North Korea national football team|North Korea national team]]. He is currently playing for and is the [[Captain (association football)|Captain]] of  [[Shimizu S-Pulse]].

==Early life==
Jong was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Japan]] to Korean parents [[Koreans in Japan|residing in Japan]]. Although some reports indicate that Jong's parents and Jong himself have [[South Korean nationality law|South Korean citizenship]], Jong has said that he is not [[South Korea]]n, but [[North Korea]]n as his family identify themselves as North Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/30/jong-tae-se-north-korea-wayne-rooney/ | title = Jong Tae-se is North Korea's answer to Wayne Rooney | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 11 February 2010 | accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother sent him to attend a private school in Japan run by [[Chongryon]], a group closely tied to the North Korean government&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web | url = http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/north-koreas-wayne-rooney/ | title = North Korea’s Wayne Rooney | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 11 February 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – where he started football at its elementary school club. He later attended [[Korea University (Japan)|Korea University]], a private university in [[Tokyo]] also funded by [[Chongryon]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Chongryon, North Korea's de facto embassy in Japan, issued a North Korean passport to him. This made him eligible, per [[FIFA]] rules, to play for North Korea and resulted in ''de facto ''[[dual nationality]].

Jong is fluent in [[Korean Language|Korean]] and [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]. He also knows how to speak [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]] which he learned from his Brazilian teammates at Japan's Kawasaki Frontale. He also speaks [[German Language|German]] from playing in [[Germany]]. He speaks cursory English, due to his trial in Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-pXhNxP2Pg | title = Jong Tae-Se habla portugues y promete lucha a Brasil en el mundial 2010.flv  | publisher = maurimc | date = 15 June 2010 | accessdate = 3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jong publicly emphasized the separation between [[sportsmanship]] and [[politics]] after the disputes before and during the match between North Korea and Japan on 15 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ji-ho (지호) | last = Lee (이) | script-title=ko:정대세, "北, 정치와 스포츠 구분해야" | date = 18 November 2011 | url = http://www.jpnews.kr/sub_read.html?uid=12056&amp;section=sc1 | work = JPNews | accessdate =19 November 2011 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
After joining [[Kawasaki Frontale]] in 2006, the striker quickly rose to become one of Kawasaki's best players and one of the best strikers in the [[J-League]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| title=Jong Tae-se is North Korea's answer to Wayne Rooney | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/30/jong-tae-se-north-korea-wayne-rooney | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=John | last=Duerden | date=30 May 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jong went for a trial with English club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in early 2010.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2890/world-cup-2010/2010/06/16/1978951/introducing-the-crying-north-korean-the-peoples-rooney-the | title = Introducing the crying North Korean, the 'Peoples' Rooney', the Blackburn nearly-man: Jong Tae-se | first = Zack | last = Wilson | publisher = Goal.com | date = 16 June 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2010 World Cup, Jong joined [[Germany|German]] club [[VfL Bochum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Bochum holt Jong Tae Se, neuer Gerichtstermin für Boateng | language=German | date = 9 July 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2012 | publisher = Spiegel Online |url= http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,705702,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; After one and half seasons in the [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]], Jong transferred to [[1. FC Köln]] in the [[Fußball-Bundesliga|1. Bundesliga]] in January 2012, following an injury to German international [[Lukas Podolski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chong Tese springt für Podolski ein|trans-title=Jong Tae-Se jumps in for Podolski|language=German|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=30 January 2012|publisher=[[Kicker (sports magazine)|kicker]]|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/564012/artikel_chong-tese-springt-fuer-podolski-ein.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his time at 1. FC Köln was marred by a lack of playing time.

On 3 January 2013, Jong announced that after he would start playing for the first-division South Korean K-League club, [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings]]. He had expressed interest in the move for several months before the announcement, and the Bluewings and [[Ulsan Hyundai FC]] had both been negotiating with him. Jong joined the South Korean outfit on 10 January 2013 for a reported fee of €300,000 from 1. FC Köln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://givemegoal.com/np/2013/01/10/suwon-bluewings-lands-jong-tae-se/ | title = Jong Tae-Se Joins Suwon Bluewings from FC koln | publisher = givemegoal.com | date = 10 January 2013 | accessdate = 13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After deliberation by [[K League 1]] and [[FIFA]] authorities, Jong was registered as a [[South Korea]]n (domestic) player in the K-League and [[AFC Champions League]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://japanese.joins.com/article/807/167807.html?servcode=600&amp;sectcode=610 | script-title=ja:＜サッカー＞"人民ルーニー"鄭大世、韓国国籍でＣＬ出場 | language = Japanese | publisher = japanese.joins.com | date = 1 February 2013 | accessdate = 25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April, he scored his debut goal for Suwon in a 3–1 home win against [[Daegu FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|trans-title=The first goal of Jung Tae Sea | title = '첫 승 실패' 서울, 5G 무승, 포항은 5G 무패... 정대세 첫 골(종합)  |url=http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1109570701 | language = Korean | publisher= Osen |date = 6 April 2013 | accessdate = 25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, 20 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win at [[Daejeon Citizen FC|Daejeon Citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|trans-title=[Classic round 8]' Jong Tae-se scored a hat-trick' Suwon wins a come-from-behind victory | title = [클래식 8R] ‘정대세 해트트릭’ 수원, 대전에 4-1 역전승 |url=http://sports.news.naver.com/sports/index.nhn?category=soccer&amp;ctg=news&amp;mod=read&amp;office_id=413&amp;article_id=0000003040 | language = Korean | publisher = sports.news.naver.com | date = 20 April 2013 | accessdate = 25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2015 he was bought by [[Shimizu S-Pulse]] as an emergency signing as Shimizu were in the drop zone after total points calculation from both stages of the season. He was inserted into the starting lineup on 25 July, Matchday 4 of the 2nd stage, away to his former club [[Kawasaki Frontale]] which ended in a 2–3 defeat.

==International career==
Jong's first international appearance was on 19 June 2007, during a [[2008 East Asian Football Championship#Group A|2008 East Asian Football Championship qualifier]] match against [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]] and he scored his first international goal in that game. He went on to score a total of four goals which Korea DPR won the match 7–0. Jong also played at the 2008 East Asian Football Championship and scored two goals in three matches for Korea DPR, receiving top scorer honors along with [[Park Chu-Young]], [[Yeom Ki-Hun]] and [[Koji Yamase]].

Before [[FIFA 2010 World Cup]] Jong was also the key figure in Korea DPR's [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign, as they qualified for the World Cup South Africa for the first time in 44 years. Jong had made himself famous for sobbing uncontrollably when [[Aegukka|the North Korean national anthem]] was played before the kickoff of Korea DPR's first group stage match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, against Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Steve | last = Anglesey | url = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/2010-world-cup-blog/World-Cup-2010-team-profile-10-weird-facts-about-North-Korea-including-Kim-Jong-Il-Kim-Jong-Hun-Jong-Tae-Se-and-more-article439739.html | title = Weird World Cup: 10 amazing facts about North Korea | publisher = The Mirror | date = 26 May 2010 | accessdate = 18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that match he assisted [[Ji Yun-Nam]]'s goal in a 2–1 defeat.&lt;ref name="PRKvBRA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2890/world-cup-2010/2010/06/15/1978503/world-cup-2010-player-ratings-brazil-21-north-korea|title=World Cup 2010 Player Ratings: Brazil 2–1 North Korea|last=Bairner|first=Robin|date=1 June 2010|publisher=goal.com|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[nickname]]d "the People's [[Wayne Rooney|Rooney]]" by the English press,&lt;ref name="PRKvBRA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/15/brazil-north-korea-world-cup-match-report|title=World Cup 2010: Brazil find finishing touch to edge out North Korea|last=Ingle|first=Sean|date=1 June 2010|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he likened his style of play to [[Didier Drogba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/06/08/north.korea.secret.team/index.html|title=The secret machine: Inside North Korea's World Cup squad|first=James|last=Montague|publisher=CNN|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kid Galahad''''' is a 1937 boxing film starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and, in the title role, rising newcomer [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]]. It was scripted by [[Seton I. Miller]] and directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].

It was remade in 1941, this time in a circus setting, as ''[[The Wagons Roll at Night]]'', also with Bogart, and in 1962 as an [[Elvis Presley]] [[Kid Galahad|musical]].&lt;ref name=TimeOut&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/kid-galahad |title=Kid Galahad |publisher=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version was re-titled '''''The Battling Bellhop''''' for television distribution in order to avoid confusion with the Presley [[remake]].

==Plot==
In Florida, boxing promoter Nick Donati (Edward G. Robinson) gets doublecrossed by his boxer, who throws a fight for a $25,000 bribe from gangster Turkey Morgan (Humphrey Bogart). Nick and his girlfriend "Fluff" (Bette Davis) decide to throw a wild, days-long party with the money they have left, before looking for a new boxing prospect. Nick orders naive young farmer turned hotel [[bellhop]] Ward Guisenberry ([[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]]) to mix some drinks, but he does not know how, as he does not drink. Fluff kindly helps him out. When Morgan, underling Buzz Barret ([[Ben Welden]]), and Chuck McGraw ([[William Haade]]), his fighter and new heavyweight champion, arrive uninvited, Ward does not like it when the somewhat drunk McGraw pushes Fluff, so he punches him, knocking him to the ground. Nick is impressed, and persuades him to try boxing.

For his first bout, Ward is up against McGraw's experienced brother. Much to everyone's surprise, he wins by knockout. To protect him from Morgan's wrath, Nick sends him, Fluff and ringside assistant Silver Jackson ([[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]]) to New York City by train. However, Morgan is waiting outside their usual hotel. He tries to get Ward to sign with him, but Ward knocks him down, insisting he will only sign with Nick.

Desperate, Fluff decides to hide the handsome young man at Nick's mother's farm. There he meets Nick's sister, Marie ([[Jane Bryan]]), fresh from a convent education. They clash. When Nick finds out, he is furious. He does not want his family to have anything to do with boxing. He takes Ward back to the city.

Ward, rechristened "Kid Galahad", wins a string of fights by knockout. He tells Fluff that his goal is to earn enough to buy a farm. Fluff falls for him, and is crushed when he confides to her that he is in love with Marie. She hides her disappointment, and with her encouragement, he drives up to tell Marie. It turns out that she is just as much in love with him. Fluff leaves Nick, confessing to him that she loves Ward and cannot bear to be around the young man. She gets a job singing in a nightclub.

In Ward's next fight, Nick orders him to just box and win on points, as knocking his opponent out would build public pressure to fight the champ too soon; Nick wants more time to train his fighter. However, Morgan tells his foe what to say to infuriate Ward. As a result, Ward wins by knockout.

Marie sees the fight; afterward they go out on the town. When she asks to see Fluff, Ward takes her to the nightclub. By coincidence, McGraw is in a private room there, drunk and with a couple of girls. When Morgan shows up to get him, McGraw spots Ward and pushes him to the floor. The two are separated, but Ward offers to fight within the month. Newspaper photographers take pictures of Ward with both Marie and Fluff. As a result, Nick finally learns that Ward has been seeing his sister.

Infuriated, Nick secretly turns on his boxer, agreeing to a title bout. He orders Ward to come out slugging, knowing it is a losing strategy. When Morgan discovers that Nick has placed substantial bets against his own fighter, he visits Nick. He learns that Nick wants to get back at Ward, and decides to bet $150,000 himself. During the bout, Ward faithfully follows Nick's orders and is knocked down repeatedly by McGraw. Fluff and Marie attend the fight together. When Fluff realizes what Nick is doing, she and Marie plead with him to stop. Nick finally comes to his senses and changes tactics. In the end, Ward knocks McGraw out and becomes world heavyweight champion.

After the fight, an armed Morgan arranges to be alone in the changing room with Nick, Ward and Silver. Nick is prepared though, and also has a gun. They exchange shots, fatal on both sides. Before he dies, Nick gives his blessing to Ward and Marie.

==Production==
According to his ''New York Times'' obituary of December 3, 1975, the playwright and screenwriter [[Lawrence Riley]], famous for his Broadway hit ''[[Personal Appearance]]'' (basis of [[Mae West]]'s ''[[Go West, Young Man]]),'' contributed to ''Kid Galahad'''s screenplay, although uncredited.

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Frank S. Nugent]] applauded Morris's "natural and easy performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=' Kid Galahad,' a Crisp Prize-Ring Film, Comes to the Strand and, With It, a New Star, Wayne Morris |author=Frank S. Nugent  |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 27, 1937 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/05/27/archives/the-screen-kid-galahad-a-crisp-prizering-film-comes-to-the-strand-a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] considered the film a "none too subtle exposition of the now well-worn theme of corruption in the boxing-ring", but conceded that "sleek direction and excellent performances keep it enjoyable."&lt;ref name=TimeOut/&gt; [[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' disagreed, characterizing it as "pretty much all genre and no nuance", though he found Curtiz's direction "surprising soft and light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kid Galahad |author=Dave Kehr |newspaper=Chicago Reader |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/kid-galahad/Film?oid=1151404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Field''' at [[Bray, Berkshire]] was a noted [[cricket]] ground in the late 18th century. It was used as the venue for four [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] between 1792 and 1795 in addition to several minor matches.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;Haygarth, pp.157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FC&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153247/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/matches.html Classification of cricket matches from 1697 to 1825]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2372_f.html CricketArchive – first-class matches at Old Field, Bray]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2372_misc.html CricketArchive – other matches at Old Field, Bray]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bray is near [[Maidenhead]] and the ground was the home venue of Maidenhead Cricket Club when it was founded in the second half of the 18th century. It was used for first-class matches by the [[Berkshire county cricket teams|Berkshire county team]] which was very strong at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153250/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1781.html#1785 From Lads to Lord's – 1785].  Retrieved on 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the venue is correctly rendered "Old Field, Bray"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2372.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Old Field, Bray |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the designation "Oldfield Bray" is given by ''Scores and Biographies'' (S&amp;B) which also calls the Berkshire team "Oldfield" in one match.&lt;ref name=SB/&gt; ''CricketArchive'' explains that S&amp;B and other sources use Oldfield Bray as if "Bray" were part of the name of the ground. It has been established that the ground was called Old Field and was located in the parish of Bray, which in the 18th century included the southern half of what became Maidenhead, where the Old Field Club was based. Maidenhead was created as a separate parish in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/162.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Berkshire v Marylebone Cricket Club 1792 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an [[Australian dollar|A$]]82 million state-of-the-art tennis facility opened on 2 January 2009&lt;ref name="DPW"&gt;{{cite news | title =Queensland Tennis Centre | work = | publisher =Department of Public Works | date = | url =http://www.publicworks.qld.gov.au/majorprojects/Pages/QldTennisCentre.aspx | accessdate =2009-11-25 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090516064232/http://www.publicworks.qld.gov.au/majorprojects/Pages/QldTennisCentre.aspx | archivedate =2009-05-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the site of the demolished [[Tennyson Power Station]].

It was designed by internationally recognised stadium designers [[HOK Sport Venue Event]] and The Mirvac Group's in-house architectural practice, HPA Pty Ltd&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;{{cite news | title =QLD Tennis Centre | work = | publisher =Tennis Australia | date = | url =http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/default.aspx?id=21&amp;pageId=12355 | accessdate =2009-11-25 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091027211808/http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/default.aspx?id=21&amp;pageId=12355 | archivedate =2009-10-27 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and constructed by [[Mirvac]] as part of the Tennyson Riverside development.

The main court was designed to incorporate a [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] glass fibre [[fabric structure|fabric roof]]. This [[tensile membrane structure]] allows diffused light through into the arena reducing the need for artificial lighting. The light weight of the fabric also reduced the amount of steel required and saved on building costs. Brisbane-based company [[Taiyo Membrane Corporation]] supplied and installed this roof along with other smaller outdoor structures at this venue.

It has twenty-three International Tennis Federation standard [[tennis court]]s, including the centre court and two showcase courts, representing all playing surfaces ([[hardcourt]], clay and grass).

The centre court ''Pat Rafter Arena'',&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.brisbaneinternational.com.au/2008/10/stadium-named-after-pat-rafter Stadium named after Pat Rafter]&lt;/ref&gt; named in honour of the Australian tennis player [[Patrick Rafter]], has a [[seating capacity]] of 5,500 (with an extra temporary seating of 1,500 bringing total capacity to 7,000).

Since January 2009 the Queensland Tennis Centre has been the host centre for combined men and women's international [[tennis]] tournament entitled the [[Brisbane International]], a combination of the former [[Next Generation Adelaide International]] event in Adelaide and the Mondial Gold Coast Women's championships.&lt;ref name="Adelaide to merge "&gt;{{cite news| title =Adelaide to merge with Brisbane in '09| work =| publisher =Tennis Australia| date =| url =http://www.tennisaustralia.com.au/pages/article.aspx?id=4&amp;articleid=ArticleID2006121112597&amp;pageId=11635&amp;HandlerId=1| accessdate =2009-11-26| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070901200512/http://www.tennisaustralia.com.au/pages/article.aspx?id=4&amp;articleid=ArticleID2006121112597&amp;pageId=11635&amp;HandlerId=1| archivedate =2007-09-01| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond James Stadium''', also known as "Ray Jay",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/music/u2-fans-line-up-before-dawn-at-ray-jay-stadium/1042679|title=U2 Fans Line Up Before Dawn at Ray Jay Stadium|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=November 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607190129/http://www.tampabay.com/features/music/u2-fans-line-up-before-dawn-at-ray-jay-stadium/1042679|archive-date=June 7, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-purpose [[American football|football]] stadium located in [[Tampa, Florida]]. It is home to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as well as the [[NCAA]]'s [[South Florida Bulls football team]]. The stadium seats 65,618.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raymondjames.com/stadium/faq.htm|title=Raymond James|website=www.raymondjames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of temporary seating, it can be expanded to 75,000 for special events. 

Raymond James Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]] and [[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]], as well as the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]]. It is also set to host [[Super Bowl LV]] in February 2021.

==History==
Raymond James Stadium was built to replace [[Tampa Stadium]] at the demand of the new Bucs owner [[Malcolm Glazer]]. It is located adjacent to the site of the old stadium on the former location of [[Al Lopez Field]], a minor-league baseball stadium that had been demolished in 1989. Once completed, the final cost of the new stadium was $168.5&amp;nbsp;million, with the entire cost publicly financed.&lt;ref name="paid off"&gt;{{cite news |title=Super Bowl 2001: We Paid for It; It Paid Off|first=Jeff|last=Testerman|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/012501/news_pf/SuperBowl2001/We_paid_for_it_it_pai.shtml|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=January 25, 2001|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was known as Tampa Community Stadium during construction, but the [[naming rights]] were bought for US$32.5&amp;nbsp;million for a 13–year deal by [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]-based [[Raymond James Financial]] in June 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/06/27/archive/main12734.shtml?source=search_story|title=Bucs' New Stadium Gets A Name, New name is 'The Raymond James Stadium'|work=CBS News|date=December 13, 1999|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 27, 2006, an extension was signed to maintain naming rights through 2015. In May 2016 the Buccaneers announced that the naming rights were extended an additional 12 years ensuring that Raymond James Financial's name will continue to appear through 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.buccaneers.com/news/article-1/Buccaneers-Announce-Stadium-Naming-Rights-Extension/071b85fc-44c3-4ad0-9b8e-3bf5b858d167|title=Raymond James Stadium Naming Rights Through 2028|work=buccaneers.com|date=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium officially opened on September 20, 1998&lt;ref&gt;http://raymondjamesstadium.com/stadium-history/&lt;/ref&gt;, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the [[Chicago Bears]], 27–15.  The stadium hosted its first soccer game on March 20, 1999, when the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] lost to [[D.C. United]], 5–2.

The stadium also hosts the annual [[Outback Bowl]] college football post-season game on [[New Year's Day]] since 1999. The [[Gasparilla Bowl]] will be held at the venue starting with the 2018 edition.

The stadium was selected to host the [[ACC Championship Game]] in 2008 and 2009.

The stadium is home field for the [[South Florida Bulls football|University of South Florida Bulls]] of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The team's record crowd at Raymond James Stadium is 69,383, on September 29, 2012, when the Bulls &amp;ndash; during their [[2012 South Florida Bulls football team|worst season ever]] &amp;ndash; played a non-conference game against the popular [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State University Seminoles]] from the powerhouse [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] for the first time.

The largest crowd ever recorded in Raymond James Stadium came on January 9, 2017 as the stadium hosted the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]]. 74,512 people were in attendance.

Through to the 2009 season, every Buccaneers game at Raymond James Stadium sold out. In 2010, no home game achieved a ticket sell out, so [[National Football League television blackout policies|none could be broadcast on local television]]. The streak carried over until week four of the 2011 season, when it sold enough tickets for its Monday night game with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] on October 3 to avoid a local blackout.

The [[Monster Jam]] tour for [[monster truck]]s holds an event at the stadium.

==Features==
[[File:pirate ship.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]
One of the most recognizable features of the stadium is a {{convert|103|ft|m|adj=on}}, 43-ton steel-and-concrete replica pirate ship in the north end zone. Each time the Bucs score points, enter the other team's [[red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]], or win a home game, the replica cannons on the ship are fired off. The cannons fire once for each point scored. In addition, when the Buccaneers enter their opponent's red zone, stadium hosts hoist team [[flag]]s around the perimeter of the upper deck. During various times throughout the game, the song "[[Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)]]" is played on the stadium public address system (taken from [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]), which signals patrons on board the ship to throw beads, t–shirts, and other free prizes to the people below. The segment is also known as a "Mini [[José Gaspar|Gasparilla]]" to most fans.  An animated parrot sits on the stern of the pirate ship.  Controlled by radio and remote control, the parrot picks fans out of the crowd and talks to those passing by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raymondjames.com/stadium/stadium_facts.htm|title=Raymond James Stadium &amp;#124; Stadium Facts|work=Raymondjames.com|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Super Bowl XXXV]] on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], the pregame, halftime, and post-game desk reporting took place from aboard the pirate ship. [[Football Night in America|NBC]]'s [[Super Bowl XLIII]] and [[ESPN College Football|ESPN]]'s [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]] coverage also emanated from the ship.

The two "Buc Vision" {{convert|2200|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} [[Daktronics]] video displays were among the largest in the league when they were built. In 2016 they were replaced with 9,600-square foot, high-definition video boards in both end zones. 'Buccaneer Cove' features a weathered, two–story fishing village [[facade]], housing stadium concessions and [[restroom]]s. All areas of the stadium are [[Americans with Disabilities Act|ADA]] compliant.

Temporary [[bleacher]]s were erected in the end zones for [[Super Bowl XXXV]], which set a then-record stadium attendance of 71,921. The stadium attendance record has since been surpassed by the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]], which also made use of temporary seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.tickpick.com/college-football-national-championship-seating-chart/|title=College Football National Championship Seating Chart 2017|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], the corner [[billboards]] in the stadium were replaced with rotating [[trilon]] billboards and these were replaced in 2016 with new high visibility displays.

Raymond James Stadium boasts the second-best turf in the NFL, according to a 2009 biannual players' survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=3870554|title=Top Turf in the NFL? Cards Best, Steelers Worst|work=ESPN.com|date=January 29, 2009|accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, the stadium was given an extensive facelift. The most notable improvement was the replacement of the {{convert|2200|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} video displays with state of the art, high visibility {{convert|9600|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} video displays in both the north and south end zones along with the addition of a new {{convert|2300|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} video tower in each corner. All together, the video displays cover more than {{convert|28,000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}}, making Raymond James Stadium the third-largest video displays in the NFL. The original sound system and the stadium's luxury boxes were also upgraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/tampa-bay-buccaneers/post/_/id/13835/bucs-raymond-james-stadium-unveils-first-portion-of-140m-makeover|title=Raymond James Stadium gets $140M Makeover|work=ESPN.com|date=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second round of improvements are planned for after the 2016 season is complete.

==Nicknames==
The stadium is referred to as "Ray Jay" or "The New Sombrero", a spinoff from "The Big Sombrero", the nickname of [[Tampa Stadium]]. Somewhat derisively, it has been occasionally referred to as "the CITS", a name coined by long-time local sportscaster Chris Thomas which stands for "Community Investment Tax Stadium", referring to the fact that the stadium was entirely financed by local taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chris Thomas Touched Us All|first=Eric|last=Deggans|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/02/20/Sports/_Chris_Thomas_touched.shtml|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=February 20, 2004|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
[[File:Raymondjames2005.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Buccaneer game action at Raymond James Stadium]]
* Immediately upon purchasing the Bucs in 1995, new owner [[Malcolm Glazer]] declared [[Tampa Stadium]] inadequate and began lobbying local government for a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bucs Stay in Tampa With a Big Price Tag|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4207/is_19950117/ai_n10181431|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227174157/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4207/is_19950117/ai_n10181431|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 27, 2008|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]|date=January 17, 1995|accessdate=February 14, 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt; When the community did not move quickly enough to suit the Glazer family, the new owners openly contacted several other cities around the U.S. about possible relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chareen|last=Williams|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-12-07/sports/9512061680_1_tampa-bay-buccaneers-joel-glazer-cleveland|title=Tampa Still Hopeful Bucs Will Stay Put|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=December 7, 1995|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The city of Tampa and Hillsborough County came up with a plan to fund a new stadium as part of a "Community Investment Tax", which was voted on in a [[referendum]] in September 1996. As part of the campaign to pass the referendum, Glazer promised to pay half the cost of the new stadium if fans put down 50,000 deposits on 10–year [[season ticket]] commitments. The drive fell 17,000 deposits short, the offer was withdrawn, and the Bucs did not pay any of the stadium's construction cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fantastic Voyage|first=Chris|last=Harry|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-07-24/sports/GLAZERS24A_1_joel-glazer-malcolm-glazer-bryan-glazer|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=July 24, 2005|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chipping In: Malcolm Glazer Says He'll Pay "About Half" the Cost of a New Stadium As a Seat-Deposit Plan Is Unveiled|first=Joe|last=Henderson|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB0F5479486B7D2&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_queryname=1|newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune]]|date=September 28, 1995|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 3, 1996, the voters of [[Hillsborough County, Florida]] approved, by 53% to 47% margin, a 30-year, half–cent sales tax to build new schools, improve public safety and infrastructure, and to build the Buccaneers a $192 million new stadium entirely with public money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Rose Despite Challenges|first=Wayne|last=Washington|url=http://www.sptimes.com/Sports/RJS/91898/Stadium_rose_despite_.html|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=September 18, 1998|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team signed a stadium lease in which the local government must pay for almost all of the stadium expenses while the franchise keeps almost all of the proceeds.&lt;ref name="paid off" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2007/09/12/biz_07nfl_all_slide_13.html |title=In Pictures: The Most Valuable NFL Teams |work=Forbes.com |date=September 12, 2007 |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011015207/http://www.forbes.com/business/2007/09/12/biz_07nfl_all_slide_13.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Tampa mayor Bill Poe sued to stop the deal, claiming that giving such a "sweetheart deal" to a private business violated [[Florida Constitution|Florida's state constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Tax Helped Pay for Bucs' Success|first=Jeff|last=Testerman|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/24/TampaBay/Stadium_tax_helped_pa.shtml|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=January 24, 2003|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local court agreed with Poe, but the Bucs and local government appealed. Eventually, the [[Supreme Court of Florida]] ruled that the agreement was constitutional, and construction continued as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Mayor's Opinion of Stadium Hasn't Changed|first=Michael|last=Canning|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/092901/news_pf/TampaBay/Former_mayor_s_opinio.shtml|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=September 29, 2001|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 31, 1996, the NFL owners met in [[New Orleans]] to select the host site for [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIV]]. [[Pro Player Stadium]] in the [[Miami]] area was selected to host Super Bowl XXXIII. [[Atlanta]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] and Tampa were candidates for Super Bowl XXXIV, with Tampa the favorite, following the successful tax referendum. The [[Georgia Dome]] in Atlanta, however, was awarded the game. As a compromise, Tampa was awarded Super Bowl XXXV, which the NFL had not originally planned to select that day.
* The last [[Major League Soccer]] game played at Raymond James Stadium was on September 9, 2001 when the Mutiny lost to the [[Columbus Crew]], 2–1, in front of 9,932 people.  Although the [[September 11 attacks]] resulted in the cancellation of the remainder of the [[2001 Major League Soccer season|2001 MLS regular season]], the Mutiny did not have any more home games scheduled anyway.  The Mutiny were subsequently disbanded by the league.  National-level soccer matches are still occasionally played at Raymond James, as its wide field makes it ideal for hosting soccer.
* In April 2003, the Tampa Sports Authority proposed passing ownership of the stadium to Hillsborough County to avoid having to pay millions of dollars in property taxes (The Bucs' lease agreement dictated that they not have to pay property taxes). However, Bucs had a right of refusal and refused to sign off on the plan unless the local government paid more of the cost for game–day security and increased the amount of (county-purchased) insurance coverage for the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tampabay: Tax Bill Swells as Bucs Stall|first=Bill|last=Varian|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/18/TampaBay/Tax_bill_swells_as_Bu.shtml|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=April 18, 2003|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute continued for months until December 2003, when the county legally declared the stadium a [[condominium]] and took ownership. As part of the change, the Bucs were given ownership of portions of the structure. To win the Bucs' approval, the county agreed to refund the team's resultant property tax payments annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hillsborough: Hillsborough Votes Yes on Plan to Own Stadium|first=Bill|last=Varian|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/06/Hillsborough/Hillsborough_votes_ye.shtml|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hillsborough: County Act Ends Tax on Stadium|first=Bill|last=Varian|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/12/18/Hillsborough/County_act_ends_tax_o.shtml|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=December 18, 2003|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 25, 2005, NFL owners met in Washington, D.C. to select the host site for [[Super Bowl XLIII]]. During the balloting, Raymond James Stadium defeated the [[Georgia Dome]] ([[Atlanta]]), [[Reliant Stadium]] ([[Houston]]), and [[Dolphins Stadium]] ([[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]]).
* After a nearly two-year legal battle, the Tampa Sports Authority came to a settlement with popular sports-seating and telescopic platform/bleacher company Hussey Seating of [[North Berwick, Maine]]. Following the stadium's opening in 1998, roughly 50,000 Hussey-manufactured seats at Raymond James Stadium began to fade from their original color – a bright, vibrant shade of red – to a shade of washed-out pink. Spotting this obvious defect, the Buccaneers organization pleaded to the TSA to sue the seating manufacturing company for the cost to replace the affected chairs in 2003. Initially, in May 2004, after testing samples of the seats, Hussey Seating did not find any cause for the fading, and thus, found no reason to replace the seats at the company's cost under the current 10–year [[warranty]]. After the TSA cited a portion of the warranty which did, in fact, state that Hussey would replace seats if any fading were to occur, Hussey president Tim Hussey admitted an error in the research and eventually would come to a $1.5 million agreement with the TSA to replace the problem seats. Reportedly, the seat-fading occurred due to a manufacturing error by Hussey, as a [[ultraviolet|UV]] inhibitor – a [[sunscreen]]-like component for the plastic – was forgotten in the mixture used to create the seats. All of the problem seats were replaced by new, non–pink seats in the spring of 2006.
* In December 2015, the Buccaneers and the Tampa Sports Authority reached an agreement to complete over $100 million in improvements and renovations to the stadium. The negotiations took months, and were extended by Bucs' lawyers demanding additional concessions after an agreement was near in September 2015.&lt;ref name="negotiations"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://events.tbo.com/news/localgovernment/how-the-raymond-james-stadium-negotiations-between-the-buccaneers-and-the/2248015 | title=How the Raymond James Stadium negotiations between the Buccaneers and the Tampa Sports Authority broke down | work=Tampa Tribune / tbo.com | date=1 October 2015 | accessdate=29 August 2016 | author=Contorno, Steve | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915001936/http://events.tbo.com/news/localgovernment/how-the-raymond-james-stadium-negotiations-between-the-buccaneers-and-the/2248015 | archive-date=September 15, 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the upgrades were paid with at least $29 million of public money, with the remainder paid for by the Bucs in exchange for the right to play a home game at another site beginning in the 2018 season and other concessions. Renovations began in January 2016, and the first phase was complete in time for the 2016 football season.&lt;ref name="2016renovation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/12/02/bucs-strike-raymond-james-stadium-renovation-deal/76653190/ | title=Bucs strike deal with county on stadium renovations | work=USA Today / WTSP | date=3 December 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2016 | author=Pransky, Noah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer==
The stadium was also home to the former [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] of [[Major League Soccer]] and continues to periodically host other soccer matches due to its accommodating field dimensions. For example, on June 8, 2012, it hosted the [[United States men's national soccer team]]'s opening qualifying match against Antigua and Barbuda for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], which the United States won 3-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/sports/soccer/a-world-cup-qualifying-victory-lacks-quality-for-the-us.html | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Godfrey | title=A World Cup Qualifying Victory Lacks Quality for the U.S | date=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 11, 2018, the [[Colombia men's national soccer team]] played against the [[United States men's national soccer team]] (4-2) to set the current attendance record of 38,361 for a soccer match at this stadium.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Read''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who made a single appearance for [[All-England cricket teams|All-England]] against the [[Hambledon Club]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] in 1773.&lt;ref name="CA9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/9.html |publisher=''CricketArchive'' |title=Kent v Surrey 1773 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake made one known first-class appearance, scoring 13 runs in his only innings. He did not bowl.&lt;ref name="CA9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Read had established his reputation by 1773, he must have been active for some years previously and his career probably began in the 1760s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Read.

'''Staouéli''' is a [[municipalities of Algeria|municipality]] in [[Algiers Province|Algiers]] [[provinces of Algeria|province]], [[Algeria]]. It is located in [[Zéralda District|Zéralda]] [[districts of Algeria|district]], on a [[Presque-isle]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], hosting the [[resort town]] of [[Sidi Fredj]]. There was a [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] circuit located in Staouéli. Grands Prix were held there from 1928–1930, but the circuit is no longer operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galpin|first=Darren|title=Staouéli|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/tracks/africa/staoueli.html|work=GEL Motorsport Information Page|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 the [[Trappists]] obtained a grant of 2500 acres of land on the site of the [[Battle of Staouéli]] (fought on June 19, 1830 during the [[French conquest of Algeria]]).  Here they have built a monastery where some 100 monks lived and worked. On the wall of the monastery is the inscription: ''S'il est triste de vivre à la Trappe, qu'il est doux d'y mourir'' (While it is sad to live here, it is sweet to die here).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2462">The '''Western Michigan University Soccer Complex''' is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] located in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] on the campus of [[Western Michigan University]]. Originally known as Lee Baker Field, the complex is adjacent to WMU's  Business, Technology &amp; Research Park and the Engineering College campus,  and is home to both the [[Western Michigan Broncos]] [[Western Michigan Broncos men's soccer|men's]] and [[Western Michigan Broncos women's soccer|women's]] soccer teams. The stands seat about 500, and there is standing room along the fencelines, particularly on the north and west sides.

The stadium opened in 2005. The first upgrades were in 2012, when the field was fenced and team shelters were added. A paved parking lot, a formal entry and walkways, and a press box were added in 2013. New bleacher seating was installed in 2015, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmubroncos.com/sports/2016/7/25/wmu-soccer-complex.aspx?id=1340 |title=WMU Soccer Complex |publisher=Western Michigan University |accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grass turf of the playing field received a major overhaul of during the summer of 2017 with removal of the top layer of soil by fraze mowing, laser-guided grading, and a new drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/2017/04/22/western-michigan-broncos-soccer-complex-renovation/100778608/ |title=Metro &amp; state: WMU getting $75,000 renovations at soccer complex |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=April 22, 2017 |accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a new scoreboard was installed along with new fencing, a new flagpole, and new nets behind the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wmubroncos.com/facilities/?id=11 |title=WMU Soccer Complex |publisher=Western Michigan University |accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the stadium, the complex includes a full-sized practice field, electronic scoreboard and sound system, covered bench shelters, and a concession stand with a storage shed.
