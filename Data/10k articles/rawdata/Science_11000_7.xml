'''Anders Gustaf Ekeberg''' ([[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], 16 January 1767 &amp;ndash; [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], 11 February 1813) was a Swedish [[chemist]] who discovered [[tantalum]] in 1802. He was notably [[deaf]].&lt;ref name="Book Review"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=10.1086/345053 | title=Book Review | author=Lang, Harry G. | journal=Isis |date=June 2002 | volume=93 | issue=2 | pages=356–357 | doi=10.1086/345053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anders Gustav Ekeberg was a Swedish scientist, mathematician and expert in Greek literature. He was a gifted student and enrolled at [[Uppsala University]] 1784, graduating in 1788. He was made [[docent]] in chemistry 1794 and experimentator (''laborator'') 1799. In 1799, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. [[Carl Gustaf Ekeberg]] was his uncle.

Ekeberg is credited with finding the element tantalum in two different minerals, specifically, tantalite from Kimito, Finland and yttrotantalite from Ytterby, Sweden. Ekeberg named the new element after the mythical Ancient Greek demigod Tantalus who, according to legend, was condemned to eternal frustration when he had to stand in water up to his neck, but the water receded as he attempted to drink.&lt;ref&gt;Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center (T.I.C.), https://www.tanb.org/about-tantalum/tantalum-history&lt;/ref&gt;

Ekeberg suffered from poor health throughout his life. During his childhood a severe cold had impaired his hearing, which was further weakened over the years, so that it hindered his teaching activities. Subsequently, a gas explosion blinded him in one eye. Ekeberg was portrayed by his friends and students as a kind and gentle man. He died, unmarried, at the age of 46.

'''The Anders Gustaf Ekeberg Tantalum Prize'''

In 2018 the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center established The Anders Gustaf Ekeberg Tantalum Prize ("Ekeberg Prize"), an annual award to recognize excellence in tantalum research. The Prize will increase awareness of the many unique properties of tantalum products and the applications in which they excel.&lt;ref&gt;Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center (T.I.C.), https://www.tanb.org/view/prize&lt;/ref&gt; 
The inaugural winner of the Ekeberg Prize was Dr Yuri Freeman for his book “Tantalum and Niobium-Based Capacitors” (Springer, 2018).

In mathematics, the '''angle condition''' is a constraint that is satisfied by the locus of points in the [[s-plane]] on which [[closed-loop pole]]s of a system reside.  In combination with the [[magnitude condition]], these two mathematical expressions fully determine the [[root locus]].

Let the characteristic equation of a system be &lt;math&gt;1+\textbf{G}(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=\frac{\textbf{P}(s)}{\textbf{Q}(s)}&lt;/math&gt;.  Rewriting the equation in [[polar form]] is useful.

: &lt;math&gt;e^{j2\pi}+\textbf{G}(s)=0 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=-1=e^{j(\pi+2k\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; are the only solutions to this equation.  Rewriting &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in [[factorization|factored form]],

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=\frac{\textbf{P}(s)}{\textbf{Q}(s)}=K\frac{(s-a_1)(s-a_2) \cdots (s-a_n)}{(s-b_1)(s-b_2)\cdots(s-b_m)},&lt;/math&gt;

and representing each factor &lt;math&gt;(s-a_p)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(s-b_q)&lt;/math&gt; by their [[vector (geometric)|vector]] equivalents, &lt;math&gt;A_pe^{j\theta_p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_qe^{j\varphi_q}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; may be rewritten.

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)=K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_ne^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n)}}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m e^{j(\varphi_1+\varphi_2+\cdots+\varphi_m)}}&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying the characteristic equation, 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e^{j(\pi+2k\pi)} &amp; = K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_ne^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n)}}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m e^{j(\varphi_1+\varphi_2+\cdots+\varphi_m)}} \\[6pt]
&amp; = K\frac{A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n}{B_1 B_2 \cdots B_m}e^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n-(\varphi_1+\varphi_2+\cdots+\varphi_m))},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

from which we derive the angle condition:

: &lt;math&gt;\pi+2k\pi=\theta_1+\theta_2+\cdots+\theta_n-(\varphi_1+\varphi_2+\cdots+\varphi_m) &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, 

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_1,\theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n &lt;/math&gt;

are the angles of zeros 1 to ''n'', and

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1,\varphi_2, \ldots, \varphi_m &lt;/math&gt;

are the angles of poles 1 to ''m''.

The [[magnitude condition]] is derived similarly.

'''Auguste Aymard''' (1808–1889) was a [[France|French]] [[Prehistory of France|prehistorian]] and [[Palaeontology|palaeontologist]] who lived and died in [[Puy-en-Velay]] (Haute-Loire). He described the fossil ''[[Entelodon magnus]]'' and the fossil genera ''[[Anancus]]'' and ''[[Amphechinus]]''.
Auguste Aymard  was the archivist  for the Departement  Haute-Loire and Conservateur of Musée du Puy-en-Velay. He made archaeological discoveries in Puy-en-Velay, [[Polignac, Haute-Loire]] and [[Espaly-Saint-Marcel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3774">'''Axiom of Maria''' is a precept in [[alchemy]]:  "One becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the one as the fourth."  It is attributed to 3rd century alchemist [[Mary the Jewess|Maria Prophetissa]], also called the Jewess, sister of Moses, or the Copt.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, CW 12, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] gives an alternative version this:  "Out of the One comes Two, out of Two comes Three, and from the Third comes the One as the Fourth."&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] (1875&amp;ndash;1961) used the axiom as a metaphor for the process of [[individuation]]. ''One'' is unconscious wholeness; ''two'' is the conflict of opposites; ''three'' points to a potential resolution; ''the third'' is the transcendent function, described as a "psychic function that arises from the tension between consciousness and the unconscious and supports their union";&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; and ''the one as the fourth'' is a transformed state of consciousness, relatively whole and at peace.

Jung speaks of the axiom of Maria as running in various forms through the whole of alchemy like a ''leitmotiv.''  In "The Psychology of the Transference"  he writes of the fourfold nature of the transforming process using the language of Greek alchemy:
:"It begins with the four separate elements, the state of chaos, and ascends by degrees to the three manifestations of Mercurius&lt;ref&gt;Haeffner, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; in the inorganic, organic, and spiritual worlds; and, after attaining the form of Sol and Luna (i.e., the precious metal gold and silver, but also the radiance of the gods who can overcome the strife of the elements by love), it culminates in the one and indivisible (incorruptible, ethereal, eternal) nature of the ''anima'', the ''quinta essentia'', ''aqua permanens'', tincture, or ''lapis philosophorum''.  This progression from the number 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 is the 'axiom of Maria'..."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, CW 16, p.207 (par.404)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Axiom of Maria may be interpreted as an alchemical analogy of the process of individuation from the many to the one, from undifferentiated unconsciousness to individual consciousness.

A '''capital improvement plan''' ('''CIP'''), or '''capital improvement program''', is a short-range plan, usually four to ten years, which identifies capital projects and equipment purchases, provides a planning schedule and identifies options for financing the plan. Essentially, the plan provides a link between a
[[municipality]], [[school district]], [[municipal parks|parks and recreation department]] and/or other local government entity and a comprehensive and [[strategic plan]] and the entity's annual [[budget]].

==Benefits==
A CIP provides many benefits including: 
* Allows for a systematic evaluation of all potential projects at the same time. 
* The ability to stabilize debt and consolidate projects to reduce borrowing costs. 
* Serve as a public relations and economic development tool. 
* A focus on preserving a governmental entity's [[infrastructure]] while ensuring the efficient use of [[public funds]]. 
* An opportunity to foster cooperation among departments and an ability to inform other units of government of the entity's priorities. For example, it is not uncommon for a large city or county to incorporate into its CIP the capital needs of a school district, parks and recreation department and/or some other public service structure.

==Features==
The CIP typically includes the following information:

* A listing of the capital projects or equipment to be purchased
* The projects ranked in order of preference
* The plan for financing the projects
* A timetable for the construction or completion of the project
* Justification for the project
* Explanation of expenses for the project

==Overall process==
Prior to undertaking the development of the CIP, the government entity will want to define the criteria for what kind of projects or equipment are to be included and organize a process for developing the plan. What is defined as a capital project or capital purchase may vary from city to county to district to state depending on the size of the local government provisioning the plan. Generally, they will be tangible items that have a life expectancy greater than one year.

A local government will also need to forecast where it believes it will face future demands and growth, which will involve an inventory of existing facilities, infrastructure and equipment. In addition, a local government will want to develop basic policies for implementing the plan. Because the CIP includes financing issues, the municipality may want to seek advice from their financial advisor and/or bond counsel. A review of the municipality's current finances is also vital.

Once the CIP is finalized, the local government may be required to hold a [[town meeting|public hearing]] before the plan is adopted by a [[city council]], a board of regents and/or a bond review commission.

==Specific steps==
# Establish a capital planning committee with bylaws
# Take inventory of existing capital assets
# Evaluate previously approved, unimplemented or incomplete projects
# Assess financial capacity
# Solicit, compile and evaluate new project requests
# Prioritize projects
# Develop a financing plan
# Adopt a capital improvement program
# Monitor and manage approved projects within the CIP
# Update existing/ongoing capital programs

The '''City Mayors Foundation''', also known as '''City Mayors''', is an international think tank dedicated to urban affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newing |first=Rod |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f149eb60-6190-11df-aa80-00144feab49a.html#axzz1aIYappPj |title=Funding and social capital are key factors in financing regeneration |publisher=FT.com |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been active since 2003 and runs the biennial [[World Mayor]] award, as well as providing pro bono consultancy services.  Unlike [[Eurocities]] and [[United Cities and Local Governments]] it is wholly independent of any city.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/city_mayors.html |title=City Mayors: About City Mayors  |work=citymayors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City Mayors has instituted a Code of Ethics for city leaders who wish to perform their duties beyond all reproach. Preamble from the Code: "Good and honest local government is the foundation of any nation that strives to provide its citizens with happiness, security and prosperity. Incompetence, corruption and misconduct in local government threaten fundamental decency in a society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/code-ethics.html |title=City Mayors: Code of Ethics  |work=citymayors.com|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also publishes books as an imprint on urban affairs.

The City Mayors Foundation commissions the trophy presented as the World Mayor Award. The trophy was designed by artist Manuel Ferrari and is handmade out of steel by the metalworker Kaspar Swankey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swankeypankey.com/g004.html |title=Kaspar Swankey  |work=swankeypankey.com  |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The City Mayors Foundation was set up in 2003 by Tann vom Hove (UK/Germany), Ruth Maguire (UK), Guy Kervella (UK/France), Nick Swift (Canada) and Josh Fecht (USA). In 2004 Andrew Stevens (UK), Mayraj Fahim (USA), Tony Favro (USA) and Adriana Maciel (Mexico) joined City Mayors.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

'''Co-Extra''' was an EU-funded research programme on [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|''co-ex''istence]] and [[Traceability|''tra''ceability]] of [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified crops]] and their edible derivatives that ran from 2005-2009.&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Agriculture Library [http://fsrio.nal.usda.gov/nal_web/fsrio/printresults.php?ID=4201 CO-EXTRA - GM and Non-GM Supply Chains: Their CO-EXistence and TRAceability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216190857/http://fsrio.nal.usda.gov/nal_web/fsrio/printresults.php?ID=4201 |date=2014-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was granted €13.5 million under the [[Sixth Framework Programme]] of the European Union, and is conducted by more than 200 scientists in 52 organisations in 18 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/biosociety/food_quality/projects/045_en.html Project description]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research goals==
The research programme studied and validated [[biological containment]] methods, forged supply chain organisations, and provided practical tools and methods for implementing co-existence between GMO-based (i.e., based on the use of genetically modified organisms) and non-GMO-based supply chains.

With regard to supporting cost-effective documentary traceability, Co-Extra was aimed at devising reliable, analytical detection methods, and at establishing the most appropriate methods of collecting, organising and distributing information. A core programme objective was the provision, to all stakeholders of food and feed chains, of a central decision-support system incorporating all necessary institutional tools, methods, models and guidelines.

==Work packages==
The programme was structured in eight work packages (WP):
* WP 1: Biology approaches for gene flow mitigation
* WP 2: Supply chain analysis, description and modelling
* WP 3: Economic costs and benefits of co-existence and traceability
* WP 4: Development testing and sampling approaches
* WP 5: Development and integration of analytical traceability tools
* WP 6: Technical challenges of GMO detection
* WP 7: Integration with respect to legal, scientific, social and ethical issues
* WP 8: Dialogue and communication

==Dissemination of research results==
The editorial team of WP 8 presented all findings on the programme's website (no longer in existence as of 2014), which had been written and designed for an audience of stakeholders and interested lay persons. The website also supplied background information on the public debate on co-existence and traceability in many EU countries, as well as on the current status of implementation of co-existence and traceability legislation and measures.

The concept of a link between '''creativity and mental illness''' has been extensively discussed and studied by psychologists and other researchers for centuries. Parallels can be drawn to connect creativity to major [[mental disorder]]s including: [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]], and [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]]. For example, studies{{which|date=November 2017}} have demonstrated correlations between creative occupations and people living with mental illness. There are cases that support the idea that mental illness can aid in creativity, but it is also generally agreed that mental illness does not have to be present for creativity to exist.

== History ==
It has been proposed that there is a particular link between creativity and mental illness (e.g. [[bipolar disorder]], whereas [[major depressive disorder]] appears to be significantly more common among playwrights, novelists, biographers, and artists).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, F. and Jamison, K. R., ''Manic Depressive Illness'', Oxford University Press (Oxford, 1990), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Association between mental illness and creativity first appeared in literature in the 1970s, but the idea of a link between "madness" and "genius" is much older, dating back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]]. In order to comprehend how the connection between “madness” and “genius” correlate, first understand that there are different types of geniuses: [[Literature|literary]] geniuses, [[Creativity|creative]] geniuses, [[scholar|scholarly]] geniuses, and “all around” geniuses. Since there are many different categories, this means that individuals can completely excel in one subject and know an average, or below average, amount of information about others.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, James C. "Two." Creativity and Mental Illness. United Kingdom: Cambridge U House, 2014. 31–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Greeks believed that creativity came from the gods, in particular the [[Muse]]s (the mythical personifications of the arts and sciences, the nine daughters of [[Zeus]]). In the Aristotelian tradition, conversely, genius was viewed from a [[Physiology|physiological]] standpoint, and it was believed that the same human quality was perhaps responsible for both extraordinary achievement and melancholy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/09/what-is-a-genius|title=What is a Genius?|last=Romeo|first=Nick|website=The Daily Beast|date=November 9, 2013|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic writers had similar ideals, with Lord Byron having pleasantly expressed, "We of the craft are all crazy. Some are affected by gaiety, others by melancholy, but all are more or less touched".

Individuals with mental illness are said to display a capacity to see the world in a novel and original way; literally, to see things that others cannot.&lt;ref name="Andreasen"&gt;Andreasen, N.C. (2011), [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2011;volume=9;issue=1;spage=42;epage=53;aulast=Andreasen "A journey into chaos: Creativity and the unconscious"], Mens Sana Monographs, 9:1, p&amp;nbsp;42–53. Retrieved 2011-03-27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
For many years, the creative arts have been used in therapy for those recovering from mental illness or addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/arts-and-health/201406/creative-arts-therapy-and-expressive-arts-therapy|title=Creative Arts Therapy and Expressive Arts Therapy|last=Malchiodi|first=Cathy|magazine=Psychology Today|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heenan|first1=Deirdre|title=Art as therapy: an effective way of promoting positive mental health?|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=March 2006|volume=21|issue=2|pages=179–191|doi=10.1080/09687590500498143|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687590500498143|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found creativity to be greater in [[schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 Actual paper])&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, [[ambidexterity]] is also associated with [[schizotypal]] and [[schizophrenic]] individuals.

Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Batey M. Furnham | year = 2009 | title = The relationship between creativity, schizotypy and intelligence | url = | journal = Individual Differences Research | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 272–284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Batey M., Furnham A. | year = 2008 | title = The relationship between measures of creativity and schizotypy | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 45 | issue = 8| pages = 816–821 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2008.08.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hypomanic personality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furnham A., Batey M., Anand K., Manfield J. | year = 2008 | title = Personality, hypomania, intelligence and creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = 5| pages = 1060–1069 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.10.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several{{which|date=November 2017}} different measures of creativity.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writers]], [[poets]] and [[artists]]. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]].

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and [[substance abuse]], and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to experience psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] and, to some extent, [[autism]], the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

Research in this area is usually constrained to cross-section data-sets. One of the few exceptions is an economic study of the well-being and creative output of three famous music composers over their entire lifetime.&lt;ref name="How Are You, My Dearest Mozart?"&gt;Karol J. Borowiecki, [http://ideas.repec.org/p/hhs/sdueko/2013_020.html "How Are You, My Dearest Mozart? Well-being and Creativity of Three Famous Composers Based on their Letters"]  Review of Economics and Statistics, 2017, 99(4): 591-605.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional indicators are obtained from letters written by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Liszt]], and the results indicate that negative emotions had a causal impact on the creative production of the artists studied.

[[Stress (psychological)|Psychological stress]] has also been found to impede spontaneous creativity.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx The science of creativity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron, K., Khazanchi, S., &amp; Nazarian, D.

https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0017868&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study at the Stanford University School of Medicine measured creativity by showing children figures of varying complexity and symmetry and asking whether they like or dislike them. The study showed for the first time that a sample of children who either have or are at high risk for bipolar disorder tend to dislike simple or symmetric symbols more. Children with bipolar parents who were not bipolar themselves also scored higher dislike scores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/11/051109092005.htm Children Of Bipolar Parents Score Higher On Creativity Test, Stanford Study Finds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

It is thus likely that when creativity itself is associated with positive moods, happiness, and mental health, pursuing a career in the arts may bring problems with stressful environment and income. Other factors such as the centuries-old [[stereotype]] of the suffering of a "mad artist" help to fuel the link by putting expectations on how an artist should act, or possibly making the field more attractive to those with mental illness. Additionally, where specific areas of the brain are less developed than others by nature or external influence, the spacial capacity to expand another increases beyond "the norm" allowing enhanced growth and development.

== Lessons from computational psychology  ==
Simulations by Stephen Thaler of limbo-thalamo-cortical loops engaged in invention, discovery, and artistic endeavors reveal a critical link between various psychopathologies and creativity. These contemplative artificial neural systems exploit the computational equivalent of volume-released neurotransmitters, namely random, hopping disturbances applied to connection weights in a process tantamount to [[neuromodulation]], the diffusive molecular infiltration of the brain's synapses.&lt;ref&gt;Ricciardiello L, Fornaro P. Beyond the Cliff of Creativity: a novel key to bipolar
disorder and creativity. Med. Hypotheses 2013;2012(80). 534–453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mind2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paradigm" /&gt; These disturbances seed the formation of the novel neural activation patterns necessary for creativity.&lt;ref name="cycles"&gt;Thaler, SL, Cycles of insanity and creativity within contemplative neural systems, [[Medical Hypotheses]]. 2016. 94:138–147,  {{DOI|10.1016/j.mehy.2016.07.010}} | url=http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(16)30363-2/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="synpert"&gt;Thaler, SL.

Thaler, A quantitative model of seminal cognition: the creativity machine paradigm (US Patent 5,659,666), Dublin Ireland: Mind II Conference, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Close observation of such artificial neural systems as they engage in creative problem solving tasks reveals a cyclic or ‘tidal’ variation in synaptic chaos. At higher disturbance levels, ideas form as the memories and [[Confabulation (neural networks)|confabulations]] absorbed within multiple neural modules weakly couple into transient, subliminal notions that go unnoticed by critic neural modules incapacitated by the synaptic chaos. As disturbance levels subside, certain neural modules may lucidly perceive novelty, utility, or value to these oftentimes half-baked notions that then perfect themselves, consolidating into full-blown ideas coupled with accompanying affective responses. Extending these computational findings to human cognition, creativity cannot be attributed to any given brain state or mood. Instead, it is a hysteretic effect brought about by multiple transits through chaotic and quiescent phases. The more intense these swings, the more novel the creative product, but at the expense of increasingly severe cognitive pathologies, including hallucinations, confusion, inattention to the external environment, and inability to differentiate imagination from reality.&lt;ref name="cycles" /&gt; In addition to providing a transparent artificial neural system by which to study creative cognition, such brain simulations provide evaluation metrics for originality and utility that are quantitative rather than subjective.&lt;ref name="synpert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, SL, A neurodynamic model linking creativity and insanity, Atlas of Science, 2017.| url=https://atlasofscience.org/a-neurodynamic-theory-linking-creativity-and-insanity/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bipolar disorder ==
{{Main|Bipolar disorder}}
Bipolar disorder is one of the main mental disorders said to inspire creativity, as the manic episodes are typically characterised by prolonged and elevated periods of energy. In her book, ''Touched With Fire'', American clinical psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison wrote that 38% of writers and poets had been treated for a type of [[mood disorder]], and virtually all creative writers and artists (89%) had experienced "intense, highly productive, and creative episodes". These were characterised by "pronounced increases in enthusiasm, energy, self-confidence, speed of mental association, fluency of thought and elevated mood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/445006821|title=Touched with fire : manic-depressive illness and the artistic temperament|last=R.|first=Jamison, Kay|date=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=068483183X|oclc=445006821}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a range of types of bipolar disorder. Individuals with Bipolar I Disorder experience severe episodes of mania and depression with periods of wellness between episodes. The severity of the manic episodes can mean that the person is seriously disabled and unable to express the heightened perceptions and flight of thoughts and ideas in a practical way. Individuals with Bipolar II Disorder experience milder periods of hypomania during which the flight of ideas, faster thought processes and ability to take in more information can be converted to art, poetry or design.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, G., (ed.) "Bipolar II Disorder: modeling, measuring and managing", Cambridge University Press (Cambridge,2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]] is widely theorised to have suffered from bipolar disorder. Other notable creative people with bipolar disorder include [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Stephen Fry]] (who suffers from [[Cyclothymia|cyclothimia]], a milder and more chronic form of bipolar)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclothymia/symptoms-causes/syc-20371275|title=Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder) - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Mariah Carey]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], and [[Patty Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/famous-people-celebrities-bipolar|title=Famous people with bipolar disorder|date=2018-04-11|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schizophrenia ==
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}

People with schizophrenia live with positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms (psychotic behaviors that are not present in healthy people): hallucinations, delusions, thought &amp; movement disorders. Negative symptoms (abnormal functioning of emotions and behavior): "flat affect", Anhedonia, reserved. Cognitive symptoms: problems with "executive functioning", attention, and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Schizophrenia|url = http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml#part_145430|website = www.nimh.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One artist known for his schizophrenia was the Frenchman [[Antonin Artaud]], founder of the [[Theatre of Cruelty]] movement. In ''Madness and Modernism'' (1992), clinical psychologist [[Louis Sass|Louis A. Sass]] noted that many common traits of schizophrenia – especially fragmentation, defiance of authority, and multiple viewpoints – happen to also be defining features of [[modern art]].&lt;ref name="FreyOnJamison"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://hyperallergic.com/376339/a-new-account-of-robert-lowells-mania-risks-glorifying-it/|title=A New Account of Robert Lowell’s Mania Risks Glorifying It|last=Frey|first=Angelica|magazine=Hyperallergic|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

== Arguments that support link ==
In a 2002 conversation with [[Christopher Langan]], educational psychologist [[Arthur Jensen]] stated that the relationship between creativity and mental disorder "has been well researched and is proven to be a fact", writing that [[Schizothymia|schizothymic]] characteristics are somewhat more frequent in philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.megafoundation.org/MegaPress/Titles/Jensen.html|title=Discussions on Genius and Intelligence|publisher=Mega Foundation Press|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ufs|date=November 2017}} In a 2015 study, Iceland scientists found that people in creative professions are 25% more likely to have gene variants that increase the risk of [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]], with [[deCODE Genetics]] co-founder [[Kári Stefánsson]] saying, "Often, when people are creating something new, they end up straddling between sanity and insanity. I think these results support the concept of the mad genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11661332/Creative-people-are-more-likely-to-suffer-from-mental-illness.html|title=Creative people are more likely to suffer from mental illness, study claims|last=Turner|first=Camilla|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

=== Psychosis ===
Many famous historical figures gifted with creative talents may have been affected by bipolar disorder. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Judy Garland]] and [[Robert Schumann]] are some people whose lives have been researched to discover signs of mood disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Goodnick, P.J. (ed.) Mania: clinical and research perspectives. American Psychiatric Press, Washington, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, creativity and psychosis share some common traits, such as a tendency for "[[thinking outside the box]]," flights of ideas, speeding up of thoughts and heightened perception of visual, auditory and somatic stimuli.

It has been found that the brains of creative people are more open to environmental stimuli due to smaller amounts of [[latent inhibition]], an individual's unconscious capacity to ignore unimportant stimuli. While the absence of this ability is associated with psychosis, it has also been found to contribute to original thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/10/031001061055.htm|title=Biological Basis For Creativity Linked To Mental Illness|website=Science Daily|date=October 1, 2003|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

=== Emotions ===
Many people with bipolar disorder may feel powerful emotions during both depressive and manic phases, potentially aiding in creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/52456?pageNumber=3 Are Genius and Madness Related? Contemporary Answers to an Ancient Question | Psychiatric Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Because (hypo)mania decreases social inhibition, performers are often daring and bold. As a consequence, creators commonly exhibit characteristics often associated with mental illness. The frequency and intensity of these symptoms appear to vary according to the magnitude and domain of creative achievement. At the same time, these symptoms are not equivalent to the full-blown psychopathology of a clinical manic episode which, by definition, entails significant impairment.&lt;ref name="simonton2005"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/are-genius-and-madness-related-contemporary-answers-ancient-question|title = Are Genius and Madness Related?

=== Posthumous diagnosis ===
Some creative people have been [[Retrospective diagnosis|posthumously diagnosed]] as experiencing bipolar or unipolar disorder based on biographies, letters, correspondence, contemporaneous accounts, or other anecdotal material, most notably in [[Kay Redfield Jamison]]'s book ''[[Touched with Fire|Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament]]''.&lt;ref name="TWF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament|author=Kay Redfield Jamison|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-83183-1|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} ''Touched With Fire'' presents the argument that bipolar disorder, and affective disorders more generally,&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, K. R., ''Touched with Fire'', Free Press (New York, 1993), pp 82 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} may be found in a disproportionate number of people in creative professions such as [[actors]], [[artist]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[musician]]s, [[author]]s, [[Performing arts|performer]]s and [[poet]]s.

=== Positive correlation ===
Several recent clinical studies have also suggested that there is a positive [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between creativity and bipolar disorder, although the relationship between the two is unclear.&lt;ref name=santosa2006&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Santosa CM, Strong CM, Nowakowska C, Wang PW, Rennicke CM, Ketter TA |title=Enhanced creativity in bipolar disorder patients: a controlled study |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=100 |issue=1–3 |pages=31–9 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17126406 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.10.013 }}

=== Bottom-up psychology ===
Brain simulations built from artificial neural nets manifest the classic psychopathologies as they push themselves toward higher levels of creativity.&lt;ref name="cycles" /&gt;

=== Mental illness and divergent thinking ===
In 2017, associate professor of psychiatry [[Gail Saltz]] stated that the increased production of [[divergent thinking|divergent thoughts]] in people with mild-to-moderate mental illnesses leads to greater creative capacities. Saltz argued that the "wavering attention and day-dreamy state" of ADHD, for example, "is also a source of highly original thinking. [...] CEOs of companies such as [[IKEA|Ikea]] and [[JetBlue|Jetblue]] have ADHD. Their creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, high energy levels, and disinhibited manner could all be a positive result of their negative affliction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/959936/there-are-some-positives-to-mental-illness-to-remove-the-stigma-we-need-to-accept-how-complex-and-sometimes-beautiful-it-is/|title=To remove the stigma of mental illness, we need to accept how complex—and sometimes beautiful—it is|last=Saltz|first=Dr. Gail|website=Quartz|date=April 16, 2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mania has also been credited with aiding in creativity because "when speed of thinking increases, [[word association]]s form more freely, as do [[Glossary of psychiatry#F|flight of ideas]], because the manic mind is less inclined to filtering details that, in a normal state, would be dismissed as irrelevant."&lt;ref name="FreyOnJamison"/&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

== Arguments against a link ==
Albert Rothenberg of ''Psychology Today'' noted that the "list of mentally ill creators who were successful [...] is dwarfed by the very large number of highly creative people both in modern times and throughout history without evidence of disorder", which includes figures such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Jane Austen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/creativity-explorations-in-art-literature-science-and-the-everyday/201503/creativity-and-mental|title=Creativity and Mental Illness|last=Rothenberg|first=Albert|magazine=Psychology Today|date=March 8, 2015|accessdate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}} Rothenberg reported that when interviewing 45 science Nobel laureates for the book ''Flight from Wonder'' he had found no evidence of mental illness in any of them, and also stated, "The problem is that the criteria for being creative is never anything very creative. Belonging to an artistic society, or working in art or literature, does not prove a person is creative. But the fact is that many people who have mental illness do try to work in jobs that have to do with art and literature, not because they are good at it, but because they're attracted to it. And that can skew the data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/08/new-study-claims-to-find-genetic-link-between-creativity-and-mental-illness|title=New study claims to find genetic link between creativity and mental illness|last=Sample|first=Ian|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 8, 2015|accessdate=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

== Modern cultural viewpoints ==
The 2012 book ''Tortured Artists'', by the American arts journalist [[Christopher Zara]], shows the universal nature of the [[tortured artist]] stereotype and how it applies to all of the creative disciplines, including film, theater, literature, music, and visual art. The artists profiled in the book have made major contributions to their respective mediums ([[Charles Schulz]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Amy Winehouse]], and dozens of others). In each case, the author attempts to make a connection between the art and the artist's personal suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Tortured Artists|year=2012|publisher=Adams Media|location=Avon, Mass|isbn=1-4405-3003-3|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable individuals ==
* [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) had many family members who may have had schizophrenia or psychosis: his aunt, uncle, son and grand-daughter.&lt;ref name="Andreasen" /&gt;{{importance example}}

* [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882–1941), a [[Literary modernism|modernist]] and early [[Feminism|feminist]] writer, is speculated to have had bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NAMI {{!}} Virginia Woolf – You Are Not Alone|url = http://www2.nami.org/template_eoy.cfm?Section=not_alone&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=147561|website = www2.nami.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance example}}

* [[Joanne Greenberg]]'s novel ''[[I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel)|I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]]'' (1964) is an autobiographical account of her teenage years in [[Chestnut Lodge]] working with Dr. [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]]. At the time she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, although two psychiatrists who examined Greenberg's self-description in the book in 1981 concluded that she did not have schizophrenia, but had extreme [[Mood disorder|depression]] and [[somatization disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=980CE7D71639F934A25751C0A967948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Schizophrenia In Popular Books: A Study Finds Too Much Hope | first=Dava | last=Sobel | date=February 17, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative constantly puts difference between the protagonist's mental illness and her artistic ability. Greenberg is adamant that her creative skills flourished in spite of, not because of, her condition.&lt;ref&gt;"I wrote [''I Never Promised You a Rose Garden''] as a way of describing mental illness without the romanticisation [sic] that it underwent in the sixties and seventies when people were taking LSD to simulate what they thought was a liberating experience. During those days, people often confused creativity with insanity. There is no creativity in madness; madness is the opposite of creativity, although people may be creative in spite of being mentally ill." This statement from Greenberg originally appeared on the page for ''Rose Garden'' at amazon.com and has been quoted in many places including ''Asylum: A Mid-Century Madhouse and Its Lessons About Our Mentally Ill Today'', by Enoch Callaway, M.D. (Praeger, 2007), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Brian Wilson]] (born 1942), founder of the American rock band [[the Beach Boys]], suffers from [[schizoaffective disorder]].  In 2002, after undergoing treatment, he spoke of how medication affects his creativity, explaining: "I haven't been able to write anything for three years.

The '''DARPA Falcon Project''' ('''F'''orce '''A'''pplication and '''L'''aunch from '''CON'''tinental United States) is a two-part joint project between the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and is part of [[Prompt Global Strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/US_looks_for_answers_after_hypersonic_plane_fails_999.html|title=US looks for answers after hypersonic plane fails|author=|date=|website=www.space-travel.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One part of the program aims to develop a reusable, rapid-strike ''[[Hypersonic]] Weapon System'' (HWS), now retitled the ''Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle'' (HCV), and the other is for the development of a launch system capable of accelerating an HCV to cruise speeds, as well as launching small satellites into Earth orbit.  This two-part program was announced in 2003 and continued into 2006.&lt;ref name=FALCON_PIP&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/tto/falcon/FALCON_PIP_FINAL.pdf FALCON Force Application and Launch from CONUS Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) PHASE I Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for BAA Solicitation 03-35] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127084027/http://www.darpa.mil/TTO/falcon/FALCON_PIP_FINAL.pdf |date=2008-11-27 }}.

''Blackswift'' was a project announced under the Falcon banner using a fighter-sized unmanned aircraft which would take off from a runway and accelerate to {{convert|6|Mach}} before completing its mission and landing again. The [[Memorandum of Understanding|memo of understanding]] between DARPA and the USAF on Blackswift—also known as the HTV-3X—was signed in September 2007.  The Blackswift HTV-3X did not receive needed funding and was canceled in October 2008.&lt;ref name=DARPA_HTV-3X_cancel/&gt;

Current research under FALCON program is centered on [[X-41 Common Aero Vehicle]] (CAV), a common aerial platform for hypersonic [[ICBM]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, as well as civilian [[Reusable launch vehicle|RLV]]s and [[Expendable launch system|ELV]]s. The prototype [[Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2]] (HTV-2) first flew on 22 April 2010; the second test flew 11 August 2011.  Both flights ended prematurely.

==Design and development==

===Past projects===
The aim was always to be able to deploy a craft from the continental United States, which could reach anywhere on the planet within one to two hours. The [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] in 1957 was the first publicly acknowledged program—although this would have been launched vertically on a rocket and then glided back to Earth, as the [[Space Shuttle]] did, rather than taking off from a runway. Originally, the Shuttle was envisaged as a part-USAF operation, and [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|separate military launch facilities]] were built at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base|Vandenberg AFB]] at great cost, though never used. After the open DynaSoar USAF program from 1957–1963, spaceplanes went [[black project|black]] (became highly classified). In the mid-1960s, the CIA began work on a high-Mach spyplane called [[Project Isinglass]]. This developed into [[Rheinberry]], a design for a Mach-17 air-launched reconnaissance aircraft, which was later canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/isiglass.htm Isinglass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614010443/http://astronautix.com/craft/isiglass.htm |date=2006-06-14 }}. astronautix.com&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Henry F. Cooper]], who was the Director of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] ("Star Wars") under President Reagan, spaceplane projects consumed $4&amp;nbsp;billion of funding in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (excluding the Space Shuttle). This does not include the 1950 and 1960s budgets for the Dynasoar, ISINGLASS, Rheinberry, and any 21st-century spaceplane project which might emerge under Falcon. He told the [[United States Congress]] in 2001 that all the United States had in return for those billions of dollars was "one crashed vehicle, a [[wiktionary:hangar queen|hangar queen]], some drop-test articles and static displays".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tgv-rockets.com/press/cooper_testimony.htm Cooper Testimony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729025229/http://www.tgv-rockets.com/press/cooper_testimony.htm |date=2007-07-29 }}. tgv-rockets.com&lt;/ref&gt; Falcon was allocated US$170&amp;nbsp;million for budget year 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/Space%20Weapons%20Spending%20in%20the%20FY%202008%20Defense%20Budget.pdf Space Weapons Spending in the FY 2008 Defense Budget] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313211154/http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/Space%20Weapons%20Spending%20in%20the%20FY%202008%20Defense%20Budget.pdf |date=2007-03-13 }}. cdi.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====HyperSoar====
The '''HyperSoar''' was an American [[hypersonic]] aircraft project developed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). It was to be capable of flying at around Mach 12 (9,200 mph, 14,700&amp;nbsp;km/h), allowing it to transit between any two points on the globe in under two hours. The HyperSoar was predicted to be a passenger plane capable of [[Skip reentry|skipping]] outside the [[atmosphere]] to prevent it from burning up in the atmosphere. A trip from Chicago to Tokyo (10,123 kilometers) would take 18 skips, or 72 minutes.  It was planned to use hydrocarbon-based engines outside the atmosphere and experimental jet engine technology with testing to begin by 2010. Later, the Hypersoar concept was acquired from LLNL by DARPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-05-12-hypersoar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303085019/https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-05-12-hypersoar.html |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 it was combined with the USAF X-41 Common Aero Vehicle to form the FALCON program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app4/x-41.html.|title=X-41 CAV|author=|date=|website=www.designation-systems.net|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FALCON===
The overall FALCON (''F''orce ''A''pplication and ''L''aunch from ''CON''tinental United States) program announced in 2003 had two major components: a small [[launch vehicle]] for carrying payloads to orbit or launching the hypersonic weapons platform payload, and the hypersonic vehicle itself.&lt;ref name=FALCON_PIP/&gt;

====Small Launch Vehicle====
The DARPA FALCON solicitation in 2003 asked for bidders to do development work on proposed vehicles in a first phase of work, then one or more vendors would be selected to build and fly an actual launch vehicle.  Companies which won first phase development contracts of $350,000 to $540,000 in November 2003 included:&lt;ref name=AIR_ATTACK&gt;[http://www.air-attack.com/page/32/USAF--DARPA-FALCON-Program.html USAF DARPA FALCON Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830044553/http://www.air-attack.com/page/32/USAF--DARPA-FALCON-Program.html |date=2008-08-30 }}.

===Blackswift===
The Blackswift was a proposed aircraft capable of hypersonic flight designed by the [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Skunk Works]], [[Boeing]], and [[Alliant Techsystems|ATK]].&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Graham (24 July 2008).

The USAF states that the "Blackswift flight demonstration vehicle will be powered by a combination [[turbine engine]] and [[ramjet]], an all-in-one power plant. The turbine engine accelerates the vehicle to around Mach 3 before the ramjet takes over and boosts the vehicle up to Mach 6."&lt;ref name=aedc&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arnold.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123053670 |title= DARPA official: AEDC 'critical' to hypersonics advancement |last= Lorenz III |first= Philip |publisher= [[Arnold Air Force Base]] |date= 17 May 2007 |accessdate= 28 March 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100415090042/http://www.arnold.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123053670 |archivedate= 15 April 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Steven Walker, the Deputy Director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (acting Director as of January, 2017), will be coordinating the project.

The Falcon program has announced the hypersonic horizontal take-off Blackswift/HTV-3X.  It is also launching the HTV-2 off the top of a rocket booster.&lt;ref name=Mach_20/&gt;  Falcon seems to be converging from two directions, on the ultimate goal of producing a hypersonic aircraft which can take off and land from a runway in the USA, and be anywhere in the world in an hour or two. Falcon is methodically proceeding toward a Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle. Dr. Walker stated,

{{quote|We need to fly some hypersonic vehicles—first the expendables, then the reusables—in order to prove to decision makers that this isn't just a dream… We won't overcome the skepticism until we see some hypersonic vehicles flying.}}

==Refocus==
In July 2013, DARPA decided it would not conduct a third flight test of the HTV-2 because enough data had been collected from the first two flights, and another test was not thought to provide any more usable data for the cost.  The tests provided data on flight aerodynamics and high-temperature effects on the aeroshell.  Work on the HTV-2 would continue to summer 2014 to provide more study on hypersonic flight.  The HTV-2 was the last active part of the Falcon program.  DARPA has now changed its focus for the program from global/strategic strike to high-speed tactical deployment to penetrate air defenses and hit targets quickly from a safe distance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_07_08_2013_p24-593534.xml&amp;p=1 Darpa Refocuses Hypersonics Research On Tactical Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117224313/http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=%2Farticle-xml%2FAW_07_08_2013_p24-593534.xml&amp;p=1 |date=2014-01-17 }} - Aviationweek.com, 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2881">'''Frederik Gottlieb Edvard Jünger''' (19 April 1823 – 21 October 1899) was a Danish [[precision mechanics|precision mechanic]] and instrument maker. His company was taken over by [[Christopher Peter Jürgensen]] in 1869. In the 1870s and early 1880s, he was the manager of [[Holmegaard Glass Factory]] near [[Næstved]].

==Early life and education==
Jünger was born in [[Holbæk]]. He initially worked as a clerk at various offices, most lately at the [[Bregentved]] estate. He was, however, interested in the technical sciences and his talent for mechanics caught the attention of [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. Ørsted helped him obtain a grant from count F. M. Knuth which enabled him to enroll at the [[Technical University of Denmark|College of Advanced Technology]]. His education also brought him to [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=Gyldendal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/H%c3%a5ndv%c3%a6rk/Mekaniker/Edvard_J%c3%bcnger|title=Edvard Jünger|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Sortedam Dossering 37.jpg|thumb|200px|The house on [[Sortedam Dossering]] (No. 37) where Jürger lived and worked.]]
Back in Denmark, he settled as an instrument maker in Copenhagen in 1852. He produced technical instruments for the College of Advanced Technology and [[Sorø Academy]] as well as distance measurement devices for the Danish army and navy and had also many customers abroad. Júrger lived on [[Sortedam Dossering]] No. 37 and worked out of his basement. He was involved in the development of the [[Hansen Writing Ball]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malling-hansen.org/the-writing-ball/production-places.html|title=Production places of the writing ball|website=Malling-Hansen Society|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several years working on an [[equatorial mount]] for [[Østervold Observatory]] and later a similar instrument for [[Lund Observatory]] in Sweden. In 1867, he was appointed to university mechanic (''universitetsmekanikus'') at [[University of Copenhagen]] and the following year he received the title of professor.&lt;ref name=Gyldendal/&gt;

==Late life==
Jünger's work compromised his vision and in 1869 he ceded his company to his employee [[Christopher Peter Jürgensen]]. He went abroad in 1869 and settled on a country estate in [[Styria|Steiermark]]. In 1873, he received an offer to take over the management of the [[Holmegaard Glass Factory]] and returned to Denmark where he ran the company for 11 years. He spent his last years in Copenhagen and is buried at [[Solbjerg Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Gyldendal/&gt;

'''Ethnosport''' (from the {{lang-grc|ἔθνος}} — [[Ethnic group|Ethnos]] meaning ''people'' + ''[[sport]]'') is a set of traditional styles of physical activity, methods of their preservation, and their development, as described in the ethnosport theory of Russian [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Alexey Kylasov]]. &lt;ref&gt;Кыласов А.В. Теория этноспорта: монография [Текст] / А. Кыласов. - М.: Советский спорт, 2012. - 112 с. {{ISBN|978-5-9718-0162-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
Ethnosport is an institutional form of united social and cultural space for all traditional styles of physical activity. The purpose of ethnosport theory is to provide a methodological basis for the design and prediction of the formation and functioning of social and cultural systems in conditions of rising representations of ethnocultural sport processes sport.

Sport became [[emancipation|emancipated]] as traditional games and sport transformed in an advertised product. Sports became more independent from ethnocultural gaming traditions that in the past belonged to the entertainment of society.

Sport emancipation led to its emergence and consolidation, which was followed by a new social function. Currently, "sport for all" is often a symbol of the values of a liberal society, which are easily accepted worldwide as "universal" because of its popularity. This new function allows sport to impose "standard values" and "ideal models" on all nations, requiring automatic copying to the prejudice of age-old traditions and identity. This is how public mind "reads" sport ideals, such as the Olympics and international sport.

The international nature of sports facilitates consolidation of this new ideological function, accessible to all nations without belonging to any of them. Sport also has the ability to mask the deepening polarization between countries in the global division of labor as well as their political differences. Sport provides a targeted ideological influence (spread of liberal ideology) for the imaginary de-ideology. These differences do not seem as important if athletes from communist, capitalist, developed, or developing countries have an equal chances of succeed.

==Definition==
'''Ethnosport''' identifies traditional styles of physical activity that have undergone a sportization, such as the introduction of sports-type institutes of sports, as expressed in the formation of federations, explicit refereeing, standard equipment, standard scoring systems, and regular, predictable outcomes.

==Examples==
Examples of ethnosports include [[martial arts]], [[bellydance]], [[yoga]], and [[massage]].

==Efforts to preserve ethnosport==
Today, cultural diversity of sport brings an institutional standard of promotion and development to traditional physical activities. Many countries are beginning to move traditional sports in certain direction, offering these traditional activities protection and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.kr/eng/front/resource_center/data_center_01_view.asp?articleid=34&amp;cate= UNESCO/TAFISA Busan Appeal (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional games are proclaimed as a part of UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The Social and Human Science department of UNESCO coordinates efforts of various organizations and academic institutions with regards to traditional sport.

[[Globalization]] has led to the need for consideration of local cultural heritage, where local cultural resources (in particular, traditional styles of physical activity) are under threat of complete or partial destruction if they are not included in global sport projects, such as the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], the [[World Games]], the [[Commonwealth Games]], the [[Mediterranean Games]], and the [[Asian Games]]. International sports organizations such as the [[IOC]], [[SportAccord]], [[IWGA]], [[International Mind Sports Association|IMSA]], and [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|FILA]] recognize this treat and try to combat it.

===FILA===
FILA has moved further than others in this direction. FILA launched a broad program of cooperation in the field of ethnosport.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Now, along with Olympic [[freestyle wrestling]], [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], and Women's freestyle wrestling FILA develops [[Grappling]], [[Pankration]], [[Beach wrestling]], and many other [[Folk wrestling|traditional wrestling styles]]. FILA works with the World Committee of Grappling and the Pankration and World Traditional Wrestling Committeeto put on the FILA World Wrestling Games. Because of FILA's efforts, [[Köräş|tatarcha koresh]] and Kazakh kores were included in program of the [[2013 Summer Universiade]] in Kazan as a new discipline: belt-wrestling. Recognition of Yakut wrestling (''khapsagai'') and [[mas-wrestling]] have allowed those disciplines to establish federations and hold their first continental championships using FILA's infrastructure.

===Reaction===
Although there is overall positive impact to recognition of ethnocultural sports as subjects of international sport, such progress does not satisfy enthusiasts of ethnosport who want full autonomy. Their distrust is expressed thusly: can sportization help spread at least some traditional physical activities? [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] who claims that countries cannot jump from the previous stage of development to another, if the previous stage is not included in the capitalist system of relations. By analogy, ethnocultural styles of competitions cannot become sports if their origin country is not included in the global world of sport.

==Ethnosport World Society==
In 2012 the Ethnosport World Society was created in order to promote ethnosport as an alternative to Anglo-Saxon sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnosport.com/= Ethnosport World Society website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Research Council''' ('''ERC''') is a public body for funding of scientific and technological research conducted within the [[European Union]] (EU). Established by the [[European Commission]] in 2007, the ERC is composed of an independent Scientific Council, its governing body consisting of distinguished researchers, and an Executive Agency, in charge of the implementation. It forms part of the framework programme of the union dedicated to research and innovation, [[Horizon 2020]], preceded by the [[Seventh Research Framework Programme]] (FP7). The ERC budget is over €13 billion from 2014 – 2020 and comes from the [[Horizon 2020]] programme, a part of the European Union's budget. Under Horizon 2020 it is estimated that around 7,000 ERC grantees will be funded and 42,000 team members supported, including 11,000 doctoral students and almost 16,000 post-doctoral researchers.

Researchers from any field can compete for the grants that support pioneering projects.  The ERC competitions are open to top researchers also from outside the union. The average success rate is about 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title=basic statistics for ERC funding activities| url=http://erc.europa.eu/statistics-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five ERC grantees have won Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref&gt;http://era.gv.at/object/news/1469&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebusiness.net/news/67734/ERC-starting-grant-holder-wins-Nobel-physics-prize|title=ERC starting grant holder wins Nobel physics prize - Science-Business|website=www.sciencebusiness.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idconsortium.es/en/news/erc-grant-holder-awarded-nobel-prize-physics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130551/http://www.idconsortium.es/en/news/erc-grant-holder-awarded-nobel-prize-physics |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant applications are assessed by qualified experts. Excellence is the sole criterion for selection; there are neither thematic priorities, nor geographical quotas for funding. The aim is to recognise the best ideas, and confer status and visibility to the best research in Europe, while also attracting talent from abroad.

Along with national funding bodies, the ERC aims to improve the climate for European frontier research. The Scientific Council has been keen to learn from the ERC’s peers in national research councils (European and overseas) and to engage in dialogue and appropriate collaboration. Also, some countries – such as Poland – have used the ERC model to establish national basic research funding bodies.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Background==
The idea of having a pan-European funding mechanism for basic research has been discussed and supported for a long time. However, its realisation was held back at the political level because the founding treaties of the European Union was interpreted as allowing union funding only to strengthen the scientific and technological base of European industry – that is, only funding for applied research rather than basic research. In conjunction with the Lisbon declaration in 2000, leaders of the EU, in particular the European Commissioner for Research at the time, [[Philippe Busquin]], realised that the European Treaty had to be reinterpreted; a transformation of European economy from traditional manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy has to involve the enhanced support at the European level for science of all kinds, including both fundamental and applied research.

In 2003, a report from the ERC Expert Group (ERCEG), chaired by Professor Federico Mayor, described how the ERC could take shape. In 2004, a high-level expert group was commissioned to further explore the possibilities of creating a European Research Council. This group concluded that the EU should establish an institution to support frontier research. A number of other expert groups, such as one commissioned by the European Science Foundation, another charged with the task of analysing the economic implications of the Lisbon declaration and a high level group commissioned by the European Commission, also arrived at a similar conclusion and boosted the idea. With the ice broken, scientists and politicians have since strongly supported the establishment of an ERC. In 2006, the European Parliament and EU Council of Ministers accepted the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for the European Union's support for research, of which the ERC was a flagship component. In the ERC kick-off conference in Berlin, various speakers talked of 'an idea whose time has come', 'a European factory of ideas', 'a champions' league’, 'a great day for Europe and a great day for science', and the beginning of a 'snowball effect'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Winnacker E.-L. | year = 2008 | title = On Excellence through Competition | url = | journal = European Educational Research Journal | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 124 | doi=10.2304/eerj.2008.7.2.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heldin C.-H. | year = 2008 | title = The European Research Council – a new opportunity for European science | url = | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 417–420 | doi=10.1038/nrm2374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==

===Scientific Council===
The ERC is governed by the [https://erc.europa.eu/about-erc/erc-president-and-scientific-council Scientific Council] (ScC), consisting of 22 eminent European scientists and scholars (including Nobel prize laureates), and supported operationally by the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA), based in Brussels. The ScC acts on behalf of the scientific community in Europe to promote creativity and innovative research. It is responsible for setting the ERC's scientific strategy, including establishing the annual Work Programmes, designing the peer review systems, identifying the peer review experts, and communicating with the scientific community. The first Scientific Council members were nominated by Commissioner [[Janez Potočnik|Potočnik]] in July 2005 and worked intensively to define the key principles and scientific operating practices of the ERC in preparation for the start-up.

The members of the Scientific Council are selected by an Identification Committee, consisting of highly respected personalities in European research, and appointed by the European Commission. The ScC members term of office lasts four years.

====President====
Following its formal establishment, the Scientific Council reaffirmed the election of its Chair and ERC president, Professor [[Fotis Kafatos]], and the two Vice-Chairs and ERC Vice-Presidents, Professor [[Helga Nowotny]] and Dr. [[Daniel Estève]]. After the highly successful Presidency of Fotis Kafatos, Helga Nowotny took over as President in March 2010 with Prof. [[Carl-Henrik Heldin]] and Prof. [[Pavel Exner]] as Vice-Presidents. In January 2014, after the end of Helga Nowotny's term of office, Professor [[Jean-Pierre Bourguignon]] became ERC President. Since then, the ERC also has a third Vice-President, Professor Nuria Sebastian Galles, alongside the two vice-presidents already in office (each of them in charge of one of the ERC scientific domains).

====Standing committees====
The ERC Scientific Council has established two Standing Committees: one deals with conflict of interest issues, the other oversees the selection of reviewers and panel lists.

===Executive Agency===
The Scientific Council is supported operationally by the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA), based in Brussels. The implementing pillar of the ERC, the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), is responsible for supporting the peer review process, implementing the ERC strategy as set by the ScC, executing all financial operations and communicating about the ERC. The ERCEA is currently headed by the Director, Pablo Amor. It employs some 400 staff of which more than 50 hold PhDs.

The fact that most Scientific staff hold a PhD, have done post-docs and/or have been academics reinforces the feeling among panellists and the Scientific Community as a whole that ERC Schemes are implemented by scientists understanding the pitfalls and hurdles of Research and who are constantly working to better their procedures in order to simplify the application as well as the granting processes, hand in hand with their colleagues from financial units.

====Steering Committee====
There is also a five-member [http://erc.europa.eu/organisation/steering-committee ERCEA Steering Committee], chaired by the European Commission's Director-General for Research and Innovation, two ScC members, and two Commission officials.

===Measures to ensure an integrated institution===
To create an integrated institution consisting of the ScC and the ERCEA, two integrative mechanisms were initially put in place:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Antonoyiannakis M. |author2=Hemmelskamp J. |author3=Kafatos F. C. | year = 2009 | title = The European Research Council Takes Flight | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 136 | issue = | pages = 805–809 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.031 | pmid=19269357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Secretary General (SG), selected by the ScC, was located in Brussels with the goal of interacting closely with the ERCEA.  This post no longer exists. The first SG was Professor [[Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker]] (2007 – 2009). The second SG was Professor [[Andreu Mas-Colell]] (2009 – 2010). The third and the last SG was Professor [[Donald B. Dingwell|Donald Bruce Dingwell]] (2010 – 2013). The Secretaries General have been instrumental in the successful setting-up of the ERC, and have worked closely and fruitfully together with the two consecutive Directors ad interim of the ERCEA, Jack Metthey and thereafter Pablo Amor. During the first half of 2011, a Task Force chaired by the European Commission's Research Director-General, Robert-Jan Smits, decided to give further suggestions regarding the governance structure of the ERC in the European Commission's Framework Programme (Horizon 2020), 2014 - 2020. It ''inter alia'' suggested to merge the positions of the President and of the Secretary General into a full-time President based in Brussels. This recommendation was implemented as of January 2014; since then, the ERC President is permanently based in Brussels and there is no Secretary General.
# The '''ERC Board''' currently consists of the ERC President, the three Vice-Presidents, and the Director of the ERCEA.

=== Budget and peer review ===
Under the EU's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 the ERC has a budget of €13.1 billion for the period 2014 - 2020. That is a substantial increase from its initial seven-year budget under the EU's seventh Research Framework Programme (2007-2013), when the total allocated to the ERC was €7.5 billion. The ERC budget is supported by the European Commission and is supplemented by contributions from the EU associated countries. Together, the 28 EU member states and the associated countries comprise the European Research Area (ERA).

The ERC's peer-review evaluation process must command the confidence of the research community and is central to the achievement of the ERC's objectives. The ERC Scientific Council divided the full range of scientific disciplines into three major domains, with budgets allotted as follows. The peer review in the three domains is carried out by a total of 25 panels led by Panel Chairs whose scientific status gives credibility to the selection process. The peer review experts come from all over the world, which makes the ERC peer review process one of the most international of its kind on this scale. There are currently about 900 ERC panel members; together with the 2000 external reviewers, they constitute the backbone of the ERC evaluation structure.

The ScC encourages interdisciplinary proposals.

== Grants offered ==

===Principles===
The two founding principles of the ERC regarding grants are:
#Research grant applications should be judged using the sole criterion of '''peer-reviewed excellence''', independent of political, geographic or economic considerations. All ERC competitions for funding are open to top researchers from any country in the world, as long as they are committed to work at least half of their time in Europe. The quality and originality of the research project and the qualifications of the applicant( as shown, for example, by their publication record) are the only evaluation criteria. This means that there will be no ''juste retour'', in other words there are no guarantees that the individual countries contributing to the programme will receive any part of the funding.
#'''Frontier research'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=H. Nowotny| title=Frontier Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities: what does it mean, what can it mean? (PDF)| url=http://www.helga-nowotny.eu/documents/frontier_research.pdf}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; should be targeted by encouraging high-risk, high-reward proposals that may revolutionise science and potentially lead to innovation if successful. With its bottom-up approach, the Scientific Council does not pre-determine thematic priorities, but challenges applicants to identify them themselves. Funding is provided for individual projects initiated in an investigator-driven, ‘bottom‑up’ process. Although collaborations within a project are welcome, there is no formal demand to collaborate.

The ERC asks researchers to think big, and provides generous support for ambitious projects. It does not want its carefully selected grantees to waste their time by taking on numerous peripheral projects, or constantly having to seek additional money to fund their research. The grants are flexible, so that all costs for a specific project can be covered, and portable, meaning that if grant holders move to another university or institute, the grant moves with them.

The applicant can be of any nationality and age, and needs to demonstrate an excellent track record and present a ground-breaking research proposal. The research must be conducted in a Host Institution located within the [[European Union]] or an associated country.

===Schemes===
The council offers the following grant schemes, with funding for up to five years:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ERC Starting Grants | url = https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ERC Consolidator Grants | url = https://erc.europa.eu/funding/consolidator-grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ERC Advanced Grants | url = https://erc.europa.eu/funding/advanced-grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">'''Evolutionism''' describes the belief in the [[evolution]] of [[Organism|organisms]]. Its exact meaning has changed over time as the study of evolution has progressed. In the 19th-century, it was used to describe the belief that organisms deliberately improved themselves through progressive inherited change ([[orthogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="isbn0-550-11000-3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carneiro | first=Robert, L. | title=Evolutionism in cultural anthropology : a critical history | publisher=Westview Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-8133-3766-1 | pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[teleological]] belief went on to include [[cultural evolution]] and [[social evolution]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-550-11000-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allen, R. T. |author2=Allen, Robert W. |title=Chambers encyclopedic English dictionary |publisher=Chambers |location=Edinburgh |year=1994 |page=438 |isbn=0-550-11000-3 |oclc= |quote=a widely held 19c belief that organisms were intrinsically bound to improve themselves, that changes were progressive, and that acquired characters could be transmitted genetically. The belief was also extended to cultures and societies, and to living organisms. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was used to describe the idea "that human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Trigger|Trigger, Bruce]]  (1986) ''A History of Archeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used by the [[Creationism|creationist movement]] to describe adherence to the scientific consensus on evolution as equivalent to a [[secular religion]].&lt;ref name="ICRMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-visit/linke.html|title=A Visit to the ICR Museum|author=Linke, Steven|date=August 28, 1992|publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]|accessdate=2008-12-05|quote=In fact, true science supports the Biblical worldview...

They object that too often evolution operates as a kind of secular religion, pushing norms and proposals for proper (or, in their opinion, improper) action.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is very seldom used within the scientific community, since the scientific position on evolution is accepted by the overwhelming majority of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;"Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time", [http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/528.pdf Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108193045/http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/528.pdf |date=2009-11-08 }}, [[Pew Research Center]], 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Because evolutionary biology is the default scientific position, it is assumed that "scientists" or "biologists" are "evolutionists" unless specifically noted otherwise.&lt;ref name="Dichotomy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/cej/4/2/supposed-dichotomy-between-creationism-evolution |title=The Supposed Dichotomy between Creationism and Evolution |author= Gough, J. B. |year=1983 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=2009-09-24}} "...to say a person is a scientist encompasses the fact that he or she is an evolutionist."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[creation-evolution controversy|creation{{endash}}evolution controversy]], creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis "evolutionists" and the theory itself "evolutionism".

==19th-century teleological use ==
Before its use to describe biological evolution, the term "evolution" was originally used to refer to any orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start.&lt;ref name=Carneiro&gt;Carneiro, Robert L.(Léonard) (2003) ''Evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history'' Westview Press pg 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first five editions of Darwin's in ''Origin of Species'' used the word "evolved", but the word "evolution" was only used in its sixth edition in 1872.&lt;ref name="penguin origin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Origin of Species|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=0-14-043205-1|edition=reprint of 1st|editor=Burrow, JW|page=460|quote=...from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, ''evolved'' (italics not in original)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, [[Herbert Spencer]] had developed the concept theory that organisms strive to evolve due to an internal "driving force" ([[orthogenesis]]) in 1862.&lt;ref name=Carneiro/&gt;  Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term "evolution" to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of [[unilineal evolution|unilineal (social) evolution]] used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900).&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce (1986) ''A History of Archaeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolutionism subsequently came to be used for the now discredited theory that evolution contained a deliberate component, rather than the selection of [[Beneficial mutation|beneficial traits]] from [[Genetic variation|random variation]] by [[Survival of the fittest|differential survival]].

==Modern use by creationists==
In modern times, the term ''[[evolution]]'' is widely used, but the terms ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' are seldom used in the [[scientific community]] to refer to [[evolutionary biology]], since the term is considered both redundant and anachronistic. 

However, the term has been used by creationists in discussing the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref name="Dichotomy" /&gt; For example, the [[Institute for Creation Research]], in order to imply placement of evolution in the category of 'religions', including [[atheism]], [[fascism]], [[humanism]] and [[occultism]], commonly uses the words ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief.&lt;ref name=ICRMuseum/&gt; The [[BioLogos Foundation]], an organization that promotes the idea of [[theistic evolution]], uses the term "evolutionism" to describe "the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse." It views this as a subset of [[scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/biologos-id-creationism|title=How is BioLogos different from Evolutionism, Intelligent Design, and Creationism|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation|quote= While BioLogos accepts evolution, it emphatically rejects evolutionism, the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse. Proponents of evolutionism believe every aspect of life will one day be explained with evolutionary theory. In this way it is a subset of scientism, the broader view that the only real truth is that which can be discovered by science. These positions are commonly held by materialists (also called philosophical naturalists) who deny the existence of the supernatural.|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12717">The term '''expected satiety''' refers to the satiety (relief from hunger) that is expected from a particular food. It is closely associated with 'expected satiation' which refers to the immediate fullness (post meal) that a food is expected to generate.

Scientists have discovered that foods differ considerably in their expected satiety. One estimate suggests that there may be a six-fold difference in  commonly consumed foods (in the UK), when they are compared calorie for calorie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | pmid=18547677
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This range of variation is important because expected satiety is thought to be a good predictor of [[food choice]] and an excellent predictor of self-selected portion sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, foods that have high expected satiety and high expected satiation tend to be selected in smaller portions (fewer calories). Therefore, they may be especially suited to diets that are designed to reduce energy intake.

Some researchers also suggest that expected satiety is an important mediator of energy intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that within-meal events (immediate post-ingestive feedback, e.g., gastric stretch) play a relatively minor role and that meal size is largely determined by decisions about portion size, before a meal begins.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, techniques have been developed that quantify expectations very precisely by comparing foods directly on a calorie-for-calorie basis. The first of these used a classical psychophysical approach based on a '[[Psychophysics#Method of constant stimuli|method of constant stimuli]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants are shown a fixed 'standard' portion of food and this is compared against a different 'comparison' food. Over a series of trials the size of the comparison food is manipulated and participants are asked to pick the food that is expected to deliver greater satiety. At the end of the task a measure of 'expected satiety' is calculated. This relates to the number of calories of the comparison food that would be expected to deliver the same satiety as the fixed standard. A conceptually similar alternative is to use a '[[Psychophysics#Method of adjustment|method of adjustment]]'. Participants are shown a picture of a standard food next to a picture of a comparison food. Using specialist software, participants change the size of the comparison portion using keyboard responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | pmid=19543204
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are loaded with sufficient speed that the change in the comparison becomes 'animated.' Participants are told to match the comparison food until both are expected to deliver the same satiety. If the same standard is used then the expected satiety of different foods can be quantified and compared directly.

==Determinants==

Expectations about the post-ingestive effects of a food are learned over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi     = 10.1016/j.appet.2009.02.009
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it would appear that the expected satiety and expected satiation of foods increases as they become familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectations are also thought to be governed by the orosensory characteristics of food. Even subtle changes to the [[flavor]] or texture of food can have a marked effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.021
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, it also appears that the expected satiety and expected satiation of foods is influenced by their perceived weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last1   = Piqueras-Fiszman
  | first1  = B.
  | title   = The weight of the container influences expected satiety, perceived density, and subsequent expected fullness

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on appetite==

The effects of expected satiety and expected satiation appear to extend beyond meal planning. Several studies show that these expectations also influence the [[hunger]] and fullness that is experienced after a meal has been consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last1   = Brunstrom
  | first1  = J.M.
  | title   = 'Expected satiety' changes hunger and fullness in the inter-meal interval

  | pages   = 310–5
  | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2011.01.002
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Product labelling and branding is likely to modify expected satiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2011.05.069
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this kind of information has the potential to influence appetite directly. Together, these observations are consistent with emerging evidence that implicates hippocampal-dependent memory mechanisms in behavioural responses to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Explorer 6''', or '''S-2''', was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite]] launched on August 7, 1959. It was a small, spheroidal satellite designed to study trapped radiation of various energies, galactic [[cosmic ray]]s, [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetism]], [[radio propagation]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|upper atmosphere]], and the [[flux]] of [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]]. It also tested a scanning device designed for photographing the [[Earth|Earth's]] cloud cover, and transmitted the first pictures of Earth from [[orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Year_2007/SEMP4FEVL2F_0.html | title=50 years of Earth Observation | work=2007: A Space Jubilee | publisher=[[European Space Agency]] | date=October 3, 2007 | accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. [[V-2 rocket]] mission #12 had taken the first images of Earth from space on October 24, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

The photo was taken when the satellite was about 17,000 mi (27,000 km) above the surface of the earth on August 14, 1959. At the time, the satellite was crossing Mexico.]]
The satellite was launched into a highly elliptical [[orbit]] with an initial local time of [[apsis|apogee]] of 2100 h. The satellite was [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] at 2.8 rps, with the direction of the [[rotation|spin axis]] having a [[right ascension]] of 217 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] and a [[declination]] of 23 degrees. Four [[solar cell]] paddles mounted near its equator recharged the storage batteries while in orbit. Each experiment except the television scanner had two outputs, digital and analog. A [[UHF]] transmitter was used for the digital telemetry and the TV signal. Two [[VHF]] transmitters were used to transmit the analog signal. The VHF transmitters were operated continuously. The UHF transmitter was operated for only a few hours each day. Only three of the solar cell paddles fully erected, and this occurred during spin up rather than prior to spin up as planned. Consequently, initial operation of the payload power supply was 63% nominal, and this decreased with time. The decreased power caused a lower signal-to-noise ratio affecting most of the data, especially near apogee. One VHF transmitter failed on September 11, 1959, and the last contact with the payload was made on October 6, 1959, at which time the solar cell charging current had fallen below that required to maintain the satellite equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdfo.org/stl/marcus.pdf |title=Earthbound Pioneer, Explorer 6 |author=Gideon Marcus |publisher=Quest, The History of Spaceflight Quarterly |volume=19 |number=1 |year=2012 |accessdate=25 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 an [[anti-satellite missile]] test of the [[Bold Orion]] rocket used Explorer 6 as a target. The missile successfully passed within {{convert|6.4|km|mi|sp=us}} of the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;

Bold Orion’s ASAT mission occurred on Tuesday, 13 October 1959. Launch took place within the Atlantic Missile Range Drop Zone (AMR DZ).  The altitude, latitude and longitude of the drop point were {{convert|35,000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}}, 29° North and 79° West, respectively.  Bold Orion successfully intercepted the Explorer 6 satellite, passing its target at a range of less than {{convert|3.5|nmi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} and an altitude of {{convert|136|nmi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The satellite's orbit [[orbital decay|decayed]] on July 1, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Fast Infrared Exoplanet Spectroscopy Survey Explorer''' ('''FINESSE''') is a  [[NASA]] mission proposal for a [[space observatory]] operating in the [[Near-infrared]] spectrum for the [[Explorers program#Medium-Class Explorers|Medium-Class Explorers]] program. The [[Principal Investigator]] is [[Mark Swain]] of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/sep/HQ_11-328_Science_Proposals.html NASA - NASA Selects Science Investigations For Concept Studies], 29 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

FINESSE was one of three Medium-Class Explorers (MIDEX) mission concepts that received $2 million to conduct a nine-month mission concept study in August 2017.&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Selects Proposals to Study Galaxies, Stars, Planets|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-proposals-to-study-galaxies-stars-planets|website=NASA|language=en|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two competing concepts are [[Arcus (satellite)|Arcus]] (an X-ray space observatory) and [[SPHEREx]] (a [[near-infrared]] space observatory). If selected, the mission would launch no earlier than 2022 and would last at least two years.

==Overview==

FINESSE would consist of a [[space observatory]] tasked to study [[exoplanet]] atmospheres by [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] surveying over 500 [[exoplanet|planets outside the Solar System]] with the goal of gaining understanding of the processes responsible for their composition, and how the Solar System fits into the larger family of planets.&lt;ref name='JPL Overview'&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/fast-infrared-exoplanet-spectroscopy-survey-explorer-finesse/ FINESSE Mission to 500+ transiting exoplanets]. NASA JPL. Accesses 1 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

FINESSE is a candidate for NASA's next [[Explorers program]] MIDEX mission, and is currently in a nine-months-long Phase A study starting from August 2017 to refine its mission concept.&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'/&gt; NASA is expected to announce the selection result of the next MIDEX mission in 2019.

While FINESSE was selected as finalist for the MIDEX mission,  NASA also conditionally selected the CASE proposal as an Explorers Program Partner Mission of Opportunity (PMO).&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'/&gt; FINESSE and CASE shares the same Primary Investigator and science team.&lt;ref name="COPAG"&gt;{{cite web|title=FINESSE and ARIEL + CASE: Dedicated Transit Spectroscopy Missions for the Post-TESS Era|url=https://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/copag/AAS_Jan2018/bean_finesse_case.pdf||publisher= NASA Cosmic Origins Program Analysis Group (COPAG)|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CASE, or Contribution To ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets, is a proposal for US participation in the European [[ARIEL]] space telescope. An exoplanet atmosphere survey mission, ARIEL is similar to FINESSE both in spacecraft capability and scientific objectives. CASE was selected on the condition that it will only be constructed if the [[European Space Agency]] selects ARIEL.&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'/&gt; At the time this was announced, it was still uncertain whether ARIEL will be ultimately selected or not. NASA has stated that if ARIEL and CASE are selected, they will not select FINESSE as the next MIDEX mission.&lt;ref name="COPAG"/&gt; On March 2018, ARIEL was selected by ESA for the fourth [[Cosmic Vision#Medium class|Cosmic Vision Medium class]] mission (M4).&lt;ref name="esa-1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Science &amp; Technology Portal staff|title=ESA's next science mission to focus on nature of exoplanets|url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/59796-esa-s-next-science-mission-to-focus-on-nature-of-exoplanets/|website=ESA Science &amp; Technology Portal|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=22 March 2018|language=en-GB|date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science objectives==

*Determine key aspects of the planet formation process. FINESSE would obtain the atmospheric composition measurements of [[metallicity]] and carbon/oxygen ratio.&lt;ref name='JPL Overview'/&gt;
*Determine key factors that establish planetary climate. FINESSE measurements would determine planetary energy budgets from the dayside to the nightside.&lt;ref name='JPL Overview'/&gt;

==Principle==

FINESSE would measure the atmospheric light [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]] of exoplanets [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transiting]] or eclipsing their parent star.&lt;ref name='JPL Overview'/&gt; The proposed spectrometer functions on the 0.5-5.0 μm range, on the [[far infrared]] wavelegths of λ/Δλ = 80 at 1.2μm, 300 at 3 μm, and it would use a 75&amp;nbsp;cm diameter primary mirror.&lt;ref name='JPL Overview'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6475">'''Feedforward, Behavior and Cognitive Science''' is a method of [[teaching]] and learning that illustrates or indicates a desired future behavior or path to a goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creating-futures.org/keystosuccess/feedforward/&lt;/ref&gt; Feedforward provides information, images, etc. exclusively about what one could do right in the future, often in contrast to what one has done in the past. The feedforward method of teaching and learning is in contrast to its opposite, [[feedback]], concerning [[human behavior]] because it focuses on learning in the future, whereas feedback uses information from a past event to provide reflection and the basis for behaving and thinking differently. In isolation, feedback is the least effective form of instruction, according to [[US Department of Defense]] studies in the 1980s. Feedforward was coined in 1976 by Peter W. Dowrick in his dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (1976). Self modelling: A videotape training technique for disturbed and disabled children. Doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedforward in behavioral and [[cognitive science]] may be defined as "images of adaptive future behavior, hitherto not mastered"; images capable of triggering that behavior in a challenging context.  Feedforward is created by restructuring current component behaviors into what appears to be a new skill or level of performance.

One concept of feedforward originated in [[behavioral science]]. Related concepts have emerged  in [[biology]], [[cybernetics]], and [[management science]]s. The understanding of feedforward help the understanding of [[brain function]] and [[rapid learning]]. The concept contributed to research and development of [[video self modeling]] (VSM).  The most productive advances in feedforward came from its association with videos that showed [[adaptive behavior]] (see Dowrick, 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;111, 121; 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;110–3, 120-2, 240-1; 1999, esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26).&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (1983).  Self-modelling.  In P. W. Dowrick &amp; S. J. Biggs (Eds.),  Using video:  Psychological and social applications (pp.&amp;nbsp;105–124).  Chichester, UK: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (1999).  A review of self modeling and related interventions.  Applied and Preventive Psychology, 8, 23-39.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a boy with [[autism]] role-plays squeezing a ball ([[stress management]] technique) instead of having a [[tantrum]] when his work is found imperfect by the teacher – or a [[selectively mute]] child is seen on video talking at school, by editing in footage of her talking at home (location disguised by use of a classroom backdrop). By selectively editing a video, a clip was made that demonstrated the desired behavior and allowed the children to learn from their future successes.

By reference to its historical context of [[Video self-modeling|VSM]], it became recognized that feedforward comprised component behaviors already in the [[repertoire]], and that it could exist in forms other than videos. In fact, feedforward exists as images in the brain, and VSM is just one of many ways to create these simulations. The videos are very short – the best are 1 or 2 minutes long, and achieve changes in behavior very rapidly. Under the right conditions, a very few viewings of these videos can produce [[skill acquisition]]s or changes in performance that typically take months and have been resistant to change by other methods. The boy with autism and the girl with selective mutism, mentioned above, are good examples.  Further examples can be found in journal articles,&lt;ref&gt;Bellini, S., Akullian, J., &amp; Hopf, A. (2007).  Increasing social engagement in young children with autism spectrum disorders using video self modeling.  School Psychology Review, 36, 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buggey, T. (2005).  Video self modeling applications with students with autism spectrum disorder in a small private school setting.  Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities, 20, 52-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W., Kim-Rupnow, W. S., &amp; Power, T. J. (2006). Video feedforward for reading.  Journal of Special Education, 39, 194-207.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the web (e.g., in sport&lt;ref&gt;http://keithlyons.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/feedforward/&lt;/ref&gt;).

The evidence for ultra-rapid learning, built from component behaviors that are reconfigured to appear as new skills, indicates the feedforward self model mechanism existing in the brain to control our future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dowrick, P. W. (2011).  Self model theory: Learning from the future.  Article invited, WIREs for Cognitive Science.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, if the conditions of learning are right, the brain takes pieces of existing skills, puts them together in new ways or in a different context, to produce a future image and a future response. Thus we learn from the future – more rapidly than we learn from the past. Further evidence comes from [[cognitive process]]es dubbed "mental time travel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Suddendorf, T., &amp; [[Michael Corballis|Corballis]], M. C.|year=2007|title=The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=30|pages=299–313|pmid=17963565|doi=10.1017/s0140525x07001975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for parts of the [[hippocampus]] etc. where they occur.&lt;ref&gt;Addis, D.

Neuropsychologica, 45, 1363-1377.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the links between these hot spots in the brain and feedforward learning have yet to be confirmed.

Feedforward concepts have become established in at least four areas of science, and they continue to spread. Feedforward often works in concert with [[feedback loop]]s for [[guidance system]]s in cybernetics or [[self-control]] in biology {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.

Feedforward in management theory enables the prediction and control of [[organizational behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Basso, D. |author2= Belardinelli, M. O. |last-author-amp=yes|year=2006|title=The role of the feedforward paradigm in cognitive psychology|journal=Cognitive Processing|volume=7|pages=73–88|pmid=16683170|doi=10.1007/s10339-006-0034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts have developed during and since the 1990s.

This structure is less than 17 million years old as constrained by the age of the ocean floor of which it is a part. Based on its morphology and the absence of any obvious [[lava]] flows that can be seen in the [[multibeam echosounder]] [[Bathymetry|bathymetric]] data, it is hypothesized that this structure is a possible oceanic impact crater.&lt;ref name="DiasOthers2009a"/&gt;

It was reported that the Fried Egg structure was first identified using data acquired during a 2008 multibeam echosounder hydrographic survey. Its presence was confirmed during a research cruise from September to November 2009. In addition, [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] data were also acquired during the September 2009 research cruise and that a third expedition using [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s to gather samples from this structure was planned.&lt;ref name="amos2009a"/&gt;

A '''gamma counter''' is a machine to measure [[gamma radiation]] emitted by a [[radionuclide]]. Unlike [[survey meter]]s, gamma counters are designed to measure small samples of radioactive material, typically with automated measurement and movement of multiple samples.

==Operation==
Gamma counters are usually [[scintillation counter]]s. In a typical system, a number of samples are placed in sealed vials or test tubes, and moved along a track. One at a time, they move down inside a shielded detector, set to measure specific energy windows characteristic of the particular [[isotope]]. Within this shielded detector there is a [[scintillator|scintillation crystal]] that surrounds the radioactive sample. Gamma rays emitted from the radioactive sample interact with the crystal, are absorbed, and light is emitted. A detector, such as a [[photomultiplier tube]] converts the visible light to an electrical signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakowiuk,|first1=Adrian|last2=Filipiak|first2=Paweł|last3=Bartak,|first3=Jakub|last4=Pieńkos|first4=Paweł|last5=Kowalska|first5=Ewa|title=Laboratory automatic measuring system for gamma specimens|journal=Nukleonika|date=2012|volume=57|issue=4|pages=633-635|url=http://www.nukleonika.pl/www/back/abstract/vol57_2012/v57n4p633.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubran|first1=MM|title=Quality control of gamma counters. I. Experimental evaluation of sources of error.|journal=Annals of clinical and laboratory science|date=1977|volume=7|issue=1|pages=57-67|pmid=836003|url=http://www.annclinlabsci.org/content/7/1/57.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the [[half-life]] and concentration of the sample, measurement times may vary from 0.02 minutes to several hours.

If the [[photon]] has too low of an energy level it will be absorbed into the scintillation crystal and never be detected. If the photon has too high of an energy level the photons may just pass right through the crystal without any interaction. Thus the thickness of the crystal is very important when sampling radioactive materials using the Gamma Counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamma Counter|url=http://www.radiationanswers.org/radiation-introduction/detecting-measuring/gamma-counter.html|website=Radiation Answers|publisher=RadiationAnswers.org|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelps|first1=Simon R.

==Applications==

'''Gladys Lounsbury Hobby''' (November 19, 1910 – July 4, 1993), born in [[New York City]], was an American microbiologist whose research played a key role in the development and understanding of [[antibiotics]]. Her work took [[penicillin]] from a laboratory experiment to a mass-produced drug during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nyt_saxon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|title=Gladys Hobby, 82, Pioneer in Bringing Penicillin to Public|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/09/obituaries/gladys-hobby-82-pioneer-in-bringing-penicillin-to-public.html|accessdate=13 May 2016|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 9, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Hobby was born in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighbourhood in New York City, one of two daughters of Theodore Y. Hobby and Flora R. Lounsbury.&lt;ref name="ntblamrcnwmn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Susan|title=Notable American Women - A Biographical Dictionary: Completing the Twentieth Century|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|isbn=0-674-01488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobby graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1931. She earned her and Ph.D. in [[bacteriology]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45835614|title=International encyclopedia of women scientists|last=1964-|first=Oakes, Elizabeth H.,|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=0816043817|oclc=45835614}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote her doctoral thesis on the medical uses of [[nonpathogenic organisms]].&lt;ref name="ntblamrcnwmn" /&gt;

Hobby worked for Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, during which time she collaborated with Dr. [[Karl Meyer (biochemist)|Karl Meyer]], a biochemist, and Dr. [[Martin Henry Dawson]], a clinician and associate professor of medicine, on determining diseases caused by hemolytic [[Streptococcus|streptococc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i and later on refining penicillin.&lt;ref name="nyt_saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miracle_cure"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miracle Cure|url=http://innovators.vassar.edu/innovator.html?id=77|publisher=Vassar College|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/psjournal/archive/winter-2005/drug.html|title=The Drug That Changed the World|last=Oatman|first=Eric|date=Winter 2005|website=|series=Volume 25, No. 1|publisher=The College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons of Columbia University|publication-place=Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons|access-date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, Hobby also worked for Prespyterian Hospital in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45835614|title=International encyclopedia of women scientists|last=1964-|first=Oakes, Elizabeth H.,|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=0816043817|oclc=45835614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobby left Columbia University in 1944 to work for [[Pfizer Pharmaceuticals]] in New York where she researched [[streptomycin]] and other antibiotics.&lt;ref name="nwhm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gladys Hobby (1910-1993)|url=http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/gladys-hobby/|publisher=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Hobby left Pfizer to specialize in chronic infectious diseases as chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in [[East Orange, New Jersey]]. She also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at [[Cornell University Medical College]].&lt;ref name="nyt_saxon" /&gt; In 1972 she founded the monthly publication, ''[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy]]'', and continued to edit it for eight years. She retired from her main career in 1977. In retirement Hobby wrote over 200 articles, working as a consultant and freelance science writer. She also published a book, ''Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobby|first=Gladys|title=Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=Connecticut|isbn=9780300032253}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985, in which she chronicled penicillin's journey and compared it to the [[Manhattan Project|Manhattan project]] in its importance to the war effort.&lt;ref name="nyt_saxon" /&gt;

Hobby died of a heart attack in 1993 at her home in a Pennsylvania retirement community.&lt;ref name="nyt_saxon" /&gt;

== Key contributions and impact==
Hobby is recognized for her work in creating a form of penicillin that was effective on human hosts. In 1940, Hobby and her colleagues, Dr. [[Karl Meyer (biochemist)|Karl Meyer]] and Dr. [[Martin Henry Dawson]], wrote to [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Chain]] to procure a sample of penicillin. They naively decided to make some penicillin and soon became experts in the fermentation process, and began refining it into a drug. Hobby, Meyer, and Dawson performed the first tests of penicillin on humans in 1940 and 1941, before presenting at the American Society for Clinical Investigation.&lt;ref name="miracle_cure" /&gt;  They discovered that penicillin was a powerful germ-killer that reduced the severity of infectious diseases and made procedures such as organ transplantation and open-heart surgery possible.&lt;ref name="nwhm" /&gt; Their findings received media coverage, which helped attract funding from the United States Government to mass-produce penicillin during World War II, saving the lives of many soldiers.&lt;ref name="nwhm" /&gt;

At Pfizer, Hobby did extensive early work on [[Oxytetracycline|Terramycin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/09/obituaries/gladys-hobby-82-pioneer-in-bringing-penicillin-to-public.html|title=Gladys Hobby, 82, Pioneer in Bringing Penicillin to Public|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1993-07-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Viomycin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/gladys%20hobby.html|title=Gladys Hobby - Vassar College Encyclopedia - Vassar College|website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for the treatment of tuberculosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13319">The following is a [[glossary]] of terms.  It is not intended to be all-inclusive.

== Concerned fields ==
*[[Statistics]]
*[[Experimental design]]
*[[Estimation theory]]

== Glossary ==
* {{anchor|alias}}Alias: When the estimate of an effect also includes the influence of one or more other effects (usually high order interactions) the effects are said to be aliased (see confounding). For example, if the estimate of effect ''D'' in a four factor experiment actually estimates (''D'' + ''ABC''), then the main effect ''D'' is aliased with the 3-way interaction ''ABC''. Note: This causes no difficulty when the higher order interaction is either non-existent or insignificant.
* [[Analysis of variance]] (ANOVA): A mathematical process for separating the variability of a group of observations into assignable causes and setting up various significance tests.
* [[Balanced design]]: An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.
* [[Blocking (statistics)|Blocking]]: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. Note: the reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.
* {{anchor|center}}Center Points: Points at the center value of all factor ranges. 
* {{anchor|center}}Coding Factor Levels: Transforming the scale of measurement for a factor so that the high value becomes +1 and the low value becomes -1 (see scaling). After coding all factors in a 2-level full factorial experiment, the design matrix has all orthogonal columns. Coding  is a simple linear transformation of the original measurement scale. If the "high" value is ''X''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and the "low" value is ''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (in the original scale), then the scaling transformation takes any original ''X'' value and converts it to (''X'' &amp;minus; ''a'')/''b'', where ''a'' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; + ''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2 and ''b'' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/2. To go back to the original measurement scale, just take the coded value and multiply it by ''b'' and add ''a'' or, ''X'' = ''b'' &amp;times; (coded value) + ''a''. As an example, if the factor is temperature and the high setting is 65°C and the low setting is 55°C, then ''a'' = (65 + 55)/2 = 60 and ''b'' = (65 &amp;minus; 55)/2 = 5. The center point (where the coded value is 0) has a temperature of 5(0) + 60 =  60°C.
* [[Comparative design]]: A design that allows the (typically mean-unbiased) estimation of the difference in factor effects, especially for the difference in treatment effects. The estimation of differences between treatment effects can be made with greater reliability than the estimation of absolute treatment effects.
* [[Confounding]]:  A confounding design is one where some treatment effects (main or interactions) are estimated by the same linear combination of the experimental observations as some blocking effects. In this case, the treatment effect and the blocking effect are said to be confounded. Confounding is also used as a general term to indicate that the value of a main effect estimate comes from both the main effect itself and also contamination or bias from higher order interactions. Note: Confounding designs naturally arise when full factorial designs have to be run in blocks and the block size is smaller than the number of different treatment combinations. They also occur whenever a fractional factorial design is chosen instead of a full factorial design.
* [[Control group]]: a set of experimental units to which incidental treatments are applied but not main treatments.  For example, in applying a herbicide as one treatment, plots receiving that treatment might be driven over by a machine applying the herbicide but treatments not receiving the herbicide would not normally be driven over.  The machine traffic is an incidental treatment. If there was a concern that the machine traffic might have an effect on the variable being measured (e.g. death of strawberry plants), then a control treatment would receive the machine traffic but no herbicide.  Control groups are a way of eliminating the possibility of incidental treatments being the cause of measured effects.  The incidental treatments are controlled for.  Compare [[treatment group]]s.  A treatment that is only the absence of the manipulation being studied is simply one of the treatments and not a control, though it is now common to refer to a non-manipulated treatment as a control.
* Crossed factors: See factors below.
* [[Design]]: A set of experimental runs which allows you to fit a particular model and estimate your desired effects.
* [[Design matrix]]: A matrix description of an experiment that is useful for constructing and analyzing experiments.
* [[Design of Experiments]]: A systematic, rigorous approach to engineering problem-solving that applies principles and techniques at the data collection stage so as to ensure the generation of valid, defensible, and supportable engineering conclusions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section3/pmd31.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Design Point: A single combination of settings for the independent variables of an experiment. A Design of Experiments will result in a set of design points, and each design point is designed to be executed one or more times, with the number of iterations based on the required statistical significance for the experiment.
* {{anchor|effect}}Effect (of a factor): How changing the settings of a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect. A treatment effect may be assumed to be the same for each experimental unit, by the assumption of treatment-unit additivity; more generally, the treatment effect may be the [[average treatment effect|average effect]]. Other effects may be [[block effect]]s. (For a factor A with two levels, scaled so that low = -1 and high = +1, the effect of A has a mean-unbiased estimator that is evaluated by subtracting the average observed response when A is -1 from the average observed response when A = +1 and dividing the result by 2; division by 2 is needed because the -1 level is 2 scaled units away from the +1 level.)
* [[errors and residuals in statistics|Error]]: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. See [[Errors and residuals in statistics]]. Note: experimental designs typically require understanding of both [[random error]] and [[Goodness of fit|lack of fit]] error.
* {{anchor|unit}}[[Experimental unit]]: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied. For example, an experimental unit can be a
** PC board
** silicon wafer
** tray of components simultaneously treated
** individual agricultural plants
** plot of land
** automotive transmissions
** etc.
* Factors: Process inputs that an investigator manipulates to cause a corresponding change in the output. Some factors cannot be controlled by the experimenter but may affect the responses. These uncontrolled factors should be measured and used in the data analysis, if their effect is significant. Note: The inputs can be discrete or continuous.
** [[Crossed factor]]s: Two factors are crossed if every level of one occurs with every level of the other in the experiment.
** [[Nested factors]]: A factor "A" is nested within another factor "B" if the levels or values of "A" are different for every level or value of "B". Note: Nested factors or effects have a hierarchical relationship.
* [[Fixed effect]]: An effect associated with an input variable that has a limited number of levels or in which only a limited number of levels are of interest to the experimenter.
* [[Interaction (statistics)|Interaction]]: Occurs when the effect of one factor on a response depends on the level of another factor(s).
* {{anchor|lof}}Lack of fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Note: Including replication in a designed experiment allows separation of experimental error into its components: [[Goodness of fit|lack of fit]] and random (pure) error.
* [[Statistical model|Model]]: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.
* Nested Factors: See factors above.
* [[Orthogonality]]: Two vectors of the same length are orthogonal if the sum of the products of their corresponding elements is 0. Note: An experimental design is orthogonal if the effects of any factor balance out (sum to zero) across the effects of the other factors.
* [[Paradigm (experimental)|Paradigm]]: a model created given the basic design, the hypothesis and the particular conditions for the experiment.
* [[Random effect]]: An effect associated with input variables chosen at random from a population having a large or infinite number of possible values.
* [[Random error]]: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Note: Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Note: Random error is also called experimental error.
* [[Randomization]]: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a designed experiment such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs. Note: The importance of randomization cannot be over stressed. Randomization is necessary for conclusions drawn from the experiment to be correct, unambiguous and defensible.
* [[Regression discontinuity design]]: A design in which assignment to a treatment is determined at least partly by the value of an observed covariate lying on either side of a fixed threshold.
* [[Replication (statistics)|Replication]]: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Note: Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.
*{{anchor|resolution}} Resolution: In [[fractional factorial design]]s, "resolution" describes the degree to which the estimated main-effects are aliased (or confounded) with estimated higher-order interactions (2-level interactions, 3-level interactions, etc.). In general, the resolution of a design is one more than the smallest order interaction which is aliased with some main effect. If some main effects are confounded with some 2-level interactions, the resolution is 3. Note: Full factorial designs have no confounding and are said to have resolution "infinity". For most practical purposes, a resolution 5 design is excellent and a resolution 4 design may be adequate. Resolution 3 designs are useful as economical screening designs.
* [[Dependent and independent variables|Response]](s): The output(s) of a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s).
* [[Response surface methodology|Response surface]]: A designed experiment that models the quantitative response, especially for the short-term goal of improving a process and the longer-term goal of finding optimum factor-values. &lt;!-- Note: These designs are most effective when there are less than 5 factors. (???)--&gt; Traditionally, response-surfaces have been modeled with quadratic-polynomials, whose estimation requires that every factor have three levels.
* [[Rotatability]]: A design is rotatable if the variance of the predicted response at any point x depends only on the distance of x from the design center point. A design with this property can be rotated around its center point without changing the prediction variance at x. Note: Rotatability is a desirable property for response surface designs (i.e. quadratic model designs).
* [[Scaling factor level]]s: Transforming factor levels so that the high value becomes +1 and the low value becomes -1.
* [[Screening design]]: A designed experiment that identifies which of many factors have a significant effect on the response. Note: Typically screening designs have more than 5 factors.
* [[Test plan]]: a written document that gives a specific listing of the test procedures and sequence to be followed.
* {{anchor|treatment}}Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.
* [[Treatment combination]]: The combination of the settings of several factors in a given experimental trial. Also known as a run.
* [[Treatment group]]: see [[Control group]]
* [[Variance component]]s: Partitioning of the overall variation into assignable components.

==Rank names==
{{Main article|Taxonomic rank}}
The main ranks are [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] (''regnum''), [[phylum]] or division (''divisio''), [[class (biology)|class]] (''classis''), [[order (biology)|order]] (''ordo''), [[family (biology)|family]] (''familia''), [[genus]] and [[species]].  The ranks of [[section (botany)|section]] and [[series (botany)|series]] are also used in botany for groups within genera, while [[section (zoology)|section]] is used in zoology for a division of an order. Further levels in the hierarchy can be made by the addition of prefixes such as sub-, super-, infra-, and so on.

Divisions such as "form", "variety", "strain", "breed", "[[cultivar]]", [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] (nothospecies) and "[[landrace]]" are used to describe various sub-specific groups in different fields.

It is possible for a [[clade]] to be unranked, for example [[Psoroptidia]] (Yunker, 1955) and the [[SAR supergroup]].

==Latin descriptions of names or taxa==
Note that in zoology the English descriptions, such as "conserved name", for example, are acceptable and generally used. This descriptions can be classified between accepted names (''nom. cons., nom. nov., nom. prot.'') and unaccepted combinations for different reasons (''nom. err., nom. illeg., nom. nud., nom. rej., nom. supp., nom. van.''), with some cases in between regarding the use (''nom. dub.'': used but not fully accepted; ''nom. obl.'': accepted but not fully used, so it yields precedence to a ''nom. prot'').

* ''[[Candidatus]]'' (''Ca.'') - a taxa proposed from incomplete information, such as uncultured bacteria known from metagenomics
* ''ex errore'' – made in error
* ''[[incertae sedis]]'' – of uncertain placement
* ''[[nomen conservandum]]'' (''nom. cons.''; plural: ''nomina conservanda'') – a conserved name

'''''Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-06-083134-9}}) is a book by [[Michael Kimmel]], published in 2008.  The book covers the culture for young men transitioning from [[adolescence]] to [[adulthood]].&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26317942#.T7Et4r_-4nQ |title= Boys to men: Why guys aren't growing up |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= August 27, 2008|work= [[MSNBC]] |publisher= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kzgSokNt|archivedate=2009-11-02| accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimmel interviewed 400 men aged 16 to 26 and identified a trend whereby young men increasingly delay adulthood.&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.edmontonsun.com/2011/10/05/boys-will-be-boys|title= Boys will be boys |last1= Jacobs |first1= Mindelle |last2= |first2= |date= October 5, 2011 |work= [[Edmonton Sun]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/style/tmagazine/07brubach.html?pagewanted=all|title= Dudes in Guyland |last1= Brubach |first1= Holly |last2= |first2= |date= September 4, 2008|work= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimmel notes that, in 1960, almost 70% of American men had by the age of 30 left home, completed their educations, found a partner and started work. By comparison, today less than a third of men reach these milestones before their thirties. Kimmel writes that young men are reluctant to grow up because they "see grown-up life as such a loss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/08/30/why-i-am-leaving-guyland.html|title= Why I Am Leaving Guyland |last1= Dokoupil |first1= Tony |last2= |first2= |date= August 28, 2008|work= [[Newsweek]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid the responsibilities of adulthood, young men retreat into a [[homosociality|homosocial]] world Kimmel terms "Guyland", a social space and a stage of life where "guys gather to be guys with each other, unhassled by the demands of parents, girlfriends, jobs, kids, and the other nuisances of adult life".&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; Young white men, in particular, feel a sense of "thwarted entitlement", believing that women and minorities have taken away traditionally white male jobs and positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/2008/09/17/guyland/ |title= Dude, where's my manhood? |last1= Hannaham |first1= James |last2= |first2= |date= September 17, 2008|work= [[Salon (website)]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edmonton"/&gt;

'''Halogen Foundation (Singapore)''' is an Institute of Public Character &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page03.aspx?id=1268 Institute of Public Character] Retrieved June 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[not-for-profit organization]] in [[Singapore]] whose mission is to inspire and influence a generation of young people to lead themselves and others well.

==Origins==
Halogen Foundation was started in 1997 in [[Australia]] originally called the Young Leaders Foundation. Its hallmark program is the National Young Leaders Days, an annual event initiated in 1997 to develop student leadership in schools. The Foundation exists in five major cities in [[Australia]] - [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It can also be found in [[New Zealand]], incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halogenfoundation.org/about.asp Who We Are.] Retrieved June 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and covering [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]], and [[Dunedin]].  It also has operations in [[Singapore]] where it is considered an Institute of Public Character.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
National Young Leaders Day consists of a range of presenters, who aim to motivate young leaders in taking action in their schools and passing on the lessons they have learned on the day. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Halogen Foundation is endorsed by national leaders of the respective countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">IBIS-2 is the version 2 of the land-surface model '''Integrated Biosphere Simulator''' (IBIS), which includes several major improvements and additions to the prototype model developed by Foley et al. [1996]. IBIS was designed to explicitly link land surface and hydrological processes, terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, and [[vegetation]] dynamics within a single physically consistent framework &lt;ref&gt;[Kucharik et al. 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBIS Functionality==

The model considers transient changes in vegetation composition and structure in response to environmental change and is, therefore, classified as a [[Dynamic Global Vegetation Model]] ([[DGVM]]) &lt;ref&gt;[Steffeen et al. 1992; Walker, 1994; W. Cramer et al., Dynamic responses of global terrestrial vegetation changes in CO2 and climate, submitted to Global Change Biology, 1999].&lt;/ref&gt; This new version of IBIS has improved representations of land surface physics, plant [[physiology]], canopy [[phenology]], [[plant functional type]] (PFT) differences, and [[carbon]] allocation. Furthermore, IBIS-2 includes a new belowground biogeochemistry submodel, which is coupled to detritus production (litterfall and fine root turnover). All process are organized in a hierarchical framework and operate at different time steps, ranging from 60 min to 1 year. Such an approach allows for explicit coupling among ecological, biophysical, and physiological processes occurring on different timescales.

==IBIS Structure==

The land surface module is based on the land surface transfer model (LSX) package of Thompson and Pollard,&lt;ref&gt;[1995a,b]&lt;/ref&gt; and simulates the energy, water, carbon, and momentum balance of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. The model represents two vegetation canopies (e.g., trees versus shrubs and grasses), eight soil layers, and three layers of snow (when required). The solar radiative transfer scheme of IBIS-2 has been simplified in comparison with LSX and IBIS-1; sunlit and shaded fractions of the canopies are no longer treated separately. The model now follows the approach of Sellers et al. [1986] and Bonan [1995]. Infrared radiation is simulated as if each vegetation layer is a semitransparent plane; canopy emissivity depends on foliage density. Another difference between IBIS-2 and IBIS-1 and LSX, is that IBIS-2 uses an empirical linear function of wind speed to estimate turbulent transfer between the soil surface and the lower vegetation canopy, and IBIS-1 and LSX use a logarithmic wind profile. The total [[evapotranspiration]] from the land surface is treated as the sum of three water vapor fluxes: evaporation from the soil surface, evaporation of water intercepted by vegetation canopies, and canopy transpiration.

IBIS simulates the variations of heat and moisture in the soil. The eight layers are described in terms of soil temperature, volumetric water content and ice content.&lt;ref&gt;[Pollard and Thompson, 1995; Foley et al. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; All the process occurring in the soil are influenced by the soil texture and amount of organic matter within the soil. One difference from the physiological processes in previous version of the model is that IBIS-1 calculates the maximum [[Rubisco]] carboxylation capacity (Vm) by optimizing the net assimilation of carbon by the leaf.&lt;ref&gt;[Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; IBIS-2 prescribes constant values of Vm for the plant functional typed (PFT). To scale [[photosynthesis]] and transpiration from the leaf level to canopy level, IBIS-2 assumes that the net photosynthesis within the canopy is proportional to the APAR within it.

==Soil Biogeochemistry==

In the original version of IBIS &lt;ref&gt;[Foley et al. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; there was no explicit below ground biogeochemistry model to complete flow of carbon between the vegetation, detritus, and [[soil organic matter]] pools. IBIS-2 includes a new soil biogeochemistry module.&lt;ref&gt;[Kucharik et al., submitted manuscript, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Interpretation of Schizophrenia''''' (first edition, 1955) is a book by Italy-born American [[psychiatrist]] [[Silvano Arieti]] in which the author sets forth [[demonstrative evidence]] of a [[psychological]] [[etiology]] for [[schizophrenia]].

Arieti expanded the book vastly in 1974 ({{ISBN|0-465-03429-2}}) and that edition won the U.S. [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#The Sciences|Science category]].&lt;ref name=nba1975&gt;
[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html "National Book Awards – 1975"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909065656/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html |date=2011-09-09 }}. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' is a 756-page book divided in 45 chapters. Arieti begins his book stating that it is difficult to define schizophrenia.  He asks if schizophrenia is an [[Mental illness|illness]] and answers in the negative, since the disorder is not understood in classic [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchowian]] criterion of cellular [[pathology]].  Though those searching for a [[biological psychiatry|biological basis]] of schizophrenia far outnumber those undertaking [[Psychology|psychological]] approaches, Arieti supports the [[Trauma model|minority view]].  He believes schizophrenia is an unrealistic way to represent both the self and the world and praises psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] for stressing the importance of psychological factors in the etiology of schizophrenia.  Arieti also mentions that [[Freud]] felt that in schizophrenia the patient's relationship with people is handicapped (an observation that resembles what presently is called ''[[autism]]'').

==Family as a cause==

Arieti then describes the psychogenic factors that lead to the disorder.  The family environment and psychodynamics in the etiology of [[psychosis]] comes under scrutiny.  Arieti describes the building of [[neurosis|neurotic]] and psychotic defense mechanisms; the emerging schizoid personality, and fully developed schizophrenia understood as an injury to the [[Self (psychology)|inner self]].  Arieti believes that a state of extreme [[anxiety]] originating in early [[childhood]] produces vulnerability for the whole life of the individual.

A characteristic of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is a prolonged childhood with a consequently extended dependency on adults.  This, according to Arieti, "is the basis of the psychodynamics of schizophrenia", a claim that also appears in later writers on [[child abuse]] such as [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and Colin Ross.  Arieti reviews the paper by [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]] about the  [[Theodore Lidz#.E2.80.9CSchizophrenogenic.E2.80.9D parents|"schizophrenogenic" mother]] and reaches the tentative conclusion that only 25 percent of the mothers of people with schizophrenia in his clinical experience fit that image.  However, he adds that only in a minority of schizophrenia cases "the child is able to retain the good maternal image".  Arieti also mentions the work of [[Theodore Lidz]], another [[trauma model]] author of schizophrenia.  Like Lidz, Arieti emphasizes the weakness of the father of the patient with schizophrenia in the paternal role.  In Arieti's own words:

:''In the first edition of this book I have described one family constellation [...] when a domineering, nagging and hostile mother, who gives the child no chance to assert himself, is married to a dependent, weak man, who is too weak to help the child [...].  In these families the weak parent [...] becomes antagonistic and [[Hostility|hostile]] toward the children because [...] he displaces his anger from the spouse to the children, as the spouse is too strong to be a suitable target.''

The roles can be reversed when the domineering spouse is the father.  Arieti is convinced that each schizophrenia case is representative of those human situations in which something went extremely wrong.  "If we ignore it, we become deaf to a profound message that the patient may try to convey".  For example, Arieti states about one of his patients that "his adolescence was a crescendo of frustration, anxiety and injury to self-esteem".  Arieti also mentions a catatonic patient who, after [[Introjection|introjecting]] the mother's engulfing behavior, believed that by moving he could produce havoc.  The patient's feelings, according to Arieti, became reminiscent of cosmic powers that may cause the destruction of the universe, so the patient chose immobility.  For Arieti, the selectivity of certain motor actions is proof that [[catatonia]] is not a biological disease or illness, but rather a disorder of the will.

==Inner world of the schizophrenic==

In Part three of ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti describes how in spite of its efforts to stay in reality, the patient's defenses finally succumb.  When the patient "cannot change the unbearable situation of himself any longer, he has to change reality".  Arieti examines the inner world of the person with schizophrenia.

When a patient states he is [[Jesus]] he is compensating a feeling of extreme [[humiliation]] at home.  The [[Paranoia|paranoid]] schizophrenic, Arieti explains, resorts to "teleologic causality" or [[animism]] to understand the world.  He writes that whatever occurs to the patient is interpreted as willed by the parental [[Dissociative identity disorder|alters]] of the patient.  In deterministic or teleologic causality, if [[Nature]]'s happenings were not willed they simply would not occur.  In paranoid [[projection (psychology)|projection]] the schizophrenic takes out from him/herself a disagreeable part of the self onto the world.  In ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti illustrates all of the above theoretical constructions with concrete cases of his clinical experience as a psychiatrist.

Arieti maintains that in every case of schizophrenia that he studied serious [[dysfunctional family|family disturbance]] was found.  When the patient idealizes the parent the idealized image of the parent is maintained in the patient's mind at the expense of an unbearable [[self-image]].  He speculates that psychosis starts only when the malevolent image of the parent is transformed "into a distressing other".  The parent or parents alters enter the mind accusing the patient of "bad child" or other equivalent accusations in voices that the [[Hearing Voices Movement|adult patient hears]].

Since the 1980s, and into the beginnings of 21st century, [[Biological psychiatry|biological psychiatric]] models of schizophrenia almost completely took over the [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] profession.  Current research into the disorder focuses on [[neurobiology]].  Psychological approaches to schizophrenia like Arieti's are a rarity in the profession, although this structurally created circumstance neglects the obvious connection between psychological phenomena and [[neurotransmitter]] levels, which can be changed through certain practices, like [[Yoga]], [[meditation]], [[hyperventilation]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[sleep deprivation]], among others.

The '''Javan rhinoceros''' (''Rhinoceros sondaicus''), also known as the '''Sunda rhinoceros''' or '''lesser one-horned rhinoceros''', is a very rare member of the family [[Rhinocerotidae]] and one of five extant [[rhinoceros]]es. It belongs to the same genus as the [[Indian rhinoceros]], and has similar mosaic, armour-like skin, but at {{convert|3.1|–|3.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|1.4|–|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, it is smaller (closer in size to the [[black rhinoceros]] of the genus ''[[Diceros]]''). Its horn is usually shorter than {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and is smaller than those of the other rhino species. Only adult males have horns; females lack them altogether.

Once the most widespread of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], throughout Southeast Asia, and into [[India]] and [[China]]. The species is [[critically endangered]], with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth,&lt;ref name="Dinerstein" /&gt;{{rp|21}} with a population of as few as 58 to 61 in [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] at the western tip of Java in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhino population figures|url=https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/rhino_population_figures|publisher=SaveTheRhino.org|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second population in [[Cat Tien National Park]] in [[Vietnam]] was declared by some conservation groups to be extinct in 2011.&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt; The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to [[poaching]], primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the [[black market]].&lt;ref name="Dinerstein" /&gt;{{rp|31}} As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the [[Vietnam War]], in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery.&lt;ref name="Santiapillai" /&gt; The remaining range is within [[Ujung Kulon National Park|one nationally protected area]], but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to [[inbreeding depression]].

The Javan rhino can live around 30–45&amp;nbsp;years in the wild. It historically inhabited lowland [[rain forest]], wet grasslands, and large floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and offspring-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no [[predator]]s in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly due to their extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on [[camera trap]]s and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on February 28, 2011, by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild.&lt;ref name="panda.org Javan calves" /&gt; In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring pairs and courting adults.&lt;ref name="Mongabay video" /&gt; There are a 58 to 68 individuals left in the wild,&lt;ref name=setiawan/&gt; and none in captivity, after the death of a male rhinoceros named Samson. Samson died in April 2018 at 30 years of age, far younger than the species' usual lifespan of 50 to 60 years, so DNA test is being conducted to explore the cause of death, including the possibility of inbreeding degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2018/05/indonesia-cites-twisted-bowel-in-death-of-javan-rhino/|title=Indonesia cites twisted bowel in death of Javan rhino |author=Basten Gokkon |date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy and naming ==
The first studies of the Javan rhinoceros by [[naturalist]]s from outside of its region took place in 1787, when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls were sent to the renowned Dutch naturalist [[Petrus Camper]], who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan rhinoceros was shot on the island of Sumatra by [[Alfred Duvaucel]], who sent the specimen to his stepfather [[Georges Cuvier]], the famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by [[Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest]] as ''Rhinoceros sondaicus''. It was the last species of rhinoceros to be identified.&lt;ref name="Rookmaaker" /&gt; Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this to say his specimen was from Java.&lt;ref name="Zeitschrift" /&gt;

The genus name ''Rhinoceros'', which also includes the Indian rhinoceros, is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] words ῥίς (''rhis''), which means "nose", and κέρας (''ceras''), which means "horn"; ''sondaicus'' is derived from ''[[sundaland|sunda]]'', the [[biogeography|biogeographical]] region that comprises the islands of Sumatra, Java, [[Borneo]], and surrounding smaller islands. The Javan rhino is also known as the lesser one-horned rhinoceros (in contrast with the greater one-horned rhinoceros, another name for the Indian rhino).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhinos-irf.org/javan/ |title=Javan Rhino (Rhinoceros sondaicus) |publisher=International Rhino Foundation |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722044955/http://www.rhinos-irf.org/javan/ |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the three distinct subspecies, only one still is known to exist:

* '''''R. s. sondaicus''''', the [[nominate subspecies]], known as the '''Indonesian Javan rhinoceros''', once lived on Java and Sumatra. The population, estimated at 63 individuals, is now confined to the Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of the island of Java. One researcher has suggested that the Javan rhino on Sumatra belonged to a distinct subspecies, ''R. s. floweri'', but this is not widely accepted.&lt;ref name="IUCN2011.2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;
* '''''R. s. annamiticus''''', known as the '''Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros''', [[Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticu]] or '''Vietnamese rhinoceros''', once lived across [[South China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Malaysia]]. The subspecific ''annamiticus'' is derived from the [[Annamite Range|Annamite Mountain Range]] in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the [[Cat Tien National Park]] in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="IUCN2011.2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt; The last known individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010.&lt;ref name="Gersmann" /&gt;
* '''''R. s. inermis''''', known as the '''Indian Javan rhinoceros''' or '''lesser Indian rhinoceros''', once ranged from [[Bengal]] to [[Burma]], but is presumed to have gone extinct before 1925.&lt;ref name="scribd" /&gt; The subspecific ''inermis'' means "unarmed", as the most distinctive characteristic of this subspecies is the small horns in males, and evident lack of horns in females. The original specimen&lt;!--is this to say, the "type specimen"?--&gt; of this species was a hornless female. The political situation in Burma has prevented an assessment of the species in that country, but its survival is considered unlikely.&lt;ref name="Foose" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pachy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NE India" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
{{main|Rhinoceros#Evolution}}
[[File:Panzernashorn2004.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian rhinoceros]] pictured here is the species most closely related to the Javan rhinoceros; they are the two members of the [[type genus]] ''Rhinoceros''.]]

Ancestral rhinoceroses are held to have first diverged from other [[perissodactyl]]s in the [[Early Eocene]]. [[Mitochondrial DNA]] comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of [[Equidae]] around 50 million years ago.&lt;ref name="DNA" /&gt; The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the Late Eocene in [[Eurasia]], and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Lacombat" /&gt;

The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, the only members of the genus ''Rhinoceros'', first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Tougard" /&gt; Although belonging to the [[type genus]], the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized that they may be closely related to the extinct ''Gaindatherium'' or ''Punjabitherium''. A detailed [[clade|cladistic]] analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed ''Rhinoceros'' and the extinct ''Punjabitherium'' in a clade with ''[[Dicerorhinus]]'', the Sumatran rhino. Other studies have suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species.&lt;ref name="Cerdeno" /&gt; The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago,&lt;ref name="Lacombat" /&gt; or as far back as 25.9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data.&lt;ref name="Tougard" /&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Javan Rhino 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Captive Javan rhino, around 1900]]

The Javan rhino is smaller than the Indian rhinoceros, and is close in size to the black rhinoceros. It is the largest animal in Java and the second-largest animal in Indonesia after the [[Asian elephant]]. The length of the Javan rhino including its head is 2 to 4 metres (6.5 to 13 feet), and it can reach a height of {{convert|1.4|–|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Adults are variously reported to weigh between {{convert|900|and|2,300|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although a study to collect accurate measurements of the animals has never been conducted and is not a priority because of their extreme conservation status.&lt;ref name="arkive" /&gt; No substantial [[sexual dimorphism|size difference]] is seen between genders, but females may be slightly bigger. The rhinos in Vietnam appeared to be significantly smaller than those in Java, based on studies of photographic evidence and measurements of their footprints.&lt;ref name="van Strien" /&gt;

Like the Indian rhino, the Javan rhinoceros has a single horn (the other extant species have two horns). Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} with the longest recorded only {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Only males have horns. Female Javan rhinos are the only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of an inch or two in height. The Javan rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting, but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (Black, Sumatran, and Indian), the Javan rhino has a long, pointed, upper lip which helps in grabbing food. Its lower [[incisor]]s are long and sharp; when the Javan rhino fights, it uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan rhino smells and hears well, but has very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.&lt;ref name="van Strien" /&gt;

Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin falls in folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck folds of the Javan rhinoceros are smaller than those of the Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.&lt;ref name="NatPost" /&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Ujungkulon.jpg|thumb|Java's [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] is the home of all remaining Javan rhinos.]]

Even the most optimistic estimate suggests fewer than 100 Javan rhinos remain in the wild. They are considered one of the most endangered species in the world.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 4 January 2010" /&gt; The Javan rhinoceros is known to survive in only one place, the Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of Java.&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The animal was once widespread from [[Assam]] and [[Bengal]] (where their range would have overlapped with both the Sumatran and Indian rhinos)&lt;ref name="NE India" /&gt; eastward to Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southwards to the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the islands of Sumatra, Java, and possibly Borneo.&lt;ref name="Raffles" /&gt; The Javan rhino primarily inhabits dense, lowland rain forests, grasslands, and reed beds with abundant rivers, large floodplains, or wet areas with many mud wallows. Although it historically preferred low-lying areas, the subspecies in Vietnam was pushed onto much higher ground (up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;m or 6,561&amp;nbsp;ft), probably because of human encroachment and poaching.&lt;ref name="Foose" /&gt;

The range of the Javan rhinoceros has been shrinking for at least 3,000 years. Starting around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, the northern range of the rhinoceros extended into China, but began moving southward at roughly {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year, as human settlements increased in the region.&lt;ref name="Biotropica" /&gt; It likely became locally extinct in India in the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="NE India" /&gt; The Javan rhino was hunted to extinction on the Malay Peninsula by 1932.&lt;ref name="Straits" /&gt; The last ones on Sumatra died out during [[World War II]]. They were extinct from [[Chittagong Hill Tracts|Chittagong]] and [[the Sunderbans]] by the middle of the 20th century. By the end of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese rhinoceros was believed extinct across all of mainland Asia. Local hunters and woodcutters in Cambodia claim to have seen Javan rhinos in the [[Cardamom Mountains]], but surveys of the area have failed to find any evidence of them.&lt;ref name="FFI" /&gt; In the late 1980s, a small population was found in the Cat Tien area of Vietnam. However, the last individual of that population was shot in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] (25 October 2011) [http://vietnam.panda.org/en/newsroom/news/?202075/Inadequate-protection-causes-Javan-rhino-extinction-in-Vietnam Inadequate protection causes Javan rhino extinction in Vietnam].&lt;/ref&gt; A population may have existed on the island of Borneo, as well, though these specimens could have been the Sumatran rhinoceros, a small population of which still lives there.&lt;ref name="Raffles" /&gt;

== Behavior ==
[[File:JavanRhino-PeterMaas-NaturalisLeiden.jpg|thumb|A museum specimen of a juvenile ''R. s. sondaicus'']]

The Javan rhinoceros is a solitary animal with the exception of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. [[Wallowing in animals|Wallowing]] in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at {{convert|12|–|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}²) compared to the female, which are around {{convert|3|–|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.&lt;ref name="IZY" /&gt;

Males [[territorial marking|mark their territories]] with dung piles and by [[urine spraying]]. Scrapes made by the feet in the ground and twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a peculiar habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.&lt;ref name="IZY" /&gt;&lt;ref name=setiawan&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Setiawan, R. ''et al''.|title=Preventing Global Extinction of the Javan Rhino: Tsunami Risk and Future Conservation Direction|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12366 |date=February 2018|doi=10.1111/conl.12366 |journal=Conservation Letters|volume=11|issue=1|page=e12366}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Javan rhino is much less vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, particularly in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study.&lt;ref name="Santiapillai" /&gt; Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head.&lt;ref name="IZY" /&gt; Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;

== Diet ==
The Javan rhinoceros is herbivorous, eating diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Most of the plants favored by the species grow in sunny areas in forest clearings, shrubland and other vegetation types with no large trees. The rhino knocks down saplings to reach its food and grabs it with its prehensile upper lip. It is the most adaptable feeder of all the rhino species. Currently, it is a pure browser, but probably once both browsed and grazed in its historical range. The rhino eats an estimated {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of food daily. Like the Sumatran rhino, it needs salt in its diet. The salt licks common in its historical range do not exist in Ujung Kulon but the rhinos there have been observed drinking seawater, likely for the same nutritional need.&lt;ref name="IZY" /&gt; 

== Conservation ==
{{see also|Rhinoceros#Horns|l1=Rhinoceros's Horns}}
[[File:Javan Rhino Zimmerman.jpg|thumb|left|A painting from 1861 depicts the hunting of ''R. s. sondaicus'']]

The main factor in the continued decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom.&lt;ref name="AP2" /&gt; Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money.&lt;ref name="Biotropica" /&gt; When the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal.&lt;ref name="African" /&gt; Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.&lt;ref name="Dinerstein" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

As with many types Asian and African [[megafauna]], the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades following the arrival of Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of [[big game hunting|big-game hunting]] that by the time the rhino's plight was made known to the world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained.

Loss of habitat because of agriculture has also contributed to its decline, though this is no longer as significant a factor because the rhinoceros only lives in one nationally protected park. Deteriorating habitats have hindered the recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching. Even with all the conservation efforts, the prospects for their survival are grim. Because the population is restricted to one small area, they are very susceptible to disease and  [[inbreeding depression]]. Conservation geneticists estimate a population of 100 rhinos would be needed to preserve the genetic diversity of this [[conservation-reliant species]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

=== Ujung Kulon ===
[[File:Dead Javan Rhino.jpg|thumb|A Dutch hunter with a dead ''R. s. sondaicus'' in Ujung Kulon, 1895]]

The Ujung Kulon peninsula of Java was devastated by the eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 1883. The Javan rhinoceros recolonized the peninsula after the event, but humans never returned in large numbers, thus creating a haven for wildlife.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In 1931, as the Javan rhinoceros was on the brink of extinction in Sumatra, the government of the Dutch East Indies declared the rhino a legally protected species, which it has remained ever since.&lt;ref name="Foose" /&gt; A census of the rhinos in Ujung Kulon was first conducted in 1967; only 25 animals were recorded. By 1980, that population had doubled, and has remained steady, at about 50, ever since. Although the rhinos in Ujung Kulon have no natural predators, they have to compete for scarce resources with wild cattle, which may keep their numbers below the peninsula's [[carrying capacity]].&lt;ref name="IPS" /&gt; Ujung Kulon is managed by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry.&lt;ref name="Foose" /&gt; Evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006, the most ever documented for the species.&lt;ref name="BBCpop" /&gt;

In March 2011, hidden-camera video was published showing adults and juveniles, indicating recent matings and breeding.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au 2011-03-01" /&gt; During the period from January to October 2011, the cameras had captured images of 35 rhinos. As of December 2011, a rhino breeding sanctuary in an area of 38,000&amp;nbsp;hectares is being finalized to help reach the target of 70 to 80 Javan rhinos by 2015.&lt;ref name="physorg" /&gt;

In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 video cameras to the existing 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge the size of the animals' population. A recent survey has found far fewer females than males. Only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in the eastern half of Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species.&lt;ref name="thejakartaglobe 17 April 2012" /&gt;

With Ujung Kulon as the last resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an advantage over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or [[tsunami]]s could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the [[Arenga pinnata|arenga palm]], which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. Following the trails of Javan rhinoceros allowed in-depth observation of their feeding habits in their natural habitat. Comparing the acid insoluble ash (MA) content of faeces and in the dry weight of food provided reliable estimates of digestibility, and this method has potential for wider application in situations where total collection of faecal matter is not feasible. There was a strong positive correlation between the size of home range and diversity of food intake, and between the size of home range with the numbers of wallow holes used. The quantity and quality of food intake were variable among rhinoceroses and over time. Overall energy consumption was related to the size of the animal, while the digestibility of plants consumed appeared to be influenced by individual age and habitat conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hariyadi |first=A.

In May 2017, Director of the Biodiversity Conservation at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Bambang Dahono Adji announced plans to transfer the rhinos to the [[Cikepuh Wildlife Sanctuary]] located in West Java.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2017/05/24/199878302/Javan-Rhinos-to-be-Transferred-to-Cikepuh-Wildlife-Reserve&lt;/ref&gt;   The animals will first undergo DNA tests to determine lineage and risk to disease so as to avoid issues such as "inbreeding" or marriage kinship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/nasional/2017/05/19/badak-jawa-akan-jalani-tes-dna-sebelum-dipindah-ke-cikepuh-401509&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antaranews.com/berita/630835/badak-jawa-akan-huni-suaka-margasatwa-cikepuh&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cat Tien ===

Once widespread in Southeast Asia, the Javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in Vietnam in the mid-1970s, at the end of the Vietnam War. The combat wrought havoc on the ecosystems of the region through the use of [[napalm]], extensive defoliation from [[Agent Orange]], aerial bombing, use of landmines, and overhunting by local poachers.&lt;ref name="AP2" /&gt;

In 1988, the assumption of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the [[Dong Nai River]].&lt;ref name="AP1" /&gt; Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited became part of the Cat Tien National Park in 1992.&lt;ref name="AP2" /&gt;

By the early 2000s, their population was feared to have declined past the point of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCpop" /&gt; Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.&lt;ref name="Santiapillai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

Genetic analysis of dung samples collected in Cat Tien National Park in a survey from October 2009 to March 2010 showed only a single individual Javan rhinoceros remained in the park. In early May 2010, the body of a Javan rhino was found in the park. The animal had been shot and its horn removed by poachers.&lt;ref name="panda.org Vietnam Rhino" /&gt; In October 2011, the International Rhino Foundation confirmed the Javan rhinoceros was extinct in Vietnam, leaving only the rhinos in Ujung Kulon.&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gersmann" /&gt;&lt;!-- couldn't find the original report, or anything giving the months of dung surveys --&gt;&lt;ref name="wwf.panda" /&gt;

=== In captivity ===
A Javan rhinoceros has not been exhibited in a zoo for over a century. In the 19th century, at least four rhinos were exhibited in [[Adelaide]], [[Calcutta]], and [[London]]. At least 22 Javan rhinos have been documented as having been kept in captivity; the true number is possibly greater, as the species was sometimes confused with the Indian rhinoceros.&lt;ref name="Garten" /&gt;

The Javan rhinoceros never fared well in captivity. The oldest lived to be 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of a captive rhino giving birth. The last captive Javan rhino died at the [[Adelaide Zoo]] in [[Australia]] in 1907, where the species was so little known that it had been exhibited as an Indian rhinoceros.&lt;ref name="van Strien" /&gt;

==In culture==
[[File:Angkor_Wat_Rhino.jpg|thumb|Rhino tormenting the damned in the "heaven and hell" gallery at Angkor Wat (12th century)]]
The Javan rhinoceros occurred in [[Cambodia]] in the past and there are at least three depictions of rhinos in the [[bas relief]]s of the temple at [[Angkor Wat]]. The west wing of the North Gallery has a relief that shows a rhino mounted by a god thought to be the fire god [[Agni]]. The rhinos are thought to be Javan rhinoceros rather than the somewhat similar looking one-horned [[Indian rhino]] on the basis of the skinfold on the shoulder which continues along the back in the Javan to give a saddle-like appearance. A depiction of the rhino in the east wing of the South Gallery shows a rhino attacking the damned in the panel depicting [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. An [[architect]] of the temple is thought to have been an Indian [[Brahmin]] priest named Divakarapandita (1040-1120 AD) who served king Jayavarman VI, Dharanindravarman I as well as [[Suryavarman II]] who constructed the temple. It is thought that the Indian priest who died before the construction of the temple might have influenced the use of tubercles on the skin which are based on the Indian rhino while the local Khmer artisans carved the other details of the rhinos based on the more familiar local Javan rhino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Some observations on the presence of one-horned rhinos in the bas reliefs of the Angkor Wat temple complex, Cambodia| author1=de Longh, H.H.|author2=Prins, H.H.T.| author3=van Strien, N.| author4=Rookmaaker, L.G.| journal=Pachyderm| volume=38| year=2005| pages=98–100|url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/117/1175858138.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the rhinoceros as the [[vahana]] of the god Agni is unique to Khmer culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1515/mamm.2005.039|title=A documented 20th century record of Javan Rhinoceros Rhinoceros sondaicus from Cambodia|journal=Mammalia|volume=69|issue=3–4|year=2005|last1=Poole|first1=Colin M|last2=Duckworth|first2=John W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Erklärung des Nashornreiters auf den Reliefs von Angkor-Vat|pages= 128–130|first=Heinrich |last=Stönner|doi=10.2307/3248014 |jstor=3248014 |journal=Artibus Asiae| volume= 1| issue= 2|year= 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rhinoceros carving in the centre of a circular arrangement in a column with other circles containing [[elephant]]s and [[water buffalo]] is known from the temple of [[Ta Prohm]]. It has been at the centre of anachronistic speculation that it might represent a [[Stegosauria|Stegosaur]] due to the leaves behind it that give the impression of plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stegosaurus, Rhinoceros, or Hoax?|author=Switek, Brian|year=2009|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/stegosaurus-rhinoceros-or-hoax-40387948/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critically Endangered ==
According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] [https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/javan-rhino (WWF)] the Javan rhino is the most threatened rhino species with only 58-68 remaining in Ujung Kulan National Park in Java, Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/javan-rhino|title=Javan Rhino|website=WWF|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the WWF, there are many threats faced by the Javan rhino for survival for its species that result in its designation as "critically endangered". One of those threats is its "reduced genetic diversity",&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"/&gt; because the low number of existing Javan rhinos results in a low amount of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding, making it difficult for the Javan rhino to survive.&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"/&gt;  The WWF also identifies "natural disasters" as another threat faced by Javan rhinos, because Ujung National Park can be affected by tsunamis&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"/&gt; or the explosion of the nearby volcano Anak Krakatau,&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"/&gt; which potentially could wipe out the entire Javan rhino species.  A third threat identified by the WWF is "disease", given that four Javan rhinos are believed to have died from a disease transmitted to them by wild cattle.&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"/&gt; Another threat is "habitat degradation", since the WWF reports that people are encroaching and developing areas near the Ujung National Park and thus destroying the last known habitat of the Javan rhino.&lt;ref name="Javan Rhino"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9862">'''Kinetic exchange models''' are multi-agent dynamic models inspired by the [[statistical physics]] of energy distribution, which try to explain the robust and universal features of income/wealth distributions.

Understanding the [[Distribution of wealth|distributions]] of [[income]] and [[wealth]] in an [[economy]] has been a classic problem in [[economics]] for more than a hundred years. Today it is one of the main branches of [[econophysics]].

==Data and basic tools==
In 1897, [[Vilfredo Pareto]] first found a universal feature in the [[distribution of wealth]]. After that, with some notable exceptions, this field had been dormant for many decades, although accurate data had been accumulated over this period.
Considerable investigations with the real data during the last fifteen years (1995–2010) revealed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chatterjee |first1=A. |last2=Yarlagadda |first2=S. |last3=Chakrabarti |first3=B.K. |title=Econophysics of Wealth Distributions  |publisher= Springer-Verlag (Milan) |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the tail (typically 5 to 10 percent of agents in any country) of the [[income]]/[[wealth]] distribution indeed follows a [[power law]]. However, the majority of the population (i.e., the low-income population) follows a different distribution which is debated to be either [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs]]
or [[log-normal]].

Basic tools used in this type of modelling are [[Probability|probabilistic]] and [[Statistics|statistical]] methods mostly taken from the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of [[statistical physics]]. [[Monte Carlo simulations]] often come handy in solving these models.

==Overview of the models==
Since the distributions of income/wealth are the results of the interaction among many heterogeneous [[Agent (economics)|agents]], there is an analogy with [[statistical mechanics]], where many particles interact. This similarity was noted by [[Meghnad Saha]] and B. N. Srivastava in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saha |first1=M. |last2=Srivastava |first2=B.N.  |title=A Treatise on Heat |publisher=Indian Press (Allahabad) |year=1931 |page=105}} (the page is reproduced in Fig. 6 in Sitabhra Sinha, [[Bikas K Chakrabarti]], [http://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/papers/sinha_chakrabarti_physicsnews_09.pdf ''Towards a physics of economics''], Physics News 39(2) 33-46, April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and thirty years later by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=B.B. |title=The Pareto-Levy law and the distribution of income |journal=International Economic Review |volume=1 |pages=69 |year=1960 |doi=10.2307/2525289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, an elementary version of the stochastic exchange model was first proposed by J. Angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angle |first=J. |title=The surplus theory of social stratification and the size distribution of personal wealth |journal=Social Forces |volume=65 |issue=2 |jstor=2578675 |doi=10.2307/2578675 |pages=293–326 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of kinetic theory of gases, such an exchange model was first investigated by A. Dragulescu and V. Yakovenko.&lt;ref name="DragulescuYakovenko"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dragulescu |first1=A. |last2=Yakovenko |first2=V. |title=The statistical mechanics of money |journal=European Physical Journal B  |volume=17 |year=2000 |pages=723–729 |doi=10.1007/s100510070114|arxiv=cond-mat/0001432 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..723D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garibaldi |first1=U. |last2=Scalas |first2=E. |last3=Viarenga |first3=P. |title=Statistical equilibrium in exchange games |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=60 |pages=241–246 |year=2007 |work= |doi=10.1140/epjb/e2007-00338-5|bibcode=2007EPJB...60..241G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main modelling effort has been put to introduce the concepts of [[savings]],&lt;ref name="ChakrabortiChakrabarti"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chakraborti |first1=A. |last2=Chakrabarti |first2=B.K. |title= Statistical mechanics of money: how savings propensity affects its distribution |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=17 |pages=167–170 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/s100510070173|arxiv=cond-mat/0004256 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..167C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatterjee |first1=A. |last2=Chakrabarti |first2=B.K. |last3=Manna |first3=K.S.S. |title=Pareto law in a kinetic model of market with random saving propensity |journal=Physica A |volume=335 |pages=155–163 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.11.014|arxiv=cond-mat/0301289 |bibcode=2004PhyA..335..155C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[taxation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guala |first1=S. |title=Taxes in a simple wealth distribution model by inelastically scattering particles |journal=Interdisciplinary description of complex systems |volume=7 | issue = 1  |pages=1–7 |year=2009|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the setting of an [[ideal gas]]-like system. Basically, it assumes that in the short-run, an economy remains conserved in terms of income/wealth; therefore ''[[law of conservation]]'' for income/wealth can be applied. Millions of such conservative transactions lead to a steady state distribution of money ([[gamma function]]-like in the ''Chakraborti-Chakrabarti'' model with uniform savings,&lt;ref name="ChakrabortiChakrabarti"/&gt; and a gamma-like bulk distribution ending with a [[Pareto tail]]&lt;ref name="ChakrabortiPatriarca"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chakraborti |first=A. |last2=Patriarca |first2=M. |title= Variational Principle for the Pareto Power Law | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.228701 |journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=103 |pages=228701 |year=2009 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103v8701C |pmid=20366128|arxiv=cond-mat/0605325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Chatterjee-Chakrabarti-Manna'' model with distributed savings&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;) and the distribution converges to it. The distributions derived thus have close resemblance with those found in [[empirical]] cases of income/wealth distributions.

Though this theory has been originally derived from the [[entropy maximization]] principle of [[statistical mechanics]], it has recently been shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. S. Chakrabarti |author2=B. K. Chakrabarti |title=Microeconomics of the ideal gas like market models |journal=Physica A |volume=388 |pages=4151–4158 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2009.06.038|arxiv=0905.3972 |bibcode=2009PhyA..388.4151C }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the same could be derived from the [[utility maximization]] principle as well, following a standard exchange-model with [[Cobb-Douglas]] [[utility function]]. The exact distributions produced by this class of kinetic models are known only in certain limits and extensive investigations have been made on the mathematical structures of this class of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=During |first1=B. |last2=Matthes |first2=D. |last3=Toscani |first3=G. |title=Kinetic equations modelling wealth distributions: a comparison of approaches |journal=Physical Review E |volume=78 |pages=056103 |year=2008 |doi=10.1103/physreve.78.056103|bibcode=2008PhRvE..78e6103D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cordier | first1=S. |last2=Pareschi |first2=L. |last3=Toscani |first3=G. |title=On a kinetic model for a simple market economy |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=120 |pages=253–277 |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/s10955-005-5456-0|arxiv=math/0412429 |bibcode=2005JSP...120..253C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general forms have not been derived so far.

==Criticisms==
This class of models has attracted criticisms from many dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Mauro Gallegati]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Thomas Lux]] and [[Paul Ormerod]] |title= Worrying Trends in Econophysics|journal=Physica A |volume=371 |pages=1–6 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2006.04.029|bibcode=2006PhyA..370....1G}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been debated for long whether the distributions derived from these models are representing the income distributions or wealth distributions. The ''[[law of conservation]]'' for income/wealth has also been a subject of criticism.

'''''La Recherche''''' is a monthly [[French language]] [[popular science]] [[magazine]] covering recent scientific news. It is published by the Société d'éditions scientifiques (the ''Scientific Publishing Group''), a subsidiary of Financière Tallandier. Tallandier is owned by Artémis, an investment company of [[François-Henri Pinault]]. The headquarters is in [[Paris]].

==History==
Created in 1946 Under the name ''Atomes'' (''Atoms''), it changed its name to the current ''La Recherche'' in 1970. The first issue with the title was published in May 1970.&lt;ref name="luc"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Luc Allemand|title=Will the Internet Save or Condemn Science Press?|journal=MÈTODE Science Studies Journal|date=2014|volume=4|doi=10.7203/metode.80.3086|url=http://metode.cat/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;task=download&amp;id=1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; It absorbed the French journal ''Nucleus'', formerly ''La Revue Scientifique de France et de l'étranger'' (the ''Scientific Journal of France and Abroad'') in 1971, followed by ''Science Progrès, Découverte'', formerly ''[[La Nature]]'' in 1973. ''La Recherche'' is published monthly.&lt;ref name="luc"/&gt; The website of the magazine was started in 1995.&lt;ref name="luc"/&gt;

'''''Lactobacillus brevis'''''  is a [[gram-positive]], rod shaped species of [[lactic acid bacteria]] which is heterofermentive, creating CO2 and lactic acid during fermentation. There are approximately 16 different strains.&lt;ref name ="Pavlova, S. I., Kilic, A. O., Kilic, S. S., So, J. S., Nader‐Macias, M. E., Simoes, J. A., &amp; Tao, L. (2002).

Journal of Applied Microbiology, 92(3), 451-459.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in many different environments, such as [[fermentation (food)|fermented foods]], and as normal microbiota. ''L.brevis'' is found in food such as [[sauerkraut]] and [[pickling|pickles]]. It is also one of the most common causes of [[beer]] spoilage. Ingestion has been shown to improve [[human immune system|human immune function]], and it has been [[patent]]ed several times. Normal gut ''microbiota'' ''L.brevis'' is found in human [[intestines]], [[vagina]] and [[feces]].

''L. brevis'' is one of the major ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species found in [[tibicos]] grains, used to make [[kefir]], and has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the [[polysaccharide]] ([[dextran]]) that forms the grains.&lt;ref name="issn1573-0972"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF01741847| title = The microbial flora of sugary kefir grain (the gingerbeer plant): biosynthesis of the grain from ''Lactobacillus hilgardii'' producing a polysaccharide gel| year = 1989| last1 = Pidoux | first1 = M.| journal = MIRCEN Journal of Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| volume = 5 |issue=2| pages = 223–238 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5n5754r5l203h5u/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major metabolites of ''L. brevis'' include [[lactic acid]] and [[ethanol]]. Strains of ''L. brevis'' and ''L. hilgardii'' have been found to produce the [[biogenic amine]]s [[tyramine]] and [[phenethylamine|phenylethylamine]].

==History==
E.B.Fred, W.H. Peterson, and J.A. Anderson initially discovered the entire Lactobacillus species in 1921 and the species was categorized based on the ability to metabolize certain carbon and sugars. This early study showed that this can produce acetic acid, carbon dioxide and large amounts of mannitol. Mannitol which is another carbon source that can be used to produce lactic acid.&lt;ref name="FRED, E.B."&gt;FRED, E.B., PETERSON,W.H., AND ANDERSON,J. A., J.Biol. Chem., 48, 385 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
''L. brevis'' has been shown to [[Active transport|actively transport]] [[glucose]] and [[galactose]]. When [[fructose]] was used as a carbon source there was only some growth and ''L. brevis'' was able to partially metabolize the [[fructose]] to [[mannitol]]. Normal growth follows the [[lactic acid]] pathway that is commonly used by most lactic acid bacterium. There are some strains that poorly metabolize glucose, whereas other strain are able to easily metabolize the sugar. As stated, this is considered a lactic acid pathway.[[File:Lactic acid fermentation.png|thumb|Lactic acid fermentation]]By using the fermentation pathway the end result is lactic acid.&lt;ref name="Annuk, H."&gt;Annuk, H., Shchepetova, J., Kullisaar, T., Songisepp, E., Zilmer, M., &amp; Mikelsaar, M. (2003). Characterization of intestinal lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates. Journal of Applied Microbiology, 94(3), 403-412.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that under high temperature conditions, 50 degrees Celsius and in acidic environments the survival of this bacteria is longer than most bacteria under acidic conditions, the bacteria can live about 45 minutes.&lt;ref name="Saarela, M."&gt;Saarela, M., Rantala, M., Hallamaa, K., Nohynek, L., Virkajärvi, I., &amp; Mättö, J. (2004). Stationary‐phase acid and heat treatments for improvement of the viability of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Journal of applied Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antibiotic resistance]] is acquired through [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], a method of bacterial reproduction. Conjugation permits a sharing of DNA allowing the bacterium to learn about various antibiotics through exposure and this information is passed down through replication between bacteria. 
[[File:Conjugation.svg|thumb|Conjugation]]

''L. brevis'' produces more organic acids, specifically [[acetic acid]] and [[ethanol]]. This means that this bacterium produces an increased acidic environment and alcohol. Growth conditions all depend on the location of the bacterium within the intestines. It does seem that they are unable to significantly replicate in [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] environments.&lt;ref name="Annuk, H."/&gt;

== Metabolic pathway ==
Metabolic pathways are defined to mean the chemical process that occurs within an organism. ''L. brevis'' uses the [[glycolysis]] process to [[metabolize]] carbon sources by [[active transport]], which moves material against the concentration gradient, normally this occurs is a movement from a high to low concentration. This pathway is used in [[probiotics]] and food preservation. 
[[File:Glycolysis overview.svg|thumb|glycolysis, a schematic overview.]]

== Food Preservations ==
''L. brevis'' is found in food such as [[sauerkraut]] and [[pickling|pickles]]. It is also one of the most common causes of [[beer]] spoilage. The [[Humulus lupulus|hop]], which is an antimicrobial bitter flavoring agent in beer, fails to suppress some strains of L. brevis because they produce a transporter that pumps the active agents of hops out of the bacterial cell.&lt;ref name="Sami et al"&gt;Sami, M., Yamashita, H., Hirono, T., Kadokura, H., Kitamoto, K., Yoda, K., &amp; Yamasaki, M. (1997). Hop-resistant Lactobacillus brevis contains a novel plasmid harboring a multidrug resistance-like gene. Journal of fermentation and bioengineering, 84(1), 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teuber &amp; Schmalreck "&gt;Schmalreck, A. F., Teuber, M., Reininger, W., &amp; Hartl, A. (1975). Structural features determining the antibiotic potencies of natural and synthetic hop bitter resins, their precursors and derivatives. Canadian journal of microbiology, 21(2), 205-212.&lt;/ref&gt; ''L. brevis'' is one of the major ''Lactobacillus'' species found in [[tibicos]] grains (aka water kefir grains), and has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the [[polysaccharide]] ([[dextran]]) that forms the grains. Major metabolites of ''L. brevis'' include [[lactic acid]] and [[ethanol]]. Strains of ''L. brevis'' and ''L. hilgardii'' have been found to produce the [[biogenic amine]]s [[tyramine]], which is found by the fermentation metabolic pathway  and is commonly found in spoiled or fermented foods and  [[phenethylamine|phenylethylamine]], which is found in chocolates but can also produce a fishy odor in other foods.

== Microbial Physiology ==
As a bacterium there are some physical attributes that are common for all bacteria. [[Gram-positive bacteria]] consists of an external plasma membrane, followed by periplasmic space and finally a [[Peptidoglycan|peptidoglycan layer]], which faces the interior of the bacteria. The external plasma membrane is very important for bacteria because this is how cells recognize the possible pathogenesis of the bacteria. Peptidoglycan is also called murein and is made up of a series of sugars.  Within gram-positive bacteria the peptidoglycan layer is much thicker than gram-negative bacteria. The actual lattice that comprises peptidoglycan is referred to as the S-layer; this lattice is linked to the peptidoglycan layer.  Unfortunately, the S-layer is normally lost when processing the bacteria under laboratory conditions, which can affect measuring adhesion. When the S-layer is dissolved with high concentration levels of substances that break down hydrogen bonds the S-layers have a survival time of about 20 minutes with each generation. ''L.brevis'' contains approximately two promotors within this area, meaning that there is significant [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the S-layer by high levels of transcribing of the sIpA gene.&lt;ref name="Sára, M., &amp; Sleytr, U. B"&gt;Sára, M., &amp; Sleytr, U. B. (2000). S-layer proteins. Journal of Bacteriology, 182(4), 859-868.&lt;/ref&gt;  SipA is a gene that has been found to aid in the coding for the production of murin (peptidoglycan) within the bacteria. The purpose of transcription is to copy DNA into a mRNA, which is used to create proteins. The promoter is used during transcription to identify the appropriate location to begin transcribing. Within probiotics it is actually the S-layer that attaches to the cellular wall of the gastrointestinal tract &lt;ref name="Hyönen et al., 2002"&gt;Hyönen, U., Westerlund-Wikström, B., Palva, A. and Korhonen, T.K. (2002) Identification by flagellum display of an epithelial cell- and fibronectin-binding function in the SipA surface protein of Lactobacillus brevis. Infect. Immun. 184, 3360–3367.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gram-positive cellwall-schematic.png|thumb|Gram-positive cellwall-schematic]]

==Probiotics==
Ingestion of probiotics has been shown to improve [[human immune system|human immune function]], and ''L. brevis'' has been [[patent]]ed several times. ''L. brevis'' has been shown to survive in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] in humans and can therefore be used as a [[probiotic]]. Currently the bacterium does not have the ability to convert milk to yogurt however, they are appropriate to be used as an alternative to other probiotics in yogurts. Within the [[geriatric]] population use of the bacteria in milk has been shown to increase cellular immunity. Dietary probiotic supplementation enhances natural killer cell activity in the elderly (an investigation of age-related immunological changes). ''L. brevis'' is considered appropriate for probiotic use because there is significant growth at pH’s 4-5, pH 5 is normally the appropriate range for milk and yogurts.

==Biotherapies==
{{medical citations needed|section|date=December 2012}}
There are significant vaginal bacteria that are found within the vagina and ''L. brevis'' is included in this microbiome, which is a collection of various bacteria. The bacteria collaborate on protecting the vagina and vaginal maintenance. Women of childbearing ages have a significant amount of ''L.brevis'' and this is normally found in a healthy vagina.&lt;ref name="Vásquez et.al"&gt;Vásquez, A., Jakobsson, T., Ahrné, S., Forsum, U., &amp; Molin, G. (2002). Vaginal Lactobacillus flora of healthy Swedish women. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 40(8), 2746-2749.&lt;/ref&gt; For some illnesses or disruptions of the vagina this bacteria can be used in aiding to restore the microbiome.  Most of the [[Lactobacillus]] species of bacteria have been found useful in preventing urinary tract infections. The efficiency in which a bacterium can defend the body is:
(1)	 Their symbiosis with potential pathogens.
(2)	Their capability of producing antibacterial materials, such as hydrogen peroxide, to limit pathogen growth.
(3)	Their production of biosurfactants that inhibit pathogen adherence.
(4)	Their ability to prime macrophages, leukocytes, cytokines, and other host defenses.
&lt;ref name="raz"&gt;Raz, R., &amp; Stamm, W. E. (1993). A controlled trial of intravaginal estriol in postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections. New England Journal of Medicine, 329(11), 753-756.&lt;/ref&gt;
During normal childbirth, it appears that newborns after a period of days receive transmission of ''L. brevis'' from the mother. It appears that the transmission occurs through breast feeding or through natural child birth.&lt;ref name="Matsumiya, Y"&gt;Matsumiya, Y., Kato, N., Watanabe, K., &amp; Kato, H. (2002). Molecular epidemiological study of vertical transmission of vaginal Lactobacillus species from mothers to newborn infants in Japanese, by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction. Journal of Infection and chemotherapy, 8(1), 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In infants, this resistance is also helpful with protecting the gut against various bile and acids. ''[[H. pylori|Helicobacter pylori]],'' which is a common gut pathogen in humans, studies have shown that certain strains of ''L.brevis'' are successful at combating this pathogen.

[[Vaginosis]] is the most common form of bacterial infection this is commonly diagnosed as a yeast infection or [[trichomoniasis]], which is a sexually transmitted parasite commonly acquired during intercourse. ''L.brevis'' along with ''Lactobacillus jensenii'' has been shown to produce high levels of hydrogen peroxide which may be able remediate the bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.&lt;ref name="Eschenbach, D. A."&gt;Eschenbach, D. A., Davick, P. R., Williams, B. L., Klebanoff, S. J., Young-Smith, K., Critchlow, C. M., &amp; Holmes, K. K. (1989). Prevalence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus species in normal women and women with bacterial vaginosis. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 27(2), 251-256.&lt;/ref&gt;''L. Brevis'' is a commonly used ingredient in pharmaceutical materials used to treat [[vaginosis]]. An evaluation of clue cells is one method of assessing vaginosis; this assessment is performed by mounting clue cells and vaginal discharge onto a slide then adding sodium chloride followed by a microscopic assessment which involves bacteria identification.&lt;ref name="Eschenbach, D. A."/&gt;

In addition to surviving within the gut of an organism, ''L.Brevis'' can also act to inhibit the [[pathogenic]] effects of certain gut pathogens and can also proliferate in the presence of additional bacteria. Some strains are resistant to certain [[antibiotics]], specifically [[erythromycin]] and [[clindamycin]].&lt;ref name="Delgado,S"&gt;Delgado, S., Flórez, A. B., &amp; Mayo, B. (2005). Antibiotic susceptibility of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract. Current Microbiology, 50(4), 202-207.&lt;/ref&gt; This antibiotic resistance may be helpful in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome when taking prescribed antibiotics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10333">[[Image:NorthSouth-Expressway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]] in [[Malaysia]]. A roadway can be a line source of [[air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]] and need not be a straight line.]]

A '''line source''', as opposed to a [[point source]], [[area source]], or  [[Volume source (pollution)|volume source]],  is a source of air, noise, water contamination or electromagnetic radiation that emanates from a linear (one-dimensional) geometry.  The most prominent linear sources are [[roadway air dispersion modeling|roadway air pollution]], [[aircraft]] air [[emission standard|emissions]], [[roadway noise]], certain types of water pollution sources that emanate over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point, elongated light tubes, certain dose models in [[medical physics]] and electromagnetic [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]. While [[Point source (pollution)|point sources]] of [[pollution]] were studied since the late nineteenth century, linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late 1960s, when environmental regulations for [[highway]]s and [[airport]]s began to emerge. At the same time, computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing needs of the [[computer model]]s required to tackle these one-dimensional sources became more available.

In addition, this era of the 1960s saw the first emergence of [[environmental scientist]]s who spanned the disciplines required to accomplish these studies. For example, meteorologists, chemists, and computer scientists in the air pollution field were required to build complex models to address [[roadway air dispersion modeling]].  Prior to the 1960s, these specialities tended to work within their own disciplines, but with the advent of [[NEPA]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Noise Control Act]] in the United States, and other seminal legislation, the era of multidisciplinary environmental science had begun.

For electromagnetic linear sources, the principal early advances in computer modeling arose in the [[Soviet Union]] and USA when the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]] were fought partially by progress in [[electronic warfare]], including the technologies of active antenna arrays.

==Linear air pollution source==

{{main article|Roadway air dispersion modeling}}

Air pollution levels near major highways and urban [[arterial]]s are in violation of U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards where millions of Americans live or work.  Even the interior of a building does not really protect inhabitants from adverse exterior air quality, since the exterior air is the intake supply, and it is well known that [[indoor air quality]] is typically worse than exterior air.

A roadway travelled by motor vehicles can be idealized by a line source emitting air pollutants.  This mathematical problem was first solved in 1970 by a collaboration of [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan, ''Theoretical basis for atmospheric diffusion from a linear source'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication IR-29, Sunnyvale, Ca.,  May 4, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Venti, ''Atmospheric diffusion models for roadway sources'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication ET-22, Sunnyvale, Ca., October 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original theory assumed steady-state traffic conditions and meteorology on a perfectly straight roadway.  Currently the models have evolved to treat variable meteorology, time-variant traffic operations and complex roadbed geometries. Current technology allows highway designers and city planners to analyze alternative roadway development plans and assess air quality impacts.  The same basic model theory can be applied to airport operations, since the linear source is merely an inclined line.  In the early 1970s these ESL models were refined into [[area source]] models to account for the finite width of the roadway.

==Linear noise source==

{{main article|Roadway noise}}

[[Image:Njturnpike.JPG|thumb|300px|left|The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] was one of the earliest line sources analyzed for [[roadway noise|noise]]]]

Roadway noise is the most important example of a linear noise source, since it comprises about 80 percent of the environmental noise exposure for humans worldwide.  In the 1960s, when computer modeling of this phenomenon was perfected, the first applications of linear source noise modeling became systematic.  After passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and Noise Control Act,&lt;ref&gt;''Public Law No. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234 (1972) Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972'',  codification amended at 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the demand for detailed analysis soared, and decision makers began to look to acoustical scientists for answers regarding the planning of new roadways and the design of [[noise mitigation]].  The intensity of roadway noise is governed by the following variables: [[traffic]] operations (speed, [[truck]] mix, age of [[vehicle]] fleet), roadway surface type, tire types, roadway geometrics, terrain, micrometeorology and the  geometry of area structures.

Due to  the complexity of the variables, a line source acoustic model must be a computer model that can analyze sound levels in the vicinity of roadways.  The first meaningful models arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Two of the leading research teams were [[BBN Technologies|BBN]] in [[Boston]] and [[ESL Inc.]] of Sunnyvale, California.  Both of these groups developed complex [[mathematical model]]s to allow the study of alternate roadway designs, traffic operations and [[noise mitigation]] strategies in an arbitrary setting.&lt;ref&gt;John Shadely, ''Acoustical analysis of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick'', Bolt Beranek and Newman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Later model alterations have come into widespread use among state [[Department of Transportation|Departments of Transportation]] and city planners, but the accuracy of early models has had little change in 40 years.

Generally line source acoustic models trace sound ray bundles and calculate spreading loss along with ray bundle divergence (or convergence} from refractive phenomena. [[Diffraction]] is usually addressed by establishing [[secondary emitters]] at any points of [[topographic]] or [[anthropomorphic]] “sharpness” (such as [[noise barrier]]s or building surfaces. [[Meteorology]] can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual [[wind rose]] and [[wind speed]] statistics (along with [[thermocline]] data).

==Water pollution line source==

[[Image:Canyon midday.jpg|thumb|right|230px| [[Colorado River]], receiving effectively a linear source of silt from the sides of the [[Grand Canyon]].]]

Less common are line source applications in the field of water pollutant dispersal.  This phenomenon generally arises when [[surface runoff]] scours [[soil contaminants]] from upper soil layers and transports these pollutants to a linear receiving water, such as a river.  The underlying land management practices which lead to such sources of water pollution are [[logging]], [[pesticide]] application, [[construction]] grading, [[slash-and-burn]] activity and urban [[stormwater]] runoff.

Again computer models are needed to address the complexity of such an extended linear discharge into a dynamic medium such as flowing water.  The resulting surface runoff water carrying pollutants may be considered a line source discharging into a river or stream.  The chemical composition of this surface runoff may be characterized by a surface runoff model such as the USGS runoff precipitation algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eco.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/prms.html United States Geological Survey runoff precipitation algorithm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610235807/http://eco.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/prms.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the instream transport may be analyzed by a dynamic river pollutant model such as [[DSSAM]].

==Light emission line source==

[[Image:FluorescentT8razorback.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Common T8 [[fluorescent]] [[lighting]] tubes used in office environments]]

In the study of illumination, a variety of sources are linear in nature, most commonly the [[fluorescent tube]], During the process of interior lighting design it is important to calculate the light intensity at work stations or other user areas, not only to ensure sufficient light is present, but more importantly to avoid [[over-illumination]] and its attendant [[energy conservation|energy wastage]] as well as adverse health effects.  Thus the scientists involved in light transmission calculations employ computer models that recognize linear sources when fluorescent fixtures are used.  In a typical setting there may be hundreds of finite length light sources that comprise the light output in an office environment. A related concept are the [[ultraviolet]] tubes used in [[phototherapy]], where output radiation from the tube can be accurately modeled by treating the tube as a line source.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Robert Grimes]], Chris Robbins, Neil John O'Hare. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21089759 ''Dose Modeling in Ultraviolet phototherapy'', Medical Physics,  '''37(10)''' October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; On a larger scale, an illuminated [[roadway]] may act as a line source of [[light pollution]].

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The title page of ''Systema Naturae'', Leiden (1735)]]

'''Linnaean taxonomy''' can mean either of two related concepts: 
# the particular form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] (taxonomy) set up by [[Carl Linnaeus]], as set forth in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735) and subsequent works. In the taxonomy of Linnaeus there are three kingdoms, divided into ''classes'', and they, in turn, into ''orders'', ''genera'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''species'' (singular: ''species''), with an additional rank lower than species.
# a term for rank-based classification of organisms, in general. That is, taxonomy in the traditional sense of the word: rank-based [[scientific classification]]. This term is especially used as opposed to [[cladistics|cladistic]] systematics, which groups organisms into [[clade]]s. It is attributed to Linnaeus, although he neither invented the concept of ranked classification (it goes back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) nor gave it its present form. In fact, it does not have an exact present form, as "Linnaean taxonomy" as such does not really exist: it is a collective (abstracting) term for what actually are several separate fields, which use similar approaches.

'''Linnaean name''' also has two meanings: depending on the context, it may either refer to a formal name given by Linnaeus (personally), such as [[Giraffa camelopardalis|''Giraffa camelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758]], or a formal name in the accepted nomenclature (as opposed to a modernistic [[clade]] name).

== The taxonomy of Linnaeus ==
In his ''Imperium Naturae'', Linnaeus established three kingdoms, namely ''Regnum Animale'', ''Regnum Vegetabile'' and ''Regnum Lapideum''. This approach, the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, survives today in the popular mind, notably in the form of the parlour game question: "Is it [[animal, vegetable or mineral]]?". The work of Linnaeus had a huge impact on science; it was indispensable as a foundation for [[biological nomenclature]], now regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. Two of his works, the first edition of the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753) for plants and the tenth edition of the ''Systema Naturae'' (1758), are accepted as part of the starting points of nomenclature; his binomials (names for species) and generic names take priority over those of others. However, the impact he had on science was not because of the value of his taxonomy.

=== Classification for plants ===
His classes and orders of plants, according to his ''Systema Sexuale'', were never intended to represent natural groups (as opposed to his [[ordo naturalis|''ordines naturales'']] in his ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'') but only for use in identification. They were used for that purpose well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Comstock, J.L.|year=1837 |title= An introduction to the study of botany: including a treatise on vegetable physiology, and descriptions of the most common plants in the middle and northern states |publisher=Robinson, Pratt &amp; Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHnvAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each class were several orders.

=== Classification for animals ===
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|400px|The 1735 classification of animals]]

Only in the Animal Kingdom is the higher taxonomy of Linnaeus still more or less recognizable and some of these names are still in use, but usually not quite for the same groups. He divided the Animal Kingdom into six classes, in the tenth edition, of 1758, these were:
* Classis 1. [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]
* Classis 2. [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]
* Classis 3. [[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]
* Classis 4. [[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]
* Classis 5. [[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]
* Classis 6. [[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]

=== Classification for minerals ===
His taxonomy of [[mineral]]s has long since dropped from use. In the tenth edition, 1758, of the ''Systema Naturae'', the Linnaean classes were:

* Classis 1. Petræ
* Classis 2. Mineræ
* Classis 3. Fossilia
* Classis 4. Vitamentra

== Rank-based scientific classification ==
{{Main|Taxonomy (biology)}}

This rank-based method of classifying living organisms was originally popularized by (and much later named for) Linnaeus, although it has changed considerably since his time. The greatest innovation of Linnaeus, and still the most important aspect of this system, is the general use of [[binomial nomenclature]], the combination of a [[genus]] name and a second term, which together uniquely identify each [[species]] of organism within a kingdom. For example, the [[human]] species is uniquely identified within the animal kingdom by the name ''Homo sapiens''. No other species of animal can have this same [[binomen]] (the technical term for a binomial in the case of animals). Prior to Linnaean taxonomy, animals were classified according to their mode of movement.

Linnaeus's use of binomial nomenclature was anticipated by the theory of definition used in [[Scholasticism]]. Scholastic logicians and philosophers of nature defined the species man, for example, as ''Animal rationalis'', where ''animal'' was considered a genus and ''rationalis'' (Latin for "rational") the characteristic distinguishing man from all other animals. Treating ''animal'' as the immediate genus of the species man, horse, etc. is of little practical use to the biological taxonomist, however. Accordingly, Linnaeus's classification treats ''animal'' as a class including many genera (subordinated to the animal "kingdom" via intermediary classes such as "orders"), and treats ''homo'' as the genus of a species ''Homo sapiens'', with ''sapiens'' (Latin for "knowing" or "understanding") playing a differentiating role analogous to that played, in the Scholastic system, by ''rationalis'' (the word ''homo'', Latin for "human being", was used by the Scholastics to denote a species, not a genus).

A strength of Linnaean taxonomy is that it can be used to organize the different kinds of living [[organism]]s, simply and practically. Every species can be given a unique (and, one hopes, stable) name, as compared with common names that are often neither unique nor consistent from place to place and language to language. This uniqueness and stability are, of course, a result of the acceptance by working [[Systematics|systematists]] (biologists specializing in taxonomy), not merely of the binomial names themselves, but of the rules governing the use of these names, which are laid down in formal [[nomenclature code]]s.

Species can be placed in a [[taxonomic rank|ranked]] [[hierarchy]], starting with either ''[[Domain (biology)|domains]]'' or ''kingdoms''. Domains are divided into [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms are divided into ''[[phylum|phyla]]'' (singular: ''phylum'') &amp;mdash; for [[animal]]s; the term ''division'', used for [[plant]]s and [[fungi]], is equivalent to the rank of phylum (and the current [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] allows the use of either term). Phyla (or divisions) are divided into ''[[Class (biology)|classes]]'', and they, in turn, into ''[[Order (biology)|orders]]'', ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'', ''[[genus|genera]]'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''[[species]]'' (singular: ''species''). There are ranks below species: in zoology, ''subspecies'' (but see ''[[form (zoology)|form]]'' or ''[[morph (zoology)|morph]]''); in botany, ''variety'' (varietas) and ''form'' (forma), etc.

Groups of organisms at any of these ranks are called ''taxa'' (singular: ''[[taxon]]'') or ''taxonomic groups''.

The Linnaean system has proven robust and it remains the only extant working classification system at present that enjoys universal scientific acceptance. However, although the number of ranks is unlimited, in practice any classification becomes more cumbersome the more ranks are added. Among the later subdivisions that have arisen are such entities as phyla, families, and tribes, as well as any number of ranks with prefixes (superfamilies, subfamilies, etc.). The use of newer taxonomic tools such as [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has led to a different way of looking at evolution (expressed in many nested [[clade]]s) and this sometimes leads to a desire for more ranks. An example of such complexity is the [[Mammal classification#McKenna.2FBell classification|scheme for mammals]] proposed by McKenna and Bell.

=== Alternatives ===
Over time, the understanding of the relationships between living things has changed. Linnaeus could only base his scheme on the structural similarities of the different organisms. The greatest change was the widespread acceptance of [[evolution]] as the mechanism of biological diversity and species formation, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. It then became generally understood that classifications ought to reflect the [[phylogeny]] of organisms, their descent by evolution. This led to [[evolutionary taxonomy]], where the various [[extant taxon|extant]] and [[extinction|extinct]] are linked together to construct a phylogeny. This is largely what is meant by the term 'Linnaean taxonomy' when used in a modern context.

In [[cladistics]], originating in the work of [[Willi Hennig]], 1950 onwards, each taxon is grouped so as to include the common ancestor of the group's members (and thus to avoid [[polyphyly]]). Such taxa may be either [[monophyly|monophyletic]] (including all descendants) such as genus ''[[Homo]]'', or [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] (excluding some descendants), such as genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''.

Originally, Linnaeus established three kingdoms in his scheme, namely for [[Plant]]s, [[Animal]]s and an additional group for [[minerals]], which has long since been abandoned.  Since then, various life forms have been moved into three new kingdoms: [[Monera]], for [[prokaryote]]s (i.e., bacteria); [[Protist]]a, for protozoans and most algae; and [[fungus|Fungi]].  This five kingdom scheme is still far from the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] ideal and has largely been supplanted in modern taxonomic work by a division into three domains: [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], which contain the prokaryotes, and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], comprising the remaining forms. These arrangements should not be seen as definitive. They are based on the [[genome]]s of the organisms; as knowledge on this increases, classifications will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Embley, T. A.  |author2=Martin, W. |lastauthoramp=yes|date=2006 |title=Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges. |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=623–630 |doi=10.1038/nature04546 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/eukaryotic-evolution-changes-and-challenges-13997647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing presumptive evolutionary relationships, especially given the wide acceptance of [[cladistic]] methodology and numerous [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular phylogenies]] that have challenged long-accepted classifications, within the framework of Linnaean taxonomy, is sometimes seen as problematic. Therefore, some systematists have proposed a [[PhyloCode]] to replace it.

[[File:Linux Distribution Timeline.svg|thumb|upright|Timeline of the development of various Linux distributions]]

This page provides general information about notable [[Linux distribution]]s in the form of a categorized list. Distributions are organized into sections by the major distribution they are based on, or the [[package management system]] they are based around.

==RPM-based==
[[File:RedHatFamilyTree1210.svg|thumb|upright|Red Hat family tree]]

[[Red Hat Linux]] and [[SUSE Linux]] were the original major distributions that used the [[.rpm]] file format, which is today used in several package management systems. Both of these were later divided into commercial and community-supported distributions. Red Hat Linux was divided into a community-supported but [[Red Hat]]-sponsored distribution named [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], and a commercially supported distribution called [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], whereas SUSE was divided into [[openSUSE]] and [[SUSE Linux Enterprise]]

|-
| [[Mandrake Linux]]
|The first release was based on Red Hat Linux (version 5.1) and [[KDE]] 1 in July 1998. It had since moved away from Red Hat's distribution and became a completely separate distribution. The name was changed to Mandriva, which included a number of original tools, mostly to ease system configuration. Mandriva Linux was the brainchild of [[Gaël Duval]], who wanted to focus on ease of use for new users.

'''MIRIAM''' (Minimum Information Required In The Annotation of Models&lt;ref&gt;The original article used the verb "requested", but this has evolved through community use into "required", and is in line with other Minimum Information (MI) standards available through the MIBBI portal&lt;/ref&gt;) is a community-level effort to standardize  the annotation and curation processes of quantitative models of biological systems.&lt;ref name="pmid16333295"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt1156 |title=Minimum information requested in the annotation of biochemical models (MIRIAM) |year=2005 |last1=Novère |first1=Nicolas Le |last2=Finney |first2=Andrew |last3=Hucka |first3=Michael |last4=Bhalla |first4=Upinder S |last5=Campagne |first5=Fabien |last6=Collado-Vides |first6=Julio |last7=Crampin |first7=Edmund J |last8=Halstead |first8=Matt |last9=Klipp |first9=Edda |last10=Mendes |first10=Pedro |last11=Nielsen |first11=Poul |last12=Sauro |first12=Herbert |last13=Shapiro |first13=Bruce |last14=Snoep |first14=Jacky L |last15=Spence |first15=Hugh D |last16=Wanner |first16=Barry L |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1509–15 |pmid=16333295|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a set of guidelines suitable for use with any structured format, allowing different groups to collaborate and share resulting models. Adherence to these guidelines also facilitates the sharing of software and service infrastructures built upon modeling activities.

The idea of "a set of good practices" including "some obligatory metadata" was first proposed by Nicolas Le Novère in October 2004 as part of a discussion to develop a common database of models in systems biology (which led to the creation of [[BioModels Database]]). These initial ideas were further refined at a meeting in Heidelberg, during [[International Conference on Systems Biology|ICSB]] 2004, with representatives from many other interested groups.

'''MIRIAM''' is a registered project of the MIBBI (minimum information for biological and biomedical investigations).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mibbi.org/ Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations{{psc|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MIRIAM Guidelines==

The '''MIRIAM Guidelines''' are composed of three parts, ''reference correspondence'', ''attribution annotation'', and ''external resource annotation'', each of which deals with a different aspect of information that should be included within a model.

===Reference correspondence===

'Reference correspondence' deals with the basic reference information needed to make use of the model, detailing on a gross level the format of the model file, and its instantiability for simulation purposes.

* The model file must be encoded in a public, standardized, machine-readable format ([[SBML]], [[CellML]], [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]], ...).
* The model file must be valid with respect to its encoding schema.
* The model must be associated with a reference description or publication detailing its origin, even if it is a composite.
* The encoded model structure must reflect the (biological) process(es) detailed in the reference description.
* The model must be instantiable; necessary quantitative parameters, such as initial conditions, should be provided if they are needed for a simulation.
* When instantiated, the model must be capable of reproducing representative results as given in the reference description, within an epsilon (algorithms, round-up errors).

===Attribution annotation===

'Attribution annotation' deals with the attribution information that must be embedded within the model file.

* The model must have a name.
* The model must include a citation of the reference description identifying the authors of the model.
* The model must include the name and contact details of the model creators.
* The date and time of model creation and last modification should be specified. A model history is useful but not required.
* The model should be linked to a precise statement about its terms of use and distribution, regardless of whether it is 'free to use' or not.

===External resource annotation===

'External resource annotation' defines the manner in which annotations should be constructed. Those annotations contain references to entities in databases, classifications, ontologies, etc. One of the purposes of annotation is to allow unambiguous identification of the various model components.

* The annotation must unambiguously relate a piece of knowledge to a model constituent.
* The referenced information should be described using a triplet &lt;code&gt;{data collection, collection-specific identifier, optional qualifier}&lt;/code&gt;:
** The annotation should be expressed as a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI).
**  The collection-specific identifier should be analysed within the framework of the data collection.
** Qualifiers (optional) should be used to refine the link between the model components and the referenced information, for example "has_a", "is_version_of" and "is_homolog_to".

More information about the existing qualifiers is available from BioModels.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biomodels.net/qualifiers/ |title=website |publisher=Biomodels.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, annotation is mainly a manual work, so to ensure their longevity the usage of perennial URIs is necessary. It was recognised that the generation of valid and unique URIs for annotation required the creation of a catalogue of shared namespaces for use by the community. This function is provided by the [[MIRIAM Registry]]. The Registry also provides a variety of supporting auxiliary features to enable automated procedures based upon these URIs. The ability to generate resolvable identifiers is provided through the use of the resolving layer, [[Identifiers.org]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21081">'''Motor imagery''' is a mental process by which an individual rehearses or simulates a given action. It is widely used in sport training as '''mental practice of action''', [[neurological rehabilitation]], and has also been employed as a research paradigm in [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]] to investigate the content and the structure of covert processes (i.e., unconscious) that precede the execution of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Ingvar, D.

Suhr|title=The Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation|location=New York|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781841698878}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some medical, musical, and athletic contexts, when paired with physical rehearsal, mental rehearsal can be as effective as pure physical rehearsal (practice) of an action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappes|first=Heather Barry|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|date=2016-07-01|title=Mental Simulation as Substitute for Experience|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=7|pages=405–420|doi=10.1111/spc3.12257|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Motor imagery can be defined as a dynamic state during which an individual mentally simulates a given action. This type of phenomenal experience implies that the subject feels themselves performing the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Decety, J.|year=1996|title=Do imagined and executed actions share the same neural substrate? |journal=Cognitive Brain Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=87–93|pmid=8713549|doi=10.1016/0926-6410(95)00033-X|citeseerx=10.1.1.211.8747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the so-called internal imagery (or first person perspective) of [[sport psychology|sport psychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mahoney, M..J.|author2= Avener, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1987|title=Psychology of the elite athlete|journal=Cognitive Therapy Research|volume=1|issue=2|pages= 135–141|doi=10.1007/BF01173634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental practice of action==
'''Mental practice''' refers to use of visuo-motor imagery with the purpose of improving motor behavior. Visuo-motor imagery requires the use of one's [[imagination]] to simulate an action, without physical movement. It has come to the fore due to the relevance of imagery in enhancing sports and surgical performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sports===
Mental practice, when combined with physical practice, can be beneficial to beginners learning a sport, but even more helpful to professionals looking to enhance their skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Cornelia|last2=Land|first2=William M.|last3=Popp|first3=Carmen|last4=Schack|first4=Thomas|date=2014-04-17|title=Mental Representation and Mental Practice: Experimental Investigation on the Functional Links between Motor Memory and Motor Imagery|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=4|pages=e95175|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0095175|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3990621|pmid=24743576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Physical practice generates the physical feedback necessary to improve, while mental practice creates a cognitive process physical practice cannot easily replicate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cocks, Margaret|displayauthors=etal|title=What surgeons can learn from athletes: mental practice in sports and surgery|journal=Journal of Surgical Education|volume=71|issue=2|pages=262–9|year=2014|doi= 10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.07.002|pmid=24602719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
When surgeons and other medical practitioners mentally rehearse procedures along with their physical practice, it produces the same results as physical rehearsal, but costs much less. But unlike its use in sports, to improve a skill, mental practice is used in medicine as a form of stress reduction before operations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Music ===
Mental practice is a technique used in music as well. Professional musicians may use mental practice when they are away from their instrument or unable to physically practice due to an injury. Studies show that a combination of physical and mental practice can provide improvement in mastering a piece equal to physical practice alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernardi|first=Nicolò Francesco|last2=Schories|first2=Alexander|last3=Jabusch|first3=Hans-Christian|last4=Colombo|first4=Barbara|last5=Altenmüller|first5=Eckart|date=2013|title=Mental Practice in Music Memorization: An Ecological-Empirical Study|url=http://ego.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/pdf/nicolo2.pdf|journal=Music Perception|volume=30|issue=3|pages=275–287|doi=10.1525/mp.2012.30.3.275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascual-Leone|first=Alvaro|last2=Dang|first2=Nguyet|last3=Cohen|first3=Leonardo G.|last4=Brasil-Neto|first4=Joaquim P.|last5=Cammarota|first5=Angel|last6=Hallett|first6=Mark|date=September 1995|title=Modulation of Muscle Response Evoked by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation During the Acquisition of New Fine Motor Skills|url=http://www.chrisdonnellymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Pascual-Leone1995.pdf|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=74|issue=3|pages=1037–1043|doi=10.1152/jn.1995.74.3.1037|pmid=7500130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because mental practice causes neuron growth that mirrors growth caused by physical practice.

===Motor deficits===
Mental practice has been used to rehabilitate motor deficits in a variety of neurological disorders.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jackson, P.L.|author2=Lafleur, M.|author3=Malouin, F.|author4=Richards, C.|author5=Doyon, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=Potential role of mental practice using motor imagery in neurologic rehabilitation|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|volume=82|issue=8|pages=1133–41|pmid=11494195|doi=10.1053/apmr.2001.24286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental practice of action seems to improve balance in individuals with [[multiple sclerosis]] and in elderly women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fansler, C.

J.|author2=Levine, P.|author3=Sisto, S. A.|author4=Johnston, M. V.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=Mental practice combined with physical practice for upper-limb motor deficit in subacute stroke|journal=Physical Therapy|volume=81|issue=8|pages=1455–62|pmid=11509075|doi=10.1093/ptj/81.8.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have also shown improvement in strength, function, and use of both upper and lower extremities in chronic stroke.

==Functional equivalence to motor preparation==
[[Image:Motor imagery3.jpg|thumb|Converging empirical evidence indicates a functional equivalence between action execution and motor imagery.]]
Motor imagery has been studied using the classical methods of [[introspection]] and mental chronometry. These methods have revealed that motor images retain many of the properties, in terms of temporal regularities, programming rules and biomechanical constraints, which are observed in the corresponding real action when it comes to execution. For instance, in an experiment participants were instructed to walk mentally through gates of a given apparent width positioned at different apparent distances. The gates were presented to the participants with a 3-D visual display (a virtual reality helmet) which involved no calibration with external cues and no possibility for the subject to refer to a known environment. Participants were asked to indicate the time they started walking and the time they passed through the gate. Mental walking time was found to increase with increasing gate distance and decreasing gate width. Thus, it took the participant longer to walk mentally through a narrow gate than to walk through a larger gate placed at the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Mentally simulated movements in virtual reality: does Fitt's law hold in motor imagery?|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=72|issue=1–2|pages=127–34|citeseerx=10.1.1.299.9473|pmid=8788865|doi=10.1016/0166-4328(96)00141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|author3=Prablanc, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1989|title=The timing of mentally represented actions|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=34|issue=1–2|pages=35–42|pmid=2765170|doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(89)80088-9|citeseerx=10.1.1.212.3957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led neurophysiologists [[Marc Jeannerod]] and [[Jean Decety]] to propose that there is a similarity in mental states between action simulation and execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=L'imagerie mentale et son substrat neurologique|journal=Revue Neurologique|volume=151|pp=474–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeannerod, M.|year=1994|title=The representing brain: Neural correlates of motor intention and imagery|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=17|issue=2|pp=187–245|url=http://users.abo.fi/jtuomain/EMCL/articles/additional/Jeannerod1994.pdf|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00034026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|year=1996|title=Neural representations for action|journal=Reviews in the Neurosciences|volume=7|issue=4|pages=285–97|pmid=9044503|doi=10.1515/REVNEURO.1996.7.4.285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional equivalence between action and imagination goes beyond motor movements. For instance similar cortical networks mediate music performance and music imagery in pianists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Meister, I.G.|author2=Krings, T.|author3=Foltys, H.|author4=Boroojerdi, B.|author5=Muller, M.|author6=Topper, R.

==Physiology==
[[Image:MI fMRI.jpg|thumb|left|Activation in the motor cortex during motor imagery amounts about 30 % of the level observed during actual performance; Roth et al., 1996.]] A large number of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies have demonstrated that motor imagery is associated with the specific activation of the neural circuits involved in the early stage of motor control (i.e., motor programming). This circuits includes the [[supplementary motor area]], the primary [[motor cortex]], the inferior [[parietal cortex]], the [[basal ganglia]], and the [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Perani, D.|author3=Jeannerod, M.|author4=Bettinardi, V.|author5=Tadary, B.|author6=Woods, R.|displayauthors=etal|year=1994|title=Mapping motor representations with PET|journal=Nature|volume=371|issue=6498|pages=600–2|doi=10.1038/371600a0|pmid=7935791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roth, M.|author2=Decety, J.|displayauthors=etal|year=1996|title=Possible involvement of primary motor cortex in mentally simulated movement: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study|journal=NeuroReport|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1280–4|pmid=8817549|doi=10.1097/00001756-199605170-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such physiological data gives strong support about common neural mechanisms of imagery and motor preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeannerod, M.|year=2001|title=Neural simulation of action: A unifying mechanism for motor cognition|journal=NeuroImage|volume=14|issue=1 Pt 2|pages=S103–9|pmid=11373140|doi= 10.1006/nimg.2001.0832|citeseerx=10.1.1.212.520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of [[cardiac]] and respiratory activity during motor imagery and during actual motor performance revealed a covariation of heart rate and pulmonary ventilation with the degree of imagined effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|author3=Durozard, D.|author4=Baverel, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1993|title=Central activation of autonomic effectors during mental simulation of motor actions in man|journal=Journal of Physiology|volume=461|issue=1|pages=549–63|pmc=1175272|pmid=8102402|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, Y.|author2=Morgan, W.P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=The effect of imagery perspectives on the psychophysiological responses to imagined exercise|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=52|issue=2|pages=167–74|doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(05)80227-X|pmid=1294196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wuyam, B.|author2=Moosavi, S.H.|author3=Decety, J.|author4=Adams, L.|author5=Lansing, R.W.|author6=Guz, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=Imagination of dynamic exercise produced ventilatory responses which were more apparent in competitive sportsmen|journal=Journal of Physiology|volume=482|issue=Pt 3|pages=713–24|pmid=7738860|pmc=1157796|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp020554}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Motor imagery activates motor pathways. Muscular activity often increases with respect to rest, during motor imagery. When this is the case, EMG activity is limited to those muscles that participate in the simulated action and tends to be proportional to the amount of imagined effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wehner, T.|author2=Vogt, S.|author3=Stadler, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Task-specific EMG characteristics during mental training|journal=Psychological Research|volume=46|issue=4|pages=389–401|doi=10.1007/BF00309071|pmid=6522565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Motor imagery is now widely used as a technique to enhance motor [[learning]] and to improve [[neurological rehabilitation]] in patients after [[stroke]]. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lotze, M.|author2=Scheler, G.|displayauthors=etal|year=2003|title=The musician's brain: functional imaging of amateurs and professionals during performance and imagery|journal=NeuroImage|volume=20|issue=3|pages=1817–29|pmid=14642491|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.07.018|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8605838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On motor learning: Motor imagery is an accepted procedure in the preparation of athletes. Such practice usually covers a warming up period, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] and concentration, and then mental simulation of the specific movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Suinn, R.M.|year=1984|chapter=Imagery and sports|editor1=W.F. Straub|editor2=J. M. Williams |title=Cognitive Sport Psychology|location=Lansing, NY|publisher= Sport Science Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In neurological rehabilitation: There is some evidence to suggest that motor imagery provides additional benefits to conventional [[physiotherapy]] or occupational therapy.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; However, a recent systematic review indicates that there is modest evidence supporting the additional benefit of motor imagery compared to only conventional physiotherapy in patients with stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zimmermann-Schlatter, A.|displayauthors=etal|year=2008|title=Efficacy of motor imagery in post-stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation|volume=5|p=8|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-5-8|pmc=2279137|pmid=18341687}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors concluded that motor imagery appears to be an attractive treatment opinion, easy to learn and to apply and the intervention is neither physically exhausting nor harmful. Therefore, motor imagery may generate additional benefit for patients.
* Motor imagery can act as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for the imagined behavior, producing similar effects on cognition and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The repeated simulated consumption of a food, for example, can reduce subsequent actual consumption of that food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Huh|first2=Young Eun|last3=Vosgerau|first3=Joachim|date=2010-12-10|title=Thought for Food: Imagined Consumption Reduces Actual Consumption|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6010/1530|journal=Science|volume=330|issue=6010|pages=1530–1533|doi=10.1126/science.1195701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21148388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation and understanding mental states==
Motor imagery is close to the notion of simulation used in cognitive and [[social neuroscience]] to account for different processes. An individual who is engaging in simulation may replay his own past experience in order to extract from it pleasurable, motivational or strictly informational properties.  Such a view was clearly described by the Swedish physiologist Hesslow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hesslow, G.|year=2002|title=Conscious thought as simulation of behavior and perception|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=6|issue=6|pages=242–247|pmid=12039605|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this author, the simulation hypothesis states that thinking consists of simulated interaction with the environment, and rests on the following three core assumptions: (1) Simulation of actions: we can activate motor structures of the brain in a way that resembles activity during a normal action but does not cause any overt movement; (2) Simulation of perception: imagining perceiving something is essentially the same as actually perceiving it, only the perceptual activity is generated by the brain itself rather than by external stimuli; (3) Anticipation: there exist associative mechanisms that enable both behavioral and perceptual activity to elicit other perceptual activity in the sensory areas of the brain.  Most importantly, a simulated action can elicit perceptual activity that resembles the activity that would have occurred if the action had actually been performed.

Mental simulation may also be a representational tool to understand the self and others. Philosophy of mind and developmental psychology also draw on simulation to explain our capacity to mentalize, i.e., to understand mental states (intentions, desires, feelings, and beliefs) of others (aka [[theory of mind]]).  In this context, the basic idea of simulation is that the attributor attempts to mimic the mental activity of the target by using his own psychological resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldman, A.I.|year=2002|chapter=Simulation theory and mental concepts|editor1=J. Dokic |editor2=J. Proust|lastauthoramp=y|title=Simulation and Knowledge of Action|volume=45|pages=1–19|doi=10.1075/aicr.45.02gol|series=Advances in Consciousness Research|isbn=978 90 272 5169 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand the mental state of another when observing the other acting, the individual imagines herself/himself performing the same action, a covert simulation that does not lead to an overt behavior.  One critical aspect of the simulation theory of mind is the idea that in trying to impute mental states to others, an attributor has to set aside her own current mental states, and substitutes those of the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldman, A.I.|year=2005|chapter=Imitation, mind reading, and simulation|editor1=S. Hurley|editor2= N. Chatert|lastauthoramp=y|title=Perspective on Imitation, from Neuroscience to Social Science, Volume 2|pp=79–93|location=Cambridge|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''mutual shaping''' was developed through [[Science and Technology Studies]] (STS) in an attempt to explain the detailed process of technological design.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping is a combination of [[social determinism]] and [[technological determinism]], suggesting that society and technology are not mutually exclusive to one another and, instead, influence and shape each other.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of TD and SD ==
[[Technological determinism]] (TD), coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]], suggests that technology is the primary catalyst for change in society. Following this theory, the development and implementation of technology is beyond the control of society as it is pervasive in all elements of our lives. Once a technology has been created its influence on society is an inevitable, predetermined path. An example that supports technological determinism is the development of the [[printing press]] that accelerated the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L. (2010). Technological determinism. In S. Priest (Ed.), Encyclopedia of science and technology communication. (pp. 870-873). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959216.n293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, social determinism (SD), popularized by social theorists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Emile Durkheim]], purports that social structure is the driving factor towards change in society.&lt;ref&gt;Determinism. (2001). In World of sociology, Gale. Retrieved from http://esearch.credoreference.com/content/entry/worldsocs/determinism/0&lt;/ref&gt; Following this view, society is the governing force that determines social behaviour, and technology is created and adapted based on society’s wants and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Aurelea. (2008). Social and technological determinism. CultureNet @ CapilanoU. Retrieved from http://culturenet.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/social-and-technological-determinism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both TD and SD are cause-and-effect theories suggesting that technology and society are mutually exclusive. The theory of mutual shaping suggests that technology design is a result of a synthesis of TD and SD. It sees technology and society working together to facilitate change. Society changes as a direct result of the implementation of technology that has been created based on society’s wants and needs. They function collectively to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social networks ==
Mutual shaping is exemplified through the integration of online [[Social networking|social networking platforms]] into daily life. They are a [[communications technology]] designed to complement pre-existing methods of communication, such as the phone or in-person conversations, that have become more convenient and/or affordable than their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = B. | last2 = Quan-Haase | first2 = A. | last3 = Witte | first3 = J. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Does the internet increase, decrease, or supplement social capital?: Social networks, participation, and community commitment | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist| volume =  45| issue = | pages =  436–455 [440] | doi = 10.1177/00027640121957286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TD would argue that these communication technologies have directly influenced our networking capabilities due to their accessibility. Without them we would not be able to conduct business or maintain friendships over long distances. SD would argue that these platforms were created as a result of a need to facilitate communication over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping supports both of these arguments, believing that the two cannot be separated. Social networking platforms display how technology and society are inextricably linked as they work together towards the advancement of one another, exemplifying the theory of mutual shaping.

The '''Oxford Department of International Development''' (ODID), or Queen Elizabeth House (QEH), is a department of the [[University of Oxford]] in England, and a unit of the University’s [[Social Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Social Sciences Division]].  It is the focal point at Oxford for multidisciplinary research and postgraduate teaching on the developing world.&lt;ref name="ODID, About Us"&gt;[http://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/about ODID, About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Head of Department is Professor Christopher Adam. Former Heads of Department include Dr Nandini Gooptu, Professor Valpy FitzGerald, Professor [[Barbara Harriss-White]], Rosemary Thorp and Professor [[Frances Stewart (economist)|Frances Stewart]].

== History ==
QEH was founded as a result of a gift of £100,000 given by Sir [[Ernest Oppenheimer]] to the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Queen%20Elizabeth%20House%20QE.pdf Queen Elizabeth House], [http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/ Oxford University Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; The donation was for the development of colonial studies and the establishment of an associated colonial centre. A further gift of £50,000 was given by the [[Colonial Development and Welfare Fund]] of the [[British government]].

QEH was constituted by Royal Charter in 1954 to provide a residential centre which people concerned with the study of Commonwealth affairs could visit to make contacts and exchange ideas.

In the 1980s there was a drive to reshape QEH as a centre for international studies, rather than purely for study concerning the Commonwealth. In 1986 it was merged with the [[Institute of Commonwealth Studies, Oxford]] and the Oxford University Institute of Agricultural Economics to create the International Development Centre, a department of the University within the Social Studies Faculty.

From 1958 to 2005 QEH was located at 20-21 St Giles. In 2005, the department moved to the former School of Geography building in Mansfield Road and became known as the Oxford Department of International Development.&lt;ref name="QEH History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/content/history|title=History|publisher=qeh.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the Palace authorised the use of the name Queen Elizabeth House for the buildings at 3 Mansfield Road.

== Courses ==

The Department provides postgraduate research training (DPhil and MPhil) and four MSc taught courses to some 200 students. These programmes involve advanced research methods, personal supervision, subject specialisation and fieldwork. International demand for these programmes is high and entrance standards are exacting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/study ODID, Study]&lt;/ref&gt; The Department forms part of the ESRC-funded [[Doctoral Training Centre]] for the Social Sciences at the University of Oxford.

ODID currently offers the following degree courses:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">'''''PolarTREC''''' (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) is a program for K-12 teachers to participate in [[field research]] in the polar regions in order to improve their knowledge of polar science and expand the reach of current scientific research beyond the scientific community. Teachers involved in PolarTREC spend about two to six weeks at their polar sites, collaborating with scientific research teams and connecting with students and the public via online media.&lt;ref name="www.polartrec.com"&gt;[http://www.polartrec.com/about/ www.polartrec.com]&lt;/ref&gt; PolarTREC is funded by the National Science Foundation and managed by the Arctic Research Consortium.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=5058614&amp;page=1#.UZOxrTkW-M1 ABC News ] |work=ABC News: PolarTREC |accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The purpose of PolarTREC is to stimulate polar [[science education]] and awareness.&lt;ref name="www.polartrec.com"/&gt;

==Expeditions==
Notable past PolarTREC expeditions include:

•Carbon Balance in Warming and Drying Tundra (2013), which studied the effects of warming and drying on [[tundra]] carbon balance &lt;ref name="PolarTREC Expeditions: Carbon Balance"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=[http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/carbon-balance-in-warming-and-drying-tundra-2013 PolarTREC Expeditions] |work=PolarTREC Expeditions|accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•Airborne Survey of Polar Ice (2013),  a six-year [[NASA]] mission, which is the largest airborne survey of Earth's polar ice ever conducted &lt;ref name="PolarTREC Expeditions: Airborne Survey"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=[http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/airborne-survey-of-polar-ice-2013] |work=PolarTREC Expeditions|accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•Tectonic History of the Transantartic Mountains (2012), which deciphered the tectonic history of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and the Wilkes Subglacial Basin &lt;ref name="PolarTREC Expeditions: Tectonic History"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=[http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/tectonic-history-of-the-transantarctic-mountains] |work=PolarTREC Expeditions|accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•Greenland Education Tour (2012), part of an initiative to foster enhanced international scientific cooperation between [[Greenland]] and the US &lt;ref name="PolarTREC Expeditions: Greenland Education Tour"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=[http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/greenland-education-tour-2012] |work=PolarTREC Expeditions|accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•In 2011, PolarTREC teacher John Wood lived in a tent at the top of [[Mt. Erebus]], an active [[volcano]] in Antarctica.  The average temperative was -20 F.&lt;ref name="[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HLf9QB_5FA%20 YouTube]"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HLf9QB_5FA YouTube] |work=YouTube PolarTREC Expedition|accessdate= May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher Experience==
Teachers must apply to the program and only the top 100 applications make it to the PolarTREC selection committee. Researcher also must apply and be selected as a PolarTREC research team.  After researchers are selected, a selection of the top 30-40 teacher applications are sent to the various research teams.  Researchers select which of the teachers to interview, after which they invite a teacher to join the team. There are usually 12 research teams—6 in the Arctic and 6 in the Antarctic—so out of the over 200 applicants each year only 12 get chosen.

Once accepted PolarTREC covers the costs of the expedition. The teachers are given special training through [[webinars]] and a week long orientation in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. While on the trip teachers are expected to communicate through the Virtual Home Base and give updates using message boards, photo albums, podcasts, "PolarConnect" events and presentations from the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polartrec.com/teachers/faq&lt;/ref&gt; Using the message boards and journals, teachers can document what the students get excited about and how they learn. This data can be used to shape science curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=5058614&amp;page=1#.UZqSCeDls-O&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers are encouraged to share their experiences with a wider audience by writing articles and speaking at conferences. Teachers also encouraged to develop lessons based on their expedition for the Learning Resources section of the website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polartrec.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4278">'''Relational-cultural theory''', and by extension, '''relational-cultural therapy''' ('''RCT''') stems from the work of [[Jean Baker Miller| Jean Baker Miller, M.D.]]. Often, relational-cultural theory is aligned with the [[feminist]] and or [[multicultural]] movements in psychology. In fact, RCT embraces many [[social justice]] aspects from these movements.

RCT was developed in [[Boston]], Massachusetts in the 1970s through the work of psychiatrist, Jean Baker Miller (Toward a New Psychology of Women), psychologists, Judith V. Jordan, Janet Surrey, and Irene Stiver at the Stone Center at Wellesley College in reaction to psychodynamic theory.  The Stone Center at [[Wellesley College]] and the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute are the hubs of RCT research and training and are perhaps best known for their ''Working Papers'' series, collective works that are continuously considered for review and reconsideration. As RCT was founded in strong feminist principles, and was started at Wellesley College, the movement's traditional focus was on women and their relational experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, J., Kaplan, A., Miller, J.B., Stiver, I., &amp; Surrey, J. (1991). Women's Growth in Connection: Writings from the Stone Center. Harvard, MA: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[mental health professional]]s employ RCT in their practice. A nonexhaustive list of these include: counselors, [[social work]]ers, [[psychologist]]s, and [[psychiatrist]]s. Some current major relational-cultural theorists, writers, and practitioners include: [[Judith V. Jordan]], Ph D, Amy Banks, MD, Maureen Walker, Ph D, Linda Hartling, Ph D, Thelma Duffey, Ph D, and Dana Comstock, Ph D.

The consistent, primary focus of RCT is the primacy of relationships. That is, relationships are both the indicators for, and the healing mechanism in psychotherapy toward, [[mental health]] and wellness.

One of the core tenets of RCT is the Central Relational Paradox (CRP). The CRP assumes that we all have a natural drive toward relationships, and in these relationships we long for acceptance. However, we come to believe that there are things about us that are unacceptable or unlovable. Thus, we choose to hide these things; we keep them out of our relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. B., Jordan, J., Stiver, I., Walker, M., Surrey, J., &amp; Eldrige, N. (2004). Therapist’s Authenticity. In Jordan, J., Walker, M., &amp; Hartling, L. (Eds.), The complexity of connection (pp. 64-89). New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the connections we make with others are not as fulfilling and validating as they otherwise might have been.

A primary goal of RCT is to create and maintain Mutually-Growth-Fostering Relationships, relationships in which both parties feel that they matter. In these healthy relationships, all of the involved parties experience what is known as the Five Good Things. These include: 1) a desire to move into more relationships, because of how a good relational experience feels; 2) a sense of zest, or energy; 3) increased knowledge of oneself and the other person in the relationship; 4) a desire to take action both in the growth-fostering relationship and outside of it; 5) an overall increased sense of worth.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, C. (2006). This Changes Everything: The Relational Revolution in Psychology. New York: Picador.
&lt;/ref&gt;

RCT involves working with clients to identify, and strive in, relationships that present opportunities for her/him to experience Mutually-Growth-Fostering Relationships. In fact, a strong, connected therapeutic relationship should be a model for these kinds of relationships. While there a number of specific challenges presented in the therapeutic relationship, RCT practitioners believe that their relationships with their clients can have a reasonably high degree of mutuality. Clinical experiences of mutuality include: the client's movement toward the awareness that she/he matters to the therapist, the therapist that she/he, too, matters to the client, an integrative awareness both have of what it means to feel like one matters, and the worth involved in offering this to another person through the process of connection.

==Biography==
Emden was born in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]].  In 1907 he became associate professor of physics and meteorology at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. The same year he published the classic work, ''Gaskugeln: Anwendungen der mechanischen Wärmetheorie auf kosmologische und meteorologische Probleme'' (Gas balls: Applications of the mechanical heat theory to cosmological and meteorological problems), which provided a mathematical model as a basis of [[star|stellar structure]]. By 1920 he was a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften]].

Emden served as the editor of ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics|Zeitschrift fur Astrophysik]]'', founded in 1930.  In 1933 he fled from [[Germany]] to escape the rise of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] party, returning to his native Switzerland.  

He was the uncle of the [[German American]] astrophysicist [[Martin Schwarzschild]] by marriage to [[Karl Schwarzschild]]'s sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Robert Emden died in [[Zürich]] in 1940.

The crater [[Emden (crater)|Emden]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.  The [[Lane-Emden equation]] and [[Emden–Chandrasekhar equation]] are named for him and [[Jonathan Homer Lane]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8740">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[control theory]], a '''Sylvester equation'''  is a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[equation]] of the form:&lt;ref&gt;This equation is also commonly written in the equivalent form of ''AX''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''XB''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A X + X B = C.&lt;/math&gt;
Then given matrices ''A'',''B'', and ''C'', the problem is to find the possible matrices ''X'' that obey this equation. All matrices are assumed to have coefficients in the [[complex number]]s. For the equation to make sense, the matrices must have appropriate sizes, for example they could all be square matrices of the same size. But more generally, ''A'' and ''B'' must be square matrices of sizes ''n'' and ''m'' respectively, and then ''X'' and ''C'' both have ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns.

A Sylvester equation has a unique solution for ''X'' exactly when there are no common eigenvalues of ''A'' and&amp;nbsp;−''B''.
More generally, the equation ''AX''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''XB''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C'' has been considered as an equation of [[bounded operator]]s on a (possibly infinite-dimensional) [[Banach space]]. In this case, the condition for the uniqueness of a solution ''X'' is almost the same: There exists a unique solution ''X'' exactly when the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectra]] of ''A'' and −''B'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia and Rosenthal, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence and uniqueness of the solutions==
Using the [[Kronecker product]] notation and the [[Vectorization (mathematics)|vectorization operator]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vec}&lt;/math&gt;, we can rewrite Sylvester's equation in the form
:&lt;math&gt; (I_m \otimes A +  B^T \otimes I_n) \operatorname{vec}X = \operatorname{vec}C,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is of dimension &lt;math&gt;n\! \times\! n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is of dimension &lt;math&gt;m\!\times\!m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;n\!\times\!m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k \times k&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]]. In this form, the equation can be seen as a [[linear system]] of dimension &lt;math&gt;mn \times mn&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;However, rewriting the equation in this form is not advised for the numerical solution since this version is costly to solve and can be [[ill-conditioned]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proposition.''' 
''Given complex &lt;math&gt; n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, Sylvester's equation has a unique solution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-B&lt;/math&gt; have no common eigenvalues.''

'''Proof.''' Consider the linear transformation &lt;math&gt;S:M_n\rightarrow M_n&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;X\mapsto AX+XB&lt;/math&gt;.

(i) Suppose that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-B&lt;/math&gt; have no common eigenvalues. Then their characteristic polynomials &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; have highest common factor &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence there exist complex polynomials &lt;math&gt;p(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q(z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p(z)f(z)+q(z)g(z)=1&lt;/math&gt;. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, &lt;math&gt;f(A)=0=g(-B)&lt;/math&gt;; hence &lt;math&gt;g(A)q(A)=I&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be any solution of &lt;math&gt;S(X)=0&lt;/math&gt;; so &lt;math&gt; AX=-XB&lt;/math&gt; and repeating this one sees that &lt;math&gt;X=q(A)g(A)X=q(A)Xg(-B)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence by the rank plus nullity theorem &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, so for all &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique solution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

(ii) Conversely, suppose that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a common eigenvalue of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-B&lt;/math&gt;. Note that 
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is also an eigenvalue of the transpose &lt;math&gt;A^T&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exist non-zero vectors &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A^Tw=sw&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Bv=-sv&lt;/math&gt;. Choose &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Cv=\overline {w}&lt;/math&gt;, the vector whose entries are the complex conjugates of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;AX+XB=C&lt;/math&gt; has no solution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as is clear from the complex bilinear pairing &lt;math&gt; \langle(AX+XB)v,w\rangle=\langle Cv,w\rangle=\langle\overline {w},w\rangle&lt;/math&gt;; the right-hand side is positive whereas the left is zero.

==Roth's removal rule==

Given two square complex matrices ''A'' and ''B'', of size ''n'' and ''m'', and a matrix ''C'' of size ''n'' by ''m'', then one can ask when the following two square matrices of size ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'' are [[matrix similarity|similar]] to each other: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} A &amp; C \\ 0 &amp; B \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; 0 \\0&amp;B \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. The answer is that these two matrices are similar exactly when there exists a matrix ''X'' such that ''AX''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''XB''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''. In other words, ''X'' is a solution to a Sylvester equation. This is known as '''Roth's removal rule'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerrish|first1=F|last2=Ward|first2=A.G.B|title=Sylvester's matrix equation and Roth's removal rule|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|date=Nov 1998|volume=82|issue=495|pages=423–430|doi=10.2307/3619888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One easily checks one direction: If ''AX''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''XB''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C'' then 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}I_n &amp; X \\ 0 &amp; I_m \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} A&amp;C\\0&amp;B \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} I_n &amp; -X \\ 0&amp; I_m \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A&amp;0\\0&amp;B \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Roth's removal rule does not generalize to infinite-dimensional bounded operators on a Banach space.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia and Rosenthal, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerical solutions==
A classical algorithm for the numerical solution of the Sylvester equation is the [[Bartels–Stewart algorithm]], which consists of transforming &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; into [[Schur decomposition|Schur form]] by a [[QR algorithm]], and then solving the resulting triangular system via [[Triangular matrix|back-substitution]]. This algorithm, whose computational cost is [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n^3)&lt;/math&gt;]] arithmetical operations,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} is used, among others, by [[LAPACK]] and the &lt;code&gt;lyap&lt;/code&gt; function in [[GNU Octave]].&lt;ref&gt;https://octave.sourceforge.io/control/function/lyap.html&lt;/ref&gt; See also the &lt;code&gt;sylvester&lt;/code&gt; function in that language.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Functions-of-a-Matrix.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The &lt;code&gt;syl&lt;/code&gt; command is deprecated since GNU Octave Version 4.0&lt;/ref&gt; In some specific image processing application, the derived Sylvester equation has a closed form solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Q. |last=Wei |first2=N.  |last2=Dobigeon |first3=J.-Y.  |last3=Tourneret |title=Fast Fusion of Multi-Band Images Based on Solving a Sylvester Equation|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Image Processing|IEEE]] |volume=24 |year=2015 |issue=11 |pages=4109–4121 |doi=10.1109/TIP.2015.2458572|arxiv=1502.03121|bibcode=2015ITIP...24.4109W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Through Distant Worlds and Times''''' or '''''Through Distant Worlds and Times: Letters from a Wayfarer in the Universe''''' is a romantic scientific story written by [[Milutin Milanković]], the [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]], [[geophysics|geophysicist]] and [[climatologist]], in the form of letters to an anonymous young woman.

==Overview==
Between 1925 and 1928, Milanković tried his hand at popular writing with a series of magazine articles on astronomy, astronomers, and climatology. Each month for three years he wrote a letter to an imaginary friend about visiting something in the universe or journeying to the past to visit an astronomer. The letters contained a large amount of autobiographical detail. They were published in a Serbian magazine and later collected in a book, ''Through Distant Worlds and Times'', published in Serbian and later in German.&lt;ref name=IceAges&gt;{{cite book|title=Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery|date=1986|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=9780674440753|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIxRp9fRDGwC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Through+Distant+Worlds+and+Times+-+Letters+of+an+Astronomer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NQiuUavHDoKKlAXokYDIAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Through%20Distant%20Worlds%20and%20Times%20-%20Letters%20of%20an%20Astronomer&amp;f=false|author=John Imbrie|author2=Katherine Palmer Imbrie |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the best selling book of his career.

==Synopsis==
The book consists of 37 letters to the unnamed woman. They serve as vehicles for discussion of the history of astronomy, climatology and science. In writing the letters, Milanković remembers his early life, from birth in [[Dalj]], through his education, to successes and failures at a professional level. The work takes inspiration from his travels through Germany, [[Hungary]], [[Istanbul]] and Europe, and his return to his birthplace, which seems to him desolate and dilapidated in contrast.

The writer uses a personal approach to science, traveling with a friend through time and space. In the appropriate attire, they roam the ancient world. Unseen by the natives, they spy Babylonian priests, [[Aristotle]], [[Eratosthenes]] and other great scholars and figures of antiquity and modern history.

The letters describe experiments, development of scientific instruments, ancient architecture and new cities, and an epic voyage on the seas. The history of scientific ideas is explored, including basic knowledge about our sun, planets and their orbits. In the central part of the book, the writer discusses climate change and cyclical ice ages throughout the history and future of the Earth.

In the final letters, Milanković describes the formation of the Earth and the stages through which it passed until it became the cradle of life, then presents its future, following the dying stages of the [[Sun]] and planets. Finally, the book deals with travel to the [[Moon]], [[Mars]] and [[Venus]], and a pilgrimage to the universe.

The '''Çöpler mine''' is one of the largest [[gold]] mines in [[Turkey]] and in the world, operated by the American [[Çalık_Holding#Mining|Alacer Gold Corporation]].&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 27| last = Hastorun| first = Sinan| title = The Mineral Industry of Turkey |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2014/myb3-2014-tu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiruna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbreports.com/admin/reports/EMJ-Turkey2012.pdf|title=Turkey minerals|year=2013|publisher=gbreports.com|accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mine is located in [[Erzincan Province]].&lt;ref name="Kiruna"/&gt; The mine has estimated reserves of 6 million oz of [[gold]].&lt;ref name="Kiruna"/&gt;

Çöpler is an [[epithermal]] [[Porphyry copper deposit|porphyry]] copper-gold deposit which forms part of the Middle Eocene [[Çöpler–Kabataş magmatic complex]] in central-eastern Turkey which formed on the north-eastern margin of the [[Tauride-Anatolide microcontinent]].  The intrusive rocks at Çöpler were emplaced into Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic metamorphosed sedimentary rocks.  Dating of igneous rocks indicate a brief magmatic and hydrothermal history at Çöpler less than a million year long about 43.8–44.6&amp;nbsp;[[Million years ago|Ma]].  The composition of magma indicate it was generated in a [[convergent boundary|convergent margin]].  Çöpler is, however, located to far away from the [[Maden–Helete arc]] and therefore must have formed in a [[Back-arc basin|back-arc setting]], similar to that in the [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|İmer|Richards|Creaser|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
