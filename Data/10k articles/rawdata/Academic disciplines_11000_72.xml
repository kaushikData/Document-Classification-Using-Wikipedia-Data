'''Animal sexual behaviour''' takes many different forms, including within the same [[species]]. Common [[mating]] or [[Reproduction|reproductively]] motivated systems include [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamy]], [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], [[polygamy]] and [[promiscuity]]. Other sexual behaviour may be reproductively motivated (e.g. [[Sexual coercion|sex apparently due to duress or coercion]] and [[situational sexual behaviour]]) or [[Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals|non-reproductively motivated]] (e.g. [[cross-species sex|interspecific sexuality]], sexual arousal from objects or places, [[Necrophilia in animals|sex with dead animals]], [[Homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual sexual behaviour]], and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] sexual behaviour).

When animal sexual behaviour is reproductively motivated, it is often termed ''mating'' or ''[[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]]''; for most non-human [[mammal]]s, mating and copulation occur at [[Estrous cycle|oestrus]] (the most fertile period in the mammalian female's reproductive cycle), which increases the chances of [[internal fertilization|successful impregnation]].&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{Cite book |author= Kent, Michael |title= Advanced biology |isbn= 978-0-19-914195-1 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2000 |pages= 250–253 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8aw4ZWLABQkC&amp;pg=PA250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= General Studies Manual |publisher= [[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]] |year= 2009 |page=17 |isbn= 9788131721339 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oAo1X2eagywC&amp;pg=RA1-PR17 |last=Thorpe |first=Showick |last2=Thorpe |first2=Edgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some animal sexual behaviour involves [[Competition (biology)|competition]], sometimes fighting, between multiple males. Females often select males for mating only if they appear strong and able to protect themselves.  The male that wins a fight may also have the chance to mate with a larger number of females and will therefore pass on his genes to their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wickler, Wolfgang |author2=Lorenz |author3=Konrad |author4=Kacher, Hermann |title= The sexual code : the social behaviour of animals and men |year= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, it was believed that only humans and a small number of other species performed sexual acts other than for reproduction, and that animals' sexuality was instinctive and a simple "[[stimulus-response]]" behaviour. However, in addition to homosexual behaviours, a range of species [[masturbate]] and may [[Tool use by animals|use objects as tools]] to help them do so. Sexual behaviour may be tied more strongly to establishment and maintenance of complex social bonds across a population which support its success in non-reproductive ways. Both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviours can be related to expressions of dominance over another animal or survival within a stressful situation (such as sex due to duress or coercion).

==Mating systems==
In [[sociobiology]] and [[behavioural ecology]], the term [[Mating systems#In animals|"mating system"]] is used to describe the ways in which animal societies are structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The mating system specifies which males mate with which females, and under what circumstances. There are four basic systems:

===Monogamy===
{{Main|Monogamous pairing in animals}}
{{See also|Evolution of monogamy}}

[[Monogamous pairing in animals|Monogamy]] occurs when one male mates with one female exclusively. A monogamous mating system is one in which individuals form [[Pair-bonding|long-lasting pairs]] and cooperate in raising offspring. These pairs may last for a lifetime, such as in [[pigeons]],&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460131/pigeon |title= Pigeon |accessdate= 26 August 2014 |work= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it may occasionally change from one mating season to another, such as in [[emperor penguin]]s.&lt;ref name="NSF"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=126932 |title= Animal Attraction: The Many Forms of Monogamy in the Animal Kingdom |accessdate= 26 August 2014 |author= Lily Whiteman |date= 13 February 2013 |work= National Science Foundation |publisher= National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with [[tournament species]], these pair-bonding species have lower levels of male aggression, competition and little [[sexual dimorphism]]. [[Zoologists]] and [[biologists]] now have evidence that monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive. Many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ågren | first1 = G. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Q. | last3 = Zhong | first3 = W. | title = Ecology and social behaviour of Mongolian gerbils, ''Meriones unguiculatus'', at Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, China | doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(89)90002-X | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 37 | pages = 11–27 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birkhead, Møller, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reichard, 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Westneat | first1 = D.

Sometimes, these [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair sexual activities]] lead to offspring.

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
Social monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g., shared use of a territory, behaviour indicative of a social pair, and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns. In humans, social monogamy takes the form of monogamous marriage. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. Finally, the term genetic monogamy is used when DNA analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. A combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide, e.g., sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual, and social and genetic monogamous relationships, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Reichard, U.H. (2003). Monogamy: Past and present. In U.H. Reichard and C. Boesch (Eds.), Monogamy: Mating strategies and partnerships in birds, humans, and other mammals, pp. 3–25, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521819733}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.

Social monogamy is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. The actual incidence of social monogamy varies greatly across different branches of the evolutionary tree. Over 90% of avian species are socially monogamous.&lt;ref name="Reichard, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reichard |first=U.H. |year=2002 |title=Monogamy – a variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62–67 |url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514183645/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash, Lipton, 2001"&gt;Barash, D.P. &amp; Lipton, J.E. (2001). The Myth of Monogamy. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company, {{ISBN|0805071369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stands in contrast to mammals. Only 3% of mammalian species are socially monogamous, although up to 15% of primate species are.&lt;ref name="Reichard, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash, Lipton, 2001" /&gt; Social monogamy has also been observed in [[reptile]]s, fish, and [[insects]].

Sexual monogamy is also rare among animals. Many socially monogamous species engage in [[extra-pair copulation]]s, making them sexually non-monogamous. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, "on average, 30% or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male."&lt;ref name="NY Times Mating"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC143FF932A1575BC0A966958260 |work= The New York Times |title= Mating for Life? It's Not for the Birds of the Bees |first= Natalie |last= Angier |date= 21 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Adair Gowaty]] has estimated that, out of 180 different species of socially monogamous songbirds, only 10% are sexually monogamous.&lt;ref name="Gowaty, Morell, 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Morell | first1 = V.

| pmc = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of genetic monogamy, determined by DNA fingerprinting, varies widely across species. For a few rare species, the incidence of genetic monogamy is 100%, with all offspring genetically related to the socially monogamous pair. But genetic monogamy is strikingly low in other species. Barash and Lipton note:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
The highest known frequency of extra-pair copulations are found among the [[fairy-wren]]s, lovely tropical creatures technically known as ''[[Malurus splendens]]'' and ''[[Malurus cyaneus]]''. More than 65% of all fairy-wren chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding group.&lt;ref name="Barash, Lipton, 2001" /&gt;{{sup|p. 12}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such low levels of genetic monogamy have surprised biologists and zoologists, forcing them to rethink the role of social monogamy in evolution. They can no longer assume social monogamy determines how genes are distributed in a species. The lower the rates of genetic monogamy among socially monogamous pairs, the less of a role social monogamy plays in determining how genes are distributed among offspring.

===Polygyny===
{{Main|Polygyny in nature}}

[[Polygyny threshold model|Polygyny]] occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In some species, notably those with [[harem]]-like structures, only one of a few males in a group of females will mate. Technically, [[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]] in sociobiology and zoology is defined as a system in which a male has a relationship with more than one female, but the females are predominantly bonded to a single male. Should the active male be driven out, killed, or otherwise removed from the group, in a number of species the new male will ensure that breeding resources are not wasted on another male's young.&lt;ref&gt;This section and examples taken from [[Robert Sapolsky]] (1998) ''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'', W.H. Freeman and Co., {{ISBN|0-7167-3210-6}}, pp. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; The new male may achieve this in many different ways, including:

* competitive [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]]: in [[lion]]s, [[hippopotamuses]], and some [[monkey]]s, the new male will kill the offspring of the previous alpha male to cause their mothers to become receptive to his sexual advances since they are no longer [[lactation|nursing]]. To prevent this, many female primates exhibit ovulation cues among all males, and show  situation-dependent receptivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fürtbauer|first=Ines|last2=Heistermann|first2=Michael|last3=Schülke|first3=Oliver|last4=Ostner|first4=Julia|date=2011-08-10|title=Concealed Fertility and Extended Female Sexuality in a Non-Human Primate (Macaca assamensis)|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23105|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023105|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3154278|pmid=21853074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[harassment]] to [[miscarriage]]: amongst wild [[horse]]s and [[baboon]]s, the male will "systematically harass" pregnant females until they miscarry.
* [[Pheromone]]-based [[spontaneous abortion]]
* in some [[rodent]]s such as [[mouse|mice]], a new male with a different scent will cause females who are pregnant to spontaneously fail to implant recently fertilised eggs. This does not require contact; it is mediated by [[scent]] alone. It is known as the [[Bruce effect]].

Von Haartman specifically described the mating behaviour of the [[European pied flycatcher]] as successive polygyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haartman | first1 = L. V. | doi = 10.1163/156853951X00296 | title = Successive Polygamy | journal = Behaviour | volume = 3 | pages = 256–273 | year = 1951 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this system, the males leave their home territory once their primary female lays her first egg. Males then create a second territory, presumably in order to attract a secondary female to breed. Even when they succeed at acquiring a second mate, the males typically return to the first female to exclusively provide for her and her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polygynous mating structures are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Aloise King |first= Edith D. |author2= Banks, Peter B. |author3= Brooks, Robert C. |title= Sexual conflict in mammals: consequences for mating systems and life history |journal= Mammal Review |publication-date= January 2013 |year= 2011 |volume= 43 |issue= 1 |pages= 47–58 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00200.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As polygyny is the most common form of polygamy among vertebrates (including humans, to some extent), it has been studied far more extensively than polyandry or polygynandry.

===Polyandry===
[[File:Hamol u0.gif|thumb|right|The anglerfish ''[[Haplophryne mollis]]'' is [[polyandrous]]. This female is trailing the atrophied remains of males she has encountered.]]
{{Main|Polyandry in nature}}

[[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]] occurs when one female gets exclusive mating rights with multiple males. In some species, such as [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blennies]], both [[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]] and [[Polyandry in nature|polyandry]] are observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Marraro |first= CH |author2= Nursall JR |title= The reproductive periodicity and behaviour of Ophioblennius atlanticus at Barbados |journal= J Zool |year= 1983 |volume= 61 |issue= 2 |pages= 317–325 |doi= 10.1139/z83-042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The males in some deep sea [[anglerfish]]es are much smaller than the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, releasing an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly [[atrophy|atrophies]], losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of [[gonads]], which release [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] in response to [[hormones]] in the female's bloodstream indicating [[ovum|egg]] release. This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W.

===Polygynandry===
{{Main|Polygynandry}}

[[Polygynandry]] occurs when multiple males mate indiscriminately with multiple females. The numbers of males and females need not be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, there are usually fewer males. Two examples of systems in primates are promiscuous mating [[chimpanzees]] and [[bonobo]]s. These species live in social groups consisting of several males and several females. Each female copulates with many males, and vice versa. In bonobos, the amount of promiscuity is particularly striking because bonobos use sex to alleviate social conflict as well as to reproduce.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/07/0722_040722_gayanimal_2.html|title=Homosexual Activity Among Animals Stirs Debate|date=2004-07-23|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mutual promiscuity is the approach most commonly used by spawning animals, and is perhaps the "original fish mating system."&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}} Common examples are [[forage fish]], such as [[herring]]s, which form huge mating [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] in shallow water. The water becomes milky with sperm and the bottom is draped with millions of fertilised eggs.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}}

===Polygamy===
{{See also|Promiscuity#Other animals}}

The term [[polygamy]] is an umbrella term used to refer generally to non-monogamous matings. As such, polygamous relationships can be polygynous, polyandrous or polygynandrous. In a small number of species, individuals can display either polygamous or monogamous behaviour depending on environmental conditions. An example is the social wasp ''[[Apoica flavissima]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In some species, polygyny and polyandry is displayed by both sexes in the population. Polygamy in both sexes has been observed in [[Red flour beetle#Polygamy in red flour beetles|red flour beetle]] (''Tribolium castaneum''). Polygamy is also seen in many [[Lepidoptera]] species including ''[[Mythimna unipuncta]]'' (true armyworm moth)''.''&lt;ref&gt;Mcneil, Jeremy N. “Calling Behavior: Can It Be Used to Identify Migratory Species of Moths.”''The Florida Entomologist'', vol. 69, no. 1, 1986, pp. 78–84., doi:10.2307/3494746.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tournament species]] is one in which "mating tends to be highly polygamous and involves high levels of male-male aggression and competition."&lt;ref name=twsNovK12&gt;{{cite news |author= Robert Sapolsky |title= Biology and Human Behavior: The Neurological Origins of Individuality, 2nd edition |url= http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1597 |publisher= ''The Teaching Company'' |year= 2005 |accessdate= 2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tournament behaviour often correlates with high levels of [[sexual dimorphism]], examples of species including [[chimpanzees]] and [[baboons]]. Most polygamous species present high levels of tournament behaviour, with a notable exception being [[bonobos]]{{Citation needed|reason=Evidence for bonobo sexual peacefulness is scant|date=April 2018}} .

==Parental investment and reproductive success==
{{Main|Bateman's principle}}
[[File:Mating Great Grey Slug 4111.jpg|thumb|Mating [[Limax maximus|grey slugs]], suspended from a slime thread]]

Female and male sexual behaviour differ in many species. Often, males are more active in initiating mating, and bear the more conspicuous sexual ornamentation like antlers and colourful plumage. This is a result of [[anisogamy]], where [[sperm]] are smaller and much less costly (energetically) to produce than [[egg]]s. This difference in physiological cost means that males are more limited by the number of mates they can secure, while females are limited by the quality of genes of her mates, a phenomenon known as [[Bateman's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bateman | first = A.J. | title = Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila | journal = Heredity | volume = 2 | pages = 349–368 | year = 1948 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1948.21 | pmid = 18103134 | issue = Pt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many females also have extra reproductive burdens in that [[parental care]] often falls mainly, or exclusively, on them.  Thus, females are more limited in their potential [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name=Trivers1972&gt;Trivers, R.L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'', 1871–1971 (pp.&amp;nbsp;136–179). Chicago, IL: Aldine. {{ISBN|0-435-62157-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In species where males take on more of the reproductive costs, such as [[sea horses]] and [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s, the role is reversed, and the females are larger, more aggressive and more brightly coloured than the males.

In hermaphroditic animals, the costs of parental care can be evenly distributed between the sexes, e.g. [[earthworm]]s. In some species of [[planarian]]s, sexual behaviour takes the form of [[penis fencing]].  In this form of copulation, the individual that first penetrates the other with the penis, forces the other to be female, thus carrying the majority of the cost of reproduction.&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/2_14_98/fob2.htm Hermaphrodites duel for manhood], ''Science News Online''.

==Seasonality==
{{Main|Seasonal breeder}}
[[File:Brain coral spawning.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brain coral]]s typically [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] in connection with the full moon every August]]

Many animal species have specific mating (or breeding) periods e.g. ([[Seasonal breeder|seasonal breeding]]) so that offspring are born or hatch at an optimal time. In marine species with limited mobility and [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] like [[coral]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[clam]]s, the timing of the common spawning is the only externally visible form of sexual behaviour. In areas with continuously high [[primary production]], some species have a series of breeding seasons throughout the year. This is the case with most primates (who are primarily tropical and subtropical animals). Some animals ([[opportunistic breeders]]) breed dependent upon other conditions in their environment aside from time of year.

===Mammals===
Mating seasons are often associated with changes to herd or group structure, and behavioural changes, including territorialism amongst individuals. These may be annual (e.g. [[Wolves#Reproduction|wolves]]), biannual (e.g. [[canine reproduction|dogs]]) or more frequently (e.g. horses). During these periods, females of most mammalian species are more mentally and physically receptive to sexual advances, a period scientifically described as [[estrous]] but commonly described as being "in season" or "in heat".  Sexual behaviour may occur outside estrus,&lt;ref&gt;For example, masturbation, trial mounting, and other behaviours are regularly seen in male animals out of season&lt;/ref&gt; and such acts as do occur are not necessarily harmful.&lt;ref name="danish"&gt;2006 Danish Animal Ethics Council report: "The mucous membrane in the female animal’s vagina and the animal’s behaviour is under influence of its rut cycle. That means that the animal is physically and mentally more ready for sexual activities at some times than at others. But this does not mean that sexual activity will lead to injuries, fear or suffering, if it happens outside the rut period."&lt;br/&gt; (Danish: ''"Slimhinden i hundyrets vagina og dyrets adfærd er under indflydelse af dets brunstcyklus. Det betyder, at dyret er fysisk og mentalt mere parat til seksuelle aktiviteter på nogle tidspunkter end på andre. Men dette er ikke ensbetydende med, at den seksuelle aktivitet vil være forbundet med skader, angst og lidelse, hvis den foregår udenfor brunstperioden."'') [http://www.jm.dk/image.asp?page=image&amp;objno=76595 Report November 2006 (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214507/http://www.jm.dk/image.asp?page=image&amp;objno=76595 |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mammals (e.g. domestic cats, rabbits and camilidae) are termed [[Induced ovulation (animals)|"induced ovulators"]].  For these species, the female ovulates due to an external stimulus during, or just prior, to mating, rather than ovulating cyclically or spontaneously. Stimuli causing induced ovulation include the sexual behaviour of coitus, sperm and pheromones.  
Domestic cats have [[penile spines]]. Upon withdrawal of a [[cat's penis]], the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which may cause ovulation.&lt;ref name="HayssenTienhoven1993"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Virginia Douglass Hayssen |author2 = Ari Van Tienhoven |title = Asdell's Patterns of Mammalian Reproduction: A Compendium of Species-specific Data |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yQzSe71g2AcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=spines |accessdate = 27 September 2013 |year = 1993 |publisher = Cornell University Press |isbn = 978-0-8014-1753-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aronson 1967"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Penile spines of the domestic cat: their endocrine-behavior relations.|last=Aronson|first=L.

===Amphibians===
For many amphibians, an annual breeding cycle applies, typically regulated by ambient temperature, precipitation, availability of surface water and food supply. This breeding season is accentuated in temperate regions, in boreal climate the breeding season is typically concentrated to a few short days in the spring.  Some species, such as the Rana Clamitans (green frog), spend from June to August defending their territory.  In order to protect these territories, they use five vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Kentwood D|title=Territoriality in the green frog (Rana clamitans): Vocalizations and agonistic behaviour|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=November 1978|volume=26|issue=4|pages=1051–1054|doi=10.1016/0003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347278900945|accessdate=2 October 2017|doi-broken-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish===
Like many [[coral reef]] dwellers, the [[clownfish]] spawn around the time of the full moon in the wild.  In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive female is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilisation. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. If the female clownfish is removed from the group, such as by death, one of the largest and most dominant males will become a female. The remaining males will move up a rank in the hierarchy.

==Motivation==
Various [[neurohormone]]s stimulate sexual wanting in animals. In general, studies have suggested that [[dopamine]] is involved in sexual incentive motivation, [[oxytocin]] and [[melanocortin]]s in sexual attraction, and [[noradrenaline]] in sexual arousal.&lt;ref name="georgiadis"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Georgiadis, J. R. |author2=Kringelbach, M. L. |author3=Pfaus, J. G. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2012 | title = Sex for fun: a synthesis of human and animal neurobiology | journal = Nature Reviews Urology | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 486–498 | doi=10.1038/nrurol.2012.151|pmid=22926422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasopressin]] is also involved in the sexual behaviour of some animals.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;{{cite book |last= Bear |first= Mark F. |title= Neuroscience, exploring the brain |year= 2007 |publisher= Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |location= Baltimore, MD |pages= 544–545 |isbn= 978-0781760034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurohormones in the mating systems of voles===
The mating system of [[prairie vole]]s is [[monogamous]]; after mating, they form a lifelong bond. In contrast, [[montane vole]]s have a [[polygamous]] mating system. When montane voles mate, they form no strong attachments, and separate after copulation. Studies{{Citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=No citation is given for the study referenced in the text.}} on the brains of these two species have found that it is two neurohormones and their respective receptors that are responsible for these differences in mating strategies. Male prairie voles release vasopressin after copulation with a partner, and an attachment to their partner then develops. Female prairie voles release oxytocin after  copulation with a partner, and similarly develop an attachment to their partner.

Neither male nor female montane voles release high quantities of oxytocin or vasopressin when they mate. Even when injected with these neurohormones, their mating system does not change. In contrast, if prairie voles are injected with the neurohormones, they may form a lifelong attachment, even if they have not mated. It's believed{{By whom|date=May 2017}} that the differing response to the neurohormones between the two species is due to a difference in the number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Prairie voles have a greater number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors compared to montane voles, and are therefore more sensitive to those two neurohormones. It's believed that it's the quantity of receptors, rather than the quantity of the hormones, that determines the mating system and bond-formation of either species.

===Oxytocin and rat sexual behaviour===
Mother rats experience a [[Estrous cycle|postparum estrus]] which makes them highly motivated to mate.  However, they also have a strong motivation to protect their newly born pups.  As a consequence, the mother rat solicits males to the nest but simultaneously becomes aggressive towards them to protect her young.  If the mother rat is given injections of an oxytocin [[receptor antagonist]], they no longer experience these maternal motivations.&lt;ref name="Kennet"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kennett, J.E. |author2=McKee, D.T.|year=2012|title=Oxytocin: An emerging regulator of prolactin secretion in the female rat|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=403–412|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2011.02263.x|pmc=3288386| pmid= 22129099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolactin influences social bonding in rats.&lt;ref name="Kennet" /&gt;

===Oxytocin and primate sexual behaviour===
Oxytocin plays a similar role in non-human primates as it does in humans.

Grooming, sex, and cuddling frequencies correlate positively with levels of oxytocin. As the level of oxytocin increases so does sexual motivation. While oxytocin plays a major role in parent child relationships, it is also found to play a role in adult sexual relationships. Its secretion affects the nature of the relationship or if there will even be a relationship at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Pieper|first2=Bridget A.|last3=Boe|first3=Carla Y.|last4=Cronin|first4=Katherine A.|last5=Kurian|first5=Aimee V.|last6=Ziegler|first6=Toni E.|title=Variation in oxytocin is related to variation in affiliative behavior in monogamous, pairbonded tamarins|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0018506X10001741|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=58|issue=4|pages=614–618|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.06.014|pmid=20600045|pmc=2933949|year=2010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-2863-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that oxytocin is higher in monkeys in lifelong monogamous relationships compared to monkeys which are single. Furthermore, the oxytocin levels of the couples correlate positively; when the oxytocin secretion of one increases the other one also increases. Higher levels of oxytocin are related to monkeys expressing more behaviours such as cuddling, grooming and sex, while lower levels of oxytocin reduce motivation for these activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Research on oxytocin's role in the animal brain suggests that it plays less of a role in behaviours of love and affection than previously believed. "When oxytocin was first discovered in 1909, it was thought mostly to influence a mother’s labour contractions and milk let-down. Then, in the 1990s, research with prairie voles found that giving them a dose of oxytocin resulted in the formation of a bond with their future mate (Azar, 40)." Oxytocin has since been treated by the media as the sole player in the "love and mating game" in mammals. This view, however, is proving to be false as, "most hormones don’t influence behaviour directly. Rather, they affect thinking and emotions in variable ways (Azar, 40)." There is much more involved in sexual behaviour in the mammalian animal than oxytocin and vasopressin can explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambert |first= K. |title= The Lab Rat Chronicles |year= 2011 |publisher= penguin group |location= New York |pages= 151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Azar |first= B. |title= Oxytocin's other side |url= http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/03/oxytocin.aspx |date= March 2011 |volume= 42 |issue= 3 |page= 40 |journal= Science Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aubert | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gustison | first2 = M.

===Pleasure{{anchor|Sex for pleasure}}===
It is often assumed that animals do not have sex for pleasure, or alternatively that humans, pigs, [[bonobo]]es (and perhaps dolphins and one or two more species of primates) are the only species that do. This is sometimes stated as "animals mate only for reproduction". This view is considered a misconception by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Elaine M., R. L. Meisel, and B. D. Sachs.

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
Even though the evolution-related purpose of mating can be said to be reproduction, it is not actually the creating of offspring which originally causes them to mate. It is probable that they mate because they are motivated for the actual copulation, and because this is connected with a positive experience. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is some form of pleasure or satisfaction connected with the act. This assumption is confirmed by the behaviour of males, who in the case of many species are prepared to work to get access to female animals, especially if the female animal is in oestrus, and males who for breeding purposes are used to [[semen collection|having sperm collected]] become very eager, when the equipment they associate with the collection is taken out.&lt;ref name="animal ethics council"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Det Dyreetiske Råd |year=2006 |title=Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr |publisher=Justitsministeriet |url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |quote=Selv om det evolutionsmæssige formål med at parre sig kan siges at være reproduktion, er det ikke selve det, at dyrene får afkom, der i første omgang får dem til at parre sig.

Det er derfor rimeligt at antage, at der er en eller anden form for behag eller tilfredsstillelse forbundet med akten. Denne antagelse bekræftes af adfærden hos handyr, der for mange arters vedkommende er parate til at arbejde for at få adgang til hundyr, især hvis hundyret er i brunst, og handyr der i avlsøjemed er vant til at få tappet sæd – de viser stor ivrighed, når det udstyr, de forbinder med sædopsamlingen, tages frem. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227144357/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
There is nothing in [[female mammals]]' anatomy or physiology that contradicts that [[sexual stimulation|stimulation of the sexual organs]] and mating is able to be a positive experience. For instance, the clitoris acts in the same way as with women, and scientific studies have shown that the success of reproduction is improved by stimulation of clitoris on (among other species) cows and mares in connection with insemination, because it improves the transportation of the sperm due to contractions of the inner genitalia. This probably also applies to female animals of other animal species, and contractions in the inner genitals are seen e.g. also during orgasm for women. It is therefore reasonable to assume that sexual intercourse may be linked with a positive experience for female animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Det Dyreetiske Råd |year=2006 |title=Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr |publisher=Justitsministeriet |url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |quote=Der er intet ved hunpattedyrenes anatomi eller fysiologi, der modsiger, at stimulation af kønsorganerne og parring skulle kunne være en positiv oplevelse – fx fungerer klitoris på samme måde som hos kvinder. Videnskabelige undersøgelser har vist, at reproduktionssuccesen forbedres ved stimulation af klitoris på bl.a. køer og hopper i forbindelse med insemination, fordi det forbedrer sædtransporten pga. sammentrækninger af de indre kønsdele. Dette gælder sandsynligvis også hundyr af andre dyrearter, og sammentrækninger i de indre kønsdele ses fx også under orgasme hos kvinder. Det er derfor rimeligt at antage, at det seksuelle samvær kan være forbundet med en positiv oplevelse for hundyrene. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227144357/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Koinophilia==
{{Main|Koinophilia}}

[[Koinophilia]] is the love of the "normal" or phenotypically common (from the Greek, ''koinos'', meaning "the usual" or "common").&lt;ref name=Koeslag1990&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koeslag | first1 = J.H. | year = 1990 | title = Koinophilia groups sexual creatures into species, promotes stasis, and stabilizes social behaviour | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 15–35 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80297-8 | pmid=2200930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to scientific literature in 1990, and refers to the tendency of animals seeking a mate to prefer that mate not to have any unusual, peculiar or deviant features.&lt;ref name=Koeslag1990 /&gt;  Similarly, animals preferentially choose mates with low [[fluctuating asymmetry]]. 
&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moller, A.P.  |author2=Pomiankowski, A |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and sexual selection|journal=Genetica|volume=89|pages=267–279|year=1993|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02424520#page-2|doi=10.1007/bf02424520}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, animal sexual ornaments can evolve through runaway selection, which is driven by (usually female) selection for non-standard traits.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1986). The Blind Watchmaker. Longman, London. Published in Penguin Books 1988, 1991, and 2006. Chapter 8, Explosions and Spirals.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation bias==
The field of study of sexuality in non-human species was a long-standing [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="news-medical"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/23/1500-animal-species-practice-homosexuality.aspx |title= 1,500 animal species practice homosexuality |date= 23 October 2006 |publisher= News-medical.net |accessdate= 19 February 2007}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past, researchers sometimes failed to observe, mis-categorising and mis-described sexual behaviour which [[Observer bias|did not meet their preconceptions]] (mainly from western [[puritanism]]). In earlier periods, bias tended to support what would now be described as conservative sexual mores. An example of overlooking behaviour relates to descriptions of [[giraffe]] mating:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
When nine out of ten pairings occur between males, "[e]very male that sniffed a female was reported as sex, while [[anal sex|anal intercourse]] with [[orgasm]] between males was only [categorized as] 'revolving around' [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]], competition or greetings."&lt;ref name="news-medical" /&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 21st century, liberal social or sexual views are often projected upon animal subjects of research. Popular discussions of bonobos are a frequently cited example. Current research frequently expresses views such as that of the [[Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo]], which in 2006 held an exhibition on animal sexuality:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;"&gt;
Many researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's ethical principles.&lt;ref name="news-medical" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other animal activities may be misinterpreted due to the frequency and context in which animals perform the behaviour. For example, domestic ruminants display behaviours such as mounting and head-butting.  This often occurs when the animals are establishing dominance relationships and are not necessarily sexually motivated. Careful analysis must be made to interpret what animal motivations are being expressed by those behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Types of sexual behaviour==

===Reproductive sexual behaviour===
====Copulation====
{{Main|Copulation (zoology)}}
Copulation is the union of the male and female [[sex organs]], the innate sexual activity specifically organized to transmit male sperm into the body of the female.

In non-primate mammals (for example, [[rodent]]s, [[canidae|canines]], [[felidae|felines]], [[bovine]]s, and [[equine]]s), the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation.&lt;ref name="Knobil"&gt;Knobil E., Neill J.D. (Eds). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1_1cDe92k_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The physiology of reproduction]. Academic Press, 3nd edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cuckoldry====
[[File:BlueGill 002.jpg|thumb|right|Small male [[bluegill]] sunfishes [[cuckold]] large males by adopting ''sneaker'' strategies.]]
{{See also|Cuckoldry in fish}}

Alternative male strategies which allow small males to engage in [[cuckoldry]] can develop in species such as fish where [[spawning]] is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of [[Polyandry in nature|polyandry]], and can occur with ''sneak spawners''. A sneak spawner is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=streak+spawning&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Streak spawning] Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing [[gamete]]s at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=spawning+rush&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Spawning rush] Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, ''jack males'' are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into [[Spawn (biology)|redds]] to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the "standard" strategy of large males.&lt;ref&gt;Gross MR (1984) "Sunfish, salmon, and the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics in fishes". Pages 55–75 in GW Potts and RJ Wottoon, eds. ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics''. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hermaphroditism====
[[File:Georgia Aquarium - Giant Grouper.jpg|thumb|right|Female [[grouper]]s change their sex to male if no male is available.]]
{{See also|Sequential hermaphroditism}}

[[Hermaphroditism]] occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternative between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with [[gonochorism]], where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of [[teleost]] fishes.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984"&gt;Shapiro DY (1984) "Sex reversal and sociodemographics processes in coral reef fishes" Pages 103–116 in GW Potts and RK Wootoon, eds., ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually hermaphrodites are ''[[Sequential hermaphroditism|sequential]]'', meaning they can [[Sex change|switch sex]], usually from female to male ([[protogyny]]). This can happen if a dominant male is removed from a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984" /&gt; This is found amongst [[coral reef fish]]es such as [[grouper]]s, [[parrotfish]]es and [[wrass]]es. It is less common for a male to switch to a female ([[protandry]]).&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|162}} As an example, most [[wrasse]]s are [[protogynous]] hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system.&lt;ref name="Robertson1978"&gt;{{Cite journal

Sexual cannibalism is a behaviour in which a female animal kills and consumes the male before, during, or after copulation. Sexual cannibalism confers fitness advantages to both the male and female.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Sexual cannibalism is common among insects, arachnids&lt;ref name="No7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polis | first1 = G.A. | year = 1981 | title = The evolution and dynamics of intraspecific +4193 predation | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 225–251 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.001301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].&lt;ref name="No7" /&gt; There is also evidence of sexual cannibalism in [[Gastropoda|gastropods]] and [[copepod]]s.&lt;ref name="No8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bilde | first1 = T. | last2 = Tuni | first2 = C. | last3 = Elsayed | first3 = R. | last4 = Pekár | first4 = S. | last5 = Toft | first5 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Death feigning in the face of sexual cannibalism | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 23–5 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0392 | pmid=17148316 | pmc=1617195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual coercion====
{{Main|Sexual coercion}}
[[File:Cairina moschata reproduction.jpg|thumb|During mating, the male [[muscovy duck]] typically immobilises the female.]]

Sex in a forceful or apparently coercive context has been documented in a variety of species.  In some [[herbivore|herbivorous]] herd species, or species where males and females are very different in size, the male [[dominance (ethology)|dominates]] sexually by force and size.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In the [[water beetle]] genus ''[[Acilius genus|Acilius]]'', an "[[evolutionary arms race]]" between the two sexes means that there is no courtship system for these beetles. Their mating behaviours include males holding females underwater until exhausted, and allowing only occasional access to the surface to breathe for up to six hours (to prevent them breeding with other males), and females which have a variety of body shapings (to prevent males from gaining a grip).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1980376.ece "Not tonight, not ever.

====Parthenogenesis====
[[Parthenogenesis]] is a form of asexual reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wininger|first=J. David|date=2004|pages=635–637|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-012436643-5/50072-9|isbn=9780124366435|title=Handbook of Stem Cells|chapter=Parthenogenetic Stem Cells}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, parthenogenesis is not a behaviour, however, sexual behaviours may be involved.

[[Cnemidophorus|Whip-tailed lizard]] females have the ability to reproduce through parthenogenesis and as such males are rare and sexual breeding non-standard. Females engage in "pseudocopulation"&lt;ref name="Whiptail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/the-new-mexico-whiptail-lizard-is-made-up-entirely-of-females/|title=New Mexico whiptail lizards are all females|author=Hiskey, D.|accessdate=13 February 2015|date=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stimulate [[ovulation]], with their behaviour following their hormonal cycles; during low levels of oestrogen, these (female) lizards engage in "masculine" sexual roles. Those animals with currently high oestrogen levels assume "feminine" sexual roles.  Lizards that perform the courtship ritual have greater fecundity than those kept in isolation due to an increase in hormones triggered by the sexual behaviours. So, even though asexual whiptail lizards populations lack males, sexual stimuli still increase reproductive success.  From an [[evolutionary]] standpoint these females are passing their full genetic code to all of their offspring rather than the 50% of genes that would be passed in sexual reproduction.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

It is rare to find true parthenogenesis in fishes, where females produce female offspring with no input from males.

====Unisexuality====
[[Unisexuality]] occurs when a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. ''[[Squalius alburnoides]]'', a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, appears to be an all-male species. The existence of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is [[diploid]], but not hermaphroditic. It can have [[triploid]] and [[tetraploid]] forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through [[hybridogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alves MJ, Collarea-Pereira MJ, Dowling TE, Coelho MM | year = 2002 | title = The genetics of maintenance of an all-male lineage in the ''Squalius alburnoides'' complex | url = | journal = J.

Some females have concealed fertility, making it difficult for males to evaluate if a female is fertile. This is costly as ejaculation expends much energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Stony coral spawning 2.jpg|thumb|right|A male [[Great star coral|star coral]] releases sperm into the water.]]

Invertebrates are often [[hermaphrodite]]s. Some hermaphroditic [[land snail]]s begin mating with an elaborate tactile courting ritual. The two snails circle around each other for up to six hours, touching with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding an organ housing a sharpened dart. The dart is made of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[chitin]], and is called a [[love dart]]. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the love dart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002650100345 |title=Dart receipt promotes sperm storage in the garden snail Helix aspersa |year=2001 |last1=Rogers |first1=David |last2=Chase |first2=Ronald |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=122–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the snails have fired their darts, they copulate and exchange sperm as a separate part of the mating progression. The love darts are covered with a mucus that contains a [[hormone]]-like substance that facilitates the survival of the sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chase, R.| year=2007 |title=The function of dart shooting in helicid snails |journal=American Malacological Bulletin |volume=23 |pages=183–189 |doi=10.4003/0740-2783-23.1.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgill.ca"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chase, R. |author2=Blanchard, K.

[[Penis fencing]] is a mating behaviour engaged in by certain species of [[flatworm]], such as ''[[Pseudobiceros bedfordi]]''. Species which engage in the practice are hermaphroditic, possessing both eggs and sperm-producing testes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/hunt_explo2.html |title= Fighting to mate: flatworm penis fencing |author= Newman, Leslie |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species "fence" using two-headed dagger-like penises which are pointed, and white in colour. One organism inseminates the other. The sperm is absorbed through pores in the skin, causing fertilisation.

[[Coral]]s can be both [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]] (unisexual) and [[Hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]], each of which can reproduce sexually and asexually. Reproduction also allows corals to settle new areas. Corals predominantly reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]]. 25% of [[hermatypic coral]]s (stony corals) form single sex ([[gonochoristic]]) colonies, while the rest are [[hermaphroditic]].&lt;ref name="Veron"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reproductive synchrony|Synchronous spawning]] is very typical on the coral reef and often, even when multiple [[species]] are present, all corals spawn on the same night. This synchrony is essential so that male and female gametes can meet. Corals must rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve lunar changes, sunset time, and possibly chemical signalling.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt; Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Hatta&gt;

Butterflies spend much time searching for mates. When the male spots a mate, he will fly closer and release [[pheromone]]s. He then performs a special [[courtship dance]] to attract the female. If the female appreciates the dancing she may join him. Then they join their bodies together end to end at their [[abdomen]]s. Here, the male passes the sperm to the female's egg-laying tube, which will soon be fertilised by the sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceray.com/biology/zoology/13-strangest-and-most-unusual-sexual-behavior-among-the-animals/2/ |title= Chan Lee Peng, August 2008 |publisher= Scienceray.com |accessdate= 5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals make [[copulatory plug|plugs of mucus]] to seal the female's [[Body orifice|orifice]] after mating. Normally such plugs are secreted by the male, to block subsequent partners. In spiders the female can assist the process.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Sexual Appetite and Animal behaviour – Sex and the single spider |journal= The Economist |url= http://www.economist.com/node/18956086 |date= 14 July 2011 |volume= 400 |issue= 8742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spider sex is unusual in that males transfer their sperm to the female on small limbs called pedipalps. They use these to pick their sperm up from their genitals and insert it into the female's sexual orifice, rather than copulating directly.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; On the 14 occasions a sexual plug was made, the female produced it without assistance from the male. On ten of these occasions the male's pedipalps then seemed to get stuck while he was transferring the sperm (which is rarely the case in other species of spider), and he had great difficulty freeing himself. In two of those ten instances, he was eaten as a result.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

==Inbreeding avoidance==
{{Main|Inbreeding avoidance}}

When close relatives mate, progeny may exhibit the detrimental effects of [[inbreeding depression]].  Inbreeding depression is predominantly caused by the [[homozygous]] expression of recessive deleterious alleles.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |year=2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, inbreeding depression may lead to the evolution of [[inbreeding avoidance]] behaviour.  Several examples of animal behaviour that reduce mating of close relatives and inbreeding depression are described next.

Reproductively active female [[naked mole-rat]]s tend to associate with unfamiliar males (usually non-kin), whereas reproductively inactive females do not discriminate.&lt;ref name="pmid10584337"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke FM, Faulkes CG |title=Kin discrimination and female mate choice in the naked mole-rat Heterocephalus glaber |journal=Proc.

When mice inbreed with close relatives in their natural habitat, there is a significant detrimental effect on progeny survival.&lt;ref name="pmid7939661"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiménez JA, Hughes KA, Alaks G, Graham L, Lacy RC |title=An experimental study of inbreeding depression in a natural habitat |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5183 |pages=271–3 |year=1994 |pmid=7939661 |doi= 10.1126/science.7939661|url=|bibcode=1994Sci...266..271J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the house mouse, the [[Major urinary proteins|major urinary protein]] (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie [[kin recognition]] and [[inbreeding avoidance]].   Thus there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP [[haplotype]]s than would be expected if there were random mating.&lt;ref name="pmid17997307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherborne AL, Thom MD, Paterson S, Jury F, Ollier WE, Stockley P, Beynon RJ, Hurst JL |title=The genetic basis of inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Curr.

[[Meerkat]] females appear to be able to discriminate the odour of their kin from the odour of their non-kin.&lt;ref name="pmid23234867"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leclaire S, Nielsen JF, Thavarajah NK, Manser M, Clutton-Brock TH |title=Odour-based kin discrimination in the cooperatively breeding meerkat |journal=Biol.

When mating does occur between meerkat relatives, it often results in [[inbreeding depression]].  Inbreeding depression was evident for a variety of traits: pup mass at emergence from the natal burrow, hind-foot length, growth until independence and juvenile survival.&lt;ref name="pmid22497583"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nielsen JF, English S, Goodall-Copestake WP, Wang J, Walling CA, Bateman AW, Flower TP, Sutcliffe RL, Samson J, Thavarajah NK, Kruuk LE, Clutton-Brock TH, Pemberton JM |title=Inbreeding and inbreeding depression of early life traits in a cooperative mammal |journal=Mol.

In natural populations of the bird ''Parus major'' (great tit), inbreeding is likely avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.&lt;ref name="pmid18211876"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szulkin M, Sheldon BC |title=Dispersal as a means of inbreeding avoidance in a wild bird population |journal=Proc.

[[Toad]]s display [[Philopatry#Breeding-site philopatry|breeding site fidelity]], as do many [[amphibian]]s.  Individuals that return to natal ponds to breed will likely encounter [[sibling]]s as potential mates.  Although [[incest]] is possible, ''Bufo americanus'' siblings rarely mate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5009">'''Aviation engineering''' is the science of designing, developing, and assembling aircraft. Aviation engineers focus on airspace development, airport design, aircraft navigation technologies, and aerodrome planning. Professionals working in this field experiment with innovations in technology and materials, test planes, simulate flight conditions, and more.

As a branch of law, it is art for it involves formulation of [[public policy]], regulations, aviation laws pertaining to [[airspace]], [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, [[aerodrome]]s and the conduct of [[air services agreements]] through treaty.

This branch of [[engineering]] is distinct to [[aerospace engineering]] which deals with the science of flying craft and spacecraft.

==Airspace development==
The global airspace is divided into territorial airspace which then belongs to a [[country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is meant by international waters and airspace? {{!}} Find Laws, Legal Information, News &amp; Solicitors - Findlaw UK |url=http://findlaw.co.uk/law/government/other_law_and_government_topics/international_waters_and_international_airspace.html |website=Find Laws, Legal Information, News &amp; Solicitors - Findlaw UK |access-date=2016-02-02 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301054920/http://findlaw.co.uk/law/government/other_law_and_government_topics/international_waters_and_international_airspace.html |archivedate=2016-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, airspace has to be engineered to benefit both military and civil users. Planning and designing airspace is important so as not to affect military operations and in order to designate air routes for commercial airlines to navigate freely without intervention by military authorities. For instance, not all of [[China]] can be used for commercial aeronautical navigation. Certain airspaces are designated as military-use only. Navigating outside commercial airspaces in the country may lead to risk of the astrayed aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China To Continue Airspace Relaxation|url = http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-04-13/china-continue-airspace-relaxation|website = Aviation International News|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prior years, airspace has been limited to military and air mail services. The advancement in aerospace engineering brought to fore aircraft designs that lead to the development of commercial airliners. Governments around the world concluded air rights for their respective airlines and their corresponding aircraft. Government saw the economic potential of airspace as a state enterprise. This rise in the development of commercial aviation led to the study of the complexities of aircraft (plane) management, airport design and construction, international air services agreements (treaties).

In recent years, the global airline industry has demanded that China should reform its aviation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = REFILE-China aviation regulator to push for air space reform -paper|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/china-aviation-idUSL4N0XC2TM20150415|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-04-15|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airport design==
Recent designs of airports have been engineered to align with global environmental standards. Advancement in [[civil engineering]] and [[architecture]] make an interplay of the two disciplines.

==Career==
Governments around the world hire aviation engineers for all sorts of reasons. In the [[United States]], federal, state and local agencies all commonly employ aviation engineers for agencies such as the Department of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of controlling aircraft navigation throughout the whole nation, maintaining navigation, licensing and certification for aviation engineers. FAA employs many aviation engineers to work on research and development problems, [[noise pollution]] and hypersonic aircraft among other things. 

Engineers are heavily involved in improving aviation technologies to support the advancement of military and commercial aviation. Aviation engineers are often employed in aerospace machine shops specializing in the technological advancement of aircraft parts and equipment. These shops produce aircraft components such as electrical connectors, oxygen generation systems, landing gear assemblies, and other pieces that require special attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aerospace Machine Shop {{!}} Precision CNC machining {{!}} Ardel Engineering|url = http://www.ardelengineering.com/aircraft-aerospace|website = www.ardelengineering.com|access-date = 2016-02-02|first = |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation engineers do more than work on planes. Aviation engineers also play a large role in airport design. They provide guidance for the construction and daily running of the airports, as well as help in the operation and maintenance.

Supported by the [[Government of Bangladesh]], BIDS functions as a [[think tank]], helping formulate socio-economic policies. The institute conducts research and promotes study and education in development economics, rural development, demographics and social sciences.

==History==

The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies had its origin in Pakistan, named as the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and established in June 1957. The PIDE was moved to Dhaka in January 1971. After the emergence of independent Bangladesh in 1971, the Institute was called the Bangladesh Institute of Development Economics (BIDE). Later on, a Parliamentary Charter was awarded in 1974 and the Institute was renamed as the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) to reflect its multidisciplinary focus of development research. It was incorporated as an autonomous body, governed by a high powered Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Planning, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Since 1974, through a process of national level institutional restructuring, two other institutions––the Population Study Centre and the National Foundation for Research on Human Resources Development–– were merged with BIDS in 1982 and 1983 respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Institute_of_Development_Studies|title=Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, funding for BIDS was made through regular government budgetary support. In 1983, the Government created an endowment fund to ensure a source of recurring revenue for running the Institute, thereby reducing its dependence on regular budgetary support, and enabling BIDS to enjoy more functional autonomy. In 2009, the Government provided a Research Endowment Fund of Tk. 200 million to support core institutional research of BIDS. Some donor agencies and foundations also provide resources for its activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==

The Publication Section publishes books, journals, policy briefs, monographs, and other reports for promoting a wide dissemination of BIDS research activities and findings. The Section, with equipment to meet the Institute's publishing requirements, also provides sales services to its local and foreign customers and promotes BIDS publication through complimentary and exchange programs. The BIDS publications have wide circulation amongst researchers, policymakers and the general readers.

The [[Bangladesh Development Studies]](BDS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bids.org.bd/BDS_intro.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225140312/http://www.bids.org.bd/BDS_intro.php |archivedate=December 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the quarterly journal of the Institute. This is published in English. It enjoys international reputation and is currently in its 35th years of publication. The BDS carries research articles, notes, and book reviews by BIDS researchers as well as by national and international scholars.

Canisius' mascot is the Golden Griffin. The use of a griffin arose from the fact that Robert de La Salle who explored Lake Erie in a ship named Le Griffon had received a Jesuit education. The college adopted the griffin in 1932, after Charles A. Brady ('33) wrote a story in a Canisius publication honoring Buffalo's centennial year as a city. Brady wrote about Rene-Robert LaSalle's [[Le Griffon]], which was built in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The griffin was first used on the La Salle medal in 1932 and from there spread to the college newspaper and sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;"THE NAME GAME; NICKNAMES FOR LOCAL TEAMS PASS THE TEST."

It represents values such as courage, boldness, intelligence, and strength befitting students and athletes alike.

The College was also the first home field of the [[Buffalo All-Americans]] of the early [[National Football League]]. Around 1917 Buffalo manager [[Barney Lepper]] signed a lease for the team to play their home games at Canisius College. The All-Americans played games at Canisius before relocating to [[Offermann Stadium|Bison Stadium]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | url=http://www.buffalonian.com/history/industry/sports/buffforgotchampI.html | title=Buffalo's Forgotten Champions | first=Jeffery | last=Miller | isbn= 978-1413450057 | publisher=Xlibris Corp  | year=2002}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
'''Classical Marxism''' refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as contrasted with later developments in [[Marxism]], especially [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]].

==Karl Marx==
[[File:Marx4.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] in 1861]]
{{details|Karl Marx}}
Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, [[Trier]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] &amp;ndash; March 14, 1883, [[London]]) was an immensely influential German [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[political economist]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation of the worker, the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the [[Russia]]n [[Bolsheviks]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.

As the American Marx scholar [[Hal Draper]] remarked: "[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".

===Early influences===
{{main|The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism}}
{{details|Influences on Karl Marx}}
The early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism]''&amp;nbsp;by [[Vladimir I. Lenin]] at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German philosophy====
Main influences include [[Immanuel Kant]]; [[G. W. F. Hegel]]; and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. 

Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of [[Young Hegelians]] to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from [[German idealism]] and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.

====English and Scottish political economy====
Main influences include [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. 

Marx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.

Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between "labour power", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of "surplus value", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.

====French socialism====
Main influences include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Charles Fourier]]; [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and [[Louis Blanc]].

Rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of [[private property]] and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern [[socialism]] and [[communism]], though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.

In 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]]. Among the more grandiose were the plans of [[Charles Fourier]] and the followers of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – France |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html#p464 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR60qYA?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blanc]] is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html#p9 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR6a1r6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, ''Solution du problème social'', in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' that convinced the young Karl Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title=What is property?|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602060944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other influences on Marx====
Main influences includes [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[materialism]]; [[Giambattista Vico]]; and [[Lewis H. Morgan]].

Marx's revision of [[Hegelianism]] was also influenced by Engels' book  ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.

Marx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially [[Epicurus]] (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis,  ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of liberty.

[[Giambattista Vico]] propounded a [[cyclical theory]] of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stage—called the Age of the Gods—religion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stage—the Age of Men—the people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - Giambattista Vico |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR5SlMg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx drew on [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and his [[social evolution]] theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).

==Friedrich Engels==
{{details|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Engels]] was a co-founder and proponent of [[Marxism]]]]
Friedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, [[Wuppertal]] – August 5, 1895, [[London]]) was a nineteenth-century German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He developed [[Communism|communist]] theory alongside his better-known collaborator, [[Karl Marx]].

In 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread [[poverty]], Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm]).

In July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml Crosby]), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, of whose leaders he met several, including [[George Julian Harney|George Harney]].

Engels actively participated in the [[Revolution of 1848]], taking part in the uprising at [[Elberfeld]]. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the [[Prussia]]ns (June/July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]], who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/german-imperial/ch01.htm]

===Marx and Engels===
Marx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on [[philosophy]] and on [[capitalism]] and decided to work together, producing a number of works including ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[Franz Mehring]]: “The more their thought and their development became one, the more they each remained a separate entity and a man”, in Mehring: ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (1918), Chapter 8 Marx and Engels [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mehring/1918/marx/ch08.htm#s2 2. An Incomparable Alliance]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
Marx's main ideas included:
* [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]]: Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their "human nature" ("''Gattungswesen''", usually translated as "species-essence" or "species-being"). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and in so doing generate alienated labour.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Alienation&lt;/ref&gt; Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism—it is not necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated.
* [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|Base and superstructure]]: Marx and Engels use the “base-structure” concept to explain the idea that the totality of relations among people with regard to “the social production of their existence” forms the economic basis, on which arises a superstructure of political and legal institutions. To the base corresponds the social consciousness which includes religious, philosophical and other main ideas. The base conditions both, the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production causes social revolutions and the resulting change in the economic basis will sooner or later lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See Marx: ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas,
and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this relationship is not a one way process—it is reflexive and the base determines the superstructure in the first instance at the same time as it remains the foundation of a form of social organization which is itself transformed as an element in the overall dialectical process. The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a [[dialectics|dialectical]] one, [[ineffability|ineffable]] in a sense except as it unfolds in its material reality in the actual historical process (which [[scientific socialism]] aims to explain and ultimately to guide).
* [[Class consciousness]]: class consciousness refers to the awareness, both of itself and of the social world around it, that a [[social class]] possesses and its capacity to act in its own rational interests based on this awareness. Thus class consciousness must be attained before the class may mount a successful revolution. However, other methods of revolutionary action have been developed, such as [[vanguardism]].
* [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|Exploitation]]: Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives—in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labor in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.
* [[Historical materialism]]: historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis through economic analysis to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).
* [[Means of production]]: the means of production are a combination of the [[means of labor]] and the [[subject of labor]] used by workers to make products. The means of labor include machines, tools, equipment, infrastructure and "all those things with the aid of which man acts upon the subject of labor, and transforms it".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (1957). xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of labor includes raw materials and materials directly taken from nature. Means of production by themselves produce nothing— [[labour (economics)|labor power]] is needed for production to take place.
* [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|Ideology]]: without offering a general definition for "ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney:
''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx on several instances has used the term to designate the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, “ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces”.&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London July 14, 1893), transl. by Donna Torr, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society as well as its ruling ideas will be determined according to what is in the ruling class's best interests. As Marx said famously in ''The German Ideology'', “the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm  Karl Marx, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create [[false consciousness]] such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital—a degradation of human life).
* [[Mode of production]]: the mode of production is a specific combination of [[productive forces]] (including human the [[means of production]] and [[labour power]], tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials and improved land) and social and technical [[relations of production]] (including the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes).
* [[Political economy]]: the term "political economy" originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy then studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity. Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital and how this manifests itself in economic activity.

===Marx's concept of class===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Marx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).

Marx describes several [[social class]]es in capitalist societies, including primarily:
* The [[proletariat]]: "those individuals who sell their [[labor power]], (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions for the [[bourgeoisie]] to [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the proletariat due to the fact that the worker's [[labor power]] generates an [[Surplus value|added value]] greater than his [[salary]].
* The [[bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy [[labor power]] from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]]ing the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the [[lumpenproletariat]], a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.

Marx also describes the [[communists]] as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]] 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society ([[Vladimir Lenin]] takes this concept a step further by stating that only "professional revolutionaries" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).

===Marx's theory of history===
{{main|Marx's theory of history}}
The Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time—this means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{thermodynamics|cTopic=Processes and Cycles}}
In [[electric power generation]] a '''combined cycle''' is an assembly of [[heat engine]]s that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into [[mechanical energy]], which in turn usually drives [[electrical generator]]s. The principle is that after completing its cycle (in the first engine), the temperature of the [[working fluid]] in the system is still high enough that a second subsequent heat engine extracts energy from the heat that the first engine produced. By combining these multiple streams of work upon a single mechanical shaft turning an electric generator, the overall net efficiency of the system may be increased by 50–60%. (That is, from an overall efficiency of say 34% (in a single cycle) to possibly an overall efficiency of 62% in net [[Carnot cycle|Carnot]] thermodynamic efficiency.)

This can be done because heat engines are only able to use a portion of the energy their fuel generates (usually less than 50%). In an ordinary (non-combined cycle) heat engine the remaining heat (i.e., hot exhaust gas) from combustion is wasted.

Combining two or more thermodynamic cycles results in improved overall efficiency, reducing fuel costs. In stationary power plants, a widely used combination is a [[gas turbine]] (operating by the [[Brayton cycle]]) burning [[natural gas]] or [[synthesis gas]] from [[coal]], whose hot exhaust powers a [[steam power plant]] (operating by the [[Rankine cycle]]). This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve a best-of-class real (HHV - see below) [[thermal efficiency]] of around 62% in base-load operation, in contrast to a single cycle steam power plant which is limited to efficiencies of around 35–42%. Many new gas power plants in North America and Europe are of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine type. Such an arrangement is also used for marine propulsion, and is called a ''[[combined gas and steam]] (COGAS)'' plant. Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles are also common.

Other historically successful combined cycles have used hot cycles with [[mercury vapour turbine]]s, [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]]s or [[molten carbonate fuel cell]]s, with steam plants for the low temperature "bottoming" cycle. Bottoming cycles operating from a steam condenser's heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but uneconomical because of the very large, expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water. However, it is common in cold climates (such as [[Finland]]) to drive community heating systems from a power plant's condenser heat. Such [[cogeneration]] systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.

In automotive and aeronautical engines, turbines have been driven from the exhausts of [[Otto cycle|Otto]] and [[Diesel cycle]]s. These are called [[turbo-compound engine]]s (not to be confused with [[turbocharger]]s).

==Basic combined cycle==
[[File:Basic-cycles.JPG|thumb|right|Topping and bottoming cycles]]

The [[thermodynamic cycle]] of the basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles. One is the Joule or [[Brayton cycle]] which is a [[gas turbine]] cycle and the other is [[Rankine cycle]] which is a [[steam turbine]] cycle.&lt;ref name="yahya"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahya|first=S.M|title=Turbines, compressors and fans|publisher=Tata Mc Graw Hill|pages=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle 1-2-3-4-1 which is the [[gas turbine power plant]] cycle is the topping cycle. It depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in high temperature region.

The cycle a-b-c-d-e-f-a which is the Rankine steam cycle takes place at a low temperature and is known as the bottoming cycle. Transfer of heat energy from high temperature [[exhaust gas]] to water and steam takes place by a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] boiler in the bottoming cycle. During the constant pressure process 4-1 the exhaust gases in the [[gas turbine]] reject heat. The feed water, wet and super heated steam absorb some of this heat in the process a-b, b-c and c-d.

=== Steam generators ===
[[File:Steam-turbines.JPG|thumb|right|Heat transfer from hot gases to water and steam]]
The steam power plant gets its input heat from the high temperature exhaust gases from [[gas turbine]] power plant.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt; The steam generated thus can be used to drive [[steam turbine]]. The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) has 3 sections: Economiser, evaporator and superheater.

== Design principles ==
[[File:Combined cycle animation.ogv|thumb|Explanation of the layout and principle of a combined cycle power generator.]]
[[File:COGES diagram.svg|thumb|right|Working principle of a combined cycle power plant (Legend: 1-Electric generators, 2-Steam turbine, 3-Condenser, 4-Pump, 5-Boiler/heat exchanger, 6-Gas turbine)]]

The efficiency of a heat engine, the fraction of input heat energy that can be converted to useful work, is limited by the temperature difference between the heat entering the engine and the exhaust heat leaving the engine.

In a [[thermal power station]], water is the working medium. High pressure steam requires strong, bulky components. High temperatures require expensive alloys made from [[nickel]] or [[cobalt]], rather than inexpensive [[steel]]. These alloys limit practical steam temperatures to 655&amp;nbsp;°C while the lower temperature of a steam plant is fixed by the temperature of the cooling water. With these limits, a steam plant has a fixed upper efficiency of 35–42%.

An open circuit gas turbine cycle has a [[Gas compressor|compressor]], a [[combustor]] and a [[turbine]]. For gas turbines the amount of metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the firing temperature), is relatively high (900 to 1,400&amp;nbsp;°C). The output temperature of the [[flue gas]] is also high (450 to 650&amp;nbsp;°C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a [[Rankine cycle]]).

In a combined cycle power plant, the heat of the gas turbine's exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) with a [[live steam]] temperature between 420 and 580&amp;nbsp;°C. The condenser of the Rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake, river, sea or [[cooling tower]]s. This temperature can be as low as 15&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Typical size of CCGT plants ===
Plant size is important in the cost of the plant. The larger plant sizes benefit from [[economies of scale]] (lower initial cost per kilowatt) and improved efficiency.

For large-scale power generation, a typical set would be a 270&amp;nbsp;MW primary gas turbine coupled to a 130&amp;nbsp;MW secondary steam turbine, giving a total output of 400&amp;nbsp;MW. A typical power station might consist of between 1 and 6 such sets.

Gas turbines for large-scale power generation are manufactured by at least four separate groups – General Electric, Siemens, Mitsubishi-Hitachi, and Ansaldo Energia. These groups are also developing, testing and/or marketing gas turbine sizes in excess of 300 MW (for 60 Hz applications) and 400 MW (for 50 Hz applications). Combined cycle units are made up of one or more such gas turbines, each with a waste heat steam generator arranged to supply steam to a single or multiple steam turbines, thus forming a combined cycle block or unit. Combined cycle block sizes offered by three major manufacturers (Alstom, General Electric and Siemens) can range anywhere from 50 MW to well over 1300 MW with costs approaching $670/kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/boston/combined-cycle-gas-fired-unit-costs-coming-in-21948694 | title=Combined-cycle, gas-fired unit costs coming in below expectations: Duke &amp;#124; S&amp;P Global Platts| date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unfired boiler ===

The heat recovery boiler is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. Hot gas turbine exhaust enters in [[super heater]] and the [[evaporator]] and then in to economiser section as it flows out from the [[boiler]].
Feed water comes in through the economizer and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit. Finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater. If the temperature of the gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt;

=== Dual pressure boiler===
[[File:Dual-cycle.jpg|thumb|center|Steam turbine plant lay out with dual pressure heat recovery boiler]]

It is often desirable if high heat is recovered from the exiting gases. Hence dual pressure boiler is employed for this purpose.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt;  It has two [[water]]/[[steam]] drums. Low pressure drum is connected to low pressure economizer or evaporator. The low pressure steam is generated in low temperature zone. The low pressure steam is supplied to the low temperature turbine. Super heater can be provided in the low pressure circuit.

Some part of the feed water from the low-pressure zone is transferred to the high-pressure economizer by a booster [[pump]]. This economizer heats up the water to its [[saturation temperature]]. This saturated water goes through the high-temperature zone of the [[boiler]] and is supplied to the high-pressure [[turbine]].
[[File:Unfired-boiler.JPG|thumb|center|Heat exchange in dual pressure heat recovery boiler]]

=== Supplementary firing ===
Supplementary firing may be used in combined cycles (in the HRSG) raising exhaust temperatures from 600&amp;nbsp;°C (GT exhaust) to 800 or even 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Using supplemental firing will however not raise the combined cycle efficiency for most combined cycles. For single boilers it may raise the efficiency if fired to 700–750&amp;nbsp;°C; for multiple boilers however, supplemental firing is often used to improve peak power production of the unit, or to enable higher steam production to compensate for failure of a second unit.

Maximum supplementary firing refers to the maximum fuel that can be fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust. The steam cycle is conventional with reheat and regeneration. Hot gas turbine exhaust is used as the combustion air. Regenerative air preheater is not required. A fresh air fan which makes it possible to operate the steam plant even when the gas turbine is not in operation, increases the availability of the unit.

The use of large supplementary firing in Combined Cycle Systems with high gas turbine inlet temperatures causes the efficiency to drop. For this reason the Combined Cycle Plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today, in comparison to simple Combined Cycle installations. However, they have two advantages that is a) coal can be burned in the steam generator as the supplementary fuel, b) has very good part load efficiency.

The [[Heat recovery steam generator|HRSG]] can be designed with supplementary firing of fuel after the gas turbine in order to increase the quantity or temperature of the steam generated. Without supplementary firing, the efficiency of the combined cycle power plant is higher, but supplementary firing lets the plant respond to fluctuations of electrical load. Supplementary burners are also called ''duct burners''.

More fuel is sometimes added to the turbine's exhaust. This is possible because the turbine exhaust gas (flue gas) still contains some [[oxygen]]. Temperature limits at the gas turbine inlet force the turbine to use excess air, above the optimal [[stoichiometric]] ratio to burn the fuel. Often in gas turbine designs part of the compressed air flow bypasses the burner and is used to cool the turbine blades.

Supplementary firing raises the temperature of the exhaust gas from 800 to 900 degree Celsius. Relatively high flue gas temperature raises the condition of steam (84 bar, 525 degree Celsius) thereby improving the efficiency of steam cycle.

== Fuel for combined cycle power plants ==

Combined cycle plants are usually powered by [[natural gas]], although [[fuel oil]], [[synthesis gas]] or other fuels can be used. The supplementary fuel may be natural gas, fuel oil, or coal. [[Biofuel]]s can also be used. Integrated [[solar energy|solar]] combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (look [[Integrated solar combined cycle|ISCC section]]). Next generation nuclear power plants are also on the drawing board which will take advantage of the higher temperature range made available by the Brayton top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.

The improvement in [[shale gas]] extraction has increased natural gas supplies and reserves dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this fact, it is becoming the fuel of choice for an increasing amount of private investors and consumers because it is more versatile than coal or oil and can be used in 90% of energy applications. Chile which once depended on hydro-power for 70% of its electricity supply, is now boosting its gas supplies to reduce reliance on its drought afflicted hydro dams. Similarly China is tapping its gas reserves to reduce reliance on coal, which is currently burned to generate 80% of the country's electricity supply.

Where the extension of a gas pipeline is impractical or cannot be economically justified, electricity needs in remote areas can be met with small-scale Combined Cycle Plants, using renewable fuels.
Instead of natural gas, Combined Cycle Plants can be filled with biogas derived from agricultural and forestry waste, which is often readily available in rural areas.

===Low-grade fuel for turbines===
Gas turbines burn mainly natural gas and light oil. Crude oil, residual, and some distillates contain corrosive components and as such require fuel treatment equipment. In addition, ash deposits from these fuels result in gas turbine deratings of up to 15%. They may still be economically attractive fuels however, particularly in combined-cycle plants.

Sodium and potassium are removed from residual, crude and heavy distillates by a water washing procedure. A simpler and less expensive purification system will do the same job for light crude and light distillates. A magnesium additive system may also be needed to reduce the corrosive effects if vanadium is present. Fuels requiring such treatment must have a separate fuel-treatment plant and a system of accurate fuel monitoring to assure reliable, low-maintenance operation of gas turbines.

== Configuration ==
A single shaft combined cycle plant comprises a gas turbine and a steam turbine driving a common generator. In a multi-shaft combined cycle plant, each gas turbine and each steam turbine has its own generator. The single shaft design provides slightly less initial cost and slightly better efficiency than if the gas and steam turbines had their own generators. The multi-shaft design enables two or more gas turbines to operate in conjunction with a single steam turbine, which can be more economical than a number of single shaft units.

The primary disadvantage of single shaft combined cycle power plants is that the number of steam turbines, condensers and condensate systems – and perhaps the number of cooling towers and circulating water systems – increases to match the number of gas turbines. For a multi-shaft combined cycle power plant there is only one steam turbine, condenser and the rest of the heat sink for up to three gas turbines; only their size increases. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale. A larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle. Thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft combined cycle power plant or a multiple shaft combined cycle power plant is more economical.

The combined-cycle system includes single-shaft and multi-shaft configurations. The single-shaft system consists of one gas turbine, one steam turbine, one generator and one Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), with the gas turbine and steam turbine coupled to the single generator in a tandem arrangement on a single shaft. Key advantages of the single-shaft arrangement are operating simplicity, smaller footprint, and lower startup cost. Single-shaft arrangements, however, will tend to have less flexibility and equivalent reliability than multi-shaft blocks. Additional operational flexibility is provided with a steam turbine which can be disconnected, using a synchro-self-shifting (SSS) Clutch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssclutch.com/howitworks/100-2SSSPrinciples.pdf|title=SSS Clutch Operating Principle|publisher=SSS Gears Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine.

Multi-shaft systems have one or more gas turbine-generators and HRSGs that supply steam through a common header to a separate single steam turbine-generator. In terms of overall investment a multi-shaft system is about 5% higher in costs.

Single- and multiple-pressure non-reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems equipped with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 540&amp;nbsp;°C or less. Selection of a single- or multiple-pressure steam cycle for a specific application is determined by economic evaluation which considers plant installed cost, fuel cost and quality, plant duty cycle, and operating and maintenance cost.

Multiple-pressure reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;°C.

The most efficient power generation cycles are those with unfired HRSGs with modular pre-engineered components. These unfired steam cycles are also the lowest in cost. Supplementary-fired combined-cycle systems are provided for specific application.

The primary regions of interest for cogeneration combined-cycle systems are those with unfired and supplementary fired steam cycles. These systems provide a wide range of thermal energy to electric power ratio and represent the range of thermal energy capability and power generation covered by the product line for thermal energy and power systems.

== Efficiency of CCGT plants ==

By combining both gas and steam cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. 
The efficiency of the cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. 
So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the [[waste heat]] temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. 
This large range means that the [[Carnot efficiency]] of the cycle is high. 
The actual efficiency, while lower than the Carnot efficiency, is still higher than that of either plant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm "Efficiency by the Numbers"] by Lee S. Langston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/the-difference-between-lcv-and-hcv-or-lower-and-higher-heating-value-or-net-and-gross-is-clearly-understood-by-all-energy-engineers-there-is-no-right-or-wrong-definition.html|title=The difference between LCV and HCV (or Lower and Higher Heating Value, or Net and Gross) is clearly understood by all energy engineers. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' definition.|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric efficiency of a combined cycle power station, if calculated as electric energy produced as a percentage of the [[lower heating value]] of the fuel consumed, can be over 60% when operating new, i.e. unaged, and at continuous output which are ideal conditions. 
As with single cycle thermal units, combined cycle units may also deliver low temperature heat energy for industrial processes, [[district heating]] and other uses. This is called [[cogeneration]] and such power plants are often referred to as a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.

In general, combined cycle efficiencies in service are over 50% on a [[lower heating value]] and Gross Output basis. 
Most combined cycle units, especially the larger units, have peak, steady-state efficiencies on the LHV basis of 55 to 59%. 
Research aimed at {{convert|1370|C|F}} turbine inlet temperature has led to even more efficient combined cycles and nearly 60% LHV efficiency (54% HHV efficiency) has been reached in the combined cycle unit of [[Baglan Bay power station|Baglan Bay]], a GE H-technology gas turbine with a NEM 3 pressure reheat boiler, using steam from the HRSG to cool the turbine blades. 

In May 2011 [[Siemens AG]] announced they had achieved a 60.75% net efficiency with a 578 megawatts SGT5-8000H gas turbine at the [[Irsching Power Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2011/fossil_power_generation/efp201105064.htm |title= Siemens pushes world record in efficiency to over 60% while achieving maximum operating flexibility |publisher= [[Siemens AG]] |date= 19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Electric]] 9HA was billed to attain 41.5% simple cycle efficiency and 61.4% in combined cycle mode, with a gas turbine output of 397 MW to 470 MW and a combined output of 592 MW to 701 MW. 
Its firing temperature is between {{convert|2600|and|2900|°F|°C}}, its [[overall pressure ratio]] is 21.8 to 1 and is used by [[Électricité de France]] in [[Bouchain]]. On April 28, 2016, this plant was certified by Guinness World Records as the worlds most efficient combined cycle power plant at 62.22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/431420-most-efficient-combined-cycle-power-plant | title=Most efficient combined cycle power plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Chubu Electric]]’s [[Nishi-ku, Nagoya]] power plant 405 MW 7HA is expected to have 62% gross combined cycle efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Air-cooled 7HA and 9HA designs rated at over 61% CC efficiency |publisher= Gas Turbine World |date= April 2014 |url= http://www.gasturbineworld.com/ge-7ha.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For 2018, GE offers its 826 MW HA at over 64% efficiency in combined cycle due to advances in [[additive manufacturing]] and combustion breakthroughs, up from 63.7% in 2017 orders and on track to achieve 65% by the early 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ha-technology-now-available-industry-first-64-percent-efficiency-284144 |title= HA technology now available at industry-first 64 percent efficiency |date= December 4, 2017 |publisher= GE Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2017, [[Mitsubishi]] claims a LHV efficiency of greater than 63% for some members of its J Series turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpshq.com/j-series.html Record-Breaking Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference between HHV and LHV===
{{or section|date=January 2018}}
To avoid confusion, the efficiency of heat engines and power stations should be stated relative to the Higher Heating Value (HHV) or Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, to include or exclude the heat that can be obtained from condensing the flue gas. It should also be specified whether Gross output at the generator terminals or Net Output at the power station fence is being considered.

The LHV figure is NOT a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input; it is 11% higher than that. The HHV figure is a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input. If the LHV approach were used for some new condensing boilers, the efficiency would calculate to be over 100%. Manufacturers prefer to cite the higher LHV efficiency, e.g. 60%, for a new CCGT, but utilities, when calculated how much electricity the plant will generate, divide this by 1.11 to get the real, e.g. 54%, HHV efficiency of that CCGT. Coal plant efficiencies are computed on a HHV basis (it doesn't make nearly as much difference for coal burn, as for gas).

The difference between HHV and LHV for gas, can be estimated (using USA units) by 1055Btu/Lb * w, where w is the lbs of water after combustion per lb of fuel. To convert the HHV of natural gas, which is 23875 Btu/lb, to an LHV (methane is 25% hydrogen) would be: 23875 – (1055*0.25*18/2) = 21500. Because the efficiency is determined by dividing the energy output by the input, and the input on an LHV basis is smaller than the HHV basis, the overall efficiency on an LHV basis is higher. So, using the ratio: 23875/21500 = 1.11 you can convert the HHV to an LHV.

So a real best-of-class baseload CCGT efficiency of 54%, as experienced by the utility operating the plant, translates to 60% LHV as the manufacturer's published headline CCGT efficiency.

===Boosting efficiency===

The efficiency of CCGT and GT can be boosted by pre-cooling combustion air. This is practised in hot climates and also has the effect of increasing power output. This is achieved by evaporative cooling of water using a moist matrix placed in front of the turbine, or by using [[Ice storage air conditioning]]. The latter has the advantage of greater improvements due to the lower temperatures available. Furthermore, ice storage can be used as a means of load control or load shifting since ice can be made during periods of low power demand and, potentially in the future the anticipated high availability of other resources such as renewables during certain periods.

The largest part of produced [[syngas]] (about 75%) is directed into the [[combustion chamber]] of the [[Gas turbine|gas-turbine]] cycle to generate power, but another part of [[syngas]] (about 25%) is withdrawn from the power generation cycle as [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or their blend to produce chemicals, fertilizers, [[synthetic fuel]]s, and etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Safonov, M.Granovskii, S.Pozharskii|first=|date=1993|title=Thermodynamic efficiency of co-generation of energy and hydrogen in gas-turbine cycle of methane oxidation.|url=|journal=Doklady Akademii Nauk (Rossii), 328(1993) 202-204|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Granovskii, M.Safonov, S.Pozharskii|first=|date=2002|title=Integrated Scheme of Natural Gas Usage with Minimum Production of Entropy.|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 80(2002)998-1001|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Granovskii, M.Safonov|first=|date=2003|title=New Integrated Scheme of the Closed Gas-Turbine Cycle with Synthesis Gas Production.|url=|journal=Chemical Engineering Science, 58(2003)3913-3921|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] benefit owing to this modification is substantiated by [[exergy]] analysis. There are numerous technological options to separate [[syngas]] from working fluid and withdraw it from the cycle (e.g., condensing vapors and removing liquids, taking out gases and vapors by [[Membrane gas separation|membrane]] and [[pressure swing adsorption]] separation, [[amine gas treating]], and [[glycol dehydration]]).

All the environmental advantages of semi-closed [[gas turbine]] cycles as to an absence of [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] and the release of non-diluted [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the flue gas stay the same. An effect of integration becomes apparent with the following clarification. Assigning the efficiency of [[syngas]] production in the integrated cycle a value equal to a regular [[syngas]] production efficiency through [[Steam methane reforming|steam-methane reforming]] (some part of [[methane]] is combusted to drive [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reforming), the net-power generation efficiency (with accounting for the consumed electricity required to separate [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]]) can reach levels higher than 60% &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; at a maximum [[temperature]] in the cycle (at the [[gas turbine]] inlet) of about 1300&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The [[natural gas]] integrated cycle with adiabatic catalytic reactor was firstly proposed at Chemistry Department of Moscow State Lomonosov University (Russia) in Prof. M. Safonov (late) group by M. Safonov,[http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-granovskiy M. Granovskii], and S. Pozharskii in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)==
{{Main|integrated gasification combined cycle}}
An [[integrated gasification combined cycle]], or IGCC, is a power plant using synthesis gas ([[syngas]]). Syngas can be produced from a number of sources, including coal and biomass. The system uses gas and steam turbines, the steam turbine operating off of the heat left over from the gas turbine. This process can raise electricity generation efficiency to around 50%.

==Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)==
An '''Integrated Solar Combined Cycle''' ('''ISCC''') is a hybrid technology in which a [[solar energy|solar thermal]] field is integrated within a combined cycle plant. In ISCC plants, solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply, supporting the steam cycle, which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/plantas_hibridas/ Integrated solar combined cycle plants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011857/http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/plantas_hibridas/ |date=2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic benefits are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/fossil-fuels-solar-energy-the-future-of-electricity-generation/|title=Fossil Fuels + Solar Energy = The Future of Electricity Generation|publisher=POWER magazine|date=2009-01-04|accessdate=2017-12-25|page=1 (paragraph 7)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major factors limiting the load output of a combined cycle power plant are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine and the heat recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/pool/hq/energy-topics/pdfs/en/combined-cycle-power-plants/OperationalFlexibilityEnhancementsofCombinedCyclePowerPlants.pdf Operational Flexibility Enhancements of Combined Cycle Power Plants p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic benefits are that the solar components costs are 25% to 75% those of a [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] plant of the same collector surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/pdfs/kelly_isccs_analysis.pdf Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925233557/http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/pdfs/kelly_isccs_analysis.pdf |date=2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automotive use ==
Combined cycles have traditionally only been used in large power plants. [[BMW]], however, has proposed that automobiles [[turbosteamer|use exhaust heat to drive steam turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2005/12/09/bmw-turbosteamer-gets-hot-and-goes/ "BMW Turbosteamer gets hot and goes"] by John Neff, AutoBlog, December 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This can even be connected to the car or truck's cooling system to save space and weight, but also to provide a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] in the same location as the radiator and preheating of the water using heat from the [[engine block]].

It may be possible to use the pistons in a reciprocating engine for both combustion and steam expansion as in the [[Six-stroke engine#Crower six-stroke engine|Crower engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060227/FREE/302270007/1023/THISWEEKSISSUE "Inside Bruce Crower's Six-Stroke Engine"] By Pete Lyons, AutoWeek, February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A turbocharged car is also a combined cycle. Bowman of Southampton offer a commercially proven add-on turbocharger which additionally can generate electric power lowering overall fuel consumption by about 8%.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

== Aeromotive use ==
Some versions of the [[Wright R-3350]] were produced as [[turbo-compound engine]]s. Three turbines driven by exhaust gases, known as ''power recovery turbines'' (unofficially "parts recovery turbines" because they ate exhaust valves on a regular basis) provided nearly 600&amp;nbsp;hp at takeoff. These turbines added power to the engine crankshaft through bevel gears and fluid couplings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.air-and-space.com/20020811%20Camarillo%20page%201.htm|title=Goleta Air and Space Museum: 2002 Camarillo EAA Fly-in|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many successful [[turbo-compound engine]] designs particularly for aircraft but their mechanical complexity and weight are less economical than multistage [[turbine engine]]s. [[Stirling engines]] are also a good theoretical fit for this application.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[File:Chris Knight in 2016.jpg|thumb|Chris Knight in 2016]]
'''''Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics''''' is a 2016 book by the left-wing activist and linguistic anthropologist [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] on [[Noam Chomsky]]'s approach to science and politics. Knight admires Chomsky's politics, but argues that his linguistic theories were influenced in damaging ways by his immersion since the early 1950s in an intellectual culture heavily dominated by US military priorities, an immersion deepened when he secured employment in a Pentagon-funded electronics laboratory in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;Letters, ''London Review of Books'', July 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Chomsky dismissed the book, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was based on a false assumption since, in fact, no military "work was being done on campus" during his time at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;''Noam Chomsky and the Bicycle Theory.'' Sam Tanenhaus interviews Noam Chomsky. ''The New York Times'', October 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent public comment, Chomsky on similar grounds denounced Knight's entire narrative as a "wreck ... complete nonsense throughout".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sam Fenn interviews Chris Knight and Noam Chomsky responds. ''Chomsky's Carburetor.'' Cited Podcast. http://citedpodcast.com/23-chomskys-carburetor/&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a reviewer for the US ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' described Knight's book as perhaps "the most in-depth meditation on 'the Chomsky problem' ever published".&lt;ref&gt;''The Chomsky Puzzle. Piecing together a celebrity scientist'', by Tom Bartlett. ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' August 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the ''New Scientist'' described Knight's account as "trenchant and compelling".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230980-800-the-value-of-everything-getting-radical-about-research/''New Scientist,'' November 2, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy continued in the ''London Review of Books'', where the sociologist of science [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] cited Knight's book approvingly, provoking Chomsky to denounce what he called "Knight's astonishing performance" in two subsequent letters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n09/jackson-lears/mysterian Letters], ''London Review of Books'', June 1; June 15; July 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has continued in the pages of Open Democracy.

Since the book was published, Knight has published evidence that Chomsky worked on a military sponsored "command and control" project for the [[MITRE Corporation]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html "When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky's Linguistics for their Weapons Systems"], 3 Quarks Daily, 12 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The argument ==
[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky in 2017]]

Knight's book begins with Chomsky's claim that his political and scientific outputs have little connection with each other. For example, asked in 2006 whether his science and his politics are related, Chomsky replied that the connection is "almost non-existent ... There is a kind of loose, abstract connection in the background. But if you look for practical connections, they're non-existent."&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', p. 248, n. 20, citing ''Irish Times'', January 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight accepts that scientific research and political involvement are distinct kinds of activity serving very different purposes. But he claims that, in Chomsky's case, the conflicts intrinsic to his institutional situation forced him to drive an unusually deep and damaging wedge between his politics and his science.

Knight points out that Chomsky began his career working in an electronics laboratory whose primary technological mission he detested on moral and political grounds. Funded by the Pentagon, the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT was involved in contributing to the basic research required for hi-tech weapons systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xi, citing 'Tri-Services Honor MIT Achievements in Military Electronics R&amp;D', ''Army Research and Development News Magazine,'' Vol. 12 no.4, July-August 1971, p 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting that he was well aware of MIT's role at the time, Chomsky himself recalls: {{quotation|"There was extensive [military] research on the MIT campus. ... In fact, a good deal of the [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus and in laboratories run by the university."&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xiv, citing {{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N.|title=Language and Politics|date=2004|publisher=AK Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1-902593-82-0|page=216|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

It was because of his anti-militarist conscience, Knight argues, that such research priorities were experienced by him as deeply troubling. By way of evidence, Knight cites this correspondence from ''The New York Review of Books'' in 1967:

{{quotation| '''[[George Steiner]]''': "Will Noam Chomsky announce that he will stop teaching at MIT or anywhere in this country so long as torture and napalm go on? ... Will he even resign from a university very largely implicated in the kind of 'strategic studies' he so rightly scorns?"

'''Noam Chomsky''': "I have given a good bit of thought to the specific suggestions that you put forth... leaving the country or resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university, associated with activities of the department of 'defense.' ... As to MIT, I think that its involvement in the war effort is tragic and indefensible."&lt;ref&gt;Abbreviated in ''Decoding Chomsky'', p. 37; citing full text in ''The New York Review of Books'', March 23, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Chomsky's situation at MIT, according to Knight, is summed up by Chomsky when he describes some of his colleagues this way:

{{quotation| "It is appalling that a person can come through an MIT education and say the kinds of things that were quoted in the ''New York Times'' article on Sunday, November 9 [1969]... One student said, right along straight Nazi scientist lines: '''What I'm designing may one day be used to kill millions of people. I don't care. That's not my responsibility. I'm given an interesting technological problem and I get enjoyment out of solving it.''' You know perfectly well that we can name twenty faculty members who've said the same thing. ... This is an attitude that is very widely held and very widely expressed."&lt;ref&gt;Abbreviated in ''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xviii, citing full text in Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Democracy and Education.'' Edited by C. P. Otero, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Chomsky, then, apparently felt that a number of his colleagues were no better than Nazi scientists. In order to maintain his moral and political integrity, Knight argues, Chomsky resolved to limit his cooperation to pure linguistic theory of such an abstract kind that it could not conceivably have any military use.

With this aim in mind, Chomsky's theoretical modelling became so abstract that not even language's practical function in social communication could be acknowledged or explored. One damaging consequence, according to Knight, was that scientific investigation of the ways in which real human beings use language became divorced from what quickly became the prevailing MIT school of formal linguistic theory.

Knight argues that the conflicting pressures Chomsky experienced had the effect of splitting his intellectual output in two, prompting him to ensure that any work he conducted for the military was purely theoretical—of no practical use to anyone—while his activism, being directed relentlessly ''against'' the military, was preserved free of any obvious connection with his science.

To an unprecedented extent, according to Knight, mind in this way became divorced from body, thought from action, and knowledge from its practical applications, these disconnects characterizing a philosophical paradigm which came to dominate much of intellectual life for half a century across the Western world.

== Reception ==

Knight's book has been both criticised and acclaimed by wide variety of commentators.

===Negative===


* '''[[Norbert Hornstein]]''' and '''Nathan Robinson''' dismiss the book as betraying a complete misunderstanding of Chomsky's linguistic theories and beliefs. They question the motives of Yale University Press, asking why Yale considered it appropriate to publish Knight's critique, which they say attacks Chomsky through political conjecture rather than addressing his linguistic or political ideas. Comparing Knight's Marxist criticism to a conservative criticism that was released in the same year by Tom Wolfe, they speculate that both were published with similar motivations - that Chomsky's criticisms were a threat to the power behind the publishers.(''Current Affairs'').&lt;ref name="currentaffairs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/12/thousand-ways-to-misrepresent-noam-chomsky|title=1000 Ways To Misrepresent Noam Chomsky |work=Current Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Robert Barsky]]''' argues that since Knight was never formally trained in Chomsky's conception of theoretical linguistics, he has no right to comment on whether it stands up as science. ''Decoding Chomsky,'' claims Barsky, offers no original insights, consisting only of "a weak rehash of critiques from naysayers to Chomsky's approach". While Barsky concedes that Chomsky did work in a military laboratory, he argues that this cannot be significant since virtually all US scientists receive Pentagon funding one way or another.

* '''Peter Stone''' claims that  Knight hates Chomsky and "for that reason, he wrote ''Decoding Chomsky'' – a nasty, mean-spirited, vitriolic, ideologically-driven hatchet job". Stone states that, although Knight is on the Left, "the level of venom on display here exceeds that of all but the most unhinged of Chomsky’s detractors on the Right." He goes   to state that "Knight spares no opportunity to paint Chomsky’s every thought and deed in the blackest possible terms" and that: "''Decoding Chomsky'' is not a critique of a body of work in linguistics; it is an attempt to demonise a man for his perceived political deviations, even though that man happens to be on the same side of the political spectrum as the man who is demonising him. Reading ''Decoding Chomsky'' taught me something about the mindset of the prosecutors in the Moscow Show Trials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/127/Decoding_Chomsky_by_Chris_Knight|title=Book Review // Decoding Chomsky |work=Philosophy Now|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Wolfgang Sperlich''' targets Knight's explanation for the so-called "Chomsky problem", the supposedly striking disconnect between Chomsky the activist (working against the military) and Chomsky the scientist (working in a military lab). According to Sperlich, Knight insinuates that Chomsky was willing "to sell his soul for a fat salary package". Sperlich responds: "What does Chris Knight want from him? That he dress in rags and live in a hovel?" Sperlich claims that at no point did Chomsky collude with any of the Pentagon's plans to make use of his research.

==Further research on Chomsky at MIT==
[[File:SAGE control room.png|right|thumb| Preparing for nuclear war: the SAGE air defense system—MITRE's first command and control project.]]

In his book, Knight points out that the US military initially funded Chomsky's linguistics because they were interested in machine translation. Later their focus shifted and Knight cites Air Force Colonel Edmund Gaines’ statement that: "We sponsored linguistic research in order to learn how to build command and control systems that could understand English queries directly."&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', pp. 53–72 and 16, citing Frederick Newmeyer, ''The Politics of Linguistics'', Chicago 1986, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book review, Robert Barsky poses the crucial question not answered in Knight's book: "Machine Translation research is turned into a project dedicated to 'command and control systems'. Really? And how did Chomsky contribute to that MT project?"

Since finishing ''Decoding Chomsky'', Knight has found apparently compelling evidence shedding light on this question. It appears that between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky worked as a "consultant" on an Air Force project to establish English as an "operational language for command and control". This is confirmed by several of Chomsky's students at the time, who also worked on this military project.

According to one of these former students, [[Barbara Partee]], the Air Force's justification for sponsoring Chomsky's approach to linguistics was "that in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program."&lt;ref&gt;C. Knight, [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html "When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky's Linguistics for their Weapons Systems"], ''3 Quarks Daily'', March 12, 2018 (citing Arnold Zwicky, [https://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/grammars-of-number-theory.pdf "Grammars of Number Theory: Some Examples"], Working Paper W-6671, MITRE Corp., 1963, Foreword, last page).

In 1971, a former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, wrote: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop ... languages for computer operations in military command and control systems." A. Debons, "Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact", in F. Alt and M. Rubinoff, ''Advances in Computers'', Vol.11, 1971. New York/London 1971, p354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Materials''' at the [[University of Oxford]], England was founded in the 1950s as the ''Department of Metallurgy'', by [[William Hume-Rothery]], who was a reader in Oxford's Department of [[Inorganic chemistry|Inorganic Chemistry]]. It is part of the university's [[Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division]]  

Around 250 people work in the Department of Materials full-time, including professors, lecturers, independent fellows, researchers and support staff. There are around 30 academic staff positions of which four are Chairs.

The [[Isaac Wolfson]] Chair in [[Metallurgy]] was set up in the late 1950s and remains one of the most important professorships in British materials science. Professor [[Sir Peter Hirsch]] formerly held the chair. The current holder of the chair is [[Peter Bruce]] [[Royal Society#Fellows|FRS]]. Other Chairs in the Department include the Vesuvius Chair of Materials held by Patrick Grant FREng, Professor in the Physical Examination of Materials formerly held by [[David Cockayne]] FRS and the James Martin Chair in Energy Materials held by James Marrow.

Oxford Materials is a research intensive department, achieving 6* status in a research assessment exercise. World leading research is done in the broad fields of structural and nuclear materials, device materials, polymers and biomaterials, nanomaterials, processing and manufacturing, characterization, and computational materials modelling.

The Department offers undergraduate degrees in ''[[Materials Science]]'' and ''Materials, Economics and Management'', having around 100 undergraduates, and around 75 postgraduate students, particularly DPhil students pursuing advanced research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/caz/mate.shtml Materials: Oxford University Graduate Studies Prospectus]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its own buildings, the Department shares 7 buildings with the [[Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford|Department of Engineering Science]] on a triangular plot with [[Banbury Road]] to the west and [[Parks Road]] to the east. In addition, the Department has extensive, large-scale facilities at [[Begbroke Science Park]], north of the city.

==History==

The Department of Metallurgy was founded in the mid 1950s by Professor Hume-Rothery. In the early 1950s, Hume-Rothery was a Reader in Metallurgy in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, and Metallurgy was taught as an option in the Chemistry degree. In rapid succession, during the second half of the 1950s, the Wolfson Chair in Metallurgy was established, Hume-Rothery was appointed as the first Wolfson Professor, an independent Department of Metallurgy was set up with a grant from the General Board, a separate final honours school in Metallurgy was established, the first students entered the course in 1960. The department was initially housed in a hut in Keble Road, until new accommodation, the Hume-Rothery building was completed in 1960. Since then, the department has gradually expanded into a total of almost 8,000 sq m, distributed over 7 buildings in the Keble Road Triangle, just north of the city centre. In December 1999, it acquired another 6,500 sq m, distributed over more than 10 buildings at the (subsequently renamed) Oxford University Begbroke Science Park (OUBSP), 5 miles away, just north of the ring road, half occupied by the departments industry-linked research, and half occupied by high-tech spin-out materials related companies.

At first the Metallurgy course was heavily based on Chemistry, but gradually the Chemistry input decreased, and it is now quite small. The Metallurgy degree was substantially revamped in the late 1960s, following Professor Hume-Rotherys retirement. At that time the course and the department were both renamed Metallurgy and the Science of Materials (MSOM). The degree was again substantially revamped in the mid-1990s, following Professor Hirschs retirement. At this time the department was renamed Materials and the course was renamed Materials Science in 2001.

A second degree course in Metallurgy, Economics and Management, later renamed Materials, Economics and Management (MEM) was introduced in the mid 1970s in response to the government’s Dainton report, which was aimed at increasing management studies at UK universities. MEM was effectively an option within MSOM and the two degrees shared a common intake and common first year teaching. A third degree, Engineering and Materials (EMS) was introduced in the late 1980s in response to another government initiative, in this case designed to enhance technology teaching at UK universities. EMS was effectively an option within Engineering, sharing a common intake and common first year teaching with the three other Engineering degrees available at Oxford. The EMS course was phased out mid-2000s and the MEM course was phased out in the mid-2010s.

'''Directoire style''', {{IPA-fr|di.ʁɛk.twaʁ}}, describes a period in the decorative arts, fashion, and especially furniture design, concurrent with the post-Revolution [[French Directory]] (November 2, 1795 through November 10, 1799). The style uses [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] and [[Empire style|Empire]].

The Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers [[Charles Percier]] (1764–1838) and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pier François Léonard Fontaine]] (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate [[Empire style]], which was introduced after [[Napoleon]] established the [[First French Empire]].

The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of [[Roman Republic|republican Rome]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David.... In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/noinclude&gt;'''Environmental niche modelling''', alternatively known as '''species distribution modelling''', '''(ecological) niche modelling''', '''predictive habitat distribution modelling''', and '''climate envelope modelling''' refers to the process of using [[computer]] [[algorithm]]s to predict the distribution of species in [[geography|geographic]] space on the basis of a mathematical representation of their known distribution in [[Natural environment|environmental]] space (= realized [[ecological niche]]). The environment is in most cases represented by climate data (such as temperature, and precipitation), but other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover can also be used. These models allow for interpolating between a limited number of species occurrence and they are used in several research areas in [[conservation biology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]].

The extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], geologic history, or [[biotic interaction]]s, that increase the difference between the [[realized niche]] and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of [[biodiversity informatics]].

== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==
Environmental niche models are in origin correlative models. Given a handful of geographically-referred observed presences of a species and climate maps, they find the most likely environmental ranges where a species lives. For these algorithms to be effective, it is required to also gather observations of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often "random background" or "pseudo-absence" data are used to fit these models. Disagreement in the literature exists over whether environmental niche models portray the [[realized niche]], which is the environments where a species '''is''' found or the [[fundamental niche]], which is where a species '''can''' be found, that is, where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival of a species. If there are incomplete records of the occurrences of a species, there is a bias introduced by pseudo-absences, or the species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitations, environmental niche models might often reflect the [[realized niche]] instead of the [[fundamental niche]].

In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic (or process-based) models assess the bio-physiological aspects of a species to generate the conditions in which the species can ideally persist, based on observations made in controlled field or laboratory studies. As such it aims at modelling the fundamental niche of the species. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=X.|author2=Thuiller|title=Comparing niche- and process-based models to reduce prediction uncertainty in species range shifts under climate change.|journal=Ecology|year=2009|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1301–13|doi=10.1890/08-0134.1|pmid=19537550}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a comparison between mechanistic and correlative models.

== Niche modelling algorithms ==
Niche modelling algorithms include "profile methods", simple statistical techniques that use e.g. environmental distance to known sites such as [http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/publications/software/anuclim/doc/bioclim.html BIOCLIM],&lt;ref name="Nix1986a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nix HA|year=1986|title=BIOCLIM — a Bioclimatic Analysis and Prediction System|journal=Research report, CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources|volume=1983–1985|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nix1986b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nix HA|editor=Longmore|title=Atlas of Elapid Snakes of Australia. Australian Flora and Fauna Series 7|publisher=Bureau of Flora and Fauna, Canberra|year=1986|pages=4–15|chapter=A biogeographic analysis of Australian elapid snakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOMAIN; "regression" (e.g. forms of generalized linear models); and "[[machine learning]]" methods such as [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy]] (MAXENT).  An incomplete list of algorithms that have been used for niche modelling includes:

===Profile techniques===
*[[BIOCLIM]]
*[[DOMAIN]]
*[[Ecological Niche Factor Analysis]] (ENFA)
*[[Mahalanobis distance]]

===Regression-based techniques===
*[[Generalized linear model]] (GLM)
*[[Generalized Additive Model]] (GAM)
*[[Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines]] (MARS)

===Machine learning techniques===
*[[MAXENT]]
*[[Artificial Neural Networks]] (ANN)
*[[Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production]] (GARP)
*[[Boosted Regression Trees]] (BRT)/Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
*[[Random Forest]] (RF)
*[[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM)

Furthermore, [[ensemble models]] can be created from several model outputs to create a model that captures components of each.  Often the mean or median value across several models is used as an ensemble.  Similarly, [[consensus models]] are models that fall closest to some measure of central tendency of all models—consensus models can be individual model runs or ensembles of several models.

'''Environmental vegetarianism''' is the practice of [[vegetarianism]] or eating a [[plant-based diet]] based on the indications that animal-based industries are environmentally destructive or [[sustainable development|unsustainable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/weekinreview/27bittman.html|title=Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler|first=Mark|last=Bittman|date=27 January 2008|access-date=8 November 2017|publisher=The New York Times|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary environmental concerns with animal products are [[pollution]]—including [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (GHG)—[[deforestation]], and the use of resources such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[Water crisis|water]], and land.

==Environmental impact of animal products==
{{Main article|Environmental impact of meat production}}[[File:Sources of dietary energy-consumtion (%) 2001-2003 (FAO).svg|thumb|400px|right|According to an [[FAO]] report, the predicted increase in [[animal product]] consumption by people living in [[Developing country|developing countries]] will bring new challenges to global [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/documents/pdf/sources_of_dietary_energy_consumption.pdf|title=FAOSTAT|website=faostat.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673609617530 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0 | volume=374 | issue=9706 | title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture | journal=The Lancet | pages=2016–2025 | year=2009 | last1 = Friel | first1 = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to animal products range from 18% to 51% of total global emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/study-claims-meat-creates-half-of-all-greenhouse-gases-1812909.html|title=Study claims meat creates half of all greenhouse gases|date=1 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=November 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=E10301–E10308 | last1 = White | first1 = Robin R. | last2 = Beth Hall | first2 = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in the journal ''[[Carbon Balance and Management]]'' found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wolf|first1=Julie|last2=Asrar |first2=Ghassem R. |last3= West|first3=Tristram O.|date=September 29, 2017 |title=Revised methane emissions factors and spatially distributed annual carbon fluxes for global livestock|url=https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y|journal=[[Carbon Balance and Management]]|volume=12 |issue=16 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in ''Climate Change'' concluded "if ... average diets among UK adults conformed to WHO recommendations, their associated GHG emissions would be reduced by 17 %. Further GHG emission reductions of around 40% could be achieved by making realistic modifications to diets so that they contain fewer animal products and processed snacks and more fruit, vegetables and cereals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1329-y#/page-1 | doi=10.1007/s10584-015-1329-y | volume=129 | title=The potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK through healthy and realistic dietary change | journal=Climatic Change | pages=253–265 | year=2015 | last1 = Green | first1 = Rosemary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2006 [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) report ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', animal agriculture contributes on a "massive scale" to [[global warming]], air pollution, [[land degradation]], energy use, [[deforestation]], and [[biodiversity]] decline.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{Citation |last= Steinfeld|first= Henning|last2= Gerber|first2= Pierre|last3= Wassenaar|first3= Tom|last4= Castel|first4= Vincent|last5= Rosales|first5= Mauricio|last6= de Haan|first6= Cees|year= 2006|title= Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|publisher= FAO|publication-place= Rome|page= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/climatechange/doc/FAO%20report%20executive%20summary.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO report estimates that the [[livestock]] (including poultry) sector (which provides draft animal power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc., in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] equivalents. This estimate was based on [[life-cycle analysis]], including feed production, land use changes, etc., and used GWP ([[global warming potential]]) of  23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. The FAO report concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global".&lt;ref name=FAO /&gt;

Some sources{{Citation needed|reason=Which sources?|date=May 2016}} disagree with some of the figures used in arriving at the FAO estimate of 18 percent. For example, the FAO report estimates that 37 percent of global anthropogenic [[methane emissions]] are attributable to the livestock sector, and a [[NASA]] summary indicates about 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Augenbraun, H.|author2=E. Mathews|author3=D. Sarma|year=1997|title=The global methane cycle|url=http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/methane/intro/cycle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the GWP multiplier used, such a difference between estimates will have a large effect on an estimate of GHG CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents contributed by the livestock sector. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. This estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA. 2011. Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990-2009. United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- INCORRECT NUMBER, DATA IS ON PP 22-23. CALCULATION NEEDED: (SUM OF MEAT PRODUCTS ACROSS PRODUCTION STAGE) (SUM OF ALL PRODUCTS ACROSS PRODUCTION STAGE). IDEALLY 2NDARY SOURCE TO PERFORM CALCULATION. Data of a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) study indicate that about 0.97 percent of energy use in the United States is accounted for by raising food-producing livestock and poultry. In this context, energy use includes energy from fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, technological solar, and wind sources. The estimated energy use in agricultural production includes embodied energy in purchased inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Canning, P., A. Charles, S. Huang, K. R. Polenske, and A Water [http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/136418/err94_1_.pdf Energy use in the U. S. foo system]. USDA Economic Research Service, ERR-94. 33 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

A 2010 report from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s (UNEP) International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth and increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= 2010|title= Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production: Priority Products and Materials|publisher= UNEP|publication-place= |page= 82|url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Portals/24102/PDFs/PriorityProductsAndMaterials_Report.pdf |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-un"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Cornell University]] scientists: "The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable".&lt;ref name=PimentelPimentel2003/&gt; However, they also write: "The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet. In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet."&lt;ref name=PimentelPimentel2003&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pimentel|first= David|last2= Pimentel|first2= Marcia|date= September 2003|title= Sustainability of meat-based and plant-based diets and the environment|url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/78/3/660S|journal= [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|publisher= |volume= 78|issue= 3|pages= 660S–663S|doi= |access-date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Cornell scientists has advised that the US could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat. He "depicted grain-fed livestock farming as a costly and nonsustainable way to produce animal protein", but "distinguished grain-fed meat production from pasture-raised livestock, calling cattle-grazing a more reasonable use of marginal land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= August 7, 1997|title= U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat, Cornell ecologist advises animal scientists|url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat|newspaper= [[Cornell Chronicle]]|location= |access-date= 19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2002 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. ... One personal act that can have a profound impact on these issues is reducing [[meat consumption]]. To produce 1 pound of feedlot beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42). Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horrigan|first= Leo|last2= Lawrence|first2= Robert S|last3= Walker|first3= Polly|date= May 2002|title= How Sustainable Agriculture Can Address the Environmental and Human Health Harms of Industrial Agriculture|url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240832/pdf/ehp0110-000445.pdf|journal= [[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|publisher= |volume= 110|issue= 5|pages= 445–456|doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110445|access-date=17 July 2015 |pmc=1240832 |pmid=12003747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another agricultural effect is on land degradation. Cattle are a known cause for [[soil erosion]] through trampling of the ground and [[overgrazing]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2009.

This growing demand is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/sustainability/sustainability-and-livestock/en/|title=Sustainability Pathways: Sustainability and livestock|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental impacts of animal production vary with the method of production. A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pests with less pesticides by rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a [[desertification]] process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than the same kind of soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;Bharati et al. 2002. Agroforestry Systems 56: 249-257&lt;/ref&gt; Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, livestock feed, or some combination of these.

Animal production has a large impact on water pollution and usage. According to the Water Education Foundation, it takes 2,464 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef in California, whereas it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat. Raising a large amount of livestock creatives a massive amount of manure and urine, which can pollute natural resources by changing the pH of water, contaminates the air, and emits a major amount of gas that directly affects global warming. As most livestock are raised in small confined spaces to cut down on cost, this increases the problem of concentrated waste. Livestock in the United States produces 2.7 trillion pounds of manure each year,  which is ten times more than what is produced by the entire U.S. population. There are issues with how animal waste is disposed, as some is used as fertilizer while some farmers create manure lagoons which store millions of gallons of animal waste which is extremely unsafe and detrimental to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vegetariantimes.com/article/the-environmental-impact-of-a-meat-based-diet|title=The Environmental Impact of a Meat-Based Diet|last=admin|date=2007-04-04|work=Vegetarian Times|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', global meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase carbon emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=July 21, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 report in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' found that a significant reduction in meat consumption is necessary to mitigate climate change, especially as the population rises to a projected 10 billion in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Achenbach|first=Joel|date=October 10, 2018 |title=Earth’s population is skyrocketing.

Environmental vegetarianism can be compared with [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism either out of necessity or because of a conscious [[simple living]] strategy. Such a person may base this belief on a philosophical viewpoint, such as the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound or that vegetarianism will help improve public health, lead to global food security, and curb [[starvation]].&lt;ref name="The Startling Effects of Going Vegetarian for Just One Day"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Startling Effects of Going Vegetarian for Just One Day|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day|accessdate=10 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007180810/http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day|archivedate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eat Better and Improve Your Health For Less Money"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eat Better and Improve Your Health For Less Money|url=http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/blog/health/economic-advantages-vegetarian-diet|accessdate=10 February 2013|author=Katherine Manning|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114192717/http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/blog/health/economic-advantages-vegetarian-diet|archivedate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental vegetarians call for a reduction of first world consumption of meat, especially in the US. According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]], "Each U.S. citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs. of meat per year, the world's highest rate. That is about 1.5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030428144241/http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-04-28|title=UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "the [[ecological footprint]] of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2004/english/ch3/|title=State of World Population 2004 - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] calls [[malnutrition]] "the silent emergency", and says that it is a factor in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths which occur every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3559542.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hungry world 'must eat less meat' | date=August 16, 2004 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trade-48538"&gt;http://www.tradeobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=48538  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405194659/http://www.tradeobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=48538 |date=April 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some{{who|date=October 2011}} argue that the adoption of an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources. For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2.6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced. For developing countries, the estimate is 0.3 pounds per pound. (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures.)&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, E. et al. 1999. Animal Agriculture and Global Food Supply. Council on Agricultural Science and Technology. 92 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62.2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200.7 pounds (boneless trimmed weight basis).&lt;ref&gt;USDA.  2010. Agricultural Statistics 2010, Table 13-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
[[Bill Mollison]] has argued in his Permaculture Design Course that vegetarianism exacerbates soil erosion. This is because removing a plant from a field removes all the nutrients it obtained from the soil, while removing an animal leaves the field intact. On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. 2009. Summary report 2007 national resources inventory. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. 123 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]] has also developed [[forest gardening]], which has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element, as a sustainable plant-based food production system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Gardening|author=Robert Hart|year=1996|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=forest%20gardening%20robert%20hart%20simple%20living&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. [[Environmentalist]] Dave Riley states that "being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us", and notes that Mollison "insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/5814|title= Does meat make the meal?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others assert that "the vegan diet wastes available land that could otherwise be used to feed more people", but still conclude that a dairy-friendly vegetarian diet is the most sustainable when compared to 9 other diets, some more influenced by vegetarianism than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/|title=Being vegan isn’t as good for humanity as you think|first=Chase|last=Purdy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ersilia Caetani-Lovatelli''' or '''Ersilia Caetani''' (12 October 1840 – 22 December 1925) was an [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] art historian, cultural historian and archaeologist.

==Life==
Caetani-Lovatelli was born in [[Rome]] in 1840 to [[Michelangelo Caetani]] and the Polish Countess Calixta Rzewuski. Her mother was from the important Rzewuski family and the aristocratic [[Caetani]] family had featured in the history of Rome and Pisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caetani Family|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Caetani-family|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learnt Greek, Latin and Sanskrit and in 1859 she married [[Giovanni Lovatelli]]. Lovatelli was the first woman  to become a member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], which is the oldest Italian scientific academy.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Ersilia&amp;last=Lovatelli Ersilia Lovatelli], Grace Mary Crowfoot, Brown.edu, Retrieved 12 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was a widow she would open her salon at the [[Caetani Palace]] on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The salon attracted writers and composers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. Actually the salon operated from 1870 to 1915 and her husband died in 1879. Caetani-Lovatelli was interested in archaeology and history and published papers on several subjects. Caetani-Lovatelli joined several academic societies. Around 1915 was the end of the salons in Italy as society became embroiled in the first world war.&lt;ref name="MarronePuppa2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1660|date=26 December 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|pages=1660–1661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universidad Nacional de Ciencias Forestales, &lt;nowiki&gt;[[UNACIFOR]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ('''before known as Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Forestales or ESNACIFOR) is a distinguished institution in the field of [[forestry]], not only in [[Honduras]] but also the region of [[Central America]]. The school was created in 1969 as a training center, and now offers two levels of degrees. Students can pursue an Associates or Bachelors in Forestry. Over 1400 professional foresters have graduated from ESNACIFOR, and the demand is always more than the supply. A development plan is in effect that provides reviews of the fundamental strategy every 10 years, tactical plan every five years, and evaluations every three months. The four parts of the school are action areas (training programs), general management, academics, and production and services (income for sustaining the school).

The technical challenge of explaining AI decisions is sometimes known as the '''interpretability problem'''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=5 July 2017|language=en}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another consideration is ''info-besity'' (overload of information), thus, ''full transparency'' may not be always possible or even required. The amount of information presented should vary based on the stakeholder interacting with the intelligent system &lt;ref name="ConnectionScience"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theodorou|first=Andreas|last2=Wortham|first2=Robert R.|last3=Bryson|first3=Joanna J.|date=2017|title=Designing and implementing transparency for real time inspection of autonomous robots|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540091.2017.1310182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically-specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command, "maximize accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset". The AI may learn useful general rules from the testset, such as "reviews containing the word 'horrible'" are likely to be negative". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

== Goals ==
AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data, but that do not reflect the complicated implicit desires of the human system designers. For example, a 2017 system tasked with image recognition learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures, rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk’s AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One transparency project, the [[DARPA]] XAI program, aims to produce "glass box" models that are explainable to a "human-in-the-loop", without greatly sacrificing AI performance. Human users should be able to understand the AI's cognition (both in real-time and after the fact), and should be able to determine when to trust the AI and when the AI should be distrusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence|website=DARPA|publisher=DARPA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History and methods ==
[[Mycin]], a research prototype that could explain which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case, was developed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Lent, M., Fisher, W., &amp; Mancuso, M. (2004, July). An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior. In Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pp. 900-907). Menlo Park, CA; Cambridge, MA; London; AAAI Press; MIT Press; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, L. M., Shortliffe, E. H., &amp; Buchanan, B. G. (1980). Computer-based medical decision making: from MYCIN to VM. Automedica, 3(2), 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1990s researchers also began studying whether it is possible to meaningfully extract the non-hand-coded rules being generated by opaque trained neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tickle|first=A. B.|last2=Andrews|first2=R.|last3=Golea|first3=M.|last4=Diederich|first4=J.|date=November 1998|title=The truth will come to light: directions and challenges in extracting the knowledge embedded within trained artificial neural networks|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/728352/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1057–1068|doi=10.1109/72.728352|issn=1045-9227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in clinical expert systems creating neural network-powered decision support for clinicians have sought to develop dynamic explanations that allow these technologies to be more trusted and trustworthy in practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2010s public concerns about racial and other bias in the use of AI for criminal sentencing decisions and findings of creditworthiness may have led to increased demand for transparent artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

Some organizations, such as [[Accenture]], offer tools to businesses to help detect bias in their systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Accenture Unveils Tool to Help Companies Insure Their AI Is Fair|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-13/accenture-unveils-tool-to-help-companies-insure-their-ai-is-fair |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=Bloomberg.com |date=June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 an interdisciplinary conference called FAT* (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) was established to study transparency and explainability in the context of socio-technical systems, many of which include artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="FAT* conference"&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://fatconference.org/ | title=FAT* Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer programs recognise white men better than black women |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/02/15/computer-programs-recognise-white-men-better-than-black-women |accessdate=5 August 2018 |work=The Economist |date=2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==

As regulators, official bodies and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for decision making processes to ensure trust and transparency. Evidence of this requirement gaining more momentum can be seen with the launch of the first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~dwaha/research/meetings/ijcai17-xai/|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''fish kill''', known also as '''fish die-off''', refers to a localized die-off of fish populations which may also be associated with more generalized mortality of aquatic life.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC (2000). [http://www.epa.gov/305b/98report/98brochure.pdf "The Quality of Our Nation’s Waters - A Summary of the National Water Quality Inventory: 1998 Report to Congress."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724052358/http://www.epa.gov/305b/98report/98brochure.pdf |date=24 July 2008 }} Document no. EPA-841-S-00-001. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;University of Florida. Gainesville, FL (2005). [http://aquat1.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/fiskil.html "Fish kill."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924135959/http://aquat1.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/fiskil.html |date=24 September 2008 }} ''Plant Management in Florida's Waters.''&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cause is reduced oxygen in the water, which in turn may be due to factors such as drought, [[algae bloom]], [[overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]], or a sustained increase in water temperature. [[Fish diseases and parasites|Infectious diseases and parasites]] can also lead to fish kill. [[Toxicity]] is a real but far less common cause of fish kill.&lt;ref&gt;Noga, Fish Disease: Diagnosis and Treatment, 2010, John Wiley and Sons {{ISBN|0-8138-0697-6}}, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish kills are often the first visible signs of [[Environmental quality|environmental]] stress and are usually investigated as a matter of urgency by environmental agencies to determine the cause of the kill. Many fish species have a relatively low tolerance of variations in environmental conditions and their death is often a potent indicator of problems in their environment that may be affecting other animals and plants and may have a direct impact on other uses of the water such as for [[drinking water]] production. Pollution events may affect fish species and [[Age class structure|fish age classes]] in different ways. If it is a cold-related fish kill, [[juvenile fish]] or species that are not cold-tolerant may be selectively affected. If [[toxicity]] is the cause, species are more generally affected and the event may include amphibians and shellfish as well. A reduction in [[dissolved oxygen]] may affect larger specimens more than smaller fish as these may be able to access oxygen richer water at the surface, at least for a short time.

==Causes==
[[File:Scheme eutrophication-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Depleted oxygen levels are the most common cause of fish kills. In this way [[eutrophication]] can have devastating consequences for the health of [[Benthos|benthic life]]]]

Fish kills may result from a variety of causes. Of known causes, fish kills are most frequently caused by pollution from agricultural runoff or biotoxins. [[hypoxia (environmental)|Ecological hypoxia]] (oxygen depletion) is one of the most common natural causes of fish kills. The hypoxic event may be brought on by factors such as [[algae bloom]]s, droughts, high temperatures&lt;ref&gt;Oregon State University (2006). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-dhe103006.php "Deadly hypoxic event finally concludes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083456/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-dhe103006.php |date=14 March 2011 }},&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thermal pollution]]. Fish kills may also occur due to the presence of disease, [[agricultural runoff]], [[sewage]] discharges, oil or [[hazardous waste]] spills, [[hydraulic fracturing]] wastewater, [[earthquake|sea-quake]]s, inappropriate re-stocking of fish, [[poaching]] with chemicals, underwater [[explosion]]s, and other catastrophic events that upset a normally stable aquatic population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Because of the difficulty and lack of standard protocol to investigate fish kills, many fish kill cases are designated as having an 'unknown' cause.&lt;ref&gt;La, V. and S.

Oxygen enters the water through [[diffusion]]. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in water depends on the [[atmospheric pressure]], the water temperature and whether the water is salty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/oxygen-solubility-water-d_841.html Oxygen Solubility in Fresh and Sea Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103230758/http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/oxygen-solubility-water-d_841.html |date=3 January 2011 }}. Engineeringtoolbox.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) and one atmosphere of pressure, a maximum of 8&amp;nbsp;mg/l of oxygen can dissolve in [[sea water]] (35&amp;nbsp;mg/l [[salinity]]) while a maximum of 9&amp;nbsp;mg/l of oxygen can dissolve in fresh water. The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in the water decreases by about 1&amp;nbsp;mg/l for each 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in water temperature above 20&amp;nbsp;°C.

Many cold water fish that live in clean cold waters become stressed when oxygen concentrations fall below 8&amp;nbsp;mg/l while warm water fish generally need at least 5 ppm (5&amp;nbsp;mg/l) of dissolved oxygen. Fish can endure short periods of reduced oxygen. Depleted oxygen levels are the most common cause of fish kills. Oxygen levels normally fluctuate even over the course of a day and are affected by weather, temperature, the amount of sunlight available, and the amount of living and dead plant and animal matter in the water.&lt;ref name="BGWM"&gt;A Beginner’s Guide to Water Management – Fish Kills, Information Circular 107, University of Florida IFAS Extension, 2003 [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_fish_kills read online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504040737/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_fish_kills |date=4 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In temperate zones oxygen levels in [[eutrophic]] rivers in summertime can exhibit very large [[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] fluctuations with many hours of oxygen [[supersaturation]] during daylight followed by [[oxygen depletion]] at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/do/do-02.htm Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Dissolved Oxygen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811091231/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/BCguidelines/do/do-02.htm |date=11 August 2010 }}. Env.gov.bc.ca. Retrieved on 2012-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with these [[photosynthetic]] rhythms there is a matching [[pH]] rhythm as [[bicarbonate ion]] is metabolised by plant cells. This can lead to pH stress even when oxygen levels are high.

Additional dissolved organic loads are the most common cause of oxygen depletion and such organic loads may come from sewage, farm waste, tip [[leachate]] and many other sources.

===Diseases and parasites===
{{See also|Fish diseases and parasites}}
[[File:Cadmans Pool, New Forest. - geograph.org.uk - 61031.jpg|thumb|right|This pond in [[New Forest]], England, has been restored following a [[viral infection]] which killed all the fish.]]
Fish are subject to various [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] in addition to parasites such as [[protozoan]]s, flukes and worms, or crustaceans. These are naturally occurring in many bodies of water, and fish that are stressed for other reasons, such as spawning or suboptimal water quality, are more susceptible. Signs of disease include sores, missing scales or lack of slime, strange growths or visible parasites, and abnormal behavior–lazy, erratic, gasping at the water surface or floating head, tail or belly up.

For example, since 2004 fish kills have been observed in the [[Shenandoah River]] basin in the spring, from the time water temperatures are in the 50s (°F) until they reach the mid-70s.  So far, investigators suspect certain bacteria, along with environmental and contaminant factors that may cause [[immune suppression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkill.html information from the Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia, USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524035958/http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkill.html |date=24 May 2011 }}; see also [http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkillhistory.html History of fish kills in the Shenandoah watershed, Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524044853/http://www.deq.state.va.us/info/srfishkillhistory.html |date=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fish farming]], where populations are optimized for the available resources, [[parasites]] or disease can spread quickly. In [[channel catfish]] [[Aquaculture of catfish|aquaculture ponds]], for example, the "hamburger gill disease" is caused by a protozoan called ''Aurantiactinomyxon'' and can kill all the fish in an affected pond. In addition to altered behavior, affected fish have swollen gills that are mottled and have the appearance of ground hamburger meat.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

Some early warning signs of fish suffering from disease or parasite infections include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100610081128/http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/420/420-252/420-252.pdf Fish Kills - Their Causes and Prevention, Virginia Tech, Virginia Cooperative Extension Publication 420-252, 2009]. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Discolouration, open sores, reddening of the skin, bleeding, black or white spots on the skin
#Abnormal shape, swollen areas, abnormal lumps, or popeyes
#Abnormal distribution of the fish such as crowding at the surface, inlet, or pond edges (though crowding at the surface during specific times of day, such as early morning, is more likely a sign of low oxygen)
#Abnormal activity such as flashing, twisting, whirling, convulsions, loss of buoyancy
#Listlessness, weakness, sluggishness, lack of activity
#Loss of appetite or refusal to feed.

===Toxins===
{{See also|Fish toxins|Cyanide fishing|Marine pollution#Toxins}}
[[Agricultural runoff]], [[sewage]], [[surface runoff]], [[chemical spill]]s and [[hazardous waste]] spills can all potentially lead to water [[toxicity]] and fish kill. Some algae species also produce toxins. In Florida, these include ''[[Aphanizomenon]]'', ''[[Anabaena]]'' and ''Microcystis''. Some notable fish kills in Louisiana in the 1950s were due to a [[pesticide]] called [[endrin]].&lt;ref&gt;Larson et al., 1997, Pesticides in Surface Waters: distribution, trends and governing factors. CRC Press {{ISBN|1-57504-006-9}} p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Natural instances of toxic conditions can occur, especially in poorly [[Buffer solution|buffer]]ed water. Aluminium compounds can cause complete fish kills, sometimes associated with autumn turn-over of lakes leading to complex chemical interactions between pH, [[calcium]] ions and complex [[polymeric]] salts of aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828232501/http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf33/anzf33-517p.pdf |date=28 August 2011 }}. Retrieved on 2012-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human-induced fish kills are unusual, but occasionally a spilled substance causes direct toxicity or a shift in water temperature or pH that can lead to fish kill.  For example, in 1997 a [[phosphate]] plant in [[Mulberry, Florida]], accidentally dumped 
{{convert|60|e6USgal|e6kl|abbr=unit}} of acidic process water into Skinned Sapling Creek, reducing the pH from about 8 to less than 4 along {{convert|36|mi|km}} of creek, resulting in the death of about 1.3 million fish.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

It is often difficult or impossible to determine whether a potential toxin is the direct cause of a fish kill.  For example, hundreds of thousands of fish died after an accidental spill of [[bourbon whiskey]] into the [[Kentucky River]] near [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]]. However, officials could not determine whether the fish kill was due to the bourbon directly or to oxygen depletion that resulted when aquatic [[microbe]]s rapidly began to consume and digest the liquor.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

[[Cyanide]] is a particular toxic compound that has been [[Cyanide fishing|used to poach fish]]. In cyanide poisoning the gills turn a distinctive cherry red. [[Chlorine]] introduced as alkaline hypochlorite solution is also extremely toxic,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110317032617/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/202794/nsw-fish-kill.pdf Fish Kills in New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving pale mucilaginous gills and an over-production of mucilage across the whole body. [[Calcium oxide|Lime]] produces similar symptoms but is also often associated with milk eyes.

===Algae blooms and red tides===
[[File:River Cam green.JPG|thumb|right|A small algae bloom on [[River Cam]] near Trinity College]]
[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|A large algae bloom off the southern coast of England in 1999]]
[[File:Red tide.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red tide]] is a reddish algae bloom caused by a microorganism common in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]
{{See also|Algae bloom|Red tide}}
An [[algae bloom]] is the appearance of a large amount of [[algae]] or [[Impurities|scum]] floating on the surface of a body of water. Algae blooms are a natural occurrence in nutrient-rich lakes and rivers, though sometimes increased nutrient levels leading to algae blooms are due to fertilizer or animal waste [[Land runoff|runoff]]. A few species of algae produce [[toxin]]s, but most fish kills due to algae bloom are a result of decreased oxygen levels. When the algae die, [[decomposition]] uses oxygen in the water that would be available to fish. A fish kill in a lake in Estonia in 2002 was attributed to a combination of algae bloom and high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Estonian Academy Publishers|title=Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, Biology and Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGqUHtmTCuoC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2005|publisher=Estonian Academy Publishers|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When people manage algae blooms in [[fish pond]]s, it is recommended that treatments be staggered to avoid too much algae dying at once, which may result in a large drop in oxygen content.

Some diseases result in mass die-offs.&lt;ref name="Moyle466"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 466&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more bizarre and recently discovered diseases produces huge fish kills in shallow marine waters. It is caused by the [[ambush predator]] [[dinoflagellate]] ''[[Pfiesteria piscicida]]''. When large numbers of fish, like [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] [[forage fish]],  are in confined situations such as shallow bays, the excretions from the fish encourage this dinoflagellate, which is not normally toxic, to produce free-swimming [[zoospores]]. If the fish remain in the area, continuing to provide nourishment, then the zoospores start secreting a [[neurotoxin]]. This toxin results in the fish developing bleeding lesions, and their skin flakes off in the water. The dinoflagellates then eat the blood and flakes of tissue while the affected fish die.&lt;ref name="Burkholder"&gt;Burkholder JM, Glasgow HB and Hobbs CW (1995) [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/124/m124p043.pdf "Fish kills linked to a toxic ambush-predator dinoflagellate: distribution and environmental conditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223203635/http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/124/m124p043.pdf |date=23 February 2012 }} ''Marine Ecology Progress Series''.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish kills by this dinoflagellate are common, and they may also have been responsible for kills in the past which were thought to have had other causes.&lt;ref name="Burkholder"/&gt; Kills like these can be viewed as natural mechanisms for regulating the population of exceptionally abundant fish. The rate at which the kills occur increases as organically polluted [[land runoff]] increases.&lt;ref&gt;Magnien RE (2001) [http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051%5B0843:TDOSPA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 "The Dynamics of Science, Perception, and Policy during the Outbreak of Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay"] ''BioScience'' '''51'''(10):843-852.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red tide]] is the name commonly given to an algal bloom of ''[[Karenia brevis]]'', a  microscopic marine dinoflagellate which is common in [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters. In high concentrations it discolors the water which often appears reddish-brown in color. It produces a toxin which paralyses the central nervous system of fish so they cannot breathe. Dead fish wash up on beaches around Texas and Florida. Humans can also become seriously ill from eating oysters and other shellfish contaminated with the red tide toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml#q9 |title=Red Tide FAQ - Is it safe to eat oysters during a red tide? |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |accessdate= 2009-08-23 |deadurl=no

The term "red tide" is also commonly used to describe harmful algal blooms on the northern east coast of the United States, particularly in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. This type of bloom is caused by another species of [[dinoflagellate]] known as ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2modulechunk&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Provider&amp;L2=Guidance+for+Businesses&amp;L3=Food+Safety&amp;sid=Eeohhs2&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dph_environmental_foodsafety_p_red_tide&amp;csid=Eeohhs2

===Biological decay===
Just as an algae bloom can lead to oxygen depletion, introduction of a large amount of [[Decomposition|decaying]] biological material in general to a body of water leads to oxygen depletion as [[microorganism]]s use up available oxygen in the process of breaking down [[organic matter]].  For example, a {{convert|10|mi|km}} fish kill in September, 2010, in the [[Sangamon River]] in Illinois was traced to discharge of animal waste into the river from a large dairy operation. The illegal discharge resulted in a complete kill of fish, frogs, [[mussel]]s and [[mudpuppy|mudpuppies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/contaminated-water-kills-fish-in-central-illinois/article_a64ef8bc-bf50-11df-9804-001cc4c002e0.html Contaminated Water Kills Fish in Central Illinois] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415154155/http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/contaminated-water-kills-fish-in-central-illinois/article_a64ef8bc-bf50-11df-9804-001cc4c002e0.html |date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrient pollution and eutrophication ===
Excessive [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] nutrient enrichment of phosphorus and nitrogen allow for rapid growth and multiplication of [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton]] in the [[Mississippi River]]. As phytoplankton continue to rapidly grow under optimal conditions, their biomass is almost doubled every 24 hours. In the water, higher concentrations of organic matter are present because of the high reproductive rate of the phytoplankton over a short period of time. The rapid growth of phytoplankton causes [[turbidity]] in the waters of the Mississippi and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Turbidity is defined as the measure of water clarity by how much the suspended material, such as algae and phytoplankton, constrict the passage of sunlight through water. Hence, as phytoplankton begin to multiply more rapidly, turbidity in the river and gulf increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Environmental Science: Toward a Sustainable Future |last= Wright |first= Richard T. |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2014 |isbn = |location=Boston |pages=523–578 |last2=Boorse |first2=Dorothy F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing turbidity blocks plants from absorbing sunlight. The process of turbidity results in limited photosynthesis production, and sometimes even death from sunlight deprivation of the submerged aquatic vegetation that are affected by the opaque turbid water accumulating at the surface.

Furthermore, a significant detrimental outcome caused by [[eutrophication]] in the Mississippi River is the increased uptake of dissolved oxygen by bacteria, in response to higher concentrations of organic matter. After eutrophication starts and is in progress, the phytoplankton reach their maximum [[population density]] and begin to die.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the dead phytoplankton accumulate, detritus, or organic matter waste, forms at the surface along with other bacteria and algae. As more phytoplankton die, the higher the concentration of organic matter becomes; and with a higher concentration of organic matter, more bacteria will reproduce.

Consequently, as more bacteria, phytoplankton, and algae exponentially grow and multiply, the more submerged aquatic vegetation die, because they do not have access to sunlight due to eutrophication. Once this snowball-like course of action is in full motion, a dead zone has been created. As a result of the excess nutrient enrichment in the Mississippi River, dead zones appear in the Gulf of Mexico, created from the process of eutrophication. The dead zones in the gulf are mainly created by the nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment of the Lower Mississippi River.

===Spawning fatalities===
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|right|A [[salmon]] which has died after spawning]]
Some species of fish exhibit mass simultaneous mortality as part of their natural life cycle.
Fish kill due to spawning fatalities can occur when fish are exhausted from [[Spawn (biology)|spawning activities]] such as courtship, nest building, and the release of eggs or [[milt]] (sperm). Fish are generally weaker after spawning and are less resilient than usual to smaller changes in the environment.  Examples include the [[Atlantic salmon]] and the [[Sockeye salmon]] where many of the females routinely die immediately after spawning.

===Water temperature===
A fish kill can occur with rapid fluctuations in temperature or sustained high temperatures. Generally, cooler water has the potential to hold more oxygen, so a period of sustained high temperatures can lead to decreased dissolved oxygen in a body of water.  An August, 2010, fish kill in [[Delaware Bay]] was attributed to low oxygen as a result of high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/fish-kill-in-delaware-bay-still-a-mystery-to-nj-dep August 2010 fish kill in Delaware Bay linked to high temperatures – low oxygen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818072307/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/fish-kill-in-delaware-bay-still-a-mystery-to-nj-dep |date=18 August 2010 }}.

A massive (hundreds of thousands) fish kill at the mouth of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], September, 2010, was attributed to a combination of high temperatures and low tide. Such kills are known to happen in this region in late summer and early fall, but this one was unusually large.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/news/pictures/slideshow?articleId=USRTR2IDT7 Slideshow: Massive fish kill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222203924/http://www.reuters.com/news/pictures/slideshow?articleId=USRTR2IDT7 |date=22 February 2014 }} Reuter’s News Service report of massive fish kill at the mouth of the Mississippi River in September, 2010. The Division of Wildlife stated that the fish kill was unrelated to the oil spill that had recently occurred in the Gulf of Mexico: [http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ Massive Fish Kill Not BP's Fault]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007233913/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/09/16/massive-mississippi-river-fish-kill-not-bps-fault/ |date=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short period of hot weather can increase temperatures in the surface layer of water, as the warmer water tends to stay near the surface and be further heated by the air.  In this case, the top warmer layer may have more oxygen than the lower, cooler layers because it has constant access to atmospheric oxygen. If a heavy wind or cold rain then occurs (usually during the autumn but sometimes in summer), the [[Stratification (water)|layers can mix]]. If the volume of low oxygen water is much greater than the volume in the warm surface layer, this mixing can reduce oxygen levels throughout the [[water column]] and lead to fish kill.

Fish kills can also result from a dramatic or prolonged drop in air (and thus, water) temperature. This kind of fish kill is selective – usually the dead fish are species that cannot tolerate cold. This has been observed in cases where a fish native to a more tropical region has been introduced to cooler waters, such as the introduction of the [[tilapia]] to bodies of water in Florida. Native to Africa’s [[Nile River]], the tilapia stop feeding when water temperatures drop below {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and die when it reaches {{convert|45|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Thus, tilapia that have survived and successfully reproduced in Florida are occasionally killed by a winter cold front.&lt;ref name="BGWM"/&gt;

In January, 2011, a selective fish kill affecting an estimated 2 million juvenile [[Spot croaker|spot fish]] was attributed to a combination of cold stress and overpopulation after a particularly large spawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/06/maryland.fish.kill/index.html?iref=obinsite CNN story on Jan 6, 2011 Fish kill in Maryland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035058/http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/06/maryland.fish.kill/index.html?iref=obinsite |date=9 November 2012 }}.

===Underwater explosions===
[[Underwater explosion]]s can lead to fish kill, and fish with [[swim bladder]]s are more susceptible. Sometimes underwater explosions are used on purpose to induce fish kills, a generally illegal practice known as [[blast fishing]]. Underwater explosions may be accidental or planned, such as for construction, [[seismic]] testing, mining or blast testing of structures under water.  In many places, an assessment of potential effects of underwater explosions on marine life must be completed and preventive measures taken before blasting.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1996, Effects of Underwater Explosions on Life in the Sea, report DSTO-GD-0080 to the [[Australian Department of Defence]] [http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/3763/1/DSTO-GD-0080%20PR.pdf read online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706121631/http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/3763/1/DSTO-GD-0080%20PR.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }};  Govoni, et al., 2008, Effects of Underwater Explosions on Larval Fish: Implications for a Coastal Engineering Project, Journal of Coastal Research 2(S):228-233 {{doi|10.2112/05-0518.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Droughts and overstocking===
Droughts and overstocking can also result in inland fish kills.

A drought can lead to lower water volumes so that even if the water contains a high level of dissolved oxygen, the reduced volume may not be enough for the fish population.  Droughts often occur in conjunction with high temperatures so that the oxygen [[carrying capacity]] of the water may also be reduced. Low river flows also reduce the available dilution for permitted discharges of treated sewage or [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial waste]]. The reduced dilution increases the organic demand for oxygen further reducing the oxygen concentration available to fish

[[Fish stocking|Overstocking]] of fish (or an unusually large [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]]) can also result in inland fish kills. Fish kill due to insufficient oxygen is really a matter of too much demand and too little supply for whatever reason(s).  Recommended stocking densities are available from many sources for bodies of water ranging from a home [[aquarium]] or backyard pond to commercial [[aquaculture]] facilities.

==Estimation==
Estimating the magnitude of a kill presents a number of problems.&lt;ref name="Labay"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Labay |first1=Andrew A. |last2=Bizan |first2=Dave |year=1999 |title=A Comparison of Fish Kill Counting Procedures on a Small, Narrow Stream |journal=North American Journal of Fisheries Management |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=209–214 |publisher=American Fisheries Society |doi=10.1577/1548-8675(1999)019&lt;0209:ACOFKC&gt;2.0.CO;2  |url=http://afsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8675%281999%29019%3C0209:ACOFKC%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Polluted waters are often very [[turbidity|turbid]] or have low transparency making it difficult or impossible to see fish that have sunk
#Rivers and streams can move fish downstream out of the investigation area.
#Small fish and [[Fry (biology)|fry]] can decompose  or become buried in sediments very quickly and are lost from the count.
#[[Predator]]s and [[scavenger]]s remove and eat fish.
#Stressed fish may swim up tributaries and die there
#Many kills are reported only when dead fish resurface due to decompositional gas formation, often several hours after the kill has occurred.
Some very large fish kills may never be estimated because of these factors. The discharge of red aluminium [[sludge]] from a reservoir in [[Hungary]] into the Marcai River is acknowledged as causing environmental devastation,&lt;ref&gt;

==Prevention and investigation==
Fish kills are difficult to predict. Even when conditions that contribute to fish kill are known to exist, prevention is hard because often conditions cannot be improved and fish cannot be safely removed in time. In small ponds, mechanical [[water aeration|aeration]] and/or removal of decaying matter (such as fallen leaves or dead algae) may be reasonable and effective preventive measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12219">In [[ethology]], a '''fission–fusion society''' is one in which the size and composition of the social group change as time passes and animals move throughout the environment; animals merge into a group (fusion)—e.g. sleeping in one place—or split (fission)—e.g. foraging in small groups during the day. For species that live in fission–fusion societies, group composition is a dynamic property.

==Species==
Fission-fusion societies occur among many different species of [[primates]] (e.g. [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]], [[Orangutan|orangutans]], and [[Human|humans]]), [[Elephant|elephants]] (e.g. [[African forest elephant|forest elephants]], [[African elephant|African elephants]]), and [[Bat|bats]] (e.g. [[Northern long-eared bat (myotis)|northern long-eared bats]]). The change in composition, subgroup size, and dispersion of different groups are 3 main elements of a fission-fusion society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramos-Fernández|first=Gabriel|last2=Morales|first2=Juan M.|date=2014-05-09|title=Unraveling fission-fusion dynamics: how subgroup properties and dyadic interactions influence individual decisions|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-014-1733-8|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=68|issue=8|pages=1225–1235|doi=10.1007/s00265-014-1733-8|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aureli|first=Filippo|last2=Schaffner|first2=Colleen M.|last3=Boesch|first3=Christophe|last4=Bearder|first4=Simon K.|last5=Call|first5=Josep|last6=Chapman|first6=Colin A.|last7=Connor|first7=Richard|last8=Fiore|first8=Anthony Di|last9=Dunbar|first9=Robin I. M.|date=August 2008|title=Fission‐Fusion Dynamics|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.journals.uchicago.edu%2Fdoi%2F10.1086%2F586708|journal=Current Anthropology|language=en|volume=49|issue=4|pages=627–654|doi=10.1086/586708|issn=0011-3204|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Primates ===

==== Chimpanzees ====
Chimpanzees often form smaller subgroups when travelling for longer periods at a time in between each food patch&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=C.A.|last2=Chapman|first2=L.J.|last3=Wrangham|first3=R.W.|date=January 1995|title=Ecological constraints on group size: an analysis of spider monkey and chimpanzee subgroups|url=https://link-springer-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/article/10.1007/BF00175729|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=59–70|doi=10.1007/bf00175729|issn=0340-5443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When obtaining food, the size of subgroups can change depending on how much food is available and how far away the food may be. If food is worth retrieving due to little travel costs, subgroup size will enlarge. So among chimpanzees, the abundance of food and how dense it may be are factors that contribute to the changes of subgroup sizes&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

==== Orangutans ====
Orangutans are one type of primates that model individual-based fission-fusion&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Schaik|first=Carel P.|date=January 1999|title=The socioecology of fission-fusion sociality in Orangutans|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02557703|journal=Primates|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=69–86|doi=10.1007/bf02557703|issn=0032-8332|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Travel parties are established among this species inhabiting specifically in a Sumatran forest, and there are several benefits. Mating opportunities are a large benefit of grouping, as parties are most substantial during high mating activity&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Infant socialization also contains benefits as well as costs, due to their needs to be cared for. Females are required to carry their infants, and those with infants of mid-size experience greater costs than those of small sizes. Carrying a small infant does not require much, and they become less dependent as they begin to wean. Mid-sized infants on the other hand, require the most energy. When travelling, females are required to support their mid-sized infants by carrying them, and waiting for them if they've fallen behind&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Humans ====
Humans also form fission-fusion societies, and this began with industrialization. In hunter-gatherer societies, humans form groups which are made up of several individuals that may split up to obtain different resources&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Couzin|first=Iain D.|last2=Laidre|first2=Mark E.|date=August 2009|title=Fission–fusion populations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.034|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=15|pages=R633–R635|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.034|issn=0960-9822|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another example of a fission-fusion society in hunter-gatherer societies is communication among the group. Groups may begin to split due to arguments and disagreements&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Among humans, gossip and language in general is also an important feature involved in fission-fusion. Communication keeps distant groups together although they may not be within close distances of each other&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Elephants ===
[[File:Forest elephants (6841454698).jpg|thumb|Forest elephants socializing at a clearing]]
Elephants display grouping as it helps to minimize risks and enhance benefits. Forest elephants often fuse into larger groups throughout forest clearings, to exchange information and maximize social opportunities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fishlock|first=Vicki|last2=Lee|first2=Phyllis C.|date=February 2013|title=Forest elephants: fission–fusion and social arenas|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.11.004|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=85|issue=2|pages=357–363|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.11.004|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Elephants are drawn to large parties present at forest clearings, and remain in the clearing for a longer period of time if there are individuals outside of their party present. Young African male elephants display a preference for larger groups, in order to communicate with other elephants and to explore dominance&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Kate E.|last2=Harris|first2=Stephen|date=September 2008|title=Adolescence in male African elephants, Loxodonta africana, and the importance of sociality|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.03.019|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=76|issue=3|pages=779–787|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.03.019|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adolescent males can gain knowledge from adult males and acquire information about their new social methods&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

=== Bats ===
Bats are one of the species which shows an advanced fission-fusion society&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kashima|first=Kazutaka|last2=Ohtsuki|first2=Hisashi|last3=Satake|first3=Akiko|date=February 7, 2013|title=Fission-fusion bat behavior as a strategy for balancing the conflicting needs of maximizing information accuracy and minimizing infection risk|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.10.034|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=318|pages=101–109|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.10.034|issn=0022-5193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among female northern long-eared bats, switching roosts is common. There are several factors involved when switching roosts, which can include canopy cover and height, decay stage of the roost, and tree height&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patriquin|first=Krista J.|last2=Leonard|first2=Marty L.|last3=Broders|first3=Hugh G.|last4=Ford|first4=W. Mark|last5=Britzke|first5=Eric R.|last6=Silvis|first6=Alexander|date=December 2016|title=Weather as a proximate explanation for fission–fusion dynamics in female northern long-eared bats|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.09.022|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=122|pages=47–57|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.09.022|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Geographic regions contribute to the switching of roosts, as females have been shown to switch when temperatures rise in Kentucky, and less when in a colder climate in Nova Scotia&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. There are also three important behaviours involved in roost-switching, which are fission-fusion grouping, synchronized movement, and settlement behaviour&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Settlement behaviour is when bats remain in the most desirable roost possible, synchronized movement is when bats choose to move to another roost in a synchronized manner, and fission-fusion behaviour is when a bat colony separates into sub-colonies which then combine back together to form a large colony&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. A reason that bats can display fission-fusion behaviours is due to the risk of infection. Increased risk of disease can occur from settlement and synchronized behaviours, but fission-fusion societies  are capable of reducing the risk of disease. Fission-fusion societies are capable of reducing the risk because of the frequent separation into subgroups&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

==Structure==
{{uncited section|date=April 2017}}

These societies change frequently in their size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the "parent group". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a faunal community and often varies to track changes in their environment and based on individual animal dynamics.

In a fission–fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to [[Social environment|environmental]] or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities.

Overlapping of so-called "parent groups" territorially is also frequent, resulting in more interaction and mingling of community members, further altering the make-up of the parent group. This results in instances where, say, a female chimpanzee may generally belong to one parent group, but encounters a male who belongs to a neighboring community. If they [[copulate]], the female may stay with the male for several days and come into contact with his parent group, temporarily "fusing" into the male's community. In some cases, animals may leave one parent group to associate themselves with another, usually for reproductive reasons.

The '''Fletcher Foundation''' is a nonprofit foundation that supports [[civil rights]], [[education]], and [[environmental education]].  The foundation supports efforts to develop a more just society with more equal opportunities for more of the population primarily by leveraging the financial and non-financial contributions of Fletcher Asset Management, the Fletcher Family including New York financier and philanthropist [[Buddy Fletcher|Alphonse Fletcher, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;http://fletcherphilanthropy.org&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Fletcher Asset Management has been accused of fraud related to its management of funds and the value of pledges Fletcher's charitable pledges are in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theday.com/article/20131215/NWS01/312159915/Waterford-success-story-Buddy-Fletcher-accused-of-fraud Waterford success story Buddy Fletcher accused of fraud] 12/15/2014 The Day&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 graduate of [[Harvard University]], Fletcher worked in investment banking and in 1991 founded Fletcher Asset Management. A Harvard Class Marshal, Fletcher endowed a University Professorship at his alma mater, first held by philosopher [[Cornel West]] and now held by literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]]. In 2004, in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the Fletcher Foundation announced the creation of the Alphonse Fletcher, Sr. Fellowship program, described by foundation chair Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as "Guggenheims for race issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses Fletcher Fellowship Awarded to Bob Moses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113224256/http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses |date=2007-11-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural class of Fletcher Fellows, each awarded $50,000, was selected in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18852">The '''Global Terrorism Index''' ('''GTI''') is a report published annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace|Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)]], and was developed by IT entrepreneur and IEP's founder [[Steve Killelea]].

The index provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism since 2000. It produces a composite score in order to provide an ordinal ranking of countries on the impact of terrorism.

It is an attempt to systematically rank the nations of the world according to [[Terrorism|terrorist]] activity. The index combines a number of factors associated with terrorist attacks to build an explicit picture of the impact of terrorism, illustrating trends, and providing a data series for analysis by researchers and policymakers.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database]] (GTD) which is collected and collated by the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START) at the [[University of Maryland]]. The GTD has codified over 150,000 cases of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the GTI|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/terrorismindex/about-the-gti/|accessdate=11 February 2013|page=Vision of Humanity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211055153/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/terrorismindex/about-the-gti/|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTI covers 163 countries, covering 99.7% of the world's population.

The aim of the report is to examine trends and to help inform a positive and practical debate about the future of terrorism and the required policy responses.

The GTI was developed in consultation with the [[Global Peace Index]] expert panel.

== Methodology ==
There is no single internationally accepted definition of what constitutes terrorism, IEP accepts the terminology and definitions agreed to by the authors of the GTD, the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)]] researchers and its advisory panel. The GTI therefore defines terrorism as “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/|title=Data Collection Methodology|website=www.start.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition recognises that terrorism is not only the physical act of an attack, but also the psychological impact it has on a society for many years after.

In order to be included as an incident in the GTD the act has to be: “an intentional act of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor". This means an incident has to meet three criteria in order for it to be counted as a terrorist act:

# The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator. 
# The incident must entail some level of violence or threat of violence — including property damage, as well as violence against people. 
# The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. This database does not include acts of state terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===GTI scoring system===

The GTI score for a country in a given year is based on a unique scoring system to account for the relative impact of incidents in the year. There are four factors counted in each country's yearly score:

* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of terrorist incidents in a given year]]
* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism in a given year]]
* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of injuries caused by terrorism in a given year]]
* The approximate level of total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year

Each of the factors is weighted differently and a five-year weighted average is applied to importantly reflect the lingering psychological effect of terrorist acts over time. The weightings shown in the table below were determined by consultation with the GPI Expert Panel:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Weight
|-
| Total number of incidents || 1
|-
| Total number of fatalities || 3
|-
| Total number of injuries || 0.5
|-
| Sum of property damages measure || 2
|}

The greatest weighting is attributed to a fatality. The property damage measure is further disaggregated into four bands depending on the measured scope of the property damage inflicted by one incident. These bandings are shown in the table below, whereby incidents causing less than US$1 million are accorded a weight of 1, between $1 million and $1 billion, and more than $1 billion. A great majority of incidents are coded in the GTD as an 'unknown' level of property damage, thus scoring nil, with 'catastrophic' events being extremely rare.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Damage level
|-
| 0 || Unknown
|-
| 1 || Minor (likely &lt; $1 million)
|-
| 2 || Major (likely between $1 million and $1 billion)
|-
| 3 || Catastrophic (likely &gt; $1 billion)
|-
|}

===Example of a country's GTI score===

To assign a relative number to how a country has been directly impacted by terrorism in any given year, for every incident recorded, the GTI calculates a weighted sum of all indicators. To illustrate, the table below depicts a hypothetical country's score for a given year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Weight !! # of records for the given year !! Score
|-
| Total number of incidents || 1 || 21 || 21
|-
| Total number of fatalities || 3 || 36 || 108
|-
| Total number of injuries || 0.5 || 53 || 26.5
|-
| Sum of property damages measure (depending on severity) || 0-3 || 20 || 40
|-
| '''Total raw score''' || colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | '''195.5'''
|}

==Economic impact of terrorism==
The economic impact of terrorism is calculated using IEP's cost of violence methodology.

The model includes both the direct and indirect costs, such as the lost life-time earnings, cost of medical treatments and property destruction from incidents of terrorism. The direct costs include those borne by the victim of the terrorist act and associated expenditure, such as medical spending. The indirect costs include lost productivity and earning as well as the psychological trauma to the victims, their families and friends.

The analysis presents conservative estimates of the economic impact of terrorism and does not include variables for which detailed appropriate data was not available. For instance, the analysis does not include the impact on business, the cost of fear from terrorism or the cost of counterterrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-terrorism-index-2016|title=Global Terrorism Index 2016|date=2016-11-17|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2017-07-13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of terrorism reached US$89.6 billion in 2015, decreasing by 15 per cent from its 2014 level.

There have been three peaks in the economic impact of terrorism since the year 2000 and they are linked to the three major waves of terrorism. The first large increase in the economic impact of terrorism happened in 2001, when the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] took place. The second peak was in 2007 at the height of the Iraq war. The 2007 increase is mainly attributed to al-Qa'ida affiliated terrorist groups and coincided with the coalition troop surge in Iraq. The third wave started in 2012 and is still continuing, with the economic impact of terrorism peaking at US$105.6 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/what-is-the-economic-impact-of-terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the last four years was mainly driven by increases in terrorism in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications by year==
[[Institute for Economics and Peace]] has published five editions of the Global Terrorism Index to date.

===2012===
The first edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in 2012. The study covered analysis of 158 countries. Data showed that terrorism increased by 234 per cent from 2002 to 2011.

The 2012 report found that the global impact of terrorism increased significantly from 2002 to 2007, reaching its peak in 2007, and subsequently plateauing. The biggest rise took place over the period from 2005 to 2007 when the majority of the global increase in terrorism was driven by events in Iraq. Four other countries also significantly contributed to the global rise with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Philippines all experiencing increases, especially between 2007 and 2009.

Only 20 nations scored a zero for terrorist impact over the 2002-2011 period, indicating the impact of terror, while heavily concentrated in some places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, was widely distributed around the world.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2011 were, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Yemen. Including these countries, the top ten countries affected by terrorism accounted for 87 per cent of total global incidents.

===2014===
The second edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2014. The study covered analysis of 162 countries. From 2000 to 2013 there was a five-fold increase in the number of people killed by terrorism, resulting in approximately 18,000 deaths.

Of the 162 countries, 87 experienced a terrorist incident, but only 60 countries recorded one or more deaths from terrorism in 2013. Worldwide over 50 per cent of terrorist attacks claimed no fatalities and only 10 per cent claimed more than five lives. Explosives were used for 60 per cent of attacks, with firearms used in 30 per cent and 10 per cent of attacks using other weapons.

In 2013 terrorist activity increased substantially with the total number of deaths rising from 11,133 in 2012 to 17,958 in 2013, a 61 per cent increase. Over the same period, the number of countries that experienced more than 50 deaths rose from 15 to 24. This highlighted that not only was the intensity of terrorism increasing, its breadth was increasing as well.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2013 were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Four terrorist groups, ISIL, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qa'ida, claimed 66 per cent of deaths in 2013. Among OECD countries, Turkey and Mexico reported the highest deaths in 2013 losing 57 and 40 lives respectively. Since 2000, seven per cent of all terrorist incidents occurred in OECD countries.

===2015===
[[File:Global Terrorism Index 2015 by country.svg|thumb|A world map indicating the GTI by country (based on 2015 data)]]

The third edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2015. The study covered analysis of 162 countries. Data from 2014 showed there has been a nine-fold increase in the number of deaths from terrorism since 2000.

Terrorist activity increased by 80 per cent in 2014 to its highest recorded level. The largest ever year-on-year increase in deaths from terrorism was recorded in 2014, rising from 18,111 in 2013 to 32,685 in 2014. Terrorism deaths spread geographically as well with the number of countries experiencing over 500 deaths increasing from five to 11.

The rise in terrorism can largely be attributed to two groups: [[ISIS]]; and [[Boko Haram]], the Nigerian jihadist group that pledged allegiance to ISIS in March 2015. Combined, these groups were responsible for 51% of all terrorism-related deaths in 2014.

In the West, lone wolf attacks account for 70 per cent of terrorist deaths since 2006. Amongst lone actors, few attacks were inspired by Islamic fundamentalism, with 80 per cent of attacks were attributed to a range of right-wing extremists, nationalists, and other types of political extremism and supremacism.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2014 were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. Terrorism increased most significantly in Nigeria, where deaths increased by over 300 per cent to 7,512 fatalities.

===2016===
[[File:Global Terrorism Index 2016 by country.svg|thumb|A world map indicating the GTI by country (2016)]]
The fourth edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2016. The study covered analysis of 163 countries. Overall, the global GTI score decreased by six per cent.

In 2015, the number of deaths from terrorism decreased by ten percent, the first decline since 2010. However, the 29,376 deaths recorded still rank 2015 as the second deadliest year on record. While much attention has been devoted to ISIL, the Taliban recorded its deadliest year in Afghanistan.

As with the past three years, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria suffered the highest levels of terrorism, accounting for 72 per cent of all deaths from terrorism in 2015. Large decreases in fatalities in Iraq and Nigeria accounted for a large portion of the worldwide decrease.

Conversely, in OECD member countries, deaths from terrorism dramatically increased in 2015, rising by 650 per cent when compared to 2014. Twenty-one of the 34 OECD countries experienced at least one terrorist attack with the majority of deaths occurring in Turkey and France. Of attacks conducted in the United States, 98 per cent were carried out by lone actors, resulting in 156 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/global-terrorism-index-2016-developed-countries-suffer-dramatic-rise-deaths-a7419396.html|title=The 10 developed countries that have suffered the most deaths from terrorism|date=2016-11-15|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The fifth edition of the Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2017. The study covered analysis of 163 countries. The global GTI scored deteriorated by four per cent from 2015 to 2016.

Overall, deaths from terrorism have fallen for the second consecutive year, resulting in a 22 per cent decrease since the peak in 2014. At an all-time high, 106 countries experienced at least one terrorist attack. Of these, 77 countries recorded at least one death, an increase from 65 countries in 2015.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Pakistan remain the top five countries most affected by terrorism, however Nigeria also saw the greatest reduction in deaths. In 2016, deaths attributed to Boko Haram decreased by 80 per cent, however, deaths attributed to ISIL increased by 49 per cent. Together these five countries accounted for three quarters of all deaths from terrorism in 2016.

OECD countries have experienced a rise in terrorism, accounting for one per cent of global deaths from terrorism in 2016. In 2010 OECD countries accounted for just 0.1 per cent of deaths. Attacks in OECD countries have shifted tactics since 2014 to utilize simpler methods against non-traditional targets. Less sophisticated attacks can be executed at a lower cost and can be more difficult to detect. Positively, the first six months of 2017 have recorded 82 deaths from terrorism, lower than the 265 deaths in 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4610">'''The "Simion Stoilow" Institute of [[Mathematics]] of the Romanian Academy''' is a [[research institute]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. 

== History ==

On December 29th, 1945, a group of twenty Romanian mathematicians from various institutions in Bucharest led by [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] held a meeting at the [[University of Bucharest]] to establish ''The Institute of Mathematical Sciences'' with the aim of "promoting scientific research in mathematical sciences, through communications, talks, publications, congresses, and other means proper to this aim". In January 1946 they registered the Institute as a [[legal person]], specifically an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], with the [[Ilfov County]] Court. On June 9th, 1948 the new [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist regime]] revamped the [[Romanian Academy]] to an institution modeled on the [[Russian_Academy_of_Sciences#The_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_USSR|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], increasing by 1966 the number of its member research centers and institutes from 7 to 56. Among the newly created institutes was ''The Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy'', established in 1949 on the basis of the previous NGO with the contribution of [[Simion Stoilow]], one of the twenty founding members in 1945. 

In 1974, [[Zoia Ceauşescu]], a graduate of the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Bucharest, and the daughter of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], the communist head of state, was hired by the institute. Her parents were not happy with her choice in studying Mathematics. Provoked by a verbal disagreement with [[Miron Nicolescu]], in April 1975, Ceauşescu issued a decree to close down the Institute. The ensued disruption of normal scientific life led to eventual departure from Romania of a number of leading mathematicians, including [[Ciprian Foias]] and [[Dan-Virgil Voiculescu]]. In 1978, with contribution from Zoia Ceauşescu some of the former members of the Institute were hired into a newly established Mathematical section of the National Institute Scientific and Technical Creation (''Institutul National pentru Creatie Stiintifica si Tehnica'', INCREST), previously known as the Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Aerospace Research (''Institutul de Mecanica Fluidelor si Cercetari Aerospatiale'', IMFCA), currently a private company (''INAV S.A.''), owned by [[:ro:Serviciile Comerciale Române|Grupul S.C.R.]].

After the [[1989 Romanian Revolution]], the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy (abbreviated IMAR) was re-established on March 8th, 1990 by a decree of the post-Communist Romanian government. It was placed under the Romanian Academy, itself partially reorganized by a decree of the same government on January 5th, 1990.

==Current situation==

Currently, IMAR is the leading Romanian institution in Mathematics research, with about 100 full- and part-time researchers. In 2000-2004, the Institute was a Centre of Excellence in Research of the [[European Commission]]. Since 2008, IMAR has a ''Laboratoire Européen Associé'' collaboration with [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. The Institute publishes two scientific journals (''Mathematical Reports'' and ''Revue roumaine de Mathématiques pures et appliquées''), and organizes many specialized conferences and congresses. Some of its members are well-known mathematicians.

IMAR also hosts the Theta Foundation, a not-for-profit independent publisher of scientific mathematical literature, and SNS-B, an independent postgraduate-level teaching initiative to guide towards research the best Romanian students. 

The Institute is located on Calea Griviţei street in downtown Bucharest in the same building it had before 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">'''International Student/Young Pugwash''' ('''ISYP''') is an [[international organization]] that promotes awareness and action among students and young professionals in relation to [[ethics|ethical]] implications of science and technology [[science policy|policy]], particularly matters of [[international security]] and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. It developed from the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]].

==History==
Students have been invited as participants in Pugwash Conferences since the early 1970s. Following interest to create a forum specifically for students, student/young Pugwash groups started to form in the late 70s, [[Student Pugwash USA]] doing so in 1979. International collaboration among the groups began in 1988 in the [[Netherlands]] for the first jointly organized IS/YP conference. Student pre-conferences to the annual Pugwash Conferences began at the 1997 Pugwash Conference held in [[Norway]].

==Organization==
ISYP's members comprise national groups, which themselves may comprise loose or formal collections of [[school]] or [[university]] chapters. National entities include [[Student Pugwash USA]] (SPUSA), the largest, and Student Pugwash UK (SPUK) among others.

Although Ainsworth knew the son as an old man, and could not have met the inventor himself, Lord (1903) wrote that this ''"settles the question of doubt as regards the portraits which [[#Thomas Sutcliffe|Lieut.-Col. Sutcliffe]] put into circulation as a portrait of his great-grandfather"'' (the fly-shuttle inventor) because Ainsworth is a more reliable source than Sutcliffe, who originated the claim that the elder John Kay is pictured.

His final year is often given as 1764 (for instance, [http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10301969 by the London Science Museum]) and often as 1780 (e.g. the BBC's ''History of the world'' [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/Jpw-PO_7S2WyQkkpYdyfTQ gives a 1780 death date] in the [[South of France]] at age 76).

'''John Kay''' (17 June 1704 – c. 1779) was the inventor of the [[flying shuttle]], which was a key contribution to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He is often confused with [[John Kay (spinning frame)|his namesake]],&lt;ref name="JK3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnkay.com/2003/01/02/weaving-the-fine-fabric-of-success/|title=Weaving the fine fabric of success|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2 January 2003|accessdate=2 June 2010|first=J.|last=Kay|authorlink=John Kay (economist)|quote=technological progress is equally dependent on skills of invention and the management of invention}} ([[John Kay (economist)|John Kay's]] essay on the two John Kays of the Industrial Revolution).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "confusion"/&gt; who built the first "spinning frame".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Lancashire worthies|first=F.|last=Espinasse|authorlink=Francis Espinasse|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, &amp; Co|year=1874|oclc=10973235}} "who has not the slightest connection with John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle" (p. 330)... "John Kay, a watchmaker, who is not for a moment to be confounded with John Kay of Bury, the undoubted inventor of the fly-shuttle" (p. 378)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Kay was born on 18 June 1704 in the [[Lancashire]] hamlet of [[Walmersley]],&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt; just north of [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. His [[yeoman farmer]] father, Robert, owned the "Park" estate in Walmersley, and John was born there.&lt;ref&gt;Lord (1903) p.86 – The Park House, pictured.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert died before John was born, leaving Park House to his eldest son. As Robert's fifth son (out of ten children), John was bequeathed £40 (at age 21) and an education until the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;Lord (1903) p.76&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was responsible for educating him until she remarried.

===Apprenticeship===
He apprenticed with a [[Reed (weaving)|hand-loom reed]] maker, but is said to have returned home within a month claiming to have mastered the business.&lt;ref&gt;Lord (1903) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a [[Reed (weaving)#History|metal substitute]] for the natural reed that proved popular enough for him to sell throughout England.&lt;ref name="confusion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/JohnKayo.htm |title= John Kay, inventor of the flying shuttle |page= 1 |date= 8 December 2007 |work= Cotton Times: understanding the Industrial Revolution |accessdate= 2 June 2010 |quote= The life of John Kay is sketchy and frequently confusing. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604214918/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/JohnKayo.htm |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After travelling the country, making and fitting wire reeds, he returned to Bury and, on 29 June 1725, both he and his brother, William, married Bury women. John's wife was Anne Holte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lord |first1= John    |title= Memoir of John Kay   |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=zAEPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=121 |year= 1903 |page= 132 |chapter= Genealogical Records   |isbn= 978-1-150-68477-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Lettice was born in 1726, and his son [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]] in 1728.&lt;ref name= "RobBorn"&gt;Lord (1903) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bury he continued to design improvements to textile machinery; in 1730 he patented a [[cord (sewing)|cord]]ing and [[Short draw#Technique|twisting]] machine for [[worsted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=605&amp;language=eng |title= John Kay 1704–1780 Inventor of the Flying Shuttle |accessdate= 1 June 2010 |publisher=Cotton Town website|deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100923014758/http://cottontown.org/page.cfm?LANGUAGE=eng&amp;pageID=605 |archivedate= 23 September 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The flying shuttle==
In 1733,&lt;ref name="po"/&gt; he received a patent for his most revolutionary device: a "wheeled [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]" for the [[hand loom]].&lt;ref&gt;More specifically, for a "New Engine or Machine for Opening and Dressing Wool" that [[wiktionary:incorporate|incorporated]] his flying shuttle – [http://www.biography.com/articles/John-Kay-9361108 John Kay Biography (1704–1764)]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. A less important portion  of the same patent (British patent no. 542) describes the 'batting machine' he had invented to [[Contamination control|rid]] the wool of [[dust]]. The critical specification attached to the patent dated 26 May 1733 (No. 542) describes "''A new invented shuttle, for the better and more exact weaving of broad cloths, broad bays, sail cloths or any other broad goods...by running on four wheels moves over the lower side of the web and spring, on a board about nine feet long... a small cord commanded by the hand of the weaver, the weaver, sitting in the middle of the loom, with great ease and expedition by a small pull at the cord casts or moves the said new invented shuttle from side to side''", quoted in Mantoux (1928).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It greatly accelerated [[weaving]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed for the broad loom, for which it saved labour over the [[Textile manufacturing by pre-industrial methods#Loom|traditional process]], needing only one operator per loom (before Kay's improvements [[Weaving#Industrial Revolution|a second worker was needed]] to catch the shuttle).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Cotton |url= https://archive.org/stream/cottoncotton00bigwrich/cottoncotton00bigwrich_djvu.txt |volume=II |series= Staple trades and industries |first1= G.|last1= Bigwood |editor1-first=G. D. |editor1-last=Knox |page= 37 |publisher= Holt |location= New York  |quote= he gave to the weaver's shuttle a mechanical impulse entirely displacing the shuttle which up to that time had been thrown backwards across the loom by two operatives. This old shuttle was practically the same as that [[s:Bible (King James)/Job#Chapter 7|mentioned in the Book of Job]]   |year= 1919  |oclc=  2052367}} (However, the Bury town meeting called to honour John Kay in 1903 noted that the biblical shuttle was still in use at that time in India, where two people often still worked a single loom —though [[Girangaon|mill production was flourishing]] there.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay always called this invention a "wheeled shuttle", but others used the name "fly-shuttle" (and later, "flying shuttle") because of its continuous speed, especially when a young worker was using it in a narrow loom. The shuttle was described as travelling at "a speed which cannot be imagined, so great that the shuttle can only be seen like a tiny cloud which disappears the same instant."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Platière|Roland de la Platière]], [[Encyclopédie Méthodique]] (1785). Translation given in Mann (1931) p.470. If Roland wrote this part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique, he was writing about a shuttle he'd seen in [[Rouen]] in 1785, that would have been manufactured under Kay's supervision, or modelled after his design.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===

In July 1733, Kay formed a partnership in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]] to begin fly-shuttle manufacturing.&lt;ref name= "flyIntro"&gt;{{cite book |last2= Wadsworth |first2= A. P. |last1= Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931  |chapter= The introduction of the fly shuttle  |publisher= Manchester University Press  |page= 451  |quote= As one of the principal centres for the manufacture of bays, which were largely made on the [[wiktionary:broad|broad]] loom, it [Colchester] offered as good an opportunity as could be found in any place for discovering a partner with capital to take up the invention... Kay and Smith each took two shares and Abbott one of the five into which the patent was divided.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; No industrial unrest was anticipated, this being the [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution#Industry and Invention|first device of the modern era]] to significantly enhance productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Popular Science |volume= 118 |issue= 3 – 154 pages – Magazine |first= M. |last= Mok |title= Will you lose your job because of a new machine?  |date=March 1931  |page= 19}}
&lt;/ref&gt; But by September 1733 the Colchester weavers, were so concerned for their livelihoods that they petitioned the King to stop Kay's inventions.&lt;ref name="flyIntro"/&gt;

The flying shuttle was to create a particular imbalance by doubling weaving [[productivity]] without changing the rate at which thread could be spun,&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;
{{cite book |title = All the year round |editor1-first= C. |editor1-last=Dickens |editor1-link = Charles Dickens |volume= 3 |page= 63 |year=1860 |oclc= 1479125 |quote= the natural balance between spinning and weaving was so much disturbed. John Kay, of Bury, had just invented the fly-shuttle, which enabled the weaver to get through as much work again as before; and he had been mobbed and nearly killed for his pains. He escaped, wrapped up in a sheet of [[cotton wool]], and was thus carried bodily through the mob }}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disruptive technology|disrupting]] spinners and weavers alike.

&lt;span id="BobbinImprovements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Kay tried to promote the fly-shuttle in Bury, but could not convince the woollen manufacturers that it was sufficiently robust; he spent the next two years improving the technology, until it had several advantages over the device specified in the 1733 patent. This was to be one of his difficulties in the coming patent disputes.&lt;ref name= "biggerShuttle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931 |volume = The transition to machine spinning    |pages= 452–454  |quote= No one denied that Kay had invented the wooden tenders and cord, by the use of which weaving the broad loom could be done by one man instead of two, but this was represented to have given rise to so many difficulties that Kay himself had done away with it... [A patent-action defendant] justified himself by pointing out that the fixed [[Bobbin|spool]] was not mentioned in the patent, and that the large 24-inch shuttle which he had been making was completely different from the 15-inch shuttle used by Kay in his first demonstration. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1738 Kay went to [[Leeds]], where his problem had become [[royalties|royalty]] collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Industrial Revolution in the Eighteenth Century: An Outline of the Beginnings of the Modern Factory System in England |first1= P. |last1= Mantoux   |pages= 207–208 |chapter= Machinery in the textile industry |year= 1928 |isbn= 978-0-226-50384-4 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; (the annual licence fee was 15 [[Shilling (British coin)|Shillings]] per shuttle).&lt;ref name= "bio1998"&gt;
{{cite book| title= Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology |first1=R.

As an inventor Kay was a [[genius]] of the first rank, but he was vain, [[wiktionary:obstinate|obstinate]] and suspicious and was destitute of business qualities.  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to invent, patenting some machines in the same year, though these were not taken up industrially.&lt;ref name= "DoNB"&gt;
{{cite book| title= Dictionary of National Biography |volume=10 |first1= L. |last1= Stephen |first2= S. |last2= Lee |page= 1135 |chapter= KAY, JOHN   |year= 1908 |isbn= 978-1-146-79385-8 }} In 1738 Patent No. 561 was issued to Kay for a [[windmill]] for working pumps and for an improved pump-chain.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Shuttle Club===
Kay (and, initially, his partners) launched numerous [[Patent infringement under United Kingdom law|patent infringement]] lawsuits, but if any of these cases were successful,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last1= Mann |first1 = J. de L. |volume= V |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931 |ol = 16534004M  |pages= 451  |quote= Between 1737 and 1743 the [[Partnership#Common law|partners]] brought several actions against weavers for infringement of the patent. It is probable that none of them were ever [[Judgment (law)|decided]]. [[Court of Chancery#Further reform|Chancery proceedings were proverbially long]] drawn out, but in some of the earlier actions Kay's legal rights seem to have been doubtful.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; compensation was below the cost of prosecution. Rather than capitulate, the manufacturers formed "the Shuttle Club", a [[syndicate]] which paid the costs of any member brought to court; their strategy of [[Patent infringement#Piracy|patent piracy]] and mutual [[Insurance#Indemnification|indemnification]] nearly bankrupted Kay.&lt;ref name= "Weaver"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, he and Joseph Stell patented a machine for [[Ribbon#Cloth ribbon|cloth ribbon weaving]], which they anticipated might be worked by [[hydropower|water wheel]],&lt;ref name="po"/&gt; but they were unable to advance their plans because of Kay's legal costs.&lt;ref name= "DoNB"/&gt; Impoverished and harassed, Kay was compelled to leave Leeds, and he returned to Bury.&lt;ref name="harass"&gt;Barlow (1878) p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1745, John's twelfth (and final) child, William, was born.&lt;ref name="kids12"&gt;Lord (1903) p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay remained inventive; in 1746 he was working on an efficient method of salt production,&lt;ref name="Wad456"&gt;Mann (1931) p.456&lt;/ref&gt; and designing improvements to [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] technology – but that made him unpopular among Bury spinners.&lt;ref name="harass"/&gt; Also, fly-shuttle use was becoming widespread in weaving,&lt;ref&gt;Mantoux (1928) says that the shuttle appears in some districts much later, and violence against the 'engine weavers' was continuing in 1760s London (pg.208). In Britain, the invention was only acknowledged to be in 'general use' by 1760, and then only for cotton, but it was standard practice much earlier. In 1747, before making any offers to Kay, the French Government inquired in London about the shuttles' uptake, and were assured that "no one uses anything but his shuttles" – Mann (1931) p.467. The impression that the "fly-shuttle" had been very widely adopted by 1746 may have been due to a confusion of this advance with another that Kay had made [[#BobbinImprovements|in 1734–1735]]: in the method of shuttle bobbin winding to reduce breaks. It was this simpler step that was first widely copied and became known as "Kay's shuttle"; this improved, non-wheeled shuttle was in (dubiously legal) general use throughout Lancashire and Yorkshire by 1737, and also substantially increased productivity – see: Mann (1931) p.467-468.&lt;/ref&gt; increasing cotton [[yarn]] demand and its [[Price elasticity of demand|price]] – and Kay was blamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Industrial Revolution |first1= M. |last1= Beggs-Humphreys |first2= H. |last2=  Gregor |first3= D. |last3= Humphreys   |page= 19 |chapter= The revolution in spinning and weaving |quote= It became possible to make a much wider cloth than before, and to produce four times as much. |publisher= Routledge |series = Routledge [[Economic History]] |date=April 2006 |isbn= 978-0-415-38222-9 }}

He had suffered violent treatment in England, but he did not leave the country on that account, but because of his inability to enforce (or profit from) his patent rights.&lt;ref&gt;Inability to enforce patent is the reason given by Kay – Mann (1931) p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel-Charles Trudaine|Trudaine's]] ''Bureau de Commerce'' was known to support textile innovations (and would later actively recruit immigrant inventors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |volume= V |last1=  Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931  |chapter= The French Cotton Industry and its relations with England |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=XAsNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=193    |pages= 197–199  |quote= Trudaine had plans for introducing foreign workmen from every country which excelled in the cotton manufacture }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Probably encouraged by the prospect of state support,&lt;ref&gt;Mann (1931) p.195 proposes that the prospect of French state support attracted Kay and later inventors to France. Also, Kay's politics and religion would have been compatible (as that of Hugenotes [[Lewis Paul#Life and work|inventors]] probably [[Hugenots#Britain and Ireland|were not]]).&lt;/ref&gt; in 1747, Kay left England for France (where he had never been before, and did not speak the language).

===State subsidy===
He went to Paris, and throughout 1747 negotiated with the French Government (in [[English language|English]]) to sell them his technology.&lt;ref name="Wadsworth"&gt;{{cite book  |volume= V |last1=  Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931  |chapter= XXII(i) Kay's career in England and France  |publisher= Manchester University Press  |pages= 458–459  |quote= Kay himself desired a sum of money to be paid down for the entire rights to the shuttles, and asked what the Government considered the exorbitant price of £10,000 [[Pound sterling#Unofficial gold standard|sterling]]. }} (The amount Kay demanded would be equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|10000|1747|r=-4}}}} at today's prices.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Denied the huge [[lump sum]] he wanted, Kay finally agreed to 3,000 ''[[French livre#Eighteenth century|livres]]'' plus a pension of 2,500 ''livre'',&lt;ref name="bio1998"/&gt; (annually from 1749) in exchange for his patent, and instruction in its use (to the manufactures of [[Normandy]]). He retained the sole rights to shuttle production in France,&lt;ref&gt;He did not hold the right of production in [[Languedoc]], having sold all rights there (for 15,000 ''livres'') before reaching agreement with the French Government in 1749. But outside of Languedoc, he retained the monopoly on legal production of fly-shuttles for use in France, see: {{cite book |last2= Wadsworth |first2= A. P. |last1=  Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931  |chapter= Kay's career in England and France    |page= 460    }}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought three of his sons to Paris to make them. Although wary of entering the manufacturing provinces (because of his experiences with rioting weavers in England) he was prevailed upon to do so.

At one time, the French authorities may have discouraged his communication with England,&lt;ref&gt;Although Kay certainly did write to the Society of Arts, and was in contact with his sons in Bury, it was thought by some in England that was unreachable; a letter published in [http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-33456.pdf Williamson's Liverpool Advertiser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527220438/http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-33456.pdf |date=27 May 2006 }} is 7 February 1766 reads "''a long time ago he was obliged to decline all Correspondence with his native land as it was not agreeable to his new Masters''"&lt;/ref&gt; but Kay wrote about the unanticipated use of his technology in England to the French government: "My new shuttles are also used in England to make all sorts of narrow [[woolen|woollen]] goods, although their use could have been more perfect had the weavers [[Not Invented Here|consulted me]]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter in the [[Archives nationales (France)|French Archives nationales]]. Extract quoted p. 470 of Mann (1931) from [[Archives nationales (France)#Paris|the Paris archives]] range [http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/sm/F12partiel_2008.pdf F/12] (992 à 1083: Inventions &amp; related correspondence 1702–1830) section 993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of [[mechanisation]] in French textile production is traditionally dated to 1753, with the widespread adoption of the flying shuttle there.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last1= Smith |first1= M. S. |title= The emergence of modern business enterprise in France, 1800–1930   |date=January 2006   |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0-674-01939-3  |page= 132 |chapter= Textile capitalism   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these new shuttles were copies, not made by the Kays. John Kay unsuccessfully tried to enforce his manufacturing monopoly, and began to quarrel with the French authorities, briefly returning to England, in 1756&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last1=  Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931  |chapter= Kay's career in England and France    |page= 460    }}&lt;/ref&gt; (it is said that he was in his Bury home in 1753 when it was vandalised by a mob – and that he narrowly escaped with his life,&lt;ref name= "DoNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Barlow (1878) Kay only survived this 1753 break-in because "two friends carried him away in a wool sheet" -a story given by Dickens in his weekly magazine 28 April 1860, and traced back to a 1766 letter from an unconnected party in the ''Williamson's Liverpool Advertiser'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=XAsNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=456 by Mann (1931)]. Bennet Woodcroft's ''A Complete History of the Cotton Trade ''says he was smuggled out in a "sack of wool" (p.302).&lt;/ref&gt; but this is probably a 19th-century tale based on earlier Colchester riots; Kay was probably in France throughout the early 1750s).&lt;ref&gt;Although he (or his son) wrote of an anti-"Wheel Shuttle" riot, no mention of a 1753 attack predates the 19th century and this story has probably grown out of earlier disturbances in Colchester – see Mann (1931) p.456&lt;/ref&gt;

He found his prospects in England unimproved; by 1758 he was back in France, which became his adopted country,&lt;ref name="bio1998"/&gt; though he was to visit England at least twice more. In the winter of 1765/66 he appealed to the [[Royal Society of Arts]] to reward him for his inventions, and exhibited his card-making machine for them. The Society could find no-one who understood the shuttle,&lt;ref name="harass"/&gt; and there was a breakdown in correspondence, so that no award was ever made. He was in England again in 1773, but returned to France in 1774 having lost his pension (at aged 70).

===Old age===
His offer to teach pupils if the pension were restored was not taken up, and he spent his remaining years developing and building machines for cotton manufacturers in [[Sens]] and [[Troyes]]. Though he was busy with engineering and letter-writing until 1779, he received only 1,700 ''livres'' from the French state over these five years, reaching a state of penury in March 1778 before receiving his final advance (to develop yet more machinery).&lt;ref&gt;Mann (1931) p. 463-464&lt;/ref&gt;

His last known letter (8 June 1779) listed his latest achievements for the ''[[Intendant#Functions|Intendant]] de Commerce'', and proposed further inventions. But since these were never made, and no more is heard of the 75-year-old Kay, it is believed that he must have died later in 1779.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;Mann (1931) p. 464-465&lt;/ref&gt;

John Kay's son, Robert, stayed in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]],&lt;ref name= "RK"&gt;If Robert stayed in France at all, he had permanently returned to Bury by 1748. Since Robert was born in 1728, he probably never left Britain when John Kay did. See: {{cite book| title= Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology |first1=R.

&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled looms to use multiple flying shuttles simultaneously, allowing multicolour wefts.&lt;ref name= "HoS"/&gt;

His son John ("French Kay") had long resided with his father in France. In 1782 he provided an account of his father's troubles to [[Richard Arkwright]], who sought to highlight problems with patent defence in a parliamentary petition.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ford Madox Brown]] portrayed Kay and his invention in a [[The Manchester Murals|mural painting]] in [[Manchester Town Hall]].

===Thomas Sutcliffe===
In the 1840s, [[Thomas Sutcliffe (soldier)|Thomas Sutcliffe]] (one of Kay's great-grandsons) campaigned to promote a [[Colchester]] heritage for Kay's family. In 1846 he unsuccessfully sought a parliamentary [[Grant (money)|grant]] for Kay's descendants (in compensation for his ancestor's treatment in England).&lt;ref name= "DoNB"/&gt; He was inaccurate in the details of his grandfather's [[genealogy]] and story, and his "Fanciful and Erroneous Statements" were discredited by John Lord's detailed examination of [[primary source]]s.&lt;ref name="untrue"&gt;{{cite book   |last1=   Mann |first1 = J. de L. |title= The cotton trade and industrial Lancashire, 1600–1780 |year= 1931  |chapter= Kay's career in England and France  |publisher= Manchester University Press  |page= 449  |quote= These legends mainly originated in the imagination of his great-grandson...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6585">The '''Laminar Flamelet Model''' is one of the methods of modelling turbulent combustions apart from SCRS, [[Eddy break-up model for combustion|Eddy flamelet model]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Combustion | work = Online CFD website | publisher = CFD Online | url = http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Combustion#Flamelet_Model | accessdate = 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Combustion]] is a very important thermochemical process with significant material and aerodynamic implications and thus [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] modeling of combustion has become indispensable. The laminar flamelet model is basically for non pre-mixed fuel (the system in which the fuel and oxygen is supplied from two different pipes). The laminar flamelet model is different from the much more popular{{Cn|date=July 2016}} SCRS model as it includes the experimental information also which helps in bringing out much more intricate relationship between variables like temperature, mixture fractions and mass fractions.

== Theory ==

The flamelet concept considers the turbulent flame as an aggregate of thin, laminar(Re&lt;2000), locally one-dimensional flamelet structures present within the turbulent flow field. Counterflow diffusion flame is a common [[laminar flow|laminar]] flame which is used to represent a flamelet in a turbulent flow. Its geometry consists of opposed and axi-symmetric fuel and oxidizer jets. As the distance between the jets is decreased and/or the velocity of the jets is increased, the flame is strained and departs from its chemical equilibrium until it eventually extinguishes. The mass fraction of species and temperature fields can be measured or calculated in laminar counterflow diffusion flame experiments. When calculated, a self-similar solution exists, and the governing equations can be simplified to only one dimension i.e. along the axis of the fuel and oxidizer jets. It is in this direction where complex chemistry calculations can be performed affordably.&lt;ref name="Flamelet models"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ANSYS|first1=Fluent|title=Laminar flamelet models theory|url=http://aerojet.engr.ucdavis.edu/fluenthelp/html/ug/node634.htm|website=FLUENT|publisher=ANSYS|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assumptions ===

The following assumptions are made in the study of all the flamelet models:&lt;ref name="Flamelet's assumptions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ANSYS|first1=FLUENT|title=Assumptions|url=http://aerojet.engr.ucdavis.edu/fluenthelp/html/ug/node633.htm|website=Aerojet.eng|publisher=ANSYS|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;-

1. While modelling only a single mixture fraction are allowed. Modelling of two-mixture-fraction flamelet models is not possible.

2. It is assumed that the mixture fraction follow the  β-function PDF, and scalar dissipation fluctuations are not considered.

3. Empirically-based streams cannot be used.

== Logic and Formulae ==

To model a non-premixed combustion, governing equations for fluid elements are required.
The conservation equation  for the species mass fraction is as follows:-

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{\partial Y_k\over\partial t}= {\chi \over 2}{1\over Le_k}\biggl({\partial^2 Y_k\over\partial Z^2}\biggr) + {\omega_k \over \rho}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Lek→lewis number of kth species
And the above formula was derived with keeping constant [[heat capacity]]. The energy equation with variable heat capacity:-

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{c_p}{\partial T\over\partial t}= {\chi \over 2}\biggl({\partial^2 h\over\partial Z^2}\biggr) - {\sum_{k=1}^N h_k}\biggl\{ {\chi \over 2}{\partial^2 Y_k\over\partial Z^2} + {\omega_k \over \rho}\biggr\}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

As can be seen from above formulas that the mass fraction and temperature are dependent on

1.	Mixture fraction Z

2.	Scalar dissipation χ

3.	Time

Many a times we  neglect the unsteady terms in above equation and assume the local flame structure having a balance between steady chemical equations and steady diffusion equation which result in Steady Laminar Flamelet Models(SLFM).
For this an average value of  χ is computed known as ''favre'' value&lt;ref name=Formulae&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfuderer|first1=D.G.|last2=Neuber|first2=A.A.|last3=Fruchtel|first3=G.|last4=Hassel|first4=E.P.|last5=Janicka|first5=J.|title=Combustion flame|date=1996|volume=106|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{\tilde{\chi_{st}}}={\tilde{\chi} \over \int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac{F(Z)}{F(Z_{st})}\ P(Z)dZ}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{F(Z) = exp \bigl(-2 \bigl[erfc^{-1}(2Z) \bigr]^2 \bigr)}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

The basic assumption of a SLFM model is that  a turbulent flame front behaves locally as a one dimensional,steady and laminar which proves to be a very useful while reducing the situation to a much simpler terms but it does create problems as few of the effects are not accounted for.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of using this [[Combustion models for CFD|combustion model]] are as follows:-

1. They have the advantage of showing strong coupling between chemical reactions and molecular transport.

2. The steady laminar flamelet model is also used to predict chemical non-equilibrium due to aerodynamic straining of the flame by the turbulence.

== Disadvantages ==
The disadvantages of Steady Laminar Flamelet model due to above mentioned reason are:&lt;ref name=Disadvantages&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitsch|first1=H.|last2=Peters|first2=N.|title=Unsteady Flamelet Modelling Of Turbulent Hydrogen-Air Diffusion Flames|journal=Twenty-Seventh Symposium (International) on Combustion/The Combustion Institute|date=1998|volume=pp. 1057–1064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	It doesn’t account for the curvature effects which can change the flame structure and is more detrimental while the structure hasn’t reached the quasi- steady state.

2.	Such Transient effects also arise  in turbulent flow, the scalar dissipation  experience  a sudden change. As the  flame structure  take time to get  stabilize.

To improve the above SLFM models, few more models has been proposed like Transient laminar flamelet model ( TLFM) by Ferreira .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">The term '''learner-generated context''' originated in the suggestion that an educational context might be described as a learner-centric ecology of resources and that a learner generated context is one in which a group of users collaboratively marshall available resources to create an ecology that meets their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R., du Boulay, B., Smith, H., Underwood, J., Fitzpatrick, G., Holmberg, J., Kerawalla, L., Tunley, H., Brewster, D. and Pearce, D. (2005), 'Using Mobile Technology to Create Flexible Learning Contexts '. Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R. (2006), Understanding Learning Contexts as Ecologies of Resources: From the Zone of Proximal Development to Learner Generated Contexts. Paper presented at the Proceedings of World Conference on Elearning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R., Shurville, S. and Browne, T. (2007), 'Initiating elearning by stealth, participation and consultation in a late majority institution'. Organisational Transformation and Social Change, 3, 4, 317–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many discussions about [[user-generated content]] (UGC), [[open educational resources]] (OER), [[distributed cognition]] and [[communities of practice]] but, although acknowledging the importance of the learning process, there has been little focus on learner-generated contexts or the impact of new technologies on the role of teacher, learner and institution.

==Background==
The term learner-generated context (LGC) is grounded in the premise that learning and teaching should not start with the embracing of new technologies, but rather that it is a matter of contextualising the learning first before supporting it with technology.&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R. et al.,(2007) [http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/getfile.cfm?documentfileid=12188 Learner-Generated Contexts: sustainable learning pathways through open content] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122058/http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/getfile.cfm?documentfileid=12188 |date=2011-07-27 }}, [http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/conference.php OpenLearn07 Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212104113/http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn/openlearn2007/conference.php |date=2008-12-12 }}, Milton Keynes&lt;/ref&gt; The concept finds its roots in the [[affordances]] and potentials of a range of [[disruptive technologies]] and practice; [[web 2.0]] and [[participative media]], [[mobile learning]], [[learning design]] and [[learning space design]]. It is also concerned with related issues in social interactions with technology around roles, expertise, knowledge, pedagogy, [[accreditation]], power, participation and democracy.

The learner-generated context concept is concerned with examining the rapid increase in the variety and availability of resources and tools that enable people to easily create and publish their own materials and to access those created by others, and ways in which this extends the capacity for [[learning context creation]] beyond the traditional contexts of, ''inter alia'', teachers, academics, designers and policymakers. It is also a concept which challenges existing pedagogies insofar as it sees a new generation of [[read-write memory|read/write]], [[participatory technologies]] as enabling learners to take ownership of both their learning and their actions in the real world and to contribute to the co-design of learning resources. In learner generated contexts, technology is seen to offer new dimensions for [[active participation]] and creativity in learning.

==Definition==
The [http://learnergeneratedcontexts.pbwiki.com/Learner+Generated+Contexts+Group Learner Generated Contexts Research Group] was formed at a workshop in Bath (UK) in March 2007. This interdisciplinary research group based at the [http://www.lkl.ac.uk/ London Knowledge Lab] defines a '''learner generated context''' (LGC) as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A context created by people interacting together with a common, self- defined or negotiated learning goal. The key aspect of Learner Generated Contexts is that they are generated through the enterprise of those who would previously have been consumers in a context created for them''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* learning moves from regulated practice(s) towards participative collaboration and co-creation
* learner needs participatory control of the learning environment
* environment is physical, social and cognitive
* learning design is purposeful – the 'preferred' and 'best' learning context may not be identical
* co-configuration, co-creation and co-design of learning space allows learners to create their own context
* new and relevant learning contexts are generated by needs and questions arising in social interactions

In [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], the '''method of complements''' is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in [[mechanical calculator]]s and is still used in modern [[computers]].

The ''nines' complement'' of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number ''y'' (the [[subtrahend]]) from another number ''x'' (the [[minuend]]) two methods may be used:

In the first method the nines' complement of ''x'' is added to ''y''. Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.
 
In the second method the nines' complement of ''y'' is added to ''x'' and one is added to the sum.  The leading digit  '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the ''ten's complement.''

The method of complements can be extended to other number bases ([[radix|radices]]); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or [[Binary number|binary arithmetic]] and test underflow and overflow in calculation.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.fit.edu/~wds/classes/adm/Lectures/TensComplement.pdf Florida Tech]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Numeric complements==
&lt;!-- linked here from [[Midy's theorem]] --&gt;

The '''radix complement''' of an ''n'' digit number ''y'' in [[radix]] ''b'' is, by definition, &lt;math&gt;b^n-y&lt;/math&gt;.  The radix complement is most easily obtained by adding 1 to the '''diminished radix complement''', which is &lt;math&gt;(b^n-1)-y&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;(b^n-1)&lt;/math&gt; is the digit &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt; repeated ''n'' times (because &lt;math&gt;b^n-1 = (b-1)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}+...+b+1)=(b-1)b^{n-1}+...+(b-1)&lt;/math&gt;; see also [[Geometric series|Geometric series Formula]]), the diminished radix complement of a number is found by complementing each digit with respect to &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt; (that is, subtracting each digit in ''y'' from &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt;).

The subtraction of ''y'' from ''x'' may be performed as follows. 
Adding the diminished radix complement of ''x'' to ''y'' results in the value &lt;math&gt;b^n-1-x + y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b^n -1-(x-y)&lt;/math&gt; which is the diminished radix complement of &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;, except for possible padding digits &lt;math&gt;b-1&lt;/math&gt;. The diminished radix complement of this is the value &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, adding the radix complement of ''y'' to ''x'' results in the value &lt;math&gt;x+b^n-y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x-y+b^n&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming ''y ≤ x'' , the result will always be greater or equal to &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt; and dropping the initial '1' is the same as subtracting &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt;, making the result &lt;math&gt;x-y+b^n-b^n&lt;/math&gt; or just &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;, the desired result.

In the [[decimal]] numbering system, the radix complement is called the ''ten's complement'' and the diminished radix complement the ''nines' complement''. In [[Binary numeral system|binary]], the radix complement is called the ''two's complement'' and the diminished radix complement the ''ones' complement''. The naming of complements in other bases is similar.  Some people, notably [[Donald Knuth]], recommend using the placement of the apostrophe to distinguish between the radix complement and the diminished radix complement.  In this usage, the ''four's complement'' refers to the radix complement of a number in base four while ''fours' complement'' is the diminished radix complement of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice. Most writers use ''one's'' and ''nine's complement'', and many style manuals leave out the apostrophe, recommending ''ones'' and ''nines complement''.

The nines' complement  of a decimal digit is the number that must be added to it to produce 9; the complement of 3 is 6, the complement of 7 is 2, and so on, see table. To form the nines' complement of a larger number, each digit is replaced by its nines' complement.

Consider the following subtraction problem:

   873  (x, the minuend)
 - 218  (y, the subtrahend)

=== First method ===
We compute the nines' complement of the minuend, 873. Add that to the subtrahend 218, then calculate the nines' complement of the result.

   126  (nines' complement of x)
 + 218  (y, the subtrahend)

{{=}}
   344
Now calculate the nines' complement of the result

   344 (result)
   655 (nine's complement of result, the correct answer)

=== Second method ===

We compute the nines' complement of 218, which is 781. Because 218 is three digits long, this is the same as subtracting 218 from 999.

Next, the sum of ''x'' and the nines' complement of ''y'' is taken:

   873  (x)
 + 781  (nines' complement of y = 999-y)

{{=}}
  1654  (999 + x-y)
 
The leading "1" digit is then dropped, giving 654.

  1654
 -1000  -(999 + 1)

{{=}}
   654  (x-y-1)

This is not yet correct. We have essentially added 999 to the equation in the first step. Then we removed 1000 when we dropped the leading 1 in the result 1654 above. This will thus make the answer we get (654) one less than the correct answer &lt;math&gt;(x-y)&lt;/math&gt;. To fix this, we must add 1 to our answer:

  654
   +1

{{=}}
  655  (x-y)

Adding a 1 gives 655, the correct answer to our original subtraction problem.

=== Magnitude of numbers ===

In the following example the result of the subtraction has fewer digits than ''x'':

    123410 (x, the minuend)
  - 123401 (y, the subtrahend)

Using the first method the sum of the nines' complement of ''x'' and ''y'' is

    876589 (nines' complement of x)
 +  123401 (y)

{{=}}
    999990
The nines' complement of 999990 is 000009. Removing the leading zeros gives 9 the desired result.

If the subtrahend, ''y'', has fewer digits than the minuend, ''x'', leading zeros must be added in the second method. These zeros become leading nines when the complement is taken. For example:

   48032  (x)
 -   391  (y)

can be rewritten

   48032  (x)
 - 00391  (y with leading zeros)

Replacing 00391 with its nines' complement and adding 1 produces the sum:

   48032  (x)
 + 99608  (nines' complement of y)
 +     1

{{=}}
  147641

Dropping the leading"1" gives the correct answer: 47641.

==Binary method==
{| class="wikitable floatright"
! Binary&lt;br&gt;digit
! Ones' &lt;br&gt;complement
|-align="center"
| 0
| 1
|-align="center"
| 1
| 0
|}
The method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones' complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing '0' to '1' and vice versa). Adding 1 to get the two's complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:

   01100100  (x, equals decimal 100)
 - 00010110  (y, equals decimal 22)

becomes the sum:

   01100100  (x)
 + 11101001  (ones' complement of y)
 +        1  (to get the two's complement)

{{=}}

  101001110

Dropping the initial "1" gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)

==Negative number representations==
{{main article|Signed number representations}}

The method of complements normally assumes that the operands are positive and that ''y'' ≤ ''x'', logical constraints given that adding and subtracting arbitrary integers is normally done by comparing signs, adding the two or subtracting the smaller from the larger, and giving the result the correct sign.

Let's see what happens if ''x'' &lt; ''y''. In that case, there will not be a "1" digit to cross out after the addition since &lt;math&gt;x-y+b^n&lt;/math&gt; will be less than &lt;math&gt;b^n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, (in decimal):

   185  (x)
 - 329  (y)

Complementing ''y'' and adding gives:

   185  (x)
 + 670  (nines' complement of y)
 +   1

{{=}}
   856

This is obviously the wrong answer; the expected answer is -144. But it isn't as far off as it seems; 856 happens to be the ten's complement of 144. This issue can be addressed in three ways:
* Ignore the issue. This is reasonable if a person is operating a calculating device that doesn't support negative numbers since comparing the two operands before the calculation so they can be entered in the proper order, and verifying that the result is reasonable, is easy for humans to do.
* Represent negative numbers as radix complements of their positive counterparts. Numbers less than &lt;math&gt;b^n/2&lt;/math&gt; are considered positive; the rest are considered negative (and their magnitude can be obtained by taking the radix complement). This works best for even radices since the sign can be determined by looking at the first digit. For example, numbers in ten's complement notation are positive if the first digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and negative if 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. And it works very well in binary since the first bit can be considered a sign bit: the number is positive if the sign bit is 0 and negative if it is 1. Indeed, [[two's complement]] is used in most modern computers to represent signed numbers.
* Complement the result if there is no carry out of the most significant digit (an indication that ''x'' was less than ''y''). This is easier to implement with [[digital circuit]]s than comparing and swapping the operands. But since taking the radix complement requires adding 1, it is difficult to do directly. Fortunately, a trick can be used to get around this addition: Instead of always setting a carry into the least significant digit when subtracting, the carry out of the most significant digit is used as the carry input into the least significant digit (an operation called an ''[[end-around carry]]''). So if ''y'' ≤ ''x'', the carry from the most significant digit that would normally be ignored is added, producing the correct result. And if not, the 1 is not added and the result is one less than the radix complement of the answer, or the diminished radix complement, which does not require an addition to obtain. This method is used by computers that use sign-and-magnitude to represent signed numbers.....

==Practical uses==
[[File:Comptometer1920Model.jpg|thumb|Comptometer from the 1920s, with nines' complements marked on each key]]
The method of complements was used in many mechanical calculators as an alternative to running the gears backwards. For example:

* [[Pascal's calculator]] had two sets of result digits, a black set displaying the normal result and a red set displaying the nines' complement of this. A horizontal slat was used to cover up one of these sets, exposing the other. To subtract, the red digits were exposed and set to 0. Then the nines' complement of the minuend was entered. On some machine this could be done by dialing in the minuhend using inner wheels of complements (i.e. without having to mentally determine the nines' complement of the minuhend). In displaying that data in the complement window (red set), the operator could see the nines' complement of the nines' complement of the minuhend, that is the minuhend. The slat was then moved to expose the black digits (which now displayed the nines' complement of the minuhend) and the  subtrahend was added by dialing it in. Finally, the operator had to move the slat again to read the correct answer.
* The [[Comptometer]] had nines' complement digits printed in smaller type along with the normal digits on each key. To subtract, the operator was expected to mentally subtract 1 from the subtrahend and enter the result using the smaller digits. Since subtracting 1 before complementing is equivalent to adding 1 afterwards, the operator would thus effectively add the ten's complement of the subtrahend. The operator also needed to hold down the "subtraction cutoff tab" corresponding to the leftmost digit of the answer. This tab prevented the carry from being propagated past it, the Comptometer's method of dropping the initial 1 from the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/Comptometer-instructions.html Easy Instructions for Operation the Controlled Key Comptometer], Comptometer Division, Felt and Tarrant Mfg. Co., Chicago, 1917, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Curta calculator]] used the method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides along the side of the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating "echelon drum" (a.k.a. "step drum"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its "6" position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines' complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 cams. The shifted drum also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for the method of complements). The always present ten's complement "overflow 1" which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the results register was, in effect, discarded.

===In computers===
Use of the method of complements is ubiquitous in digital computers, regardless of the representation used for signed numbers. However, the circuitry required depends on the representation:

* If two's complement representation is used, subtraction requires only inverting the bits of the subtrahend and setting a carry into the rightmost bit.
* Using ones' complement representation requires inverting the bits of the subtrahend and connecting the carry out of the most significant bit to the carry in of the least significant bit (end-around carry).
* Using sign-magnitude representation requires only complementing the sign bit of the subtrahend and adding, but the addition/subtraction logic needs to compare the sign bits, complement one of the inputs if they are different, implement an end-around carry, and complement the result if there was no carry from the most significant bit.

===Manual uses===
The method of complements was used to correct errors when accounting books were written by hand. To remove an entry from a column of numbers, the accountant could add a new entry with the ten's complement of the number to subtract. A bar was added over the digits of this entry to denote its special status. It was then possible to add the whole column of figures to obtain the corrected result.

Complementing the sum is handy for cashiers making change for a purchase from currency in a single denomination of 1 raised to an integer power of the currency's base.  For decimal currencies that would be 10, 100, 1,000, etc., e.g. a $10.00 bill.

==In grade school education==

In grade schools, students are sometimes taught the method of complements as a shortcut useful in [[mental arithmetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Principles of Arithmetic and Geometry for Elementary School Teachers | author = Carl Barnett Allendoerfer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1971 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subtraction is done by adding the ten's complement of the [[subtrahend]], which is the nines' complement plus 1.  The result of this addition used when it is clear that the difference will be positive, otherwise the ten's complement of the addition's result is used with it marked as negative.  The same technique works for subtracting on an adding machine.

== Microbial vs macro-organism biogeography ==

The biogeography of macro-organisms (i.e., plants and animals that can be seen with the naked eye) has been studied since the eighteenth century. For macro-organisms, biogeographical patterns (i.e., which organism assemblages appear in specific places and times) appear to arise from both past and current environments. For example, [[polar bears]] live in the [[Arctic]] but not the [[Antarctic]], while the reverse is true for [[penguins]]; although both polar bears and penguins have adapted to cold climates over many generations (the result of past environments), the distance and warmer climates between the north and south poles prevent these species from spreading to the opposite hemisphere (the result of current environments). This demonstrates the biogeographical pattern known as "isolation with geographic distance" by which the limited ability of a species to physically disperse across space (rather than any [[Selection (biology)|selective]] genetic reasons) restricts the geographical range over which it can be found.

The biogeography of [[microorganism]]s (i.e., organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye, such as fungi and bacteria) is an emerging field enabled by ongoing advancements in genetic technologies, in particular cheaper [[DNA sequencing]] with higher throughput that now allows analysis of global datasets on microbial biology at the molecular level. When scientists began studying microbial biogeography, they anticipated a lack of biogeographic patterns due to the high dispersibility and large population sizes of microbes, which were expected to ultimately render geographical distance irrelevant. Indeed, in microbial ecology the oft-repeated saying by [[Lourens Baas Becking]] that “everything is everywhere, but the environment selects” has come to mean that as long as the environment is [[ecologically]] appropriate, [[geological]] barriers are irrelevant.&lt;ref name = "omalley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Malley|first1=Maureen A.|title=The nineteenth century roots of 'everything is everywhere'|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=August 2007|volume=5|issue=8|pages=647–651|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1711|pmid=17603517}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies show clear evidence for biogeographical patterns in microbial life, which challenge this common interpretation: the existence of microbial biogeographic patterns disputes the idea that “everything is everywhere” while also supporting the idea that environmental selection includes geography as well as historical events that can leave lasting signatures on microbial communities.&lt;ref name = "martiny" /&gt;

Microbial biogeographic patterns are often similar to those of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the [[distance decay]] relationship, the [[Occupancy–abundance relationship|abundance-range]] relationship, and [[Rapoport's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=China A.|last2=Fuhrman|first2=Jed A.|last3=Horner-Devine|first3=M.

However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and macro-organism do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], selection, and [[mutation]]). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (for larger animals dispersal is much more constrained due to their size).&lt;ref name = "martiny" /&gt; As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.&lt;ref name = "marine" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amend|first1=Anthony S.|last2=Oliver|first2=Tom A.|last3=Amaral-Zettler|first3=Linda A.|last4=Boetius|first4=Antje|last5=Fuhrman|first5=Jed A.|last6=Horner-Devine|first6=M.

== Distinct patterns ==

=== Reversed latitudinal diversity gradient ===
Larger organisms tend to exhibit [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], with larger biodiversity existing in the tropics and decreasing toward more temperate polar regions. In contrast, a study on indoor fungal communities&lt;ref name = "indoor" /&gt; found microbial biodiversity to be significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics. The same study found that drastically different buildings exhibited the same indoor fungal composition in any given location, where similarity increased with proximity. Thus despite human efforts to control indoor climates, outside environments appear to be the strongest determinant of indoor fungal composition.

=== Bipolar latitude distributions ===
Certain microbial populations exist in opposite hemispheres and at complementary latitudes. These ‘bipolar’ (or ‘antitropical’) distributions are much rarer in macro-organisms; although macro-organisms exhibit latitude gradients, ‘isolation by geographic distance’ prevents bipolar distributions (e.g., polar bears are not found at both poles). In contrast, a study on marine surface bacteria&lt;ref name = "marine" /&gt; showed not only a latitude gradient, but also complementarity distributions with similar populations at both poles, suggesting no "isolation by geographic distance". This is likely due to differences in the underlying biogeographic process, dispersal, as microbes tend to disperse at high rates and far distances by traveling through the atmosphere.

=== Seasonal variations ===
Microbial diversity can exhibit striking seasonal patterns at a single geographical location. This is largely due to dormancy, a microbial feature not seen in larger animals that allows microbial community composition to fluctuate in relative abundance of persistent species (rather than actual species present). This is known as the "seed-bank hypothesis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennon|first1=Jay T.|last2=Jones|first2=Stuart E.|title=Microbial seed banks: the ecological and evolutionary implications of dormancy|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=February 2011|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2504|pmid=21233850}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has implications for our understanding of ecological resilience and thresholds to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caporaso|first1=J Gregory|last2=Paszkiewicz|first2=Konrad|last3=Field|first3=Dawn|last4=Knight|first4=Rob|last5=Gilbert|first5=Jack A|title=The Western English Channel contains a persistent microbial seed bank|journal=The ISME Journal|date=10 November 2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=1089–1093|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.162|pmc=3358019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Directed panspermia ===
[[Panspermia]] suggests that life can be distributed throughout [[outer space]] via [[comets]], [[asteroids]], and [[meteoroids]].  Panspermia assumes that life can survive the harsh space environment, which features vacuum conditions, intense radiation, extreme temperatures, and a dearth of available nutrients. Many microorganisms are able to evade such stressors by forming [[spores]] or entering a state of low-metabolic dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roszak|first1=DB|last2=Colwell|first2=RR|title=Survival strategies of bacteria in the natural environment.|journal=Microbiological Reviews|date=September 1987|volume=51|issue=3|pages=365–79|pmid=3312987|pmc=373117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in microbial biogeography have even shown that the ability of microbes to enter and successfully emerge from dormancy when their respective environmental conditions are favorable contributes to the high levels of microbial biodiversity observed in almost all [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=S. E.|last2=Lennon|first2=J. T.|title=Dormancy contributes to the maintenance of microbial diversity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 2010|volume=107|issue=13|pages=5881–5886|doi=10.1073/pnas.0912765107|pmid=20231463|pmc=2851880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus microbial biogeography can be applied to panspermia as it predicts that microbes are able to protect themselves from the harsh space environment, know to emerge when conditions are safe, and also take advantage of their dormancy capability to enhance biodiversity wherever they may land.

[[Directed panspermia]] is the deliberate transport of microorganisms to colonize another [[planet]]. If aiming to colonize an Earth-like environment, microbial biogeography can inform decisions on the biological payload of such a mission. In particular, microbes exhibit latitudinal ranges according to [[Rapoport's rule]], which states that organisms living at lower [[latitudes]] (near the [[equator]]) are found within smaller latitude ranges than those living at higher [[latitudes]] (near the poles). Thus the ideal biological payload would include widespread, higher-latitude microorganisms that can tolerate of a wider range of climates. This is not necessarily the obvious choice, as these widespread organisms are also rare in microbial communities and tend to be weaker competitors when faced with [[endemic]] organisms. Still, they can survive in a range of climates and thus would be ideal for inhabiting otherwise lifeless Earth-like planets with uncertain environmental conditions. [[Extremophiles]], although tough enough to withstand the space environment, may not be ideal for directed panspermia as any given extremophile species requires a very specific climate to survive. However, if the target was closer to Earth, such as a planet or moon in our [[Solar System]], it may be possible to select a specific extremophile species for the well-defined target environment.

'''Migration''', in [[ecology]], is the large-scale movement of members of a species to a different [[natural environment|environment]]. Migration is a natural behavior and component of the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of many species of mobile organisms, not limited to animals, though [[animal migration]] is the best known type. Migration is often cyclical, frequently occurring on a [[season]]al basis, and in some cases on a [[diurnal cycle|daily basis]].

==Defining doctrine==

[[NATO]]'s definition of doctrine, used unaltered by many member nations, is:

"''Fundamental principles by which the military forces guide their actions in support of objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgement in application''".&lt;ref name="NATO"&gt;AAP-6(V) NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Army states: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Military doctrine is a formal expression of military knowledge and thought, that the army accepts as being relevant at a given time, which covers the nature of conflict, the preparation of the army for conflict, and the method of engaging in conflict to achieve success ... it is descriptive rather than prescriptive, requiring judgement in application. It does not establish dogma or provide a checklist of procedures, but is rather an authoritative guide, describing how the army thinks about fighting, not how to fight. As such it attempts to be definitive enough to guide military activity, yet versatile enough to accommodate a wide variety of situations."''&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of National Defence. ''The Conduct of Land Operations'' B-GL-300-001/FP-000, 1998: iv–v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A U.S. Air Force Air University staff study in 1948 defined military doctrine functionally as "those concepts, principles, policies, tactics, techniques, practices, and procedures which are essential to efficiency in organizing, training, equipping, and employing its tactical and service units."&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation Division, Air University. "To Analyze the USAF Publications System for Producing Manuals", staff study, 13 July 1948, quoted in Futrell, Robert Frank. ''Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine: Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force'', 1907–1960. December 1989, Air University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]], of the Defence Studies Department of [[King's College London]]/[[JSCSC]] quoted [[J F C Fuller]]'s 1923 definition of doctrine as the "central idea of an army".&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sheffield, 'Doctrine &amp; Command in the British Army, A Historical Overview,' Army Doctrine Publication Land Operations, DGD&amp;D, [[British Army]], May 2005, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet ''Dictionary of Basic Military Terms'' defined military doctrine as "a state's officially accepted system of scientifically founded views on the nature of modern wars and the use of the armed forces in them. ... Military doctrine has two aspects: social-political and military-technical."&lt;ref&gt;Moscow: Voenizdat, 1965, quoted in [[William Odom]], "Soviet Military Doctrine," ''[[Foreign Affairs (magazine)|Foreign Affairs]]'', Winter 1988/89&lt;/ref&gt; The social-political side "encompasses all questions concerning methodology, economic, and social bases, the political goals of war. It is the defining and the more stable side." The other side, the military-technical, must accord with the political goals. It includes the "creation of military structure, technical equipping of the armed forces, their training, definition of forms and means of conducting operations and war as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;A. Beleyev, "The Military-Theoretical Heritage of M. V. Frunze," ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' (Red Star), November 4, 1984, quoted in William Odom's article in ''[[Foreign Affairs (magazine)|Foreign Affairs]]'', Winter 1988/89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of doctrine==

Before the development of separate doctrinal publications, many nations expressed their military philosophy through regulations.

===United Kingdom===
Field Service Regulations were issued by the [[War Office]] in 1909, 1917, 1923, 1930, and 1935.  Similar publications under various names were subsequently published.  Formal British Military Doctrine was first published in 1988 and in 1996 became British Defence Doctrine applicable throughout the armed forces.

===France===
The development of military doctrine in France came about in the aftermath of the nation's defeat during the [[Franco-Prussian war]]. The [[École supérieure de guerre]], under the direction of its commandant, [[Ferdinand Foch]], began developing a consistent doctrine for handling armies, corps, and divisions. Foch's 1906 work, ''Des principes de la guerre'' (translated by [[Hilaire Belloc]] as ''The Principles of War'') expressed this doctrine.

===Prussia and German Empire===
Prussian doctrine was published as ''Regulations for the Instruction of the Troops in Field Service and the Exercises of the larger Units of the 17th June, 1870''. The doctrine was revised in 1887 and published in English in 1893 as The Order of Field Service of the German Army, by Karl Kaltenborn und Stachau, and once again in 1908 as ''Felddienst Ordnung (Field Service Regulations)''.

===United States===
In the period between the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], doctrine was defined by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#Field Service Regulations|"Field Service Regulations."]] In addition, many officers wrote military manuals that were printed by private publishers, such as Hardee's Tactics, used by both [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and Union forces. General [[George B. McClellan]] wrote a cavalry manual, ''Regulations and Instructions for the Field Service of the U.S. Cavalry,'' in 1862.

The General Staff became responsible for writing Field Service Regulations. They were published in 1908, were revised in 1913 and again in 1914 based on experiences of European powers in the first months of the war.

As late as 1941 U.S. Army doctrine was published in ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#Field Service Regulations|Field Service Regulations&amp;nbsp;– Operations]]''. This designation was dropped and replaced by [[United States Army Field Manuals|U.S. Army Field Manuals (FM)]].

==Relationship between doctrine and strategy==
{{see also|Military strategy}}
Doctrine is not [[strategy]]. NATO's definition of strategy is "presenting the manner in which military power should be developed and applied to achieve national objectives or those of a group of nations."&lt;ref name="NATO" /&gt; The official definition of strategy by the United States Department of Defense is: "Strategy is a prudent idea or set of ideas for employing the instruments of national power in a synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve national or multinational objectives."&lt;ref&gt;United States Southern Command Command Strategy 2016. www.southcom.mil/AppsSC/files/0UI0I1177092386.pdf, accessed 1-29-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Military strategy provides the rationale for military operations. Field Marshal Viscount [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] and co-chairman of the Anglo-US [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] Committee for most of the Second World War, described the art of military strategy as:
"to derive from the [policy] aim a series of military objectives to be achieved: to assess these objectives as to the military requirements they create, and the pre-conditions which the achievement of each is likely to necessitate: to measure available and potential resources against the requirements and to chart from this process a coherent pattern of priorities and a rational course of action."&lt;ref&gt;''British Defence Doctrine'', Edition 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, doctrine seeks to provide a common conceptual framework for a military service:
* what the service perceives itself to be ("Who are we?")
* what its mission is ("What do we do?")
* how the mission is to be carried out ("How do we do that?")
* how the mission has been carried out in history ("How did we do that in the past?")
* other questions.&lt;ref&gt;Grint and Jackson, 'Toward "Socially Constructive" Social Constructions of Leadership', ''Management Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 24, No. 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, doctrine is neither operations nor tactics. It serves as a conceptual framework uniting all three levels of warfare.

Doctrine reflects the judgments of professional military officers, and to a lesser but important extent [[Civilian control of the military|civilian leaders]], about what is and is not militarily possible and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul of Armies: Counterinsurgency Doctrine and Military Culture in the US and UK|last=Long|first=Austin|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780801453793|location=Ithica: NY|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include:
* military technology
* national geography
* the capabilities of adversaries
* the capability of one's own organization&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Posen|Posen, Barry]]. ''The Sources of Military Doctrine: France, Britain, and Germany Between the World Wars''. 1984, Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-9427-3}}, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--&gt;Warfare is conducted on three levels: [[strategic]], [[operational]], and [[tactical]]. &lt;br /&gt;
The strategic level of war is that which a nation or group of nations determine national or multinational [[strategic security]] objectives and guidance, and develops and uses national resources to achieve these objectives. National leaders translate [[national interests]] and [[policy]] into national strategic objectives. Military commanders base their theater or campaign [[planning]] on these objective.&lt;br /&gt;
At the operational level of war a campaign is a series of related [[military operations]] aimed at accomplishing a strategic or operational objective within a given time and space. Operational art determines when, where, and for what purposes commanders employ major forces. Actions at the operational level usually involve broader dimensions of time and space than those of tactical actions.&lt;br /&gt;
Tactics is the employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other. It includes the ordered arrangement and maneuver of units in relation to each other, the terrain, civil considerations, and the enemy to translate potential [[military power]] into successful operations.&lt;--&gt;

==Military doctrine by country==

===China===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
[[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] military doctrine is influenced by a number of sources including an indigenous classical military tradition characterized by strategists such as [[Sun Tzu]] and modern strategists such as [[Mao Zedong]], along with Western and Soviet influences. One distinctive characteristic of Chinese military science is that it places emphasis on the relationship between the military and society as well as views military force as merely one part of an overarching [[grand strategy]].

According to French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', the Chinese nuclear doctrine is to maintain a nuclear force allowing it to deter and respond to a nuclear attack. However, new evolutions show that China could allow use of its nuclear arsenal in more situations.&lt;ref&gt;"Les Etats-Unis inquiets du développement de la capacité nucléaire chinoise." ''Le Monde'', 25 May 2007 [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-914812@51-914819,0.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat of the [[French Army]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the French military, as part of its movements to increase professionalism, emphasized officer training at the [[École de Guerre]]. [[Ferdinand Foch]], as an instructor, argued against the concept of a commander moving units without informing subordinates of his intentions. In doing so, a common doctrine served as a point of training.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have then, a doctrine. All the brains have been limbered up and regard all questions from an identical point of view. The fundamental idea of the problem being known, each one will solve the problem in his own fashion, and these thousand fashions, we may very well be sure, will act to direct all their efforts to a common objective.”&lt;ref&gt;Commandant A. Grassez, ''Préceptes et Jugements du marechal Foch'', (Nancy, France, Berger-Leveault, editor; 1919, translated in Futrell, Robert Frank, ''Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine: Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force, 1907–1960''.

===Germany===
{{See also|Mission-type tactics}}
German military doctrine incorporates the concept of ''Auftragstaktik'' (Mission-type tactics), which can be seen as a doctrine within which formal rules can be selectively suspended in order to overcome "friction". Carl von Clausewitz stated that "Everything in war is very simple but the simplest thing is difficult". Problems will occur with misplaced communications, troops going to the wrong location, delays caused by weather, etc., and it is the duty of the commander to do his best to overcome them. Auftragstaktik encourages commanders to exhibit initiative, flexibility and improvisation while in command.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Samuels,  "Erwin Rommel and German Military Doctrine, 1912-1940," ''War in History'' (2017) 24#3:308-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The current combat doctrine of the [[Indian Army]] is based on the effective combined utilization of holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralize enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/cold-start.htm Cold Start Doctrine].

India's nuclear doctrine follows the policy of credible minimum [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]], [[No first strike]], No use of nuclear weapons on Non-nuclear states and Massive nuclear retaliation in case deterrence fails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsa-india.org/an-feb-1.01.htm India's Nuclear Doctrine and Policy]. Idsa-india.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

India has recently adopted new war doctrine known as "[[Cold Start (military doctrine)|Cold Start]]" and its military has conducted exercises several times since then based on this doctrine. "Cold Start" involves joint operations between India's three services and integrated battle groups for offensive operations. A key component is the preparation of India's forces to be able to quickly mobilize and take offensive actions without crossing the enemy's nuclear-use threshold. A leaked US diplomatic cable disclosed that it was intended to be taken off the shelf and implemented within a 72-hour period during a crisis.

===Israel===
;Strategic doctrine
Israel's military doctrine is formed by its small size and lack of [[strategic depth]]. To compensate, it relies on [[deterrence theory|deterrence]], including through a presumed [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons arsenal]]. It tries to overcome its quantitative disadvantage by staying qualitatively superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/doctrine/|title=Strategic Doctrine – Israel|date=25 May 2000|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its doctrine is based on a strategy of defense but is operationally offensive, by [[pre-emptive war|pre-empting]] enemy threats and securing a quick, decisive victory if deterrence fails. Israel maintains a heightened state of readiness, advanced [[early warning]] systems, and a robust [[military intelligence]] capability to ensure attackers cannot take advantage of Israel's lack of strategic depth.&lt;ref name="Sadeh1997" /&gt; Early warning and speedy victory is also desired because the [[Israel Defense Forces]] rely heavily on [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reservists]] during major wars; lengthy mobilization of reservists is costly to the Israeli economy.&lt;ref name="Kahana2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahana|first=Ephraim|title=Historical Dictionary of Israeli Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAar3TpYOt4C|accessdate=10 July 2014|date=2006-04-19|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810865006|page=xxxix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli doctrine is constructed with the assumption that Israel would be largely self-sufficient in its war-fighting, without nearby allies to assist.&lt;ref name="Sadeh1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sadeh|first=Eligar|title=Militarization and State Power in the Arab–Israeli Conflict: Case Study of Israel, 1948–1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGHcpPPJrswC&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=1 March 2014|date=1997-08-01|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9780965856461|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's emphasis on operational offense was espoused by its first prime minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], as early as 1948 (during Israel's [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|war of Independence]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;If [the Arabs] attack us as they did this time, we shall transfer the war to the gates of their country. ... We do not intend to conduct ... a static defensive war at the venue where we were attacked. If they attack us again, in the future, we want the war to be waged not in our country, but in the enemy's country, and we want to be not on the defensive but on the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sadeh, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Yitzhak Rabin]], who was [[Ramatkal|Chief of the IDF Staff]] during the [[Six-Day War]], offered a similar explanation for Israel's pre-emptive beginning to the war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic philosophy of Israel was not to initiate war, unless an [[casus belli|act of war]] was carried out against us. We then lived within the lines prior to the Six-Day War, lines that gave no depth to Israel—and therefore, Israel was in a need, whenever there would be a war, to go immediately on the [[offensive (military)|offensive]]—to carry the war to the enemy's land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDWXI8-4fxk|title=Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin Interview with Bill Boggs|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Tactical doctrine
IDF command has been decentralized since the early days of the state, with junior commanders receiving broad authority within the context of [[mission-type tactics|mission-type orders]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadeh, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli junior officer training has emphasized the need to make quick decisions in battle to prepare them appropriately for [[maneuver warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maneuver Warfare Handbook|author=William S. Lind|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|edition=Kindle|series=Westview Special Studies in Military Affairs|year=1985}}. Location 1044.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia and the Soviet Union===
{{further|Military doctrine of Russia}}
The Soviet meaning of military doctrine was very different from U.S. military usage of the term. Soviet Minister of Defence Marshal Grechko defined it in 1975 as "a system of views on the nature of war and methods of waging it, and on the preparation of the country and army for war, officially adopted in a given state and its armed forces."

In Soviet times, theorists emphasised both the political and "military-technical" sides of military doctrine, while from the Soviet point of view, Westerners ignored the political side. However, the political side of Soviet military doctrine, Western commentators Harriet F Scott and William Scott said, "best explained Soviet moves in the international arena".&lt;ref&gt;Scott and Scott, 1979, pp. 37, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet (and contemporary Russian) doctrine emphasizes [[Combined arms|combined-arms]] warfare as well as [[Operation (military)|operational]] warfare. It emphasizes the initiation of military hostilities at a time, date, and location of its choosing on terms of its choosing and the extensive preparation of the battlespace for operations.

Former Soviet/Russian doctrine sacrifices tactical flexibility and adaptability for strategic and operational flexibility and adaptability; tactical personnel are trained as relatively inflexible executors of specific, detailed orders, while the operational-strategic level of Russian military doctrine is where most innovation takes place.

The Soviet response to problems of nuclear strategy began with classified publications. However, by 1962, with the publication in the [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Vasily Sokolovsky]]'s volume, ''Military Strategy'', the Soviets laid out their officially endorsed thoughts on the matter, and their ideas on how to cope with nuclear conflict.{{vague|date=February 2012}}

===Sweden===
In the 2000s and early 2010s, the [[Moderate Party (Sweden)|Moderate Party]]–led governments transformed the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] from a [[Cold War]] posture of defence to one of participation in international operations. The assumption was that Sweden's homeland would face minimal external threats. Supreme Commander [[Sverker Göranson]] estimates that as of 2014, Swedish forces could resist a limited enemy attack for only one week.&lt;ref name="Rolander"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304554004579422572239271130|title=Sweden Mulls "Doctrine Shift" in Defense After Russian Incursion in Ukraine|last=Rolander|first=Nicolas|date=6 March 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2014 Crimean Crisis]] has stirred debate within Sweden that a return to significant defensive forces and/or a closer alliance with [[NATO]] may be necessary in the wake of Russia's actions in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Rolander" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
For some 280 years the British Army achieved considerable success without having any formal 'Military Doctrine', although a huge number of publications dealing with tactics, operations and administration had been produced. However, during his tenure as Chief of the General Staff (1985–89) [[Nigel Bagnall|General Sir Nigel Bagnall]] directed that British Military Doctrine was to be prepared, and tasked Colonel (later General) [[Timothy Granville-Chapman]] (an artillery officer who had been his Military Assistant in Headquarters 1st British Corps) to prepare it. The first edition of British Military Doctrine (BMD) was published in 1988. It led to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force developing their own maritime and air-power doctrines. However, in 1996 the first edition of British Defence Doctrine (BDD) was published, drawing heavily on the BMD. The Army adopted BDD as their Military Doctrine. The fourth edition of BDD was published in 2011; it uses the NATO definition of doctrine.

NATO underpins the defence of the UK and its Allies, while also providing deployable expeditionary capabilities to support and defend UK interests further afield.  However, until recently, most NATO doctrine has been mirrored by equivalent, but different, national Joint Doctrines.  This has often caused a dilemma for UK Armed Forces committed to operations as part of a NATO-based coalition.

In 2012, the Chief of Defence Staff and Permanent Undersecretary for Defence issued direction on how the UK contribution to NATO could be improved, stating that; 'We should use NATO doctrine wherever we can, and ensure coherence of UK doctrine with NATO wherever we cannot.'

The 2014 edition of [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jdp-0-01-fourth-edition-british-defence-doctrine Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 0-01 UK Defence Doctrine] reflects this change in policy

However, the British Army had formal publications for a long time, and these amounted to its doctrine. ''Field Service Regulations'' (FSR), on the Prussian pattern, were published in 1906 and with amendments and replacement editions lasted into the Second World War. They required each arm and service to produce their own specific publications to give effect to FSR. After the Second World War FSR were replaced by various series of manuals, again with specific training pamphlets for each arm and service. These deal with operational and tactical matters.

The current capstone publication for the army is Army Doctrine Publication ''Operations'' alongside maritime and air-power equivalents and joint warfare publications all under the umbrella of BDD. The four layers constituting "land doctrine" are summarised as:
* [http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/FDB67DF9-5835-47FD-897D-CA82C17EC7A5/0/20111130jdp001_bdd_Ed4.pdf British Defence Doctrine] – provides philosophy
* Joint (and Allied) Operational Doctrine and Capstone Environmental Doctrine ([http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/MicroSite/DCDC/OurPublications/JDWP/Jdp01Campaigning.htm JDP 01 Joint Operations] [http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/ajp1/AJP-01-D.pdf AJP-01 Allied Joint Operations] [http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/MicroSite/DCDC/OurPublications/JDWP/ArmyDoctrinePublicationadpOperations.htm ADP Operations] – provides principles
* Joint Functional and Thematic Doctrine such as JDP 5-00 Campaign Planning and JDP 3-40 Security and Stabalisation provide doctrine on specific areas or themes. JDP 5-00([http://mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/56AAAE6B-0728-4D10-A6AB-DBBE30B957B8/0/JDP5002ndEdCh1web.pdf]) JDP 3-40([http://mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C403A6C7-E72C-445E-8246-D11002D7A852/0/20091201jdp_40UDCDCIMAPPS.pdf])
* Army Field Manual (two volumes) – provides practices
* Land component handbooks and special to arm publications – provide procedures

The ''Army Field Manual'' comprises Volumes 1 (Combined Arms Operations) in 12 parts led by "Formation Tactics" and "Battlegroup Tactics", and Volume 2 (Operations in Specific Environments) in 6 parts (desert, urban, etc.).

BDD is divided into two parts: "Defence Context" and "Military Doctrine". Defence Context deals with two matters. First, the relationship between Defence policy and military strategy, and—while highlighting the utility of force – emphasizes the importance of addressing security issues through a comprehensive, rather than an exclusively military, approach. Second it expounds the Nature of and the [[Principles of War]], the three Levels of Warfare (Strategic, Operational and Tactical) and its evolving character. The ten Principles of War are a refined and extended version of those that appeared in FSR between the two world wars and based on the work of [[JFC Fuller]].

The Military Doctrine states that it comprises national Joint Doctrine, Higher Level Environmental Doctrine, Tactical Doctrine, Allied Doctrine and doctrine adopted or adapted from ad hoc coalition partners. The part deals with three matters. First it describes the likely employment of the British Armed Forces in pursuit of Defence policy aims and objectives. Next it explains the three components of fighting power (conceptual, physical and moral components) and the criticality of the operating context to its effective application. Finally it describes the British approach to the conduct of military operations—"the British way of war". This includes mission command, the manoeuvrist approach and a warfighting ethos that requires accepting risks.

The BDD is linked to a variety of unclassified policy documents such as Defence White Papers and Strategic Defence Reviews, as well as classified Strategic Planning Guidance. The current, 2011, edition of BDD is underpinned by recent developmental and conceptual publications such as ''The DCDC Global Strategic Trends Programme 2007–2036'' and ''The High Level Operational Conceptual Framework'', which comprises specific army, navy and air force publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/9E4BA75A-8E9F-4A52-983B-44A0226C4906/0/20080924_jdp0_01_3rdEd_U_DCDCIMAPPS.pdf British Defence Doctrine] accessed 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Sources====
The [[United States Constitution]] invests Congress with the powers to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States and to raise and support armies. [[Title 10 of the United States Code]] states what Congress expects the Army, in conjunction with the other Services, to accomplish. This includes: Preserve the peace and security and provide for the defense of the United States, its territories and possessions, and any areas it occupies; Support national policies; Implement national objectives; Overcome any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States.

====Key concepts====
Most modern US doctrine is based around the concept of '''full spectrum operations''', which combine offensive, defensive, and stability or civil support operations simultaneously as part of an interdependent joint or combined force to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. They employ synchronized action—lethal and nonlethal—proportional to the mission and informed by a thorough understanding of all dimensions of the operational environment.

Offensive operations defeat and destroy enemy forces, and seize terrain, resources, and population centers. They impose the commander's will on the enemy. Defensive operations defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability operations.

Stability operations encompass various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted abroad to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. Civil support operations are support tasks and missions to homeland civil authorities for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities. This includes operations dealing with the consequences of natural or manmade disasters, accidents, and incidents within the homeland.

Under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] it was stated that the US armed forces should be able to fight [[Two-front war|two]]—at one point, two-and-a-half—wars at the same time. This was defined to mean a war in Europe against the Soviet Union, a war in Asia against China or North Korea, and a "half-war" as well—in other words, a "small" war in the [[Third World]]. When [[Richard Nixon]] took office in 1969, he altered the formula to state that the United States should be able to fight one-and-a-half wars simultaneously.

This doctrine remained in place until 1989–90, when President [[George H.W. Bush]] ordered the "Base Force" study which forecast a substantial cut in the military budget, an end to the Soviet Union's global threat, and the possible beginning of new regional threats. In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered a "Bottom-Up Review," based on which a strategy called "win-hold-win" was declared—enough forces to win one war while holding off the enemy in another conflict, then moving on to win it after the first war is over. The final draft was changed to read that the United States must be able to win two "major regional conflicts" simultaneously.

The current strategic doctrine, which Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] issued in his Quadrennial Defense Review of early 2001 (before the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]]), is a package of U.S. military requirements known as 1-4-2-1. The first 1 refers to defending the US homeland. The 4 refers to deterring hostilities in four key regions of the world. The 2 means the US armed forces must have the strength to win swiftly in two near-simultaneous conflicts in those regions. The final 1 means that the US forces must win one of those conflicts "decisively".

The general policy objectives are to (1) assure allies and friends; (2) dissuade future military competition, (3) deter threats and coercion against U.S. interests, and (4) if deterrence fails, decisively defeat any adversary.

====United States Department of Defense====
The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] publishes Joint Publications which state all-services doctrine. The current basic doctrinal publication is Joint Publication 3-0, "Doctrine for [[Joint warfare|Joint Operations]].

=====United States Air Force=====
Headquarters, [[United States Air Force]], publishes current USAF doctrine. The lead agency for developing Air Force doctrine is Headquarters, Air Force Doctrine Center; the Air Staff International Standardization Office works on multinational standardization, such as NATO Standardization Agreements ([[STANAG]]s), and agreements between the American, British, Canadian, and Australian Armies and Navies ([[ABCA Armies|ABCA]]) that affect the Air Force. Currently the basic Air Force doctrinal documents are the 10-series of Air Force publications.

=====United States Army=====
The [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) is responsible for developing Army doctrine. TRADOC was developed early in the 1970s as a response to the American Army's difficulties in the [[Vietnam War]], and is one of the reforms that improved Army professionalism. Currently the capstone Army doctrinal document is Army Doctrine Publication 3-0, Unified Land Operations (published October 2011).

=====United States Navy=====
The Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) Doctrine Department coordinates development, publication, and maintenance of [[United States Navy]] doctrine. Currently the basic unclassified naval doctrinal documents are Naval Doctrine Publications 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. NWDC is also the United States Navy lead for NATO and multinational maritime doctrine and operational standardization.

=====United States Marine Corps=====
The Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) has responsibility for [[United States Marine Corps]] doctrine. The capstone doctrinal document is ''Warfighting'' (MCDP1),&lt;ref&gt;http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=267776&lt;/ref&gt; along with MCDP's 1-1, 1–2, and 1–3 (Strategy, Campaigning, and Tactics, respectively). MCDP 1-0 (Marine Corps Operations) translates the philosophical-based capstone/keystone publications into operational doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=234141&amp;sid=1938041|title=LibApps Login @ Library of the Marine Corps|author=|date=|website=guides.grc.usmcu.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States Coast Guard=====
Headquarters, [[United States Coast Guard]], published Coast Guard Publication 1, ''U.S. Coast Guard: America's Maritime Guardian'', which is the source of USCG doctrine.

===SFR Yugoslavia===
With the passing of the National Defense Law of 1969, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] adopted a [[total war]] military doctrine named ''Total National Defense'' or ''Total People's Defense''{{ref label|Total National Defense|b|}}. It was inspired by the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War]] against the fascist occupiers and their collaborators in the [[Second World War]], and was designed to allow Yugoslavia to maintain or eventually reestablish its [[independent state|independent]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] status should an invasion occur. According to it, ''any citizen who resists an aggressor is a member of the armed forces'', thus the whole population could be turned into a monolithic resistance army.

Starting from the [[elementary school]] education, over [[high schools]], [[universities]], organizations and companies, the authorities prepared the entire population to contest an eventual occupation of the country and finally to liberate it. For this purpose, the [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defense Forces]] (TO) would be formed to mobilize the population in case of an aggression. The combat readiness of the TO meant that the steps of organization and training could be bypassed after the start of hostilities. The TO would supplement the regular [[Yugoslav People's Army]], giving it greater defensive depth and an armed local population ready to support combat actions. Large numbers of armed civilians would increase the cost of an invasion to a potential aggressor.

The most likely scenario in the doctrine being used was a general war between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In such a situation, Yugoslavia would remain non-aligned, and it would not accept foreign troops of either alliance on its territory. The doctrine recognized the likelihood that one side or the other might try to seize Yugoslav territory as a [[Staging area|forward staging area]], to ensure [[Line of communication|lines of communication]] or simply to deny the territory to enemy forces. Such action would be considered aggression and would be resisted. Regardless of ideology, the occupiers would be considered Yugoslavia's enemy.

====Territorial Defense Forces====
The [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defense Forces]] (TO) were formed in 1969 as an integral part of the Yugoslav ''Total National Defense'' doctrine. They chad able-bodied civilian males and females. Between 1 and 3 million Yugoslavs between the ages of 15 and 65 would fight under TO command as irregular or [[guerrilla]] forces in wartime. In peacetime, however, about 860,000 TO troops were involved in [[military training]] and other activities.

The TO concept focused on small, lightly armed [[infantry]] units fighting defensive actions on a familiar local terrain. A typical unit was a [[company (military)|company]]-sized [[detachment (military)|detachment]]. More than 2000 communes, factories, and other enterprises organized such units, which would fight in their home areas, maintaining local defense production essential to the overall war effort. The TO also included some larger, more heavily equipped units with wider operational responsibilities. The TO [[battalions]] and [[regiments]] operated in regional areas with [[artillery]] and [[antiaircraft]] guns and some [[armoured vehicle]]s. Using their mobility and tactical initiative, these units would attempt to alleviate the pressure of enemy armored columns and [[air strikes]] on smaller TO units. In the coastal regions, TO units had naval missions. They operated some [[gunboats]] in support of [[navy]] operations. They were organized to defend strategic coastal areas and naval facilities against enemy [[amphibious landing]]s and raids. They also trained some [[Military diving|divers]] for use in [[sabotage]] and other [[special operations]].

The TO was helped by the fact that most of its citizen-[[soldiers]] were one-time JNA [[conscript]]s who had completed their term of compulsory [[military service]]. However, TO [[Military recruitment|recruitment]] was somewhat limited by the army's desire to include as many recently released conscripts as possible in its own [[military reserve]]. Other sources of TO manpower lacked prior military service and required extensive [[recruit training|basic training]].

The TO organisation was highly decentralized and independent. TO units were organized and funded by the governments in each of the Yugoslav [[Country|constituent republics]]: [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]].

A '''municipal corporation''' is the legal term for a [[local government|local governing body]], including (but not necessarily limited to) [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]], [[town]]s, [[township]]s, [[charter township]]s, [[village]]s, and [[borough]]s. The term can also be used to describe [[municipally owned corporation]]s.&lt;ref name=Voornetal&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke L. Van Genugten, and Sandra Van Thiel (2017)|title=The efficiency and effectiveness of municipally owned corporations: A systematic review|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1319360|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes&gt;{{cite web|last=Tavares, Antonio F., and Pedro J.

==Municipal corporation as local self-government==
Municipal incorporation occurs when such [[municipality|municipalities]] become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a [[municipal charter]]. A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' or '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Canada===
In Canada charters are granted by [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]].

The [[Corporation of Chennai]] is the oldest Municipal Corporation in the world after UK.&lt;ref name="oldestcorp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm|title=The first corporation |date=2003-04-02|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=14 April 2012|location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The title "corporation" was used in [[borough]]s from soon after the [[Norman conquest of Ireland|Norman conquest]] until the [[Local Government Act 2001]]. Under the 2001 act, [[county borough]]s were renamed "cities" and their corporations became "city councils"; other borough corporations were renamed "borough councils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/|title=Local Government Act, 2001|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014|page=§11(3), §11(4), Schedule 2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204040438/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/|archivedate=4 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Partition of Ireland]], the corporations in the [[Irish Free State]] were Dublin, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] (county boroughs) and [[Drogheda]], [[Kilkenny]], [[Sligo]], [[Clonmel]], and Wexford (non-county boroughs). [[Dún Laoghaire]] gained borough status in 1930 as “The Corporation of Dun Laoghaire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/sec0003.html#sec3|title=Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, Section 3|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galway]]'s borough status, lost in 1840, was restored in 1937; it was formally styled "the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Galway”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003/sec0003.html |title=Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937, Section 3 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but referred to as "the Corporation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1937/en/act/prv/0003/sec0002.html |title=Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937, Section 2  |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Local government in the United States}}
In the United States, such municipal corporations are established by charters that are granted either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general municipal corporation [[law]], usually after the proposed [[charter]] has passed a referendum vote of the affected population.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Municipal corporation as enterprises==
Under the enterprise meaning of the term, municipal corporations are "organisations with independent corporate status, managed by an executive board appointed primarily by local government officials, and with majority public ownership".&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; Some MOCs rely on revenue from user fees, distinguishing them from agencies and special districts funded through taxation,&lt;ref name=TavaresCamoes /&gt; although this is not always the case.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt; Municipal corporation follows a process of externalization that requires new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and follow common changes in the institutional landscape of public services.&lt;ref name=GrossiReichard /&gt; They are argued to be more efficient than bureaucracy but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial autonomy.&lt;ref name=Voornetal /&gt;

:''The following [[Portal:Contents/Outlines|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to law:
'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.

'''Phototoxicity''', also called '''photoirritation''', is a chemically induced skin irritation, requiring light, that does not involve the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Dorland&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Anderson, D.M. |editor2=Keith, J. |editor3=Novac, P. |editor4=Elliott, M.A. |year=1994|title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary|edition=28th|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company|isbn=0721655777|translator= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[photosensitivity]].&lt;ref name=Dorland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phototoxicity and photoallergy|author=JH Epstein|year=1999|volume=18|issue=4|pages=274–284|journal=Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery|pmid=10604793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skin response resembles an exaggerated sunburn. The involved chemical may enter into the skin by topical administration or it may reach the skin via systemic circulation following ingestion or parenteral administration. The chemical needs to be "photoactive," which means that when it absorbs light, the absorbed energy produces molecular changes that cause toxicity. Many synthetic compounds, including drug substances like [[tetracyclines]] or [[fluoroquinolone]]s, are known to cause these effects. Surface contact with some such chemicals causes [[photodermatitis]]; many plants cause [[phytophotodermatitis]]. Light-induced toxicity is a common phenomenon in [[Photosensitivity in humans|humans]]; however, it also occurs in other animals.

==Scientific background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
A phototoxic substance is a chemical compound which becomes toxic when exposed to light.
*Some [[medicines]]: [[tetracycline antibiotics]], [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], [[amiodarone]], [[quinolones]]
*Many cold pressed citrus [[essential oils]] such as [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] oil
*Some plant juices: [[parsley]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and ''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]''
*Others: [[psoralen]]

Phototoxicity is a quantum chemical phenomenon. Phototoxins are molecules with a [[conjugated system]], often an [[Aromaticity|aromatic system]]. They have a low-lying [[excited state]] that can be reached by excitation with visible light photons. This state can undergo [[intersystem crossing]] with neighboring molecules in tissue, converting them to toxic [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s. These rapidly attack nearby molecules, killing cells. A typical radical is [[singlet oxygen]], produced from regular [[triplet oxygen]]. Because free radicals are highly reactive, the damage is limited to the body part illuminated.

==Photosafety evaluation==

===Physico-chemical properties===

===''In vitro'' test systems===
3T3 Neutral Red Phototoxicity Test – An in vitro toxicological assessment test used to determine the cytotoxic and photo(cyto)toxicity effect of a test article to murine fibroblasts in the presence or absence of UVA light.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay (3T3 NRU PT) can be utilized to identify the phototoxic effect of a test substance induced by the combination of test substance and light and is based on the comparison of the [[cytotoxic]] effect of a test substance when tested after the exposure and in the absence of exposure to a non-cytotoxic dose of UVA/vis light. Cytotoxicity is expressed as a concentration-dependent reduction of the uptake of the vital dye - [[Neutral Red]].

Substances that are phototoxic in vivo after systemic application and distribution to the skin, as well as compounds that could act as phototoxicants after topical application to the skin can be identified by the test. The reliability and relevance of the 3T3 NRU PT have been evaluated and has been shown to be predictive when compared with acute phototoxicity effects in vivo in animals and humans."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">The '''Porn Art Movement''' (Movimento de Arte Pornô) was a transgressive Brazilian [[avant-garde]] movement that started in 1980 and ended in 1982. The movement took place under a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]  and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” ''Folha de S. Paulo'' (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'' magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a "crusade against pornography." See: "Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia." ''Jornal do Brasil'', March 16th, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and [[pansexuality]]. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book ''Antolorgia'', published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by [[Eduardo Kac]] in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kac invited [[Cairo Trindade]]&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ''ArteManha'', Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called ''Pelo Topless Literário'' (''Literary Topless'').&lt;ref&gt;''Gang'', n. 1, May 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sudden invasion of the beach’s Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city).

Soon after the ''Literary Topless'' intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang.

Kac and Trindade wrote the ''Manifesto Pornô'' (''Porn Manifesto'') in May 1980 and first published it in the movement’s zine ''Gang'', n. 1, September 1980.  The movement published a total of three editions of the ''Gang'' zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist’s books and anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the ''Porn Manifesto'' on September 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro.

On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach’s Lifeguard Post 9.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by law&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach.  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/naked-dutch-tourists-arrested-rio]&lt;/ref&gt;), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” ''Pasquim'', n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[videographer]] Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions.

The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled ''Destricted''.&lt;ref&gt;The DVD compilation ''Destricted'' was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac’s series entitled ''Pornogramas'' (''Pornograms''), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054235/http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} ; [http://www.canalcontemporaneo.art.br/_v3/site/evento.php?idioma=br&amp;id_evento=5278]&lt;/ref&gt; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show ''Losing the Human Form'', realized in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/exposiciones/actuales/perder-forma-humana_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: ''Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana. Una imagen sísmica de los años ochenta en América Latina'' (Madrid: Museo Reina Sofia, 2012), pp. 199-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art forms==

The Porn Art Movement produced work in a variety of media, including performance, poetry, [[graffiti]], drawing, photography, cartoon and the graphic arts. Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called ''Jornal Dobrabil'', a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;Glauco Mattoso, ''Jornal Dobrabil'' (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement’s agenda while inviting the movement’s participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled ''Pornograms'', hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two ''Pornograms'' in his artist’s book ''Escracho'', which he published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/jfabc/id/3079/rec/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30355">‘Net positive’, from '''Positive Development''' (PD) theory, is a new paradigm in [[sustainable development]] and design.  PD theory (taught and published from 2003)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2003) ‘Retrofitting: Beyond Zero Waste’, in ''KLM-UC International Conference Proceedings'', University of Canberra, ACT, Australia; Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, Australia, http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland (accessed 2005);  Birkeland, J. (2005) ‘Reversing Negative Impacts by Design’, in ''Sustainability for the ACT: the Future’s in our Hands'', Office of Sustainability, ACT, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; was first detailed in ''Positive Development'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development: From Vicious Circles to Virtuous Cycles through Built Environment Design’'', Earthscan, London.  (A two volume book updating net positive theory is forthcoming.)&lt;/ref&gt; A net positive system/structure would ‘give back to nature and society more than it takes’ over its life cycle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Eco-positive impacts of development must keep pace with human consumption (or ecological footprint) and offset past losses of nature, as defined in ''Positive Development'' ''(Ibid)'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ‘sustainable development’ - in the real-world context of population growth, biodiversity losses, cumulative pollution, wealth disparities and social inequities - closes off future options.  To reverse direction, development must, among other sustainability criteria, increase nature beyond pre-human conditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;A sustainable building should aim to be better for nature/society than no building at all, as well as increase nature beyond native conditions.  A rule of reason would be applied as to whether the baseline is pre-industrial or pre-historic, depending on the location and circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; PD develops the tools to enable net positive design and development.

== Net Positive Sustainability ==
According to PD, the original precepts of sustainability (nature preservation and equity among current/future generations)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;These principles are common to most early definitions of sustainability and were endorsed at a national level as early as 1969 in the preamble to the National Environmental Protection Act in the United States. Among the first international documents to define sustainability was the IUCN/UNEP/WWF (1980) ''World Conservation Strategy'', re-published in 1991 as ''Caring for the Earth: A Strategy for Sustainable Living'', The World Conservation Union, United Nations Environment Program and World Wide Fund for Nature, Earthscan, London, UK.  Here it meant improving life quality within the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. See also COAG (1992) The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), Council of Australian Governments, Canberra, Australia.  For historical context, see Commoner, B. (1971) ''The Closing Circle: Nature, Man And Technology'', Knopf, New York and Porritt, J. (1985) ''Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology Explained'', Blackwell Publishers, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; require increasing future options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Social options do not mean more consumer products but rather substantive and positive life choices which requires increasing the ecological base and public estate.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, requires that development increase the life support system (nature).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;The idea that sustainability requires maintaining or increasing future option was discussed in Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society: Institutional Reform and Social Transformation'', University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. See also Norton, B.G. (2005) ''Sustainability: A Philosophy of Adaptive Ecosystem Management'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois for a comprehensive discussion on this point.&lt;/ref&gt; Green design always aimed for ecological restoration, social regeneration and economic revitalization.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;For a typology of green building design, see Birkeland, J. (2013) ‘Business Opportunities through Positive Development’, in ''A New Dynamic: Effective Business in a Circular Economy'', in K. Webster, J. Bleriot, and C. Johnston (Eds), Ellen MacArthur Foundation Publishing, Isle of Wight, UK, pp. 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these essentially ‘add value’ relative to ''current'' sites, buildings or practices.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;For a discussion of contemporary sustainable building design approaches, see Hes, D. and du Plessus, D. (2015) ''Designing for Hope: Pathways to Regenerative Sustainability'', Taylor &amp; Francis, New York. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not increase nature in absolute terms.  Positive development is defined as structures that increase universal life quality and future options by expanding the ‘ecological base’ (ecosystems, ecological carrying capacity, biodiversity) and the ‘public estate’ (universal access to means of survival/wellbeing and social capital).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2007) ‘GEN 4: ‘Positive Development’, ''BEDP (Built Environment Design Professions) Environmental Design Guide of the Australian Institute of Architects'', ACT, Australia. http://www.environmentdesignguide.com.au/ Assessed June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology Clarification ==
The term net positive&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;The term also appears as ‘net-positive’ or ‘netpositive’.  A special issue was dedicated to net-positive design.  See Cole, R. (2015) ‘Net-zero and Net-positive Design: a question of value’, in ''Building Research &amp; Information'' 43(1), pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly used by green designers, developers and businesses.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;For example, see Forum for the Future, WWF, and The Climate Group (2015) ''Net Positive: A New Way of Doing Business''. Available at http://www.theclimategroup.org/what-we-do/publications/net-positive-a-new-way-of-doing-business/ Accessed June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in context, it usually means just ‘giving back’ - that is, without fixed baselines&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Benchmarks are relative to the present, so eco-restoration is seen by some as net positive, yet this does not account for past biodiversity losses and increased human consumption.&lt;/ref&gt; - by optimizing material resources, energy and stakeholder benefits, etc.  This was the aim of 20th Century green building design.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;There are a wide range of 20th Century green design books, including:  Papanek, V. (1971) ''Design for the Real World: human ecology and social change'', Pantheon Books, New York; Johnson, R. (1979) ''The Green City'', MacMillan: S. Melbourne, Australia;  Todd, N. and J. Todd (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', N. Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA.; Vale, B. and R. Vale (1975) ''The Autonomous House: Design and Planning for self-''sufficiency, Thames and Hudson Ltd, London;  Wann, D. (1996) ''Deep Design: Pathways to a Liveable Future'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  Lyle, J.T. (1994) ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'', Wiley &amp; Sons, New York;  van der Ryn, S, and Cowan, D. (1996)  ''Ecological Design'', Island Press, Washington, DC.  Mackenzie, D. (1991), ''Green Design: Design for the Environment'', Lawrence King, London;  Girardet, H. (1992), ''The Gaia Atlas of Cities: New Directions for Sustainable Urban Living'', Gaia books Ltd, London; and Yeang, K. (1999) ''The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable Intensive Buildings'', Prestel Verlag, Munich, Germany [Yeang has written numerous books on green design].&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental ethics and social justice remain central concerns in PD,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Social factors have always been a part of sustainable design paradigms, but the focus is generally on the (psychological, social, physiological, experiential, etc.) needs of building users, and less on using a building project to solve social inequities in the wider community.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, ‘eco-positive’ is increasingly used to underscore the ecological dimension. The term ‘net’ also causes some confusion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;See for example, Baggs, D. (2015) Buildings Alone will Never be Regenerative, in ''Sourceable - Industry News and Analysis'' https://sourceable.net/buildings-alone-will-never-be-regenerative/ June 29.  Accessed July 2015.  This claims net positive design only concerns resource balances and does not use a life cycle perspective, but this has no basis in PD literature.&lt;/ref&gt; In PD, ‘net’ means public benefits ''beyond'' neutral impacts - not just reducing the total negative impacts to zero by, for example, making tradeoffs.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;For an overview of zero energy building, see Kibert, C.J. and Fard, M.M. (2012) Differentiating among Low-energy, Low-carbon and Net Zero-energy Building Strategies for Policy Formulation, ''Building Research &amp; Information'', 40(5), pp. 625-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory Origins ==
PD theory built on eco-philosophies that emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;See for example, Merchant, C. (1980) ''The Death of Nature: Women, ecology, and the scientific revolution'', HarperCollins, New York; Warren, K. (1997), ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana;  Naess, A. (1989) ''Ecology, community, and lifestyle'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, UK; Warren, K. and Wells-Howe, B. (1994) ''Ecological Feminism'', Routledge, New York;  Salleh, A. (1997) ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', Zed Books, London;  Shiva, V. (1988) ''Staying Alive: Women, Ecology and Development'', Zed Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for social transformation, they deconstructed the hierarchical cultures, dualistic thought patterns and linear-reductionist analyses of modernity. PD added a positive/negative overlay to explain why these theories did not contemplate increasing nature to offset consumption. Later, sustainability was absorbed into the dominant paradigm (DP) which assumed that current institutions could resolve the problems they fostered.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;See WCED (1987) ''Our Common Future'', Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.  This seminal report couched sustainability within the dominant economic and policy making frameworks and did not engage with the sustainability literature critical of the dominant paradigm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PD, existing institutional and physical structures reduce future options and are thus terminal.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;''Planning for Sustainability, Ibid.'' Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was that, by converting negative systems into positive ones, genuinely sustainable planning, decision and design frameworks would materialize.

=== Design-decision Distinction ===
The distinction between decision-making and design is central to PD.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;See Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), pp. 163-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-making processes/tools divide, compare and choose.  They use bounded or ‘closed system’ thinking which excludes considerations that are difficult to quantify.  Essentially, decision methods simplify issues and options to facilitate finding the best path from the present position or desired future.  Back-casting and scenario planning, while powerful tools, presume the future can be predicted and selected.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 165-179&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods decide now how future citizens must live.  They also reduce future options by narrowing resources, adaptability, space and biodiversity over time. Sustainability therefore requires rethinking decision-making and design tools from first principles.

=== Decision-making (reducing costs) ===
The reduction of the ecological base and public estate continues, PD argues, because new sustainability goals were spliced onto the old (anti-ecological) closed system models, methods and metrics of the DP.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Given escalating human consumption, even global depopulation and ecological regeneration would not counterbalance total negative resource flows and ecological impacts. PD maintains that closed system models created and institutionalized zero-sum decision and measurement frameworks such as cost-benefit/risk-benefit analyses.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies and ‘reverses’ over a hundred systemic biases in governance, planning, decision and design frameworks by converting them into open system and design-based frameworks to facilitate eco-positive planning and design.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Positive Development and Assessment’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environments'', 3(1), pp. 4-22;  Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design (multiplying benefits) ===
Whereas the internal logic of decision frameworks (choosing) tend to diminish ecosystems and land eco-productivity, eco-logical design (creating) can multiply functions and public benefits synergistically. Eco-positive design involves open systems thinking (i.e. with transparent/permeable boundaries).  For example, building rating tools are based on limits or thresholds (borders) and do not contemplate net public gains.  Perhaps because of the deeply-embedded historic elevation of rationalist decision-making over design, green building design templates and rating tools are decision-based.  Being reductionist, they encourage tradeoffs between costs and benefits or nature and society in physical development.  Hence they tend to reduce adaptability, diversity and reversibility.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;There are many critiques of green building rating tools.  Brandon, P.S., and Lombardi, P.L. (2011) ''Evaluating Sustainable Development in the Built Environment'' (2nd ed.) Chichester, West Sussex, Ames, Iowa, Wiley-Blackwell; Gu, Z., Wennersten, R., and Assefa, G. (2006) ‘Analysis of the Most Widely Used Building Environmental Assessment Methods’, ''Environmental Sciences,'' 3(3), pp. 175-192;  Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, [[Australia http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland|Australia &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (accessed 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Decision systems in governance (i.e. legislative, executive and judicial) resolve conflict by allocating rights and resources - not by increasing the ecological base and/or public estate.  Hence PD suggests different frameworks for environmental governance.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘The Case for a New Public Forum’, in Furnass, B., Whyte, J., Harris, J., and Baker, A. (Eds), ''Survival, Health and Wellbeing into the 21st Century'', Nature and Society Forum, pp. 111-114.  Birkeland, J. (1995) ‘Ethics-Based Planning’, ''Australian Planner'' 33(1), pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These include a modified constitution with a new decision sphere to deal with the unique ethical dimensions of biophysical development, planning and design.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1993) ‘Towards a New System of Environmental Governance’, in ''The Environmentalist'', 13(1), pp. 19-32;  Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society, Ibid''; Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 220-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Given real-world political barriers to change, PD also suggests default strategies to enable incremental reform by changing institutions from within.  PD contends that gaps can be avoided in new governance and planning systems by simply reversing each ecologically terminal convention into eco-positive ones.

== Planning ==
SMARTmode (systems mapping and redesign thinking) is a PD planning process&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 251-173.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes two dozen environment gap analyses to highlight sustainability issues that are almost never assessed in planning or design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are forensic ‘flows analyses’ that identify (local/regional) social and ecological deficits that developments could ameliorate by design.  They can be undertaken scientifically using emerging multi-dimensional digital mapping tools,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. and Simpson, R., eds. (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth, Virtual Nations, Data Cities'', D_City, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; more pragmatically by design teams,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and Resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; or more subjectively in community ‘charrettes’ (aka working bees) for workshopping planning criteria and design briefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, W. (2002) ‘Pros and cons of design charrettes’, in J. Birkeland (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A Sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Until planners perform these analyses routinely, therefore, they can serve as design thinking exercises, guidelines and/or criteria.

== Design ==
While improved systems of governance, decision-making and planning can assist, biophysical sustainability is ultimately a design problem. To compensate for past system design errors, fundamental reforms of design methods and processes are required.  PD proposes means to reduce material flows without tradeoffs by, for example, creating mutual gains and ‘low-impact luxury’ environments.&lt;ref&gt;Aesthetics or design quality does not equal high production costs, whereas high-tech equipment usually has high [[embodied energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; PD contends that eco-positive design is already possible, partly through the integration of natural systems with building structures, spaces and surfaces (e.g. ‘[[living machines]]’,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, N.J. and Todd J. (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California;  J. Todd (2002) ‘Living Technologies’, in Birkeland J. (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, pp. 114-117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mycology]],&lt;ref&gt;Stamets, P.

Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). PD contributes other design concepts (e.g. ‘design for eco-services’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Design for Eco-services’, Part A - Environmental Services, ''Environment Design Guide 77'', and Part B - Building Services, ''Environmental Design Guide 78'', Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, pp. 1-13 and pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green scaffolding’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J.

(1994) ‘Ecofeminist Playgardens’, International Play Journal, Vol. 2, pp. 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Design for Eco-services ===
The term ‘ecosystem services’ generally applies only to human benefits, which are usually valued by units (e.g. money, carbon or energy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. (1997) ‘The Value of the World’sEcosystem Services and Natural Capital’, ''Nature'', vol 387, pp. 253–260;  Heal, G. (2000) ''Nature and the Marketplace: Capturing the Value of Ecosystem Services'', Island Press, Washington, DC; Folke, C. Jansson, Å., Larsson, J. and Costanza, R. (1997) ‘Ecosystem Appropriation by Cities, Ambio Vol 26, pp. 167-172;  Daily, G. and K. Ellison (2002) ''The New Economy of Nature'', Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD uses the term ‘eco-services’ to include not only nature’s instrumental (pragmatic) values like ecosystem goods and services, but its intrinsic (priceless) and ‘biophilic’ values.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1993) ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'', in S. Kellert (Ed) Island Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD considers the value of nature to be ‘infinite’ as it is not only the basis of the economy, but essential to human existence itself.  To counteract the ecological footprint of existing development,&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, M. and Rees W. E. (1996) ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing the Human Impact on the Earth'', New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘surplus’ natural and social capital&lt;ref&gt;Surplus in PD means ‘giving back more than it takes’ from a life cycle and whole system perspective, not sending energy or water back to the grid or mains.&lt;/ref&gt; - assessed from fixed biophysical baselines - must be created both off-site and on-site by design.

=== Carbon-neutral Design ===
Net positive energy is barred by the laws of physics.  Moreover, calculations of ‘net energy’ seldom include the embodied energy - let alone ecological impacts incurred during resource extraction, production and transportation.  With substantial passive solar design and renewable energy, buildings can send unused energy back to the grid, but it might be used for unsustainable purposes elsewhere. Nonetheless, a building could sequester more carbon than it emits over its life cycle with substantial building-integrated vegetation, using PD design principles.  A case study (conducted by a cross-disciplinary team) showed this would within under twelve years, well under its life span.&lt;ref&gt;Renger, C., Birkeland, J. and Midmore, D. (2015) ‘Net Positive Building Carbon Sequestration: A Case Study in Brisbane’, in ''Building Research and Information: Special issue'' on net positive design 43(1), pp. 11-24. See also Birkeland, J.L. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25, http://trove.nla.gov.au/ accessed June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Reporting ===
The PD eco-positive design reporting process (EDR)&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to avoid many shortcomings of decision-based approaches to design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 83-96. Rating tools often give credits for things that have financial gains like energy and water savings or worker health and productivity but do not increase the ecology, let alone offset biodiversity impacts. They do not credit actual net positive impacts.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to green building rating tools, the EDR aims to uncover opportunities to create net public gains.  Design teams answer questions based on PD design criteria&lt;ref&gt;''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and SMARTmode analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257;  ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 251-273.&lt;/ref&gt; This forces education, collaboration and ‘frontloading’ design (i.e. investing more in preliminary design stages).&lt;ref&gt;See Weizacker, E. van, Lovins, A. and Lovins, H. (1997) ''Factor 4: Doubling Wealth – Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan, London, UK.  Hawken, P., Lovins, A and Lovins, H. (1999) ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', Earthscan, London, UK.  It is a widely cited claim that design is only about one percent of the total cost of the building, yet can save fifty to ninety percent of the total operating cost of a building.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing the research and reasoning behind decision and design concepts facilitates input from community, assessors and independent experts, and should therefore occur be undertaken in development project. Being affordable and flexible, it is also easily adapted to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;An example EDR process was created for Bogota based on a study of cultural, economic, social, ecological and other special needs.  This is not yet published.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Strategies ===
Eco-positive retrofitting is a priority PD strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Eco-Retrofitting with Building Integrated Living’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environment Conference Proceedings''. Delft, Netherlands. www.sasbe2009.com/ accessed May 2011; ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massive ongoing impacts of buildings, biophysical sustainability is impossible without retrofitting cities.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2013) ''Buildings and Climate Change: Summary for Decision Makers'', United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi (by United Nations organizations and national building institutes).  UN-HABITAT (2011) ''Cities and Climate Change: Global Report on Human Settlements''. http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS2011_Full.pdf/ accessed July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing buildings with greener ones costs too much in materials, money, energy and time, as new buildings represent only 1-3% of the building stock.  It is now accepted that retrofitting can be profitable in resource, energy, health savings and worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Romm, J. (1999) ''Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Emissions'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  EPA (1998) Market Values for Home Energy Efficiency (study by Nevin and Watson for the USA Environmental Protection Agency), Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; It can happen quickly and simultaneously, or when buildings are repurposed or refurbished anyway.  Green buildings may last a hundred years but few are designed for upgrading/adaptability, so they will soon need retrofitting to a higher standard.

== Design Assessment ==
Most rating tools prioritize resource efficiency and treat ‘reductions in negative impacts’ as if positive.  Their baselines and benchmarks preclude net-positive impacts.  Some provisions consider respective rights/responsibilities, but not broader ethical issues like improving human-nature relationships, reducing total resource flows or increasing social capital in the vicinity. Also, innovation is often valued for its own sake, not outcomes, and eco-efficiency saves owners money anyway. PD’s ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ analysis instead prioritizes positive system-wide outcomes and net public benefits.&lt;ref&gt;The PD ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ is summarized in Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 240-242.&lt;/ref&gt; Being non-numerical, it allows self-assessment during design when scientific data is unavailable, time and ego has vested or irreversible decisions are made.

=== PD Starfish ===
The PD ‘starfish’ design and rating tool enables quantification while assisting designers to consider more dimensions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2010) ‘Starfish Tool for Net Positive Design’, Presentation at ''Positive Communities'', DEEDI (Queensland Government), Brisbane;  Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), 163-187. (Note the tool is elaborated in a forthcoming book).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modified radar diagram with added layers and satellite diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Radar diagrams are standard spreadsheet tools.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most life cycle assessment tools estimate impacts between ‘-1’ (bad) to ‘0’ (best) or zero impact, eco-positive public benefits are excluded.  Unlike rating tools, benchmarks for different sustainability factors are based on fixed biophysical conditions - not typical buildings, sites or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D and R. Simpson (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth/Virtual Nations/Data Cities - Connecting Global Futures for Environmental Planning'', D. Jackson and R. Simpson, E-book, http://dcitynetwork.net/manifesto/; Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘The Eco-Positive Design Tool’, in ''Solar Progress'', Journal of the Australian Solar Energy Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The starfish uses one scale to assess impacts in relation to fixed benchmarks (from ‘-1’ to ‘+1’) and a linear scale on another layer for scoring/comparison purposes.

The '''post-graduate diploma in management studies''', [[post-nominal letters]] '''DMS''', is a university management qualification in the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Early structure===
The post-graduate qualification was originally accredited by the DMS Committee of the [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|DES]]. It originally required either one year full-time or 3 years part-time study, and was arranged in two discrete sections: Part A and Part B. It was compulsory to pass the Part A examinations and assessment first before being allowed to take Part B. Part B consisted of the final examinations and a project dissertation. Overall the marks achieved in coursework, examinations and the final dissertation had to exceed a weighted threshold for the candidate to pass and be awarded a DMS. It was thus quite an intensive course with a large workload. If a candidate achieved 90% or above, they were awarded a Distinction.

===Entry requirements===
Normally a bachelor's degree or extensive managerial experience and/or other professional qualifications. Originally there was also a lower age limit for entry of 35 years old, but this requirement was subsequently dropped as managers above that age found that the qualification had no value in achieving employment or promotion above 35.

===Accreditation===
Initially in the UK the qualification was accredited by the DMS committee of the DES, and later by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). It was originally accepted by the [[Chartered Management Institute|BIM]] as its core qualification for admission as a full member. The BIM subsequently was renamed to the Institute of Management when combining with the Institute of Industrial Managers, and now has again been renamed to become the [[Chartered Management Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.managers.org.uk CIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
The assessment for the few DMS courses which are still run in the UK is now almost without any formal examinations being required to be passed. It is thus subjectively awarded on the basis of course performance only, according to the opinion of the academic staff responsible.

==Controversy==

It has been argued by some that the move away from mainly or wholly exam assessed courses has lessened the 'value of the qualification' however the change from exams to coursework, projects and assignments is fairly in keeping with most postgraduate UK qualifications, although some exams are normally required.

==Recognition==
The DMS is accepted by the CMI as part of the required qualification for [[chartered manager]].

'''Sacred Harp''' singing is a tradition of sacred choral music that originated in [[New England]] and was later perpetuated and carried on in the [[American South]] of the United States. The name is derived from ''The Sacred Harp,'' a ubiquitous and historically important tunebook printed in [[shape notes]]. The work was first published in 1844 and has reappeared in multiple editions ever since.  Sacred Harp music represents one branch of an older tradition of American music that developed over the period 1770 to 1820 from roots in [[New England]], with a significant, related development under the influence of "revival" services around the 1840s. This music was included in, and became profoundly associated with, books using the [[shape note]] style of notation popular in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;David Warren Steel, "Shape-note hymnody," in ''Grove Music Online'' (Oxford UP: article updated 16 October 2013) [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2252332 Subscription Required]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred Harp music is performed ''[[a cappella]]'' (voice only, without instruments) and originated as [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian]] music.

== The music and its notation ==

The name of the tradition comes from the title of the shape-note book from which the music is sung, ''The Sacred Harp''. This book exists today in various editions, discussed below.

In shape-note music, notes are printed in special shapes that help the reader identify them on the [[scale (music)|musical scale]]. There are two prevalent systems, one using four shapes, and one using seven.  In the four-shape system used in ''The Sacred Harp'', each of the four shapes is connected to a particular syllable, ''fa'', ''sol'', ''la'', or ''mi'', and these syllables are employed in singing the notes,&lt;ref&gt;This is a simplified version of Guidonian solmization which was also used in Elizabethan England: see [[Solfège#Origin]]&lt;/ref&gt; just as in the more familiar system that uses ''do'', ''re'', ''mi'', etc. (see [[solfege]]). The four-shape system is able to cover the full musical scale because each syllable-shape combination other than ''mi'' is assigned to two distinct notes of the scale. For example, the C major scale would be notated and sung as follows:

[[Image:TheShapesOfShapeNoteSinging 4ShapeSystem.gif|center||600 px|The [[C major scale]] in [[shape notes]]]]

The shape for ''fa'' is a triangle, ''sol'' an oval, ''la'' a rectangle, and ''mi'' a diamond.

In Sacred Harp singing, pitch is not absolute. The shapes and notes designate degrees of the scale, not particular pitches. Thus for a song in the key of C, ''fa'' designates C and F; for a song in G, ''fa'' designates G and C, and so on; hence it is called a ''moveable "do"'' system.

When Sacred Harp singers begin a song, they normally start by singing it with the appropriate syllable for each pitch, using the shapes to guide them. For those in the group not yet familiar with the song, the shapes help with the task of [[sight reading]]. The process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory. Once the shapes have been sung, the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words.

==Singing Sacred Harp music==
[[File:HollowSquareInSacredHarp.PNG|thumb|The hollow-square seating arrangement for Sacred Harp singing]]
Sacred Harp groups always sing [[a cappella]], that is to say, without accompanying instruments.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, no [[harp]]s are present. The term "Sacred Harp" is sometimes taken by singers to be a metaphor for the human voice (Anon. 1940, 127).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On a number of early historical recordings, a piano or parlor organ accompanied the singers. In the ensuing decades, the practice of using such instruments has evidently died out.&lt;/ref&gt;  The singers arrange themselves in a hollow square, with rows of chairs or pews on each side assigned to each of the four parts:  treble, [[Alto (voice)|alto]], [[tenor]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. The treble and tenor sections are usually mixed, with men and women singing the notes an octave apart.

There is no single leader or conductor; rather, the participants take turns in leading. The leader for a particular round selects a song from the book, and "calls" it by its page number. Leading is done in an open-palm style, standing in the middle of the square facing the tenors (see: ''[[Leading Sacred Harp music]]'').

The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] at which the music is sung is relative; there is no instrument to give the singers a starting point. The leader, or else some particular singer assigned to the task, finds a good pitch with which to begin and intones it to the group (see: ''[[Pitching Sacred Harp music]]''). The singers reply with the opening notes of their own parts, and then the song begins immediately.

The music is usually sung not literally as it is printed in the book, but with certain deviations established by custom; see [[Performance practice of Sacred Harp music]].

As the name implies, Sacred Harp music is [[sacred music]] and originated as Protestant Christian music. Many of the songs in the book are [[hymn]]s that use words, meters, and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in Protestant [[hymn]]ody. However, Sacred Harp songs are quite different from "mainstream" Protestant hymns in their musical style: some tunes, known as [[fuguing tune]]s, contain sections that are [[polyphony|polyphonic]] in texture, and the [[harmony]] tends to deemphasize the interval of the [[interval (music)|third]] in favor of [[perfect fourth|fourths]] and [[perfect fifth|fifths]]. In their melodies, the songs often use the [[pentatonic scale]] or similar "gapped" (fewer than seven-note) scales.

In their [[musical form]], Sacred Harp songs fall into three basic types. Many are ordinary ''[[hymn tune]]s'', mostly composed in four-bar phrases and sung in multiple verses.  ''[[Fuging tune]]s'' contain a prominent passage about 1/3 of the way through in which each of the four choral parts enters in succession, in a way resembling a [[fugue]].  ''Anthems'' are longer songs, less regular in form, that are sung through just once rather than in multiple verses.&lt;ref&gt;The harmony and form of Sacred Harp music are discussed in Cobb (1978, chapter 2) and in more technical detail in Horn (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venues for singing===

Sacred Harp singing normally occurs not in church services, but in special gatherings or "singings" arranged for the purpose. Singings can be local, regional, statewide, or national. Small singings are often held in homes, with perhaps only a dozen singers. Large singings have been known to have more than a thousand participants. The more ambitious singings include an ample potluck dinner in the middle of the day, traditionally called "dinner on the grounds."

Some of the largest and oldest annual singings are called "conventions". The oldest Sacred Harp convention was the [[Southern Musical Convention]], organized in [[Upson County, Georgia]] in 1845. The two oldest surviving Sacred Harp singing conventions are the [[Chattahoochee Musical Convention]] (organized in [[Coweta County, Georgia]] in 1852), and the [[East Texas]] Sacred Harp Convention (organized as the [[East Texas Musical Convention]] in 1855).

=== Sacred Harp music as participatory music ===
[[File:Sacred Harp 192 Schenectady.webm|thumb|Performance in Alabama of the tune "Schenectady", 2011]]
Sacred Harp singers view their tradition as a participatory one, not a passive one. Those who gather for a singing sing for themselves and for each other, and not for an audience. This can be seen in several aspects of the tradition.

First, the seating arrangement (four parts in a square, facing each other) is clearly intended for the singers, not for external listeners. Non-singers are always welcome to attend a singing, but typically they sit among the singers in the back rows of the tenor section, rather than in a designated separate audience location.

The leader, being equidistant from all sections, in principle hears the best sound. The often intense sonic experience of standing in the center of the square is considered one of the benefits of leading, and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song.

The music itself is also meant to be participatory. Most forms of choral composition place the melody on the top (treble) line, where it can be best heard by an audience, with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody. In contrast, Sacred Harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right, thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task.&lt;ref&gt;Horn (1970, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, "bringing out the melody" is not a high priority in Sacred Harp composition, and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors. Fuging tunes, in which each section gets its moment to shine, also illustrate the importance in Sacred Harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part.

==History of Sacred Harp singing==

Marini (2003) traces the earliest roots of Sacred Harp to the "country parish music" of early 18th century England. This form of rural church music evolved a number of the distinctive traits that were passed on from tradition to tradition, until they ultimately became part of Sacred Harp singing. These traits included the assignment of the melody to the tenors, harmonic structure emphasizing fourths and fifth, and the distinction between the ordinary four-part hymn ("plain tune"), the anthem, and the [[fuging tune]]. Several composers of this school, including [[Joseph Stephenson (composer)|Joseph Stephenson]] and [[Aaron Williams (composer)|Aaron Williams]], are represented in the 1991 Edition of ''The Sacred Harp''.  For further information on the English roots of Sacred Harp music, see ''[[West gallery music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for this paragraph: Marini (2003, 77), Temperley (1983), and the essay "Distant Roots of Shape Note Music" by Keith Willard, posted at the fasola.org web site ([http://fasola.org/introduction/English_Roots.html]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the mid 18th century, the forms and styles of English country parish music were introduced to America, notably in a new tunebook called ''Urania'', published 1764 by the singing master [[James Lyon (singing master)|James Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Marini (2003, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;  This stimulus soon led to the development of a robust native school of composition, signaled by the 1770 publication of [[William Billings]]'s ''The New England Psalm Singer'', and then by a great number of new compositions by Billings and those who followed in his path. The work of these composers, sometimes called the "[[Music of the United States before 1900#First New England School|First New England School]]", forms a major part of the Sacred Harp to this day.

Billings and his followers worked as singing masters, who led [[singing schools]]. The purpose of these schools was to train young people in the correct singing of sacred music. This pedagogical movement flourished, and led ultimately to the invention of [[shape note]]s, which originated as way to making the teaching of singing easier. The first shape note tunebook appeared in 1801:  ''The Easy Instructor''&lt;ref&gt;Dick Hulan writes, "My copy of William Smith's ''Easy Instructor, Part II'' (1803) attributes the invention [of shape notes] to 'J. Conly of Philadelphia'." According to David Warren Steel, in ''John Wyeth and the Development of Southern Folk Hymnody'', "This notation was invented by Philadelphia merchant John Connelly, who on 10 March 1798 signed over his rights to the system to Little and Smith." Andrew Law also laid claim to the invention of the shape note system.&lt;/ref&gt; by William Smith and William Little. At first, Smith and Little's shapes competed with a rival system, created by [[Andrew Law (composer)|Andrew Law]] (1749–1821) in his ''The Musical Primer'' of 1803. Although this book came out two years later than Smith and Little's book, Law claimed earlier invention of shape notes. In his system, a square indicated ''fa'', a circle ''sol'', a triangle ''la'' and a diamond, ''mi.'' Law used the shaped notes without a musical staff. The Smith and Little shapes ultimately prevailed.

Shape notes became very popular, and during the first part of the nineteenth century, a [[List of shape-note tunebooks|whole series]] of shape note tunebooks appeared, many of which were widely distributed. As the population spread west and south, the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically. Composition flourished, with the new music often drawing on the tradition of [[folk music|folk song]] for tunes and inspiration. Probably the most successful shape note book prior to ''The Sacred Harp'' was [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', published in 1835 and still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;The shape note systems continued to evolve throughout the 19th century; for a more complete history, see [[shape note]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as they flourished and spread, shape notes and the kind of participatory music which they served came under attack. The critics were from the urban-based "better music" movement, spearheaded by [[Lowell Mason]], which advocated a more "scientific" style of sacred music, more closely based on the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] styles of contemporaneous European music. The new style gradually prevailed. Shape notes and their music disappeared from the cities prior to the Civil War, and from the rural areas of the Northeast and Midwest in the following decades. However, they retained a haven in the rural South, which remained a fertile territory for the creation of new shapenote publications.&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph: Marini (2003, 81). Evidence that Americans outside the rural South were slow, even reluctant, to give up their old music is given in Horn (1970, ch. 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arrival of ''The Sacred Harp'' ===
Sacred Harp singing came into being with the 1844 publication of [[Benjamin Franklin White]] and [[Elisha J. King]]’s ''The Sacred Harp''. It was this book, now distributed in several different versions, that came to be the shape note tradition with the largest number of participants.

B. F. White (1800-1879) was originally from [[Union County, South Carolina]], but since 1842 had been living in [[Harris County, Georgia]]. He prepared ''The Sacred Harp'' in collaboration with a younger man, E. J. King, (ca. 1821–44), who was from [[Talbot County, Georgia]]. Together they compiled, transcribed, and composed tunes, and published a book of over 250 songs.

King died soon after the book was published, and White was left to guide its growth.  He was responsible for organizing [[singing school]]s and conventions at which ''The Sacred Harp'' was used as the songbook. During his lifetime, the book became popular and would go through three revisions (1850, 1859, and 1869), all produced by committees consisting of White and several colleagues working under the auspices of the [[Southern Musical Convention]].  The first two new editions simply added appendices of new songs to the back of the book. The 1869 revision was more extensive, removing some of the less popular songs and adding new ones in their places. From the original 262 pages, the book was expanded by 1869 to 477. This edition was reprinted and continued in use for several decades.

===Origin of the modern editions===

Around the turn of the 20th century, Sacred Harp singing entered a period of conflict over the issue of traditionalism. The conflict ultimately split the community.&lt;ref&gt;The primary source for this section is Cobb (2001, chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

B. F. White had died in 1879 before completing a fourth revision of his book; thus the version that Sacred Harp participants were singing from was by the turn of the century over three decades old. During this time, the musical tastes of Sacred Harp's traditional adherents, the inhabitants of the rural South, had changed in important ways. Notably, [[Southern Gospel|gospel music]] - syncopated and chromatic, often with piano accompaniment - had become popular, along with a number of church hymns of the "mainstream" variety, such as "Rock of Ages."  Seven-shape notation systems had appeared and won adherents away from the older four-shape system (see [[shape note]] for details). As time passed, Sacred Harp singers doubtless became aware that what they were singing had become quite distinct from contemporary tastes.

The natural path to take&amp;mdash;and the one ultimately taken&amp;mdash;would be to assert the archaic character of Sacred Harp as an outright virtue. In this view, Sacred Harp should be treasured as a time-tested musical tradition, standing above current trends of fashion. The difficulty with adopting traditionalism as a guiding doctrine was that different singers had different opinions about just what form the stable, traditionalized version of Sacred Harp would take.

The first move was made by [[Wilson Marion Cooper|W. M. Cooper]], of [[Dothan, Alabama]], a leading Sacred Harp teacher in his own region, but not part of the inner circle of B. F. White's old colleagues and descendants. In 1902 Cooper prepared a revision of ''The Sacred Harp'' that, while retaining most of the old songs, also added new tunes that reflected more contemporary music styles.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2004) characterizes Cooper book style thus: it "contains a greater proportion of "camp meeting" songs than the Denson book, with more compressed part-writing, chromatic harmonies, and choruses characterized by call-and-response rather than "fuging" style. Denson book singers generally say that the Cooper book sounds more like "new book or
gospel singing."&lt;/ref&gt;  Cooper made other changes, too:

*He retitled many old songs. These songs were formerly named by their tune, using arbitrarily chosen place names ("New Britain", "Northfield", "Charlestown"). The new names were based on the text; thus "New Britain" became "Amazing Grace", "Northfield" became "How Long, Dear Savior", and so on. The old system was intended in colonial times to permit mixing and matching of tunes and texts, but was unnecessary in a system where the pairing of tune and text was fixed.
*He transposed some songs into new keys. This is thought to have brought the notation closer to actual performing practice.
*He wrote new alto parts for the many songs that originally just had three vocal lines.

The Cooper revision was a success, being widely adopted in many areas of the South, such as Florida, southern Alabama, and Texas, where it has continued as the predominant Sacred Harp book to this day. The "Cooper book," as it is now often called, was revised by Cooper himself in 1907 and 1909. His son-in-law published the book in 1927, including an appendix compiled by revision committee. The Sacred Harp Book Company was formed in 1949, and subsequent revision has been supervised by editorial committees under its instruction. New editions were issued in 1950, 1960, 1992, 2000, 2006 and 2012.

In the original core geographic area of Sacred Harp singing, northern Alabama and Georgia, the singers did not in general take to the Cooper book, as they felt it deviated too far from the original tradition. Obtaining a new book for these singers was made more difficult by the fact that B. F. White's son [[James Landrum White|James L. White]], who would have been the natural choice to prepare a new edition, was a non-traditionalist.  His "fifth edition" (1909)&lt;ref&gt;This edition may be viewed in digital form at [http://originalsacredharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/j-l-white-sacred-harp-fifth-edition.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; won little support among singers, while his "fourth edition with supplement" (1911) enjoyed some success in a few areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 98-110&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a committee headed by [[Joseph Stephen James]] produced an edition entitled ''Original Sacred Harp'' (1911) that largely satisfied the wishes of this community of singers.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 94-98&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SacredHarp1991ed.jpg|thumb|1991 edition of ''The Sacred Harp'' showing the characteristic horizontal format of shape note books]] --&gt;
[[File:Photo of Original Sacred Harp (Denson edition) songbook.jpg|thumb|"Original Sacred Harp (Denson Revision)"]]

The James edition was further revised in 1936 by a committee under the leadership of the brothers [[Seaborn McDaniel Denson|Seaborn]] and [[Thomas Jackson Denson|Thomas Denson]], both influential [[singing school]] teachers. Both died shortly before the project was complete, and the remaining work was overseen by [[Paine Denson]], son of Thomas. This book was entitled ''Original Sacred Harp, Denson Revision'', and was itself revised 1960, 1967, and 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 110-117&lt;/ref&gt; a more thorough revision and remodeling of this book, overseen by [[Hugh McGraw]], is known simply as the "1991 Edition," though some singers still call it the "Denson book."

Even the highly traditionalist James and Denson books followed Cooper in adding alto parts to most of the old three-part songs (these alto parts led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Cooper).&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; Some people (see for instance the reference by Buell Cobb given below) believe that the new alto parts imposed an esthetic cost by filling in the former stark open harmonies of the three-part songs. Wallace McKenzie (reference below) argues to the contrary, basing his view on a systematic study of representative songs.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie further judges that the Cooper alto parts were more successful than the Denson ones in retaining the original harmonic style.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, there is little support today for abandoning the added alto parts, since most singers give a high priority to giving every side of the square its own part to sing.

It was thus that the traditionalism debate split the Sacred Harp community, and there seems little prospect that it will ever reunite under a single book. However, there have been no further splits. Both the Denson and the Cooper groups adopted traditionalist views for the particular form of Sacred Harp they favored, and these forms have now been stable for about a century.

The strength of traditionalism can be seen in the front matter of the two hymnbooks. The Denson book is forthrightly Biblical in its defense of tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;DEDICATED TO
All lovers of Sacred Harp Music, and to the memory of the illustrious and venerable patriarchs who established the Traditional Style of Sacred Harp singing and admonished their followers to "seek the old paths and walk therein".&lt;ref&gt;The passage quotes [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 6:16:  "Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cooper book also shows a warm appreciation of tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May God bless everyone as we endeavor to promote and enjoy Sacred Harp music and to continue the rich tradition of those who have gone before us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To say that both communities are traditionalist does not mean they discourage the creation of new songs. To the contrary, it is part of the tradition that musically creative Sacred Harp singers should become composers themselves and add to the canon. The new compositions are prepared in traditional styles, and could be considered a kind of tribute to the older material. New songs have been incorporated into editions of ''The Sacred Harp'' throughout the 20th century.

===Other Sacred Harp books===

Two other books are currently used by Sacred Harp singers. A few singers in north Georgia employ the "White book," an expanded version of the 1869 B. F. White edition edited by [[James Landrum White|J. L. White]]. [[African-American]] Sacred Harp singers, although primarily users of the Cooper book, also make use of a supplementary volume, ''The Colored Sacred Harp'', produced by [[Judge Jackson]] (1883–1958) in 1934 and later revised in two subsequent editions. In his book ''Judge Jackson and The Colored Sacred Harp'', Joe Dan Boyd identified four regions of Sacred Harp singing among African-Americans: eastern Texas (Cooper book), northern Mississippi (Denson book), south Alabama and Florida (Cooper book), and New Jersey (Cooper book). The ''Colored Sacred Harp'' is limited to the New Jersey and south Alabama-Florida groups. Sacred Harp was "exported" from south Alabama to New Jersey. It appears to have died out among the African-Americans in eastern Texas.

In summary, three revisions of and one companion book to ''The Sacred Harp'' are currently in use in Sacred Harp singing:

*''The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition'' (the "Denson book"). Carrollton, GA: Sacred Harp Publishing Company.
*''The Sacred Harp, Revised Cooper Edition, 2012''. Samson, AL: The Sacred Harp Book Company.
*''The Sacred Harp, J. L. White Fourth Edition, with Supplement'' (the "White book"). Atlanta, GA: J. L. White. Released 1911; republished 2007.
*''The Colored Sacred Harp''. Ozark, AL: Judge Jackson. [3rd revised edition (1992) includes rudiments by H. J. Jackson (son of J. Jackson) and an autobiography of Judge Jackson].

Sacred Harp books generally contain a section on [[Rudiments of music|rudiments]], describing the basics of music and Sacred Harp singing.

===The spread of Sacred Harp singing in modern times===

In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has experienced a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not grow up in the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;For an extended narrative of this spread, see Bealle (1997, chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt; New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.&lt;ref name="Clawson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clawson|first=Laura|title=I Belong to This Band, Hallelujah!: Community, Spirituality, and Tradition Among Sacred Harp Singers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8bua5aSIDMC&amp;pg=PA163|date=15 September 2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10959-6|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The U.S. beyond the South====
There are now strong Sacred Harp singing communities in most major urban areas of the United States, and in many rural areas, as well.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to singings that demonstrates this dramatic spread may be found at the "fasola.org" web site, under http://fasola.org/singings/.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first groups of singers formed outside the traditional Southern home region of Sacred Harp singing was in the Chicago area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Miller (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The first Illinois convention was held in 1985, with enthusiastic and strongly proactive support by prominent Southern traditional singers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Midwest Convention is now acknowledged to be one of the major American conventions, attracting hundreds of singers from all over the US and abroad.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Similarly, the Sacred Harp singing community in western New England has become a prominent one in recent years. In March 2008, the 2008 Western Massachusetts Sacred Harp Convention attracted over 300 singers from 25 states and a number of foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-13/120504721045690.xml&amp;coll=1|title=Sacred Harp sing draws followers|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent singing conventions outside the South include, for example, the Keystone Convention in Pennsylvania, the Missouri Convention, and the Minnesota State Convention, which began in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freude.com/mnfasola/convention.html|title=22nd Annual Minnesota State Sacred Harp Singing Convention|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacred Harp Singing beyond the US====
In more recent times Sacred Harp singing has spread beyond the borders of the United States.

The [[United Kingdom]] has had an active Sacred Harp community since the 1990s. The first UK Sacred Harp convention took place in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/ukconvns.html |title=Conventions |work=United Kingdom Sacred Harp &amp; Shapenote Singing |publisher=Edwin and Sheila Macadam |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are regular singings in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonsacredharp.org/|title=London Sacred Harp|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonsacredharp.bandcamp.com/|title=Music - London Sacred Harp|work=London Sacred Harp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Home Counties, the Midlands, Yorkshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sheffieldsacredharp.weebly.com/|title=Sheffield &amp; South Yorkshire Sacred Harp|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancashire, Manchester, Brighton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightonshapenote.weebly.com/|title=Brighton Shape Note Singing|work=Brighton Shape Note Singing|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyneside,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastleshapenote.co.uk/|title=tyneside sacred harp and shape note singing|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Anglia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norwichsacredharp.tumblr.com/|title=Norwich Sacred Harp|work=Norwich Sacred Harp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolsacredharp.org/|title=Bristol Sacred Harp|work=Bristol Sacred Harp|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapenotescotland.weebly.com/|title=Shapenote Scotland|work=Shapenote Scotland|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has a decades-long tradition of Sacred Harp singing, particularly in [[Southern Ontario]] and the [[Eastern Townships]] of [[Quebec]]. Singings have been organized weekly in [[Montreal, Quebec]] since 2011, as well as a monthly afternoon sing, and the first Montreal all-day sing took place in the spring of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/montrealsacredharpsingers/|title=Montreal Sacred Harp Singers - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred Harp singing has happened on a monthly basis for years in [[Toronto]].

[[Australia]] has had Sacred Harp singing since 2001, and singings are held regularly in Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/147368602037141/|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/surryhillsshapenotesingers/|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canberra &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/Canberrashapenote/|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blackwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blackwood-Academy/121582631252295|title=Blackwood Academy|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Australian All Day Singing was held in Sydney in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timberandsteel.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/australias-first-ever-sacred-harp-singing-convention-hits-sydney/|title=Australia’s First Ever Sacred Harp Singing Convention Hits Sydney|work=Timber and Steel|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Sacred Harp singing was introduced to [[Ireland]], by Dr Juniper Hill of [[University College Cork]], spreading quickly from a class module into the wider community. In March 2011 U.C.C. hosted the first annual Ireland Sacred Harp Convention, and the Cork community held their first All-Day Singing on 22 October 2011. There are now also growing Sacred Harp communities in Belfast and Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corksacredharp.com/|title=Cork Sacred Harp|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most recent development, Sacred Harp singing has expanded beyond the limits of English-speaking countries to mainland Europe. In 2008 a singing community was established in Poland (which hosted the first Camp Fasola Europe in September 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://campfasola.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Camp-Fasola-Application-Europe-2012.pdf Application form for Camp Fasola Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany there are regular weekly or monthly singings in Bremen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/english|title=English - Sacred Harp Bremen|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Hamburg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacredharphamburg.weebly.com/|title=Sacred Harp Singing in Hamburg - Sacred Harp Hamburg Singing School - Home|work=Sacred Harp Singing in Hamburg|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpberlin.de|title=Sacred Harp Berlin|last=|first=|date=|website=Sacred Harp Berlin|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cologne&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpcologne.com|title=Sacred Harp Cologne|website=Sacred Harp Cologne|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Munich, most of them with their own annual All-Day singings.  Elsewhere in Germany, singers meet irregularly in Frankfurt, Gießen and Nürnberg.

==Origins of the music==
{{See also|Sacred Harp hymnwriters and composers}}
The music used in Sacred Harp singing is eclectic. Most of the songs can be assigned to one of four historical layers.

{{ordered list
| The oldest of these layers comes from 18th century New England, and represents a rendition in shape notes of the work of outstanding early American composers such as [[William Billings]] and [[Daniel Read]], who worked as singing masters.&lt;/li&gt;
| A second layer comes from the decades around 1830, following the migration of the shape note tradition to the rural South. Many of the songs in this layer are believed to be originally secular [[folk music|folk tunes]], harmonized in parts and given religious lyrics. As one would expect from the folk origin of such music, it often emphasizes the notes of the [[pentatonic scale]]. They often employ stark, vivid harmonies based on open fifths. Most of the songs of this layer were originally composed in just three parts (treble, tenor, bass), with the altos added later, as noted above.

The sound of this musical layer, as well as to some extent ''The Sacred Harp'' in general, can be observed by comparing versions of the well-known hymn "[[Amazing Grace]]", which is familiar to many Americans in a form such as the following:

[[File:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.PNG|center|thumb|600 px|A familiar harmonization of "Amazing Grace".  [[Media:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.OGG|Click]] to hear piano reduction ([[Ogg]] format, 234K)]]

In ''The Sacred Harp'' (1991 edition), "Amazing Grace" is harmonized quite differently. Note that the "air", or melody, is in the tenor.

(As noted above, the title "New Britain" is the name of the tune, not the song as a whole.)

| A third layer of ''Sacred Harp'' music is from the mid nineteenth century and represents the popular sensibility of that era. A number of these mid-century works have an almost primal simplicity&amp;mdash;the harmony is essentially a single extended major chord, and the parts a decoration in slow tempo of that chord.
| The most recent layer consists of the songs that were added to the books during the twentieth century. These are the work of musically creative participants in the Sacred Harp tradition, who strove to create songs that would fit into the existing tradition by adopting the style of one of the earlier periods. About a sixth of the Denson edition is taken up with such compositions, dating from as recently as 1990. The twentieth-century composers often have recycled their lyrics from earlier Sacred Harp songs (or from their sources, such as the work of the 18th-century hymnodist [[Isaac Watts]]). A number of these modern compositions have become favorites of the singing community, and it is anticipated that future editions of ''The Sacred Harp'' will also include new songs.
}}

There are a few additional songs in ''The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition'' that cannot be assigned to any of these four main layers. There are some very old songs of European origin, as well as songs from the English rural tradition that inspired the early New England composers. There are also a handful of songs by European [[classical music|classical]] composers ([[Ignaz Pleyel]], [[Thomas Arne]], and [[Henry Rowley Bishop]]).The book even includes five hymns by [[Lowell Mason]], long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that ''The Sacred Harp'' has preserved to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See the online Index to the Denson edition: http://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?v=composer&lt;/ref&gt;

The description just given is based on ''The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition'', also known as the Denson edition. The widely used "Cooper" edition overlaps considerably (about 60%) in content, but also includes many later songs. A detailed comparison of the two editions has been made by Sacred Harp scholar Gaylon L. Powell, available [http://resources.texasfasola.org/tunecomparisonindex.html here].

==Other books with the title ''Sacred Harp''==

''The Sacred Harp'' was a popular name for 19th century hymn and tune books, with no fewer than four bearing the title. The first of these was compiled by John Hoyt Hickok and printed in [[Lewistown, Pennsylvania|Lewiston, Pennsylvania]] in 1832. The second was compiled by Lowell and Timothy Mason and printed in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1834, as part of the "better music" movement mentioned above. The publisher released their book as a [[shape note]] edition, while they preferred to urbanize their audience by releasing a round note edition.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1933b, 395)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gould (55)&lt;/ref&gt;

The third ''Sacred Harp'' was the one by [[Benjamin Franklin White|B. F. White]] and E. J. King (1844), the origin of today's Sacred Harp singing tradition.

Lastly, according to W. J. Reynolds, writing in ''Hymns of Our Faith'', there was yet a fourth ''Sacred Harp'' - ''The Sacred Harp'' published by J. M. D. Cates in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1867.

The '''Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings''' ('''SPAB''') (sometimes known as '''Anti-Scrape'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E. P.|last=Thompson|authorlink=E. P. Thompson|year=1976|title=William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary|publisher=Pantheon|quote=The Society, which Morris dubbed "Anti-Scrape...|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-394-73320-7|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[amenity society]] founded by [[William Morris]], [[Philip Webb]] and others, in 1877; to oppose what they saw as destructive 'restoration' of ancient buildings then occurring in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[England]]; 'ancient' being used in the wider sense of 'very old' rather than the more usual modern one of 'pre-[[medieval]]'.

Morris was particularly concerned about the practice, which he described as 'forgery', of attempting to return functioning buildings to an idealised state from the distant past, which often involved the removal of elements added in their later development, and which Morris saw as contributing to their interest as documents of the past.  Instead, he proposed that ancient buildings should be repaired, not restored, so that their entire history would be protected as [[cultural heritage]].  Today, these principles are widely accepted.

==Organisation and activities==
Today, the SPAB still operates according to Morris's original manifesto.  It campaigns, advises, runs training programmes and courses, conducts research and publishes information.  As one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], the Society is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[Listed Building|listed buildings]], and by law must be notified of any application in England and Wales to demolish in whole or part any listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]]|title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015|date=24 March 2015|url=https://www.GOV.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015|website=www.GOV.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|HM Government]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It currently has c. 8,500 members (2012).  The Society also has a branch in [[Scotland]].

The society's Mills Section is the only British national body concerned with the protection, repair and continued use of traditional [[windmill]]s and [[watermill]]s; [[Ken Major]] carried out much work on its behalf.

The society, which is a registered charity, is based at 37 [[Spitalfields|Spital Square]], [[London|LONDON]] [[London E1|E1]] 6DY, [[England]].

For its dedicated service to heritage, the society was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards|European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://EuropaNostra.org/laureates-2012/|title=2012 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards – Category 3 - Dedicated service|website=EuropaNostra.org|publisher=[[Europa Nostra]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://EuropaNostra.org/awards/89/|title=The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB)|website=EuropaNostra.org|publisher=[[Europa Nostra]]|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-254_en.htm|title=Winners of 2012 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards announced|website=Europa.eu|publisher=[[European Commission]] - press release|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57395">'''Species reintroduction''' is the deliberate release of a [[species]] into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism is capable of survival.&lt;ref name="Campbell-Palmer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell-Palmer | first1 = R. | last2 = Rosell | first2 = F. | year = 2010 | title = Conservation of the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber: an olfactory perspective | url = | journal = Mammal Review | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 293–312 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2907.2010.00165.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of species reintroduction is to establish a healthy, [[Genetic diversity|genetically diverse]], self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing [[population]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965796229|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics|last=Frankham|first=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jon|last3=Briscoe|first3=David|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|location=United Kingdom|pages=419–470|oclc=965796229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species that may be eligible for reintroduction are typically [[Threatened species|threatened or endangered]] in the wild. However, reintroduction of a species can also be for [[pest control]]. For example, wolves being reintroduced to a wild area to curb an [[overpopulation]] of elk or deer. Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term "'''reestablishment'''".&lt;ref name="Campbell-Palmer 2010"/&gt;

Humans have been reintroducing species for food and pest control for thousands of years. However, the practice of reintroducing for conservation is much younger, starting in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Seddon 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seddon | first1 =    | year = 2007 | title =   Developing the Science of Reintroduction Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 303–312 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00627.x | pmid = 17391180 | last2 = Armstrong | first2 = DP | last3 = Maloney | first3 = RF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for sourcing individuals==
There are a variety of approaches to species reintroduction. The optimal strategy will depend on the biology of the organism.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Guidelines for Restorations and Other Conservation Translocations|url=http://www.iucn-whsg.org/sites/default/files/IUCN%20Guidelines%20to%20Reintroduction%20and%20Other%20Conservation%20Translocations.pdf|website=IUCN|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first matter to address when beginning a species reintroduction is whether to source individuals ''in situ'', from wild populations, or ''ex situ'', from captivity in a zoo or botanic garden, for example.

===''In situ'' sourcing===
''[[In situ]]'' sourcing for restorations involves moving individuals from an existing wild population to a new site where the species was formerly extirpated. Ideally, populations should be sourced ''in situ'' when possible due to the numerous risks associated with reintroducing organisms from captive populations to the wild.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that reintroduced populations have the best chance of surviving and reproducing, individuals should be sourced from populations that genetically and ecologically resemble the recipient population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Generally, sourcing from populations with similar environmental conditions to the reintroduction site will maximize the chance that reintroduced individuals are well adapted to the habitat of the reintroduction site .&lt;ref name="Houde et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houde|first1=Aimee|last2=Garner|first2=Shawn|last3=Neff|first3=Bryan|title=Restoring species through reintroductions: strategies for source population selection|journal=Restoration Ecology|date=2015|volume=23|issue=6|pages=746–753|doi=10.1111/rec.12280|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montalvo|first=Arlee M.|last2=Ellstrand|first2=Norman C.|date=2000-08-15|title=Transplantation of the Subshrub Lotus scoparius: Testing the Home-Site Advantage Hypothesis|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99250.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1034–1045|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99250.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consideration for ''in situ'' sourcing is at which life stage the organisms should be collected, transported, and reintroduced. For instance, with plants, it is often ideal to transport them as seeds as they have the best chance of surviving translocation at this stage. However, some plants are difficult to establish as seed and may need to be translocated as juveniles or adults.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Guidelines for Restorations and Other Conservation Translocations|url=http://www.iucn-whsg.org/sites/default/files/IUCN%20Guidelines%20to%20Reintroduction%20and%20Other%20Conservation%20Translocations.pdf|website=IUCN|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ex situ'' sourcing===
In situations where ''in situ'' collection of individuals is not feasible, such as for rare and endangered species with too few individuals existing in the wild, [[Ex situ conservation|''ex situ'']] collection possible. 
''Ex situ'' collection methods allow storage of individuals that have high potential for reintroduction. Storage examples include [[germplasm]] stored in seed banks, sperm and egg banks, [[cryopreservation]], and tissue culture.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods that allow for storage of a high numbers of individuals also aim to maximize genetic diversity. Stored materials generally have long lifespans in storage, but some species do lose viability when stored as seed.&lt;ref name="Walters 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Christina|last2=Wheeler|first2=Lana|last3=Grotenhuis|first3=Judith|title=Longevity of seeds stored in a genebank: species characteristics|journal=Seed Science Research|date=2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–20|accessdate=|doi=10.1079/ssr2004195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue culture and cryopreservation techniques have only been perfected for a few species.&lt;ref name="Engelmann 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelmann|first1=Florent|title=Use of biotechnologies for the conservation of plant biodiversity|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology-Plant|date=2011|volume=47|issue=1|pages=5–16|accessdate=|doi=10.1007/s11627-010-9327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Organisms may also be kept in living collections in captivity. Living collections are more costly than storing [[germplasm]] and hence can support only a fraction of the individuals that ''ex situ'' sourcing can.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk increases when sourcing individuals to add to living collections.

==Successes and failures==
Reintroduction biology is a relatively young discipline and continues to be a work in progress.  No strict and accepted definition of reintroduction success exists, but it has been proposed that the criteria widely used to assess the conservation status of endangered taxa, such as the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria, should be used to assess reintroduction success.&lt;ref name="Robert 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A. | last2 = Colas | first2 = B.  | last3 = Guigon | first3 = I. | last4 = Kerbiriou | first4 = C.  | last5 = Mihoub | first5 = J.B. | last6 = Saint-Jalme | first6 = M.  | last7 = Sarrazin | first7 = F. |year = 2015 | title = Defining reintroduction success using IUCN criteria for threatened species: a demographic assessment | url = | journal = Animal Conservation | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 397–406| doi = 10.1111/acv.12188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful reintroduction programs should yield viable and self-sustainable populations in the long-term.

Assessments from all of the studies included goals, success indicators, project summary, major difficulties faced, major lessons learned, and success of project with reasons for success or failure. A similar assessment focused solely on plants found high rates of success for rare species reintroductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albrecht|first=Matthew A.|last2=Guerrant Jr.|first2=Edward O.|last3=Maschinski|first3=Joyce|last4=Kennedy|first4=Kathryn L.|date=2011-11-01|title=A long-term view of rare plant reintroduction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711002849|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=144|issue=11|pages=2557–2558|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2011.07.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of data from the Center for Plant Conservation International Reintroduction Registry found that, for the 49 cases where data were available, 92% of the reintroduced plant populations survived two years.

Many factors can attribute to the success or failure of a reintroduction.  Predators, food, pathogens, competitors, and weather can all affect a reintroduced population's ability to grow, survive, and reproduce.The number of animals reintroduced in an attempt should also vary with factors such as social behavior, expected rates of predation, and density in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimberger|first=Kirsten|last2=Downs|first2=Colleen T.|last3=Perrin|first3=Mike R.|date=2009-10-01|title=Two Unsuccessful Reintroduction Attempts of Rock Hyraxes (Procavia capensis) into a Reserve in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3957/056.039.0213|journal=South African Journal of Wildlife Research|volume=39|issue=2|pages=192–201|doi=10.3957/056.039.0213|issn=0379-4369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals raised in captivity may experience stress during captivity or translocation, which can weaken their immune systems.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007" /&gt;

Unfortunately, the monitoring period that should follow reintroductions often remains neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Sarrazin, F. Barbault, R. (November 1996).

== Genetic considerations ==
When a species has been extirpated from a site where it previously existed, individuals that will comprise the reintroduced population must be sourced from wild or captive populations. When sourcing individuals for reintroduction, it is important to consider [[local adaptation]], adaptation to captivity (for [[ex situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]]), the possibility of [[inbreeding depression]] and [[outbreeding depression]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]], and [[genetic diversity]] of the source population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reintroduced populations experience increased vulnerability to influences of [[Genetic drift|drift]], [[Natural selection|selection]], and [[gene flow]] evolutionary processes due to their small sizes, climatic and ecological differences between source and native habitats, and presence of other mating-compatible populations.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latch|first=Emily K.|last2=Rhodes|first2=Olin E.|date=2006-01-21|title=The effects of gene flow and population isolation on the genetic structure of␣reintroduced wild turkey populations: Are genetic signatures of source populations retained?|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10592-005-9089-2|journal=Conservation Genetics|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=981–997|doi=10.1007/s10592-005-9089-2|issn=1566-0621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sork|first=Victoria L.|date=2015-11-03|title=Gene flow and natural selection shape spatial patterns of genes in tree populations: implications for evolutionary processes and applications |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=291–310|doi=10.1111/eva.12316 |pmc=4780383|pmid=27087853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the species slated for reintroduction is rare in the wild, it is likely to have unusually low population numbers, and care should be taken to avoid [[inbreeding]] and [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inbreeding can change the frequency of allele distribution in a population, and potentially result in a change to crucial genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, [[outbreeding depression]] can occur if a reintroduced population can hybridize with existing populations in the wild, which can result in offspring with reduced fitness, and less adaptation to local conditions. To minimize both, practitioners should source for individuals in a way that captures as much genetic diversity as possible, and attempt to match source site conditions to local site conditions as much as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Capturing as much [[genetic diversity]] as possible, measured as [[heterozygosity]], is  suggested in species reintroductions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some protocols suggest sourcing approximately 30 individuals from a population will capture 95% of the genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Maintaining genetic diversity in the recipient population is crucial to avoiding the loss of essential local adaptations, minimizing inbreeding depression, and maximizing fitness of the reintroduced population.

=== Ecological Similarity ===
Plants or animals that undergo reintroduction may exhibit reduced fitness if they are not sufficiently adapted to local environmental conditions. Therefore, researchers should consider ecological and environmental similarity of source and recipient sites when selecting populations for reintroduction. Environmental factors to consider include climate and soil traits (pH, percent clay, silt and sand, percent combustion carbon, percent combustion nitrogen, concentration of Ca, Na, Mg, P, K).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Historically, sourcing plant material for reintroductions has followed the rule "local is best," as the best way to preserve local adaptations, with individuals for reintroductions selected from the most geographically proximate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havens|first=Kayri|last2=Vitt|first2=Pati|last3=Still|first3=Shannon|last4=Kramer|first4=Andrea T.|last5=Fant|first5=Jeremie B.|last6=Schatz|first6=Katherine|date=2015-01-01|title=Seed Sourcing for Restoration in an Era of Climate Change|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3375/043.035.0116|journal=Natural Areas Journal|volume=35|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.3375/043.035.0116|issn=0885-8608}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, geographic distance was shown in a [[common garden experiment]] to be an insufficient predictor of fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, projected climatic shifts induced by [[climate change]] have led to the development of new seed sourcing protocols that aim to source seeds that are best adapted to project climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

A study of the reintroduction of ''[[Castilleja levisecta]]'' found that the source populations most physically near the reintroduction site performed the poorest in a field experiment, while those from the source population whose ecological conditions most closely matched the reintroduction site performed best, demonstrating the importance of matching the evolved adaptations of a population to the conditions at the reintroduction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Beth|last2=Kaye|first2=Thomas|date=2011|title=Reintroduction of Castilleja levisecta: Effects of Ecological Similarity, Source Population Genetics, and Habitat Quality|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=19|pages=166–176|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00549.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptation to Captivity ===
Some reintroduction programs use plants or animals from captive populations to form a reintroduced population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When reintroducing individuals from a captive population to the wild, there is a risk that they have adapted to captivity due to differential selection of genotypes in captivity versus the wild. 
The genetic basis of this adaptation is selection of rare, [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[allele]]s that are deleterious in the wild but preferred in captivity.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; Consequently, animals adapted to captivity show reduced stress tolerance, increased tameness, and loss of local adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=Richard|date=2008|title=Genetic adaptation to captivity in species conservation programs|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=17|pages=325–333|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2007.03399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also can show adaptations to captivity through changes in drought tolerance, nutrient requirements, and seed dormancy requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ensslin|first=Andreas|last2=Tschöpe|first2=Okka|last3=Burkart|first3=Michael|last4=Joshi|first4=Jasmin|date=2015-12-01|title=Fitness decline and adaptation to novel environments in ex situ plant collections: Current knowledge and future perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715301373|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=192|pages=394–401|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extent of adaptation is directly related to intensity of selection, genetic diversity, [[effective population size]] and number of generations in captivity. 
Characteristics selected for in captivity are overwhelmingly disadvantageous in the wild, so such adaptations can lead to reduced fitness following reintroduction. 
Reintroduction projects that introduce wild animals generally experience higher success rates than those that use captive-bred animals.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; Genetic adaptation to captivity can be minimized through management methods: by maximizing generation length and number of new individuals added to the captive population; minimizing effective population size, number of generations spent in captivity, and [[Natural selection|selection]] pressure; and reducing genetic diversity by [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; For plants, minimizing adaptation to captivity is usually achieved by sourcing plant material from a [[seed bank]], where individuals are preserved as wild-collected seeds, and have not had the chance to adapt to conditions in captivity. However, this method is only plausible for plants with [[seed dormancy]].&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt;

=== Genetic Trade-offs ===
In reintroductions from captivity, translocation of animals from captivity to the wild has implications for both captive and wild populations. Reintroduction of genetically valuable animals from captivity  improves genetic diversity of reintroduced populations while depleting captive populations; conversely, genetically valuable captive-bred animals may be closely related to individuals in the wild and thus increase risk of inbreeding depression if reintroduced. 
Increasing genetic diversity is favored with removal of genetically overrepresented individuals from captive populations and addition of animals with low genetic relatedness to the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Earnhardt|first=Joanne M.|date=November 1999|title=Reintroduction programmes: genetic trade-offs for populations|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00074.x|journal=Animal Conservation|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=279–286|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00074.x|issn=1367-9430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/774393970|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last=1942-|first=Frankham, Richard,|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Ballou, J.

== Improving research techniques ==
A cooperative approach to reintroduction by ecologists and biologists could improve research techniques. For both preparation and monitoring of reintroductions,  increasing contacts between academic population biologists and wildlife managers is encouraged within the Survival Species Commission and the IUCN.  The IUCN states that a re-introduction requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of persons drawn from a variety of backgrounds.&lt;ref name="SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group 1995"/&gt; A survey by Wolf et al. in 1998 indicated that 64% of reintroduction projects have used subjective opinion to assess habitat quality.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007"/&gt;  This means that most reintroduction evaluation has been based on human anecdotal evidence and not enough has been based on statistical findings. Seddon et al. (2007) suggest that researchers contemplating future reintroductions should specify goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction, and planning and evaluation processes should incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches.&lt;ref name="Seddon 2007" /&gt;

Monitoring the health of individuals, as well as the survival, is important; both before and after the reintroduction. Intervention may be necessary if the situation proves unfavorable.&lt;ref name="SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group 1995"/&gt;  Population dynamics models that integrate demographic parameters and behavioral data recorded in the field can lead to simulations and tests of a priori hypotheses. Using previous results to design further decisions and experiments is a central concept of [[adaptive management]]. In other words, learning by doing can help in future projects. Population ecologists should therefore collaborate with biologists, ecologists, and wildlife management to improve reintroduction programs.&lt;ref name="bgci.org"&gt;BGCI: The global network. Retrieved April 30, 2012 from http://www.bgci.org/ourwork/Ecosystems/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic monitoring ===
For reintroduced populations to successfully establish and maximize reproductive fitness, practitioners should perform genetic tests to select which individuals will be the founders of reintroduced populations and to continue monitoring populations post-reintroduction.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines" /&gt; A number of methods are available to measure the genetic relatedness between and variation among individuals within populations.

Long-term genetic monitoring is recommended post-reintroduction to track changes in genetic diversity of the reintroduced population and determine success of a reintroduction program. 
Adverse genetic changes such as loss of [[heterozygosity]] may indicate management intervention, such as population supplementation, is necessary for survival of the reintroduced population.&lt;ref name="Haye 877–892"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haye|first=M.

==Re-introduction Specialist Group (RSG)==
The RSG is a network of specialists whose aim is to combat the ongoing and massive [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] by using re-introductions as a responsible tool for the management and restoration of biodiversity. It does this by actively developing and promoting sound inter-disciplinary scientific information, policy, and practice to establish viable wild populations in their natural habitats.
The role of the RSG is to promote the re-establishment of viable populations in the wild of animals and plants. The need for this role was felt due to the increased demand from re-introduction practitioners, the global conservation community and increase in re-introduction projects worldwide.

Increasing numbers of animal and plant species are becoming rare, or even extinct in the wild. In an attempt to re-establish populations, species can – in some instances – be re-introduced into an area, either through translocation from existing wild populations, or by re-introducing captive-bred animals or artificially propagated plants.

'''Spektr-RG''' (Russian for ''[[Electromagnetic spectrum|Spectrum]]'' + ''[[X-ray|Röntgen]]'' + ''[[Gamma ray|Gamma]]''; also called '''Spectrum-X-Gamma''', '''SRG''', '''SXG''') is a Russian/German [[high-energy astronomy|high-energy astrophysics]] observatory. {{As of|April 2016}} it is planned to launch in 2019.&lt;ref name="Spektr-RG" /&gt;
The primary instrument of the mission is [[eROSITA]], built by the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] (MPE). It is designed to be used to conduct a 4-year X-ray survey sky, the first in a medium X-ray band up to 10 keV energies.
This survey will detect many new [[Galaxy cluster|clusters of galaxies]] and [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].
The second instrument, [[ART-XC]], is a Russian high energy X-ray telescope.
This instrument and spacecraft are being built under the leadership of the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI). 

== Spacecraft ==
The Spektr-RG programme was revived in 2005&lt;ref name ="IKI2005"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/SXG/PROJECT/SXG-eng.htm | date = 2005-10-30 | accessdate=2011-02-04 | publisher = [[Russian Space Research Institute]] | title = Spectrum-RG/eRosita/Lobster mission definition document}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the spacecraft was in final stages of assembly during 2016. Instrument launch is scheduled for early-2019.&lt;ref name="Spektr-RG"/&gt;.

[[File:PlanetaSH(3).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Artist's impression of one possible appearance of a superhabitable planet. The reddish hue is vegetation.&lt;ref name="Plnts" /&gt;]]

A '''superhabitable planet''' is a hypothetical type of [[exoplanet]] or [[exomoon]] that may be better suited than [[Earth]] for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence]] and [[evolution]] of  [[life]]. The concept was introduced in 2014 by René Heller and John Armstrong,{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}} who have criticized the language used in the search for [[Planetary habitability|habitable planets]], so they propose clarifications because a [[circumstellar habitable zone]] (HZ) is not enough to define a planet's habitability.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=51|ps=}} Heller and  Armstrong state that it is not clear why Earth should offer the most suitable physicochemical parameters to living organisms, because "planets could be non-Earth-like, yet offer more suitable conditions for the emergence and evolution of life than Earth did or does."  While still assuming that life requires water, they hypothesize that Earth may not represent the optimal [[planetary habitability]] conditions for maximum [[biodiversity]]; in other words, they define a superhabitable world as a [[Rocky planet|terrestrial planet]] or moon that could support more diverse [[flora]] and [[fauna]] than there are on Earth, as it would empirically show that its [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] is more hospitable to life.

Heller and Armstrong also point out that not all [[rocky planet]]s in a [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] (HZ) may be habitable, and that [[tidal heating]] can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ, such as in [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s internal ocean.&lt;ref name="HZ"&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Reynolds, R.T. |author2=McKay, C.P. |author3=Kasting, J.F. |title=Europa, tidally heated oceans, and habitable zones around giant planets |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0273117787903644 |journal=Advances in Space Research |pages=125–132 |issue=7 |year=1987 | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(87)90364-4|bibcode = 1987AdSpR...7..125R }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The habitable zone (HZ) is a region present around each star where a terrestrial planet or moon that has an atmospheric pressure and a suitable combination of gases, could maintain liquid water on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mendez |first=Abel |date=10 August 2011 |title=Habitable Zone Distance (HZD): A habitability metric for exoplanets |journal=PHL |url=http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/habitablezonesdistancehzdahabitabilitymetricforexoplanets |access-date=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data|title=Planetary Habitability Laboratory |access-date=17 July 2015 |publisher=PHL de la [[University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo|UPRA]] |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, planets in the HZ may not be habitable, as tidal heating during the planet's orbit can be an additional heat source that causes a planet to enter a runaway greenhouse state.|group=n.}}  The authors propose that in order to identify a habitable—or superhabitable—planet, a characterization concept is required that is biocentric rather than geo- or [[anthropocentric]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}} Heller and Armstrong proposed to establish a profile for exoplanets according to stellar type, mass and location in their [[planetary system]], among other features. According to these authors, such superhabitable worlds would likely be larger, warmer, and older than Earth, and orbiting [[K-type main-sequence star]]s.

== General characteristics ==
Heller and Armstrong proposed that a series of basic characteristics are required to classify an [[exoplanet]] or [[exomoon]] as superhabitable;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/super-habitable-world-may-exist-near-earth/ |title=Super-Habitable World May Exist Near Earth |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=March 14, 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Williams, D.M. |author2=Kasting, J.F. |title=Habitable Planets with High Obliquities |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957596 |journal=Icarus |pages=254–267 |issue=1 | date=September 1997 |doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5759 |bibcode=1997Icar..129..254W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Rushby, A.J. |author2=Claire, M.W. |author3=Osborn, H. |author4=Watson, A.J. |title=Habitable Zone Lifetimes of Exoplanets around Main Sequence |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2012.0938 |journal=Astrobiology |pages=833–849 |issue=13 |date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} for size, it is required to be about 2 [[mass of the Earth|Earth masses]], and 1.3 [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] will provide an optimal size for [[plate tectonics]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55|ps=}} In addition, it would have a greater [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] that would increase retention of gases during the planet's formation.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} It is therefore likely that they have a denser [[atmosphere]] that will offer greater concentration of [[oxygen]] and [[greenhouse gas]]es, which in turn raise the average temperature to optimum levels for plant life to about {{convert|25|C|F}}.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}}&lt;ref name="ScAm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/superhabitable-planets/ |title=Faraway Planets May Be Far Better for Life |access-date=20 April 2015 |last=Moyer |first=Michael |date=31 January 2014 |journal=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt; A denser atmosphere may also influence the surface relief, making it more regular and decreasing the size of the [[ocean basin]]s, which would improve diversity of marine life in shallow waters.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-56|ps=}}

Other factors to consider are the [[Stellar classification|type of star]] in the system. [[K-type star]]s are less massive than the Sun, and are stable on the main sequence for a very long time (15 to 30 billion years, compared to 10 billion for the Sun, a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G-class star]]),{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56-57|ps=}} giving more time for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]] and [[evolution]]. A superhabitable world would also require to be located near the center of the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of its star system for a long time.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56|ps=}}{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}

Experts have not reached a consensus about what is the optimal rotation speed for an exoplanet, but it should not be too fast nor too slow. The latter case can cause some problems similar to those observed in Venus, which completes one rotation every 243 Earth days and as a result, cannot generate an Earth-like [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |title=Planet Venus Facts: A Hot, Hellish &amp; Volcanic Planet |url=http://www.space.com/44-venus-second-planet-from-the-sun-brightest-planet-in-solar-system.html |journal=Space.com |date=4 November 2014 |access-date=2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57-58|ps=}}

=== Atmosphere ===
There are no solid arguments to explain if Earth's atmosphere has the optimal composition to host life.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} On Earth, during the period when [[coal]] was first formed, atmospheric oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) levels were up to 35%, and  coincided with the periods of greatest [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Falcon-Lang, H. J.| title=Fire ecology of a Late Carboniferous floodplain, Joggins, Nova Scotia| year=1999| publisher=Journal of the Geological Society| location=London| chapter=156| pages=137–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, assuming that the presence of a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is essential for exoplanets to develop complex life forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Harrison, J.F. |author2=Kaiser, A. |author3=VandenBrooks, J.M. |title=Atmospheric oxygen level and the evolution of insect body size |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1690/1937 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |pages=1937–1946 |volume=277 |date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} the percentage of oxygen relative to the total atmosphere appears to limit the maximum size of the planet for optimum superhabitability and ample biodiversity{{Clarify|date=October 2016}}.

Also, the atmospheric density should be higher in more massive planets, which reinforces the hypothesis that [[super-Earths]] can provide superhabitable conditions.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}}

=== Age ===
[[File:Artist’s Impression of a Baby Star Still Surrounded by a Protoplanetary Disc.jpg|280px|thumb|right|The first stars that formed in the universe were [[metallicity|metal-free stars]], which probably prevented planet formation.]]
In a biological context, older planets than Earth may have greater biodiversity, since native species have had more time to [[Biological evolution|evolve]], adapt and stabilize the environmental conditions to sustain a suitable environment for life that can benefit their descendants.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56-57|ps=}}

However, for many years it was thought that since older star systems have lower [[metallicity]], they should display low planet formation, and thus such old planets may have been scant in the beginning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ray |last=Sanders |title=When Stellar Metallicity Sparks Planet Formation |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/when-stellar-metallicity-sparks-planet-formation/ |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |date=9 April 2012 |access-date=7 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the number of ''[[Metallicity|metallic]]'' items in the universe must have grown steadily since its inception.&lt;ref name="AgP"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/17441-universe-heavy-metals-planet-formation.html |title=When Did the Universe Have the Right Stuff for Planets? |access-date=24 April 2015 |journal=Space.com |last=Cooper |first=Keith |date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first exoplanetary discoveries, mostly gas giants orbiting very close to their stars, known as ''[[Hot Jupiters]]'', suggest that planets were rare in systems with low metallicity, which invited suspicion of a time limit on the appearance of the first objects landmass.{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=188-189|ps=}} Later, in 2012, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler telescope]]'s observations allowed experts to find out that this relationship is much more restrictive in systems with [[Hot Jupiters]], and that terrestrial planets could form in stars of much lower metallicity, to some extent.&lt;ref name="AgP" /&gt;  It is now thought that the first Earth-mass objects should appear sometime between 7 and 12 billion years.&lt;ref name="AgP" /&gt; Given the greater stability of the orange dwarfs (K-type) compared to the Sun (G-type) and longer life expectancy, it is possible that superhabitable exoplanets belonging to K-type stars, orbiting within its habitable zone, could provide a longer, steadier, and better environment for life than Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}

== Profile summary ==

Despite the scarcity of information available, the hypotheses presented above on superhabitable planets can be summarized as a preliminary profile, even if there is no scientific consensus.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} 
* Mass: approximately 2M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Radius: to maintain a similar Earth density, its radius should be between 1.2 and 1.3R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Oceans: percentage of surface area covered by oceans should be Earth-like but more distributed, without large continuous land masses. The oceans should be shallow; the light then will penetrate easier through the water and will reach the fauna and flora, stimulating an abundance of life down in the ocean.
* Distance: shorter distance from the center of the habitable zone of the system than Earth.
* Temperature: average surface temperature of about {{convert|25|C|F}}.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}} 
* Star and age: belonging to an intermediate [[K-type star]] with an older age than the Sun (4.5 billion years) but younger than 7 billion years.
* Atmosphere: somewhat denser than Earth's and with a higher concentration of oxygen. That will make life larger and more abundant.

There is no confirmed exoplanet that meets all these requirements. After updating the database of exoplanets on 23 July 2015, the one that comes closest is [[Kepler-442b]], belonging to an orange dwarf star, with a radius of 1.34R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; and a mass of 2.34M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;, but with an estimated surface temperature of {{convert|-2.65|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=Kepler-442+b| title=NASA Exoplanet Archive |access-date=8 January 2015 |first=[[NASA]] |work=NASA Exoplanet Science Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data|title=Planetary Habitability Laboratory |access-date=7 January 2015 |first=[[PHL]] |work=PHL University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance ===

The appearance of a superhabitable planet should be, in general, very similar to Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}} The main differences, in compliance with the profile seen previously, would be derived from its mass. Its denser atmosphere probably prevent the formation of ice sheets as a result of lower thermal difference between different regions of the planet.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Also, it has a higher concentration of clouds, and abundant rainfall.

Probably the vegetation is very different due to the increased air density, precipitation, temperature, and stellar flux. For the type of light emitted from the [[K-type star]]s, plants may take other colors than green.&lt;ref name="Plnts"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| author=Nancy Y.

In general, the climate of a superhabitable planet would be warmer, moist, homogeneous and have stable land, allowing life to extend across the surface without presenting large population differences, in contrast to Earth that has inhospitable areas such as glaciers, deserts and tropical regions.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-56|ps=}} If the atmosphere contains enough molecular oxygen, the conditions of these planets may be bearable to humans even without the protection of a [[space suit]], provided that the atmosphere does not contain excessive toxic gases, but would require some adaptation to the increased gravity, such as an increase in muscles and  in bone density, etc.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}&lt;ref name="WW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/20728-new-alien-planets-oceans-life.html |title=What Might Alien Life Look Like on New 'Water World' Planets? |access-date=23 April 2015 |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=18 April 2013 |publisher=Space.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abundance ==
[[File:SH Planet comp.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Set and subsets of terrestrial worlds.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}}]]
Heller and Armstrong speculate that the number of superhabitable planets can far exceed that of [[Earth analog]]s:{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}} less massive stars in the [[main sequence]] are more abundant than the larger and brighter stars, so there are more orange dwarfs than solar analogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=LeDrew |first=Glenn |year=2001 |title=The Real Starry Sky |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |volume=95 |issue=686 |pages=32–33 |issn=0035-872X |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2001JRASC..95...32L&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=16 July 2015 |bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that about 9% of stars in the Milky Way are [[K-type star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Croswell |first=Ken |title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60sPD6yjbVAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=percentage+%22orange+dwarfs%22+milky+way&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zit9UpfGA-&amp;sig=o1ASitJqAFJH7NqnlVOyRS-DLsU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI0_Ki-cjgxgIVxVoUCh3AYACT#v=onepage&amp;q=percentage%20%22orange%20dwarfs%22%20milky%20way&amp;f=false |access-date=17 July 2015 |edition=1 |year=1997 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0684832526 |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point favoring the predominance of superhabitable planets in regard to Earth analogs is that, unlike the latter, most of the requirements of a superhabitable world can occur spontaneously and jointly simply by having a higher mass.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-58|ps=}} A planetary body close to 2 or 3M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; should have longer-lasting plate tectonics and also will have a larger surface area in comparison to Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} Similarly, it is likely that its oceans are shallower by the effect of gravity on the planet's crust, its gravitational field more intense and, a denser atmosphere.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}}

By contrast, Earth-mass planets may have a wider range of conditions. For example, some may sustain active tectonics for a shorter time period and will therefore end up with lower air density than Earth, increasing the probability of developing global ice coverage, or even a permanent [[Snowball Earth]] scenario.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Another negative effect of lower atmospheric density can be manifested in the form of thermal oscillations, which can lead to high variability in the global climate and increase the chance for  catastrophic events. In addition, by having a weaker [[magnetosphere]], such planets may lose their atmospheric hydrogen by [[hydrodynamic escape]] easier and become a desert planet.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Any of these examples could prevent the emergence of life on a planet's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star/#.VMlrZi4XeOU |title=NASA's Kepler Discovers First Earth-Size Planet In The 'Habitable Zone' of Another Star |access-date=4 August 2015 |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |date=17 April 2014 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the multitude of scenarios that can turn an Earth-mass planet located in the habitable zone of a solar analogue into an inhospitable place are less likely on a planet that meets the basic features of a superhabitable world, so that the latter should be more common.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}}

'''Wild animal suffering''' is the [[suffering]] experienced by nonhuman animals in nature through causes such as disease, injury, starvation, natural disasters, and killings by other animals.

There is considerable disagreement around this latter point, as many believe that human intervention in nature would be either unethical, unfeasible, or both.

== Extent of suffering in nature ==

In his [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiography]], [[Charles Darwin]] acknowledged that the existence of extensive suffering in nature was fully compatible with the workings of natural selection, yet maintained that [[Reinforcement#Reinforcement|pleasure]] was the main driver of fitness-increasing behavior in organisms.&lt;ref name=Darwin1993 /&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] challenged Darwin's claim in his book ''[[River Out of Eden]]'', wherein he argued that wild animal suffering must be extensive due to the interplay of the following evolutionary mechanisms:

* [[Gene-centered view of evolution|Selfish genes]] – genes are wholly indifferent to the well-being of individual organisms as long as DNA is passed on.
	 
* [[Struggle for existence|The struggle for existence]] – competition over limited resources results in the majority of organisms dying before passing on their genes.
	 
* [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian checks]] – even bountiful periods within a given ecosystem eventually lead to overpopulation and subsequent population crashes.
From this, Dawkins concludes that the natural world must necessarily contain enormous amounts of animal suffering as an inevitable consequence of [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawkins|first1=Richard|title=River Out of Eden|date=1995|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-01606-5|chapter=Chapter 4: God's Utility Function}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this he wrote:[[File:Mouse litter.jpg|thumb|A litter of [[House mouse|mice]] with their mother. The reproduction of mice follows an ''r''-selection strategy, with many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=9781857994056|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Building on this, others have argued that the prevalence of [[r-selection|r-selected animals]] in the wild indicates that the average life of a wild animal is likely to be very short and end in a painful death. According to this view, the average life of a wild animal should thus contain more suffering than happiness, since a painful death would outweigh any short-lived moments of happiness in their short lives.&lt;ref name="Horta2010a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild|journal=Télos|year=2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=73–88|url=https://www.academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagoff1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ng1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|authorlink1=Yew-Kwang Ng|title=Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of Animal Consciousness and Suffering|journal=Biology and Philosophy|year=1995|volume=10|issue=3|pages=255–285|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00852469|doi=10.1007/BF00852469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?'' Christie Wilcox argues that wild animals do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings of wild animals having greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals. Additionally, unlike domestic animals, animals in the wild do not have some of their needs provided for them by human caretakers.&lt;ref name="Bambi or Bessie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Christie|title=Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/04/12/bambi-or-bessie-are-wild-animals-happier/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=8 May 2016|date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare economist [[Yew-Kwang Ng]] has written that evolutionary dynamics can lead to animal welfare which is worse than necessary for a given population equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Ng1995" /&gt;

==Philosophical status==

=== History of concern for wild animals ===
In the essay 'On Nature', [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote about suffering in nature and the normativity of struggling against it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned for doing to one another, are nature's every day performances. [...] The phrases which ascribe perfection to the course of nature can only be considered as the exaggerations of poetic or devotional feeling, not intended to stand the test of a sober examination. No one, either religious or irreligious, believes that the hurtful agencies of nature, considered as a whole, promote good purposes, in any other way than by inciting human rational creatures to rise up and struggle against them.
[...] Whatsoever, in nature, gives indication of beneficent design proves this beneficence to be armed only with limited power; and the duty of man is to cooperate with the beneficent powers, not by imitating, but by perpetually striving to amend, the course of nature - and bringing that part of it over which we can exercise control more nearly into conformity with a high standard of justice and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Nature |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1874/nature.htm |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English writer and naturalist [[Henry Stephens Salt]] wrote an entire chapter on the plight of wild animals, 'The Case of Wild Animals', in his 1894 book [[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]. Salt wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is of the utmost importance to emphasize the fact that, whatever the legal fiction may have been, or may still be, the rights of animals are not morally dependent on the so-called rights of property; it is not to owned animals merely that we must extend our sympathy and protection. [...]
To take advantage of the sufferings of animals, whether wild or tame, for the gratification of sport, or gluttony, or fashion, is quite incompatible with any possible assertion of animals' rights.&lt;ref name="animal-rights-library.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Salt argued that humans are justified in killing wild animals in self-defense, but that "[...] we are not justified in unnecessarily killing—still less in torturing—any harmless beings whatsoever." He argues that this applies to insects as well: "We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not to take it away from the meanest insect without sufficient reason.'"&lt;ref name="animal-rights-library.com"/&gt;

In 1991, the environmental philosopher [[Arne Naess (philosopher)|Arne Naess]] critiqued what he termed the "cult of nature" of contemporary and historical attitudes of indifference towards suffering in nature. He argued that we should confront the reality of the wilderness and that we should be prepared to disturb natural processes when feasible to relieve suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naess|first1=Arne|title=Should We Try to Relieve Clear Cases  of Suffering in Nature?|journal=Pan Ecology|date=1991|volume=6|pages=1–5|url=https://www.abolitionist.com/reprogramming/suffering-nature.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology as intrinsically valuable ===

[[Holmes Rolston III]] argues that only unnatural animal suffering is a morally bad thing and that humans do not have a duty to intervene in natural cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolston III|first1=Holmes|title=Environmental Ethics: Duties To and Values in the Natural World|date=1988|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9780877225010|url=https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Ethics-Duties-Values-Natural/dp/0877226288|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrates carnivores in nature because of the significant ecological role they play. Others have argued that the reason that humans have a duty to protect other humans from predation is because humans are part of the cultural world rather than the natural world and so different rules apply to them in these situations.&lt;ref name=Hettinger1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hettinger|first=Ned|title=Valuing Predation in Rolston's Environmental Ethics|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1994|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.5840/enviroethics199416138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moriarty1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moriarty|first=Paul|author2=Mark Woods |title=Hunting ≠ Predation|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1997|volume=19|issue=4|pages=391–404|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19971945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that prey animals are fulfilling their natural function, and thus flourishing, when they are preyed upon or otherwise die, since this allows natural selection to work.&lt;ref name=Aaltola2010 /&gt;

=== Wild animal suffering as a ''reductio ad absurdum'' ===

That people would also be obliged to intervene in nature has been used as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' against the position that animals have rights.&lt;ref name=Simmons2009 /&gt; This is because, if animals such as prey animals did have rights, people would be obliged to intervene in nature to protect them, but this is claimed to be absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink1=David Benatar|title=Why the Naïve Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naïve|journal=Environmental Values|date=February 2001|volume=10|issue=1|pages=103–112|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|jstor=30301788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Rainer|title=Innocent Threats and the Moral Problem of Carnivorous Animals|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|year=2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=146–159|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2012.00561.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5930.2012.00561.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; An objection to this argument is that people do not see intervening in the natural world to save other people from predation as absurd and so this could be seen to involve treating non-human animals differently in this situation without justification.&lt;ref name=Horta2010c&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title= Disvalue in nature and intervention|journal=Pensata Animal|year=2010|volume=34|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/7822811/DisvalueNatureIntervention.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relevance to the theological problem of evil ===
{{Main|Problem of evil#Problem of evil and animal suffering}}

The [[problem of evil]] has been extended beyond human troubles to include the suffering of animals over the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions to reduce suffering ==

=== Arguments for intervention ===
Some theorists have reflected on whether we should accept the harms that animals suffer in nature or try to do something to mitigate them.&lt;ref name="Horta2010a" /&gt; The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights-based or welfare-based. From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to prevent such rights from being violated by other animals.&lt;ref name=Aaltola2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaltola|first=Elisa|authorlink1=Elisa Aaltola|title=Animal Ethics and the Argument from Absurdity|journal=Environmental Values|date=February 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=79–98|doi=10.3197/096327110X485392|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ev/2010/00000019/00000001/art00006|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a welfare-based perspective, a requirement to intervene may arise insofar as it is possible to prevent some of the suffering experienced by wild animals without causing even more suffering.&lt;ref name="Policing Nature" /&gt; Advocates of intervention in nature argue that nonintervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches. Some proposed courses of action include removing predators from wild areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|last2=MacAskill|first2=Amanda|title=To Truly End Animal Suffering, the Most Ethical Choice is To Kill Wild Predators (Especially Cecil the Lion)|url=http://qz.com/497675/to-truly-end-animal-suffering-the-most-ethical-choice-is-to-kill-all-predators-especially-cecil-the-lion/|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=17 April 2016|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grush|first1=Loren|title=Killing off wild predators is a stupid idea|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/10/9308195/killing-off-wild-predators-is-a-stupid-idea|website=The Verge|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; refraining from reintroducing predators,&lt;ref name=Sagoff1984 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horta2010b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=The Ethics of the Ecology of Fear against the Nonspeciesist Paradigm A Shift in the Aims of Intervention in Nature|journal=[[Between the Species]]|year=2010|volume=13|issue=10|pages=163–187|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2010v13n10.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing medical care to sick or injured animals,&lt;ref name=Pearce2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policing Nature" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reese|first1=Jacy|title=Wild animals endure illness, injury, and starvation.

=== The practicality of intervening in nature ===

A common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved, or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance.&lt;ref name=McMahan2010&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahan|first=Jeff|title=Predators: A Response|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/predators-a-response/?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Simmons argues that we should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in [[unintended consequences]] such as damaging the ecosystem, interfering with human projects, or resulting more animal deaths overall.&lt;ref name=Simmons2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Aaron|title=Animals, Predators, The Right to Life and The Duty to Save Lives|journal=Ethics &amp; The Environment|year=2009|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2979/ete.2009.14.1.15| pages=15–27|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/een/summary/v014/14.1.simmons.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has argued that intervention in nature would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run. In practice, however, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good.&lt;ref name=Singer1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=Food for Thought|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1973/jun/14/food-for-thought/|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=June 14, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=The Point of View of The Universe|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199603695|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors dispute Singer's empirical claim about the likely consequences of intervening in the natural world, and argue that some types of intervention can be expected to produce good consequences overall. Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] cites examples of animal species whose extinction is not generally regarded as having been on balance bad for the world. Cowen also notes that, insofar as humans are already intervening in nature, the relevant practical question is not whether we should intervene at all, but what particular forms of intervention we should favor.&lt;ref name="Policing Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|title=Policing Nature|journal=Environment Ethics|year=2003|volume=25|issue=2|pages=169–182|doi=10.5840/enviroethics200325231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Oscar Horta similarly writes that there are already many cases in which we intervene in nature for other reasons, such as for human interest in nature and environmental preservation as something valuable in their own rights.&lt;ref name=Horta2010a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild|journal=Télos|year=2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=73–88|url=https://www.academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, moral philosopher [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] argues that, since humans "are already causing massive, precipitate changes in the natural world," we should favor those changes that would promote the survival "of herbivorous rather than carnivorous species."&lt;ref name=McMahan2010 /&gt;

[[Peter Vallentyne]] suggests that, while humans should not eliminate predators in nature, they can intervene to help prey in more limited ways. In the same way that we help humans in need when the cost to us is small, we might help some wild animals at least in limited circumstances.&lt;ref name=Verchot2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verchot|first1=Manon|title=Meet the people who want to turn predators into vegans|url=http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/meet-the-people-who-want-to-turn-predators-into-vegans.html|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=TreeHugger|date=30 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential conflict between animal rights and environmentalism ===

It has been argued that the common environmentalist goal of preserving the natural order is not in line with the goal of looking after the welfare of sentient animals.&lt;ref name=Belshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Belshaw|first=Christoher|title=Environmental Philosophy|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=1-902683-21-8|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been further argued that they conflict in different cases. Examples include environmentalists supporting hunting invasive species for population control while animal rights advocates oppose it;&lt;ref name=Horta2010d&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horta|first1=Oscar|title=What Is Speciesism?|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|year=2010|volume=23|issue=3|pages=243–266|url=http://masalladelaespecie.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/whatisspeciesism.pdf|doi=10.1007/s10806-009-9205-2|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rights advocates arguing for the extinction or reengineering of carnivores or ''r'' strategist species while deep ecologists defend their right to be and flourish as they are;&lt;ref name=Pearce2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=David|title=Reprogramming Predators|year=2009|url=http://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/reprogramming-predators.html|publisher=HEDWEB|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rights advocates defending the reduction of wildlife areas or arguing against their expansion out of concern that most animal suffering takes place in them while environmentalists want to safeguard and expand the wild.&lt;ref name=Sagoff1984&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagoff|first=Mark|title=Animal Liberation and Environmental Ethics: Bad Marriage, Quick Divorce|journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal|year=1984|volume=22|issue=2|pages=297–307|url=http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1936&amp;context=ohlj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hettinger1994/&gt;

=== History of interventions ===
In 2016, 350 starving [[hippo]]s and [[African buffalo|buffalo]]es at [[Kruger National Park]] were killed by park rangers. One of the motives for the action was to prevent the animals from suffering as they died.&lt;ref name="krugercull"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Jason|title=South African national park to kill animals in response to severe drought|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/south-african-national-park-kill-animals-severe-drought|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
