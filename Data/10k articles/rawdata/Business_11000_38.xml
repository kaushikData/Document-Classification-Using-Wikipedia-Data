'''20 Times Square''' is a large mixed-use 39-story development located at 701 [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] on the northeast corner of West 47th Street in [[Times Square]], [[Manhattan]] at the top of the Times Square 'bow tie'.&lt;ref name="20 times square agents"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://commercialobserver.com/2014/05/ian-schrager-taps-cbre-for-20-times-square-retail/ |title=Ian Schrager Taps CBRE for 20 Times Square Retail| last=Barbarino| first=Al| publisher=Commercial Observer}} (May 21, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The development will include one of [[Ian Schrager|Ian Schrager's]] new Edition Hotels operated by [[Marriott International|Marriott]] above a 6-floor 76,000 sq ft retail component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/20/marriott-brings-schragers-vision-to-times-squares-new-edition/ |title=Marriott brings Schrager’s vision to Times Square’s new ‘Edition’ |publisher=[[New York Post]]|first=Steve |last=Cuozzo}} (January 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The building replaces the [[Cecil B. DeMille]] building previously home to the famous [[Unique Recording Studios]] which closed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mixonline.com/mag/audio_unique_recording_studio/ |title=Unique Recording Studio |publisher=Mix Magazine Online}} (August 1, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to City Planning Department documents, an increase in the size (and [[Floor area ratio|FAR]]) of the 500 foot tall building was made possible by the [[Air rights#Transfer of development rights|transfer of air rights]] from two nearby Broadway locations.&lt;ref name="Cuozzo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2013/12/16/mima-to-get-big-treehaus/ |title=MiMa to get big Treehaus| last=Cuozzo| first=Steve| publisher=[[New York Post]]}} (December 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

Between 2000 and 2011, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ) worked with [[Vornado Realty Trust]], who had partnered with the Lawrence Ruben Company.&lt;ref name = realdeal&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | title = Chinese Developer Pledges up to $700 million with Vornado Realty Trust for Port Authority Tower | magazine = [[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]] | date = July 15, 2011 | url = http://therealdeal.com/blog/2011/07/15/chinese-developer-soho-china-pledges-up-to-700m-with-vornado-realty-trust-for-port-authority-tower/ | accessdate = May 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, the PANYNJ announced the terms of an agreement in which it would receive nearly $500 million in a lease arrangement for a new office tower above the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] that would also provide funds for additional terminal facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=Tower Planned Atop Port Authority Bus Terminal in New Wave of Development |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 30, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/nyregion/30tower.html |accessdate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would include {{convert|1300000|sqft|m2}} of commercial space in a new office tower, which was to use the vanity address 20 Times Square, the addition of {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} of new retail space in the bus terminal, as well as 18 additional departure gates, accommodating 70 additional buses carrying up to 3,000 passengers per hour. New escalators would be installed to help move passengers more quickly between the gate area and the ground floor. Construction was expected to begin in 2009 or 2010 and take four years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunlap |first=David W. |title=Designs Unveiled for Tower Above Port Authority Bus Terminal |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/nyregion/25terminal.html |accessdate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=renderings&gt;{{cite press release |title=RENDERINGS RELEASED FOR PLANNED OFFICE TOWER ABOVE PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL'S NORTH WING |url=http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1021 |publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in the tradition of Times Square, and the [[zoning ordinance]]s requirement for building owners to display illuminated signs, the development would have featured a very large wraparound high definition LED screen, known as a [[Jumbotron]]. If completed the screen would have been one of the largest [[List of largest video screens|video-capable screen]]s in the world.&lt;ref name="co"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbarino |first=Al |url=http://commercialobserver.com/2014/05/ian-schrager-taps-cbre-for-20-times-square-retail/ |title=Ian Schrager Taps CBRE for 20 Times Square Retail |publisher=Commercial Observer |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screen would feature 16 million LED diodes (pixels) measuring only 10mm, providing 18,000 square feet of screen along 200 linear feet of wraparound frontage.&lt;ref name="20 times square agents" /&gt;&lt;ref name="co"/&gt; This would make the screen the largest single LED screen in New York and over six times the size of the famous [[Coca-Cola sign]] in Times Square. The sign would have been 1,000 square feet larger than Times Square's previous largest - the 17,000 square foot sign on the flagship [[Walgreens]] store located at [[One Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/nyregion/24sign.html |title=How to Stand Out in Times Square? Build a Bigger and Brighter Billboard| last=Collins| first=Glenn |work=The New York Times|date=May 24, 2008|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vanity address 20 Times Square has now been allocated by the City to a retail development at 701 7th Avenue (on the northeast corner of West 47th Street and Seventh Avenue) by the City in April 2014,&lt;ref name="20 times square agents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuozzo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rew-online1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rew-online.com/2014/05/20/cbre-to-market-20-times-square-retail/ |title=CBRE to market 20 Times Square retail |publisher=[[Real Estate Weekly]] |date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 it was announced that the retail space is being leased through the [[CBRE Group]].&lt;ref name="20 times square agents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rew-online1"/&gt;

On November 30, 2017, the [[National Football League]] and [[Cirque du Soleil]] opened [[NFL Experience]] Times Square—an interactive museum attraction devoted to the league, in four ground-level floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/hotels-resorts/hotel-openings/marriot-edition-hotel-times-square-ian-schrager|title=This New Times Square Hotel Will Be Wrapped in New York City's Biggest Billboard|work=Travel &amp; Leisure|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/the-future-of-cirque-du-soleil-isn-t-the-circus|title=The Future of Cirque du Soleil Isn’t the Circus|date=2017-11-29|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/legit/news/nfl-times-square-cirque-du-soleil-1201802172/|title=Cirque du Soleil, NFL Team Up For Massive Times Square Attraction|last=Cox|first=Gordon|date=2016-06-23|work=Variety|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/11/30/16716970/nfl-experience-times-square-football-theme-park-fans|title=The NFL opened up a football theme park in the middle of Times Square|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains broadcasting facilities for [[NFL Network]]'s [[morning show]] ''[[Good Morning Football]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/good-morning-football-moving-from-cbs-to-nfl-experience-times-square.html|title=Good Morning Football moving to new NFL Experience in Times Square|date=2018-02-13|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, it was announced that the attraction would close due to underperformance.

==Education==
Ahmad Faizal was born in Ipoh, Perak. He received his primary education at Cator Avenue School, Ipoh and had his secondary education at Anderson School, Ipoh. He graduated in Business Studies from [[Edith Cowan University]] in [[Perth]], [[Australia]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/12/perak-pakatan-chairman-ahmad-faizal-sworn-in-as-perak-mb/ |title=Perak Pakatan chairman Ahmad Faizal sworn in as Perak MB  |publisher=The Star Online |date=May 12, 2018 |website=The Star Online |access-date=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Arthur Lowes Dickinson''' (8 August 1859 – 28 February 1935)&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/46880&lt;/ref&gt; was a British chartered accountant in England and the United States of America.

Dickinson was the senior partner in the USA of Price Waterhouse (now [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] from 1901 to 1913, during which time he established the principles of consolidated accounting, to provide transparency about conglomerate companies.  He was also instrumental in the beginnings of international efforts to establish international accounting standards. A professorship at the Harvard Business School is named after him.

== Life ==

Dickinson was the eldest son of [[Lowes Cato Dickinson]], a Victorian portrait painter, and Margaret Ellen Williams, whose father had discovered [[Charlotte Bronte]] as reader for Smith, Elder, and Company. His younger brother, [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson]] was a distinguished political scientist and philosopher. He also had five sisters.

He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]], and at [[King's College Cambridge]], where he studied mathematics and graduated in 1882. He began a career in accountancy in 1883, and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1888, sharing first place in the Institute of Chartered Accountants' examinations with another candidate.

In 1901 he was posted to New York as the first resident senior partner in the USA of Price Waterhouse, then primarily a British partnership. One of his first acts was to devise a format for presenting the consolidated accounts of the United States Steel Corporation. From 1904 to 1906 he was President of the US Federation of Societies of Public Accountants, and in 1904 helped organise the First International Congress of Accountants in Saint Louis, Missouri, where he delivered a paper entitled "Profits of a Corporation" which set out the principles of consolidated accounting.&lt;ref&gt;http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/arthur-lowes-dickinson/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1906 he became a naturalised US citizen, but returned to London in 1913, where he remained as a senior partner of Price Waterhouse until 1925.

From 1917 to 1920 he was financial adviser to the Coal Controller (the coal industry having been placed under centralised control during the [[First World War]]), and was awarded a knighthood for his services in this capacity in 1919. After his retirement from Price Waterhouse he maintained an interest in the coal industry, being a director of several coal companies.

In 1888 he married Mary Katherine Jennings. They adopted two daughters.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Legacy ==

His work on developing consolidated accounting was important at a time (of the "Robber Barons" in the USA) when conglomerates' external and internal transactions were far from transparent. So too was his work in helping to establish international accounting standards. But he was critical of the dangers of viewing accountancy as a narrow and technical exercise; and his book ''Accounting Practice and Procedure'' (1913) sought to provide a deeper understanding of the nature and scope (but also limitations) of accountancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/46880&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1905StudebakerElectricAd1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1905 [[Studebaker]] advertisement claiming (at the bottom) Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers membership]]
The '''Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers''' ('''ALAM'''), originally the '''Manufacturer's Mutual Association''' ('''MMA'''), was an organization originally formed to challenge the litigation of the fledgling [[automobile industry]] by [[George B. Selden]] and the [[Electric Vehicle Company]].  Ultimately, the organization took advantage of its power and became Selden's greatest ally.  In exchange for favorable royalty rates, the group gained the power to litigate and exclude other manufacturers from licensing, making them the most powerful group in the early automotive industry.

== Early history ==

In 1899, the Electric Vehicle Company purchased the rights to Selden's automobile patent.  The patent was deemed flimsy by most of the industry, but the company purchased the rights to guarantee the legality of their new venture, the [[Columbia Automobile Company]].  A year later, however, the Columbia Automobile Company was in shambles thanks to internal corruption and low demand for electric vehicles, and the Electric Vehicle Company turned to the Selden patent as an alternative source of revenue.  They set out to have manufacturers pay a 5% royalty on all cars produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Columbia Car: Reliable, Simple to Operate and Ready for Action |url=http://www.secondchancegarage.com/classic-car/columbia-3.cfm |work=secondchancegarage.com |accessdate=16 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216054500/http://www.secondchancegarage.com/classic-car/columbia-3.cfm |archivedate=16 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, The Electric Vehicle Company launched several lawsuits against automobile manufacturers.  Their ultimate target among the fray was [[Alexander Winton]], and his [[Winton Motor Carriage Company]].  Originally formed in 1896, the Winton Company was by 1900 the highest-volume automobile producer in the US.  If the patent were to gain validity in the industry, Selden believed, they needed to tackle the largest manufacturer.

The Winton Company's defense made the costly mistake of concentrating on challenging the patent’s validity through [[demurrer]]; by 1902 the case was still tied up and Winton was considering a settlement.  In response to his distress, other independent automobile makers formed a group called the Manufacturers Mutual Association to breathe new life into Winton's legal defense.  Formed by [[Henry Bourne Joy]] and [[Frederic L. Smith]] of [[Packard]] and [[Oldsmobile|Olds]], the two entrepreneurs used their position to threaten the Electric Vehicle Company.  The MMA called for much lower royalty payments and for the legal and license rights to be controlled by the MMA, or else they would bolster Winton's dying legal fund.

== Control of the industry ==
[[Image:AssociationOfLicensedAutomobileManufacturers.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1904 ALAM Advertisement]]
By 1903, the organization had officially become the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, and had secured favorable rights from the Electric Vehicle Company.  Only a few months after the formation of the organization, Winton became an ALAM member, and the suit against his company was dropped.  The patent had gained legitimacy without ever having its validity determined.

The ALAM gained from the agreement, giving them control over the entire automobile industry for a relatively low cost.  The group negotiated a 1.25% royalty on all cars produced, one half of one percent of which went directly into the ALAM legal and operations funds.  Applications for ALAM membership and a Selden license were granted only by the unanimous decision of a 5-member executive board.  This system left ALAM members with royalties considerably lower than the costs of trying the Selden patent in the courts, and gave existing members the ability to exclude and even litigate unlicensed competitors.

The ALAM's exclusionary policies were ultimately its undoing.  The up-and-coming [[Ford Motor Company]] was capitalized in 1903, and [[Henry Ford]] immediately attempted to secure a Selden license.  He was denied, officially due to his past business failures (the [[Detroit Automobile Company]] and the [[Henry Ford Company]], specifically), and also due to the protectionist climate of the ALAM.  Frederic Smith of Olds was the executive board member most outspoken against Ford’s admission to the ALAM, and also had the most to lose from such an admission, as he held most of the [[Detroit]] market for mass-produced automobiles.

On October 22, 1903, the ALAM filed suit with the Ford Motor Company, and what followed was a messy public relations battle.  The ALAM launched a campaign threatening to sue those who purchased Ford automobiles. Ford responded in-kind, summing up their position as, "We believe that the art would have been just as far advanced to-day if Mr. Selden had never been born."

On September 15, 1909, presiding Judge Hough found legitimacy in the Selden patent.  The court of appeals later overturned the ruling, finding in favor of Ford on January 9, 1911. ALAM chose not to contest the ruling.

'''CNNfn''' (fn = '''f'''inancial '''n'''ews) was an American [[cable television]] [[news]] network operated by the [[CNN]] subsidiary of the media conglomerate [[Time Warner]] from November 29, 1995, and of [[AOL-Time Warner]] until December 15, 2004. The network was dedicated to covering [[financial markets]] and business news, similar to [[CNBC]].

It was available in a number of markets, including the U.S. and Australia. In Canada, much of its content was aired on [[Business News Network|ROB TV]] (now BNN).

After years of struggling to attract an audience, Time Warner folded CNNfn in late 2004. On some U.S. cable television systems, its slot was given to [[CNN International]] on a full-time basis; previously, CNN International filled CNNfn's schedule in late nights and weekends. However, many cable companies ended their carriage of the channel and did not take CNN International.

The website CNNfn.com survives today as the [[CNNMoney.com]] website, a joint venture with Time Inc.'s [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] and [[Money (magazine)|''Money'']] magazines.

==Network history==
In 1995, [[Lou Dobbs]] and [[Ted Turner]] were having heated internal discussions about the direction of CNN. Dobbs was able to convince Turner that letting him start a new channel would be a way to solve both issues. Turner would keep Dobbs working for CNN while giving him his own network to run.

In July 1999, Dobbs quit CNNfn and started his own company, [[Space.com]], and eventually returned to CNN to host ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight]]''.

From the start, CNNfn struggled to be picked up by local and national cable operators. In 2004, the official CNNfn network was shut down. However the technologies invented in the early CNNfn days helped launch CNN and the entire broadcasting industry into a new digital era. The CNNfn.com website continued on, and in 2001 merged with ''[[Money (magazine)|Money Magazine]]'' to form CNNMoney.

==Schedule==
The schedule below is taken from the now-defunct site of CNNfn as at 2001 (only from Monday to 12 am on Friday).  All the times '''ET'''.

==Technological advances==
CNNfn inaugurated many innovations on TV and online.  Many of these helped the Internet and broadcasting industry become what they are today.  Just a few of these accomplishments include:
*The first fully digital studio in the world.  From the digital cameras to the production room and beyond, the CNNfn network was the first fully digital professional broadcasting studio. Unlike all other studios at the time, CNNfn could control all cameras with a single joystick. CNNfn claimed the joystick operator was a computer-trained worker, not a [[camera operator]]. To make this happen, CNNfn worked closely with [[Avid Systems]] in creating some of their own first generation broadcasting solutions. Additionally CNNfn and Avid Systems worked with [[Apple Computer]] to create a hacked version of the [[classic Mac OS|Mac operating system]] as no other system at that time could handle the throughput requirements of real-time digital video editing. Due to these advancements, CNNfn had many issues with [[labor unions]]. The unions claimed that the joystick operator should be worth four times as much as a normal camera operator and thus unionized workers should be paid accordingly.
*The first online stock quote engine. CNNfn worked with [[S&amp;P Comstock]] and [[Townsend (company)|Townsend]] to convert what was then a special direct connection to the stock market into a real-time data feed that could be used by the CNNfn.com website. Prior to this, [[ticker symbol]] lookups were typically reserved for private firms and not generally available.
*The first automated on-air [[News_ticker|stock ticker]]. Other broadcasters were showing a moving ticker, however the data from these were edited and typed by hand.  Therefore, the lag time in the data being displayed to a view was unpredictable. CNNfn was the first to automatically tap into the ticker feed and create an engine that would "auto-select" hot stocks and otherwise prioritize the display to show the most relevant stocks.
*The first with advertising campaign management. The online advertising market was just being invented while CNNfn's website was being launched.  Prior to CNNfn, the online advertising market primarily used weighting for [[ad rotation]]s. This would provide a specific advertiser a percentage of views for each page the ad was displayed. CNNfn worked with industry leader [[NetGravity]] to develop the first policy engine that would allow CNNfn.com to target advertisements based on user demographics.
*The first to utilize [[streaming media]] with broadcast video. At the time, [[RealNetworks]], VDONet, and [[VXtreme]] were startups in the streaming media space. No broadcaster saw the Internet as a viable way to reach their audience and they all believed their content to be too valuable to broadcast over the Internet for free. In late 1996, CNNfn.com published 1–2 hours of its programming each day within minutes after the actual show had aired on TV.
*The first to utilize [[Layer 7]] [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] to scale. At the time, [[round-robin DNS]] with weighted nodes to account for servers with more or less power or connectivity was the only way to scale a [[Server farm|web farm]]. CNNfn was working closely with [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] by also helping the write portions of their software which was incorporated into their 2.x product line. Round robin was not fast enough at taking a server out of rotation when Netscape would crash. Thus CNNfn worked with a few vendors to implement a Layer 7 solution that would instantly know when a server was up or down. This dramatically increased the speed and quality of the CNNfn and CNN websites.
*The first to fully automate publishing. By working with [[Lotus Software]], CNNfn was the first to use a database [[Front and back ends|back-end system]] to automate the work flow of a publishing system. At that time, even the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', another startup, used web masters to hand convert articles from the editors into [[HTML]] and to get them approved by hand through e-mail or visual confirmation from a manager. The web master would then post the story onto the website and edit the referring page to add a link to the new document. CNNfn worked with Lotus's [[Lotus Domino|Domino]] product to fully automate the draft, approval, and publishing of its articles.  The website was completely automated in re-writing its static home page with the latest stories.  As an industry first, this method was published in a few major magazines and studies by others.  Within months after its initial deployment, CNN revamped its own website's publishing methods and reduced its webmasters from 15 to 3.

In the summer of 1996 the top two technology members of Lou Dobb's team, Sam Edge and [[Nils Lahr]], threatened to quit CNNfn if changes were not made to allow them more creative control in implementing new technologies. Additionally, they wanted some level of credit and increased internal recognition through proposed promotions. Dobbs tried to keep these key members of the team at CNNfn by offering them higher wages and even went as far as to suggest that he would create an entire company dedicated to high-technology research in connection with [[Gartner]] such that the advancements that were made would become knowledge that could be sold to others. However Dobbs was unable to make this happen quickly inside of CNN as there was resistance from Turner and others. In late 1996, Edge moved to CNN in [[Atlanta Georgia Temple|Atlanta, Georgia]], and Lahr left to join the startup [[VXtreme]] (which was later purchased by [[Microsoft]] and became what is now the [[Windows Media]]). Dobbs made a last-ditch attempt to keep Nils inside CNN by attempting to sue him, claiming there were "important" and "unfinished" duties that required his attention at CNNfn. The lawsuit, however, was thrown out and Lahr was allowed to leave. Shortly after Dobbs quit CNNfn and as promised started his own company Space.com.

Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, CDI measures the sales strength of a particular product category within a specific market (e.g., soft drinks in 10–50 year old's).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the CDI metric is to quantify the relative performance of a category within specified customer groups. The CDI helps marketers identify strong and weak segments (usually demographic or geographic) for categories of goods and services.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

The CDI is useful in all marketing strategies when used with the [[Brand Development Index]] (BDI). The CDI can give vital data for marketers to allocate advertising to specific areas maximizing product category knowledge and profit.

==Construction==

CDI: An index of how well a category performs in a given market segment, relative to its performance in the market as a whole.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

::CDI (I) = 	
::[Category sales to group (#) ÷ Households in group (#)] ÷ 
::[Total category sales (#) ÷ Total households (#)]
::''Note: Although defined here with respect to households, these indexes could also be calculated for customers, accounts, businesses, or other entities.'' &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

A '''certification [[Listing and approval use and compliance|listing]]''' is a document used to guide installations of [[Certification|certified]] products, against which a field installation is [[Installation testing|compared]] to make sure that it complies with a regulation (e.g., a [[building code]]). Typically, products or items are required to be installed or used in accordance with a subject-related certification listing if those products or items are subject to [[product certification]] and must be used in a specific manner in order to be safe for use. Certification listings are issued by organisations that are usually nationally [[accredited]] for doing both [[Product testing|testing]] and product certification work, in accordance with nationally accredited [[Standards organization|standard]]s.

== Description ==
A certification [[Listing and approval use and compliance|listing]] is a document used to guide installations of [[Certification|certified]] products. After a field installation is completed, it is [[Installation testing|compared]] to the list to make sure that it complies with a regulation (e.g., a [[building code]]). Often, products or items are required—by [[law]], [[Voidable|void]] of [[warranty]], or other means—to be installed or used in accordance with a subject-related certification listing if those products or items are subject to [[product certification]] and must be used in a specific manner in order to be safe for use.

== Organizations ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}

Certification listings are issued by organisations that are usually nationally [[accredited]] for doing both [[Product testing|testing]] and product certification work, in accordance with nationally accredited [[Standards organization|standard]]s. [[Underwriter Laboratories]] certifications are commonly seen on products for sale in the United States.

== Example of fire door test ==
The following pictures illustrate an example of a successful [[fire test]] that led to a [[UL (safety organization)|UL]] listing or a three-hour fire protection rating. The entire assembly is exposed to a fire for the specified amount of time per the objective of the test. Following this heat exposure, a hose stream is applied to the door. [[Fire door]]s and [[fire damper]]s are derated from the fire barriers they are in. In this case, a 3-hour rated door is acceptable for use in up to a 4-hour wall. Because it goes into a 4-hour wall, it received a 45[[Pounds per square inch|PSI]] (31[[Newton (unit)|N]]/[[Centimetre|cm]]²) hose stream test.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://database.ul.com/cgi-bin/XYV/template/LISEXT/1FRAME/showpage.html?name=GSNN.SP-2-003&amp;ccnshorttitle=Fire+Door+Assemblies+and+Window+Assemblies&amp;objid=1081660372&amp;cfgid=1073741824&amp;version=versionless&amp;parent_id=1075607282&amp;sequence=1|title=GSNN.SP-2-003 – Fire Door Assemblies and Window Assemblies|website=database.ul.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EasyWay''' was an international [[tea]] outlet that serves hot and cold beverages with assorted flavouring. It started out as a small store in [[Taiwan]] owned by Kuo Wun-Ho and Fu Hsin-Chin back in 1992, its success riding on the popularity of [[bubble tea]] in Taiwan. EasyWay was a company with more than 700 stores worldwide, including outlets in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. 

EasyWay serves tea and other drinks in sealed cups with heat-sealed plastic lids. Consumers can customise their order with such toppings as [[tapioca]] pearls or flavoured jelly. The tea offered includes [[green tea]] and [[black tea]], with an option of adding powdered mixtures such as milk, cocoa and almonds, or flavoured syrups such as green apple, lemon and pineapple. Outlets also serve other items such as shaved ice drinks, relish tea, flavoured milk teas and iced chocolate and coffee.

'''Havana Club''' is a brand of [[rum]] created in Cuba in 1934, and now one of the best-selling rum brands in the world. Originally produced in [[Cárdenas, Cuba|Cardenas]], [[Cuba]] by family-owned Jose Arechabala S.A., the brand was nationalized after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959. Since 1994 it has been produced in Cuba and sold globally (except the United States) by Havana Club International, a 50:50 [[joint venture]] between [[Pernod Ricard]] and the Cuban government. 

[[Bacardi]] also produces a competing product with the same name in Puerto Rico, sold only in the United States. The two companies have engaged in ongoing litigation about ownership of the brand.

== History and production ==
[[File:Roneria Havana Club.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The current distillery in Santa Cruz del Norte]]The Arechabala family founded a distillery in Cardenas, Cuba in 1878.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later renamed Jose Arechabala S.A., the company created the Havana Club brand in 1934, and sold rum under that name in both Cuba and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://delafe.com/cardenas//arechabe.htm|title = Arechabala Industries|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = de la Fé|first = E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040329005992/en/Bacardi-Files-Appeal-Asks-Court-Declare-Company|title = Bacardi Files Appeal and Asks Court to Declare Company Exclusive Owner of Havana Club Brand|date = 30 March 2004|accessdate = 11 January 2015|website = Business Wire|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was nationalized by the Castro government in 1960.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Susan|title=Pernod Ricard Loses Appeals Court Ruling in Bacardi ‘Havana Club Fight|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-29/pernod-ricard-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-bacardi-havana-club-fight.html|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Arechabala family left Cuba for [[Spain]] and the [[United States]].

The Cuban government sold rum abroad under the Havana Club name beginning in 1972, focusing primarily on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.goodwinprocter.com/~/media/Files/Publications/Attorney%20Articles/2006/A_Heady_Mix.pdf|title = A heady mix|last = O'Connell, Jr.|first = Robert M.|date = 2006|journal = World Trademark Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 11 January 2015|pages = 5–10|edition = |issue = November/December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government focused on Havana Club because (unlike the Barcardi family) the Arechabala family had not established plants outside of Cuba and so could not produce a competing brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba: The Biography of a Cause | publisher=Penguin | author=Gjelten | year=2008|isbn = 9780670019786|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was considered a "national jewel" by the Cuban government, and in 1977 manufacturing was moved to a new plant in [[Santa Cruz del Norte]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 1994, Cuban production and non-US global marketing of Havana Club has continued under a joint partnership between [[Pernod Ricard]] and [[Corporación Cuba Ron]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

In 1994, Bacardi began producing rum under the Havana Club name in [[Cataño, Puerto Rico|Cataño]], Puerto Rico using a recipe given to them by Arechabala family members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While originally sold in only a few US states (primarily Florida), production was expanded in 2006, and in 2012, after winning a critical court battle, Bacardi announced plans to sell the rum more broadly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Pernod Ricard/Bacardi trademark conflict ==
The Havana Club trademark has been the subject of extensive trademark litigation in the US, Spain, and World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquín Roy|title=Cuba, the United States, and the Helms-Burton Doctrine|publisher=University Press of Florida|page=55|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jose Arechabala S.A. was nationalized, the Arechabala family left Cuba and stopped producing rum. They therefore allowed the US trademark registration for "Havana Club" to lapse in 1973. Taking advantage of the lapse, the Cuban government registered the mark in the US in 1976.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/incoming/article1941675.html | title=Havana Club rum dispute isn’t over yet | work=Miami Herald | date=20 July 2012 | accessdate=11 January 2015 | author=Whitefield|first = Mimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was then assigned by the Cuban government to Pernod Ricard in 1993.

In 1994, Bacardi obtained the Arechabala family's remaining rights in the brand, and began producing limited amounts of rum bearing the name. 922 cases were sold in the US in 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Business and Economics: Law and Policy|last = Stephan|first = Paul B.|publisher = LexisNexis|year = 2010|isbn = 9780327174677|location = |pages = |last2 = Roin|first2 = Julie A.|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew litigation from Pernod Ricard.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&amp;ct_id=1 | title=Bacardi wins round in Havana Club fight | publisher=Caribbean Business PR | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=8 January 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109025423/http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=55761&amp;ct_id=1 | archivedate=9 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernod Ricard was successful in two of the first three court holdings issued in this litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 2039818|title = Rumble of the Rums: The Battle Over 'Havana Club'|last = Aste|first = Dylan M.|date = 2009|journal = Journal of Contemporary Legal issues|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 19|page = 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1998, after heavy lobbying from Bacardi, the US Congress passed the "Bacardi Act", which protected trademarks related to expropriated Cuban companies, and effectively ended the first phase of the litigation by eliminating Pernod Ricard's [[Standing (law)|standing]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/19/why-congress-hates-your-cuban-rum.html|title = Why Congress Hates Your Cuban Rum|date = 19 December 2014|accessdate = 8 January 2015|website = Daily Beast|publisher = |last = Mak|first = Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act (also known as Section 211) has been applied only to the Havana Club trademark.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; The act was ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization in 2001 and 2002, on grounds that it singled out one country (Cuba).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wto.int/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds176_e.htm|title = DISPUTE SETTLEMENT: DISPUTE DS176 United States — Section 211 Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1998|date = 2 January 2002|accessdate = |website = World Trade Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has not yet acted to address the WTO ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Farhadian.pdf|title = Stealing Bacardi's Thunder|last = Farhadian|first = Sarah L.|date = 8 June 2012|journal = Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 320|volume = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a 2005 deadline and requests from the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2008/03/john-beast-bruton-savages-yanks.html|title = John ("the Beast") Bruton savages the yanks ... diplomatically|date = 28 March 2008|accessdate = |website = IP Kat|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial round of litigation, a second round of litigation occurred, through both the US Federal court system and the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]], focused in part on the allegedly deceptive nature of the use of "Havana" in the name of a rum produced outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This round of litigation lasted from 2009 to 2012, and again resulted in a victory for Bacardi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After this defeat, Pernod Ricard announced plans to market the product in the US under the "Havanista" mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2014/12/pernod-moves-step-closer-to-havanista-us-launch/|title = Pernod moves step closer to Havanista US launch|date = 18 December 2014|accessdate = 11 January 2015|website = The Spirits Business|publisher = |last = Hopkins|first = Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bacardi announced plans to extend distribution of Bacardi's version of Havana Club throughout the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/bacardi-havana-club-rum_n_1592027.html|title = Bacardi To Start Selling Havana Club Rum Across The United States|date = 13 June 2012|accessdate = |website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Harrison|first = Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, Pernod Ricard's ownership of the mark has been upheld in three court rulings, most recently in 2011.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In January 2016, after a thaw in US-Cuba relations, the U.S. government awarded a trademark for Havana Club to the Cuban government, which was "expected to reignite longstanding tension between Bacardi Ltd. and the Cuban government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article54863035.html|title=Cuba prevails in Havana Club rum dispute with Bacardi|last=Whitefield|first=Mimi|date=15 January 2016|work=|access-date=2016-12-06|via=|newspaper=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trippmickle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuban-government-granted-a-u-s-trademark-for-havana-club-rum-1452890441|title=U.S. Grants Cuban Government a Trademark for Havana Club Rum|author=Tripp Mickle|date=15 January 2016|work=WSJ|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacardi appealed the decision, and in 2017, Florida lawmakers asked President Donald Trump to reverse the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/international-business/article57948323.html|title=Bacardi says it’s not over yet in Havana Club trademark battle|last=Whitefield|first=Mimi|date=2 February 2016|work=|newspaper=Miami Herald|access-date=2016-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article141553089.html|title=Florida lawmakers ask Trump administration to revoke Havana Club trademark license|last=Gámez Torres|first=Nora|date=2017-03-29|work=Miami Herald|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernod Ricard's Havana Club is the fifth-largest rum brand in the world, with almost 4 million cases sold in 2012&amp;ndash;2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cubacontemporanea.com/en/havana-club-sales-3-percent|title = Havana Club Sales Up 3 Percent|date = 30 August 2013|accessdate = |website = Cuba Contemporanea|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109041412/http://www.cubacontemporanea.com/en/havana-club-sales-3-percent|archivedate = 9 January 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sold in over 120 countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its strongest markets include France, and Germany, where marketing plays off the brand's distribution in East Germany during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sun, Sex, and Socialism: Cuba in the German Imaginary|last = Hosek|first = Jennifer Ruth|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9781442641389|location = |pages = 27–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, it is also bottled in India, the world's second-largest rum market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-08-19/news/27720124_1_bacardi-white-rum-cuban-government|title = Pernod takes on Bacardi with Havana Club|last = Kurian|first = Boby|date = 19 August 2008|work = The Economic Times|access-date = |last2 = Gupta|first2 = Swagata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernod Ricard plays heavily on Cuban themes in its marketing, including labeling Havana Club as "El Ron de Cuba" ("The Rum of Cuba").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is one of the most common items brought into the US by tourists returning from Cuba.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To avoid charges of customer deception, Bacardi's Havana Club labeling prominently mentions that it is made in Puerto Rico and is often referred to as "Havana Club Puerto Rican rum".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/havana-club-rum-from-puerto-rico-not.html|title = Havana Club rum from Puerto Rico not false advertising|date = 15 April 2010|accessdate = 15 January 2015|website = [[Rebecca Tushnet]]'s 43(B)log: False advertising and more|publisher = |last = Tushnet|first = Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernod Ricard's labeling, originated by Cubaexport in the 1970s, is gold and red, and features the [[Castillo de la Real Fuerza#La Giraldilla|Giraldilla]], a weathervane from the old fort of Havana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pernod Ricard has announced plans to use similar gold and red labels on their "Havanista" product in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, Bacardi announced new branding and plans to sell their version of Havana Club nationally. This will be distilled in Puerto Rico and bottled in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article81034457.html|title=Bacardi evokes Cuba’s ‘golden age’ in taking Havana Club rum national|last=Whitefield|first=Mimi|date=2016-05-31|work=Miami Herald|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellipedia''' is an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States intelligence community|United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelink.gov {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225104427/http://www.intelink.gov/ |date=2012-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established as a pilot project in late 2005 and formally announced in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/intellipedia-marks-second-anniversary.html |title=Intellipedia marks second anniversary |publisher=CIA Press Release |date=March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;INSA, Analytic Transformation, September 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellipedia consists of three [[wiki]]s running on the separate [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System|JWICS]] (Intellipedia-TS), [[SIPRNet]] (Intellipedia-S), and [[DNI-U]]  (Intellipedia-U) [[Computer network|networks]]. The [[Classified information|levels of classification]] allowed for information on the three wikis are [[Top Secret]] [[Sensitive Compartmented Information]] (TS SCI), [[Classified information in the United States#Secret|Secret]] (S), and [[Sensitive But Unclassified]] (SBU or [[For Official Use Only|FOUO]]) information, respectively.  Each of the wikis is used by individuals with appropriate [[Security clearance|clearances]] from the 16 agencies of the [[US intelligence community]] and other national-security related organizations, including [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]] and other federal departments. The wikis are not open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Steve, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/26/AR2009082603606.html For Intelligence Officers, A Wiki Way to Connect Dots]", ''[[Washington Post]]'', August 27, 2009, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellipedia is a project of the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI) [[Intelink|Intelligence Community Enterprise Services]] (ICES) office headquartered in [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]]. It includes information on the regions, people, and issues of interest to the communities using its host networks. Intellipedia uses [[MediaWiki]], the same software used by the [[Wikipedia]] free-content encyclopedia project.&lt;ref name="National Defense Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2006/November/Pages/SecurityBeat2819.aspx?PF=1 |title=Wikipedia for Intel Officers Proves Useful |work=National Defense Magazine |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IvkVRnyJ?url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2006/November/Pages/SecurityBeat2819.aspx?PF=1 |archivedate=2013-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary of mainstream ''Wikipedia'', its intelligence analogue encourages editing that incorporates personal points of view regardless of rank as it was decided that, "much of the self-corrective knowledge in the Intelligence Community resides in personal points of view," and that, "not all good ideas originate at the top."&lt;ref name="D. Calvin Andrus" /&gt;

The Secret version connected to SIPRNet predominantly serves [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] personnel, many of whom do not use the Top Secret JWICS network on a day-to-day basis. Users on unclassified networks can access Intellipedia from remote terminals outside their workspaces via a [[VPN]], in addition to their normal workstations. [[Open Source Intelligence]] (OSINT) users share information on the unclassified Intelink-U wiki.

==History==
Intellipedia was created to share information on some of the most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce.&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2006-11-02-intellipedia_x.htm |title=Over 3,600 intelligence professionals tapping into Intellipedia |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=Associated Press |first=Katherine |last=Shrader |date=2006-02-11 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged weapons programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartbrief.com/alchemy/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=53427FBF-AE22-4442-B244-C4E7C872397A&amp;lmid=archives "Data from spies now assembled wiki-style"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;Bruce Finley, [http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4216851 "Intelligence Fixes Floated at Conference," ''Denver Post'', 08/22/2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellipedia was at least partially inspired by a paper written for the [[Galileo Award]] (an essay competition set up by the CIA, later taken over by the DNI), which encouraged any employee at any intelligence agency to submit new ideas to improve information sharing. The first essay selected was by [[Calvin Andrus]], chief technology officer of the Center for Mission Innovation at the CIA, entitled "The Wiki and the Blog: Toward a Complex Adaptive Intelligence Community". Andrus' essay argued that the real power of the Internet had come from the boom in self-publishing, and noted how the open-door policy of [[Wikipedia]] allowed it to cover new subjects quickly.&lt;ref name="D. Calvin Andrus"&gt;D. Calvin Andrus, Ph.D. Office of Application Services, Central Intelligence Agency. [http://www.acadac.net/wiki/images/a/af/SSRN-id755904.pdf The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community], ''Studies in Intelligence'', Volume 49, Number 3, September 2005. Published on the Web as, {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Wik_and_%20Blog_7.htm |title=The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community|author=D. Calvin Andrus |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Center for the Study of Intelligence |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03intelligence.html |title=Open-Source Spying |author=Clive Thompson |work=The New York Times Magazine|date=2006-12-03|accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard A. Russell, Deputy Assistant [[Director of National Intelligence]] for [[Information Sharing Customer Outreach (ISCO)]] said it was created so "analysts in different agencies that work X or Y can go in and see what other people are doing on subject X or Y and actually add in their two cents worth ... or documents that they have. ... What we're after here is 'decision superiority', not 'information superiority'. ... We have to get inside the decision cycle of the enemy. We have to be able to discover what they're doing and respond to it effectively."&lt;ref name="National Defense Magazine" /&gt;

In September 2007, sixteen months after its creation, officials noted that the top-secret version of Intellipedia alone (hosted on [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System|JWICS]]) has 29,255 articles, with an average of 114 new articles and more than 6,000 edits to articles added each workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Shane|title=Logged In and Sharing Gossip, Er, Intelligence|date=September 2, 2007|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/weekinreview/02shane.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2009, the overall Intellipedia project hosted 900,000 pages edited by 100,000 users, with 5,000 page edits per day.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1890084,00.html |title=Wikipedia for Spies: The CIA Discovers Web 2.0 |work=Time |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first=Massimo |last=Calabresi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2014, Intellipedia contained around 269,000 articles&lt;ref&gt;Kaven Waddel. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/the-governments-secret-wiki-for-intelligence/518508/?google_editors_picks=true The Government’s Secret Wiki for Intelligence: Analysts reportedly tucked classified information about Russian hacking inside Intellipedia for safekeeping,] ''The Atlantic,'' March 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Top Secret Intellipedia counting 113,000 content pages with 255,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=jasonsmathers|url=https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/intellipedia-usage-statistics-10058/|title=FOIA request for Intellipedia usage statistics|publisher=MuckRock|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===10 years later===
A 2017 two-part ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' series on Intellipedia and next steps reported that after 10 years of usage Intellipedia helped the IC get caught up to "Web 2.0" but never reformed how official reports were created like [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s. A more official version of Intellipedia called the Living Intelligence System was created after the fact and focused on collaboratively writing official reports. It failed to catch on because each agency has a different process for writing official, classified reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2017/03/intellipedia-wikipedia-spies-much/ The Wikipedia for Spies and Where It Goes From Here], Wired, March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the lessons learned from Intellipedia and the Living Intelligence System, a pilot program within the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency created the Tearline apps focused on writing official collaborative reports in the less bureaucratic space of unclassified content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2017/04/american-spies-now-smartphone-app/ American Spies Now Have Their Own Smartphone App], Wired, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential problems==
Some are concerned that individual intelligence agencies will create their own wikis, draining ideas and input from Intellipedia.&lt;ref name="Intellipedia Discussion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/11/intellipedia.html#comment-25336444|title=Intellipedia - Marginal REVOLUTION|date=2 November 2006|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Dennehy, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] official involved in integrating the system into the intelligence fabric, said disseminating material to the widest possible audience of analysts is key to avoiding mistakes. He said analysts from multiple agencies had used the network to post frequent updates on recent events, including [[2006 New York City plane crash|the crash of a small plane into a New York City apartment building in October 2006]] and [[2006 North Korean missile test|North Korea's test of a missile in July 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/people/michael_wertheimer/|title=Intellipedia Roundtable Discussion|website=esenai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view it as risky because it allows more information to be viewed and shared;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/|title=U.S. intelligence unveils spy version of Wikipedia|website=esenai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Michael Wertheimer]], [[John Michael McConnell|McConnell's]] assistant deputy director for analysis, it is worth the risk. The project was greeted initially with "a lot of resistance," said Wertheimer, because it runs counter to past practice which sought to limit the pooling of information.&lt;ref name="metimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20061103-075107-4557r|title=US spies create their own 'Wiki' intelligence|website=metimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said there are risks in everything everyone does: "the key is risk management, not risk avoidance." Some encouragement has been necessary to spur contributions from the traditional intelligence community.&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"/&gt; However, he said the system appeals to the new generation of intelligence analysts because "this is how they like to work" and "it's a new way of thinking."&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metimes"/&gt;

==Successes==
[[File:Intellipedia2008.png|thumb|[[2008 Mumbai attacks]] page on Intellipedia]]
[[Thomas Fingar]], [[Director of National Intelligence|Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis]] (DDNI/A), cited the successful use of Intellipedia to develop an article on how Iraqi insurgents were using [[chlorine]] in [[improvised explosive devices]] saying, "They developed it in a couple of days interacting in Intellipedia,"..."No bureaucracy, no mother-may-I, no convening meetings. They did it and it came out pretty good. That's going to continue to grow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensenews.com/story.php?F=2733832&amp;C=america "U.S. Intel Agencies Modernize Info Sharing", ''DefenseNews.com'', May 7, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/speeches/20070905_speech.pdf 2007 Analytic Transformation Symposium], 6 September 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 10, 2007 testimony before the [[United States Congress]], [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], cited the increasing use of Intellipedia among analysts and its ability to help experts pool their knowledge, form virtual teams, and make quick assessments.&lt;ref name="10 September 2007 hearing"&gt;[http://dni.gov/testimonies/20070910_testimony.pdf Michael McConnell. "Confronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland: Six Years after 9/11]", ''Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee'', September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations]]'', a 2008 book by several experts in the field of intelligence analysis, cited Intellipedia as evidence of the changing nature of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Roger George, James Bruce, et al., ''Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations'', Georgtown University Press, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Haseltine]], former ODNI Associate Director for Science and Technology said that "It's hard to overstate what [Burke and Dennehy] did . ... They made a major transformation almost overnight with no money after other programs failed to achieve these results with millions of dollars in funding."  Haseltine said intelligence analysts had "reacted 'more quickly and more intelligently' to potential terrorist threats than they would have without Intellipedia".&lt;ref name=medals/&gt;

==Community practices==
[[File:Intellipedia shovel.jpg|thumb|An Intellipedia shovel, awarded to exemplary wiki contributors.]]
The wiki provides so much flexibility that several offices throughout the community are using it to maintain and transfer knowledge on daily operations and events.&lt;ref name="Spotlight/Wilson"&gt;Executive Biz, [http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=jwilson Executive Spotlight with Jesse Wilson], October 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone with access to read it has permission to create and edit articles after registering and acquiring an account with [[Intelink]]. Since Intellipedia is intended to be a platform for harmonizing the various points of view of the agencies and analysts of the Intelligence Community, Intellipedia does not enforce a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]] policy.&lt;ref name="NTY Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03intelligence.html?ex=1322802000&amp;en=46027e63d79046ce&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title=Open-Source Spying|work=New York Times Magazine|date=December 2006|accessdate=2006-12-03 |first=Clive |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, viewpoints are attributed to the agencies, offices, and individuals participating, with the hope that a consensus view will emerge. Intellipedia also contains a great deal of non-encyclopedic content including meeting notes and items of internal, administrative interest. Deputy DNI [[Thomas Fingar]] made a comparison to [[eBay]], the auction Web site where the reliability of sellers is rated by buyers. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intellipedia. It's been written up. It's the Wikipedia on a classified network, with one very important difference: it's not anonymous. We want people to establish a reputation. If you're really good, we want people to know you're good. If you're making contributions, we want that known. If you're an idiot, we want that known too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/15754/intelligence_reform_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.html|title=Intelligence Reform [Rush Transcript; Federal News Service]|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mazzetti |last=Mark |title=Intelligence Chief Announces Renewed Plan for Overhaul |date=April 12, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/washington/12intel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 2006–2007, Intellipedia editors awarded symbolic ''shovels'' to users to distinguish exemplary Wiki ''gardening'' and to encourage others in the community to contribute. A template with a picture of the limited-edition shovel (actually a trowel), was created to place on user pages for Intellipedians to show their ''gardening'' status. The handle bears the imprint: "I dig Intellipedia! It's wiki wiki, Baby." The idea was inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|barnstar]],&lt;ref name="eekim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eekim.com/blog/2006/09/27/intellipediashovel |title=EEK Speaks |work=Eugene Eric Kim's Blog |accessdate=2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used on both [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|Wikipedia]] and [[MeatballWiki]] for similar purposes. The shovels have since been replaced with a mug bearing the tag line, "Intellipedia: it's what we know".

Different agencies have experimented with other ways of encouraging participation. For example, at the CIA, managers have held contests for best pages with prizes such as free dinners.&lt;ref name="web2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9096658&amp;pageNumber=1 |title=CIA, Pfizer, Wachovia and Sony execs suggest options for adopting Web 2.0 |author=Heather Havenstein |publisher=Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Rasmussen, knowledge management officer at the Defense Department's [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), argues that "gimmicks" like the Intellipedia shovel, posters, and handbills, encourage people to use [[Web 2.0]] tools like Intellipedia and are effective low-tech solutions to promote their use. Also, Rasmussen argues that "[[social software]]–based contributions should be written in an employee's performance plan".&lt;ref name="FCW"&gt;"[http://www.fcw.com/print/13_16/news/102750-1.html Government taps the power of us: Officials turn to blogs and wikis to share information and achieve goals]", ''Federal Computer Week'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Several agencies in the Intelligence community, most notably the CIA and NGA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/web20-adoption-in-large-enterprises/|title=Web2.0 Adoption in Large Enterprises|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed training programs to provide time to integrate social software tools into analysts' daily work habits. These classes generally focus on the use of Intellipedia to capture and manage knowledge, but they also incorporate the use of the other social software tools. These include [[blog]]s, [[RSS]], and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;[http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?sid=1286296&amp;nid=250 Radio interview] that highlights Intelligence Community social software training programs, Federal News Radio, November 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sean d"&gt;[http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=sdennehy Executive Spotlight Interview with Sean Dennehy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042130/http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=sdennehy |date=2008-12-06 }}, ExecutiveBiz, December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chris R"&gt;[http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=crasmussen Executive Spotlight Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204094209/http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=crasmussen |date=2008-12-04 }} with Chris Rasmussen, ExecutiveBiz, October 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2009, Don Burke and Sean P. Dennehy, two of the originators of Intellipedia, were awarded with the "Homeland Security Service to America Medal" by the [[Partnership for Public Service]]. The award noted that they "Promoted information sharing across the intelligence community through the development and implementation of Intellipedia, a Wikipedia-like clearinghouse of intelligence expertise."&lt;ref name=medals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicetoamericamedals.org/honorees/view_profile.php?profile=215|title=2009 'Service to America Medal Recipients' |accessdate=2010-01-05 |publisher=[[Service to America Medals]] |date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived in China in 1881 and became a partner at the company in 1887. He became a director of company for from 1887 to 1902 and also numerous public companies, including the chairman of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Daily Press"/&gt;

He was appointed as [[Unofficial Member|unofficial member]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1892, 1893, 1896 and 1901 and became the first of the two unofficial members in the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong]] in 1896 and again in 1901, until he retired from public and business services and returned to England in 1902. 

After going back to England, he lived at [[Minto, Scottish Borders|Minto House]], [[Hawick]] and Rokeby, [[Barnard Castle]], and bought the Makerstoun property on the [[River Tweed]] near Kelso afterward.

The '''James H. Doolittle Award''' is an honor presented annually by the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]]. It is an award for "outstanding accomplishment in technical management or engineering achievement in aerospace technology". The award consists of a perpetual trophy on permanent display at SETP headquarters, and a smaller replica presented to the recipient. It is named after [[Jimmy Doolittle|General James Doolittle]], famous for the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo during World War II.&lt;ref name=Criteria&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setp.org/criteria/james-h-doolittle-award.html |title=James H. Doolittle Award Criteria |publisher=Setp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doolittle Trophy is a [[bronze]] form melding an aerodynamic shape, a stylized spacecraft, and a winged human figure. The aerodynamic shape stands for the scientists and engineers who provide technological breakthroughs. The spacecraft represents continued growth of the  aerospace industry. The human figure represents the pilot who guides the test effort to reach its goals. A [[helmet]] and [[goggles]] rest on the base of the trophy symbolizing the tools of the early test pilot and Jimmy Doolittle himself. Plaques bearing the name of each honoree are mounted around the sides of the [[teak]] base.&lt;ref name=SETP_56th&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=SETP 56th Awards Banquet Program |publisher=Society of Experimental Test Pilots |location=Lancaster, California |date=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
The Society lists three criteria for nominations to this award:&lt;ref name=Criteria/&gt;
#The recipient must be a living member of the Society
#A significant phase of the accomplishment must have occurred while a member of the Society
#The accomplishment must clearly be in the technical management or engineering aspects of aerospace technology

==Early life==
Rahman was born in [[Bangladesh]], came to the United Kingdom when she was eight months old and was brought up in [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], London where she attended [[Queen Elizabeth's School for Girls]]. In 1998, at the age of 18, she moved to [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=MacLeod|first=Murdo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audioslideshow/2014/jul/25/scotland-stories-scottish-independence-audio-slideshow|title=Scotland stories: Jelina Berlow-Rahman, human rights lawyer|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=25 July 2014|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pursue a degree in [[Bachelor of Laws|law]]&lt;ref name="bbcasiannetwork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rg093|title=The British Bangladeshi Power and Inspiration List 2014|publisher=[[BBC Asian Network]]|date=2 February 2014|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Strathclyde]].

Rahman's paternal uncle fought in [[World War II]] as a seaman. Rahman's father came to the UK at the age of 15 and started his own restaurant, and now has a restaurant in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt;

In 1997, at the age of 17, Rahman was diagnosed with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (lupus), a chronic autoimmune illness which left her with scarred facial skin and inflamed kidneys. In 2005, at the age of 26, her kidneys failed and she was on [[dialysis]] at [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] three days a week for four years. Rahman was on [[chemotherapy]] for two years. In December 2009, at the age of 29, she received a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcasiannetwork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journalonline2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1006796.aspx|title=Glasgow solicitor named business hero|work= |location= |publisher=''The Journal''|date=3 July 2009|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"&gt;{{cite news |last=Silvester|first=Norman|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/exclusive-legal-eagle-runs-law-1039597|title=Exclusive: Legal eagle runs law firm from hospital bed|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rahman required continuing hospital treatment since she qualified as a solicitor in December 2008.&lt;ref name="journalonline2"/&gt; In 2009, she opened her own law firm J R Rahman Solicitors.&lt;ref name="bbcasiannetwork"/&gt; She runs the firm single-handed, combining the roles of lawyer, receptionist, secretary and accountant while continuing with her dialysis treatment.&lt;ref name="journalonline2"/&gt;

In 2009, J R Rahman Solicitors was listed in the Top 100 Business at the [[Barclays]] Trading Places Awards, a Government-backed national awards which honours for people who turn their lives around by choosing to start up a business.&lt;ref name="journalonline2"/&gt; In the same year, it was awarded Up and Coming Law Firm of the Year at The Law Awards of Scotland.&lt;ref name="thelawawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawawards.com/pages/winners2009|title=2009 Winners|publisher=The Law Awards of Scotland|date=2009|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, legal watchdogs gave permission for Rahman to work on cases and see clients while undergoing treatment.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2005, Rahman, whilst working as a working in the Asylum Department at Livingstone Brown, Glasgow, she won the Empower Scotland Social Equality and Justice Award.&lt;ref name="journalonline1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/Magazine/50-12/1002533.aspx|title=Young solicitor's Empower award|work= |location= |publisher=''The Journal''|date=12 December 2005|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, she was named as one of the 30 Under 30 promising lawyers in Scotland.&lt;ref name="firmmagazine"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.firmmagazine.com/jelina-rahman-scoops-business-award/|title=Jelina Rahman scoops business award|work= |location= |publisher=''The Firm''|date= |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she was awarded Best Professional in Business at the Scottish Asian Business Awards.&lt;ref name="theasianworld"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.theasianworld.co.uk/index.php/nominees-for-8th-annual-scottish-asian-business-awards-are-revealed/|title=Nominees for 8th annual Scottish Asian Business Awards are revealed|work= |location= |publisher=''Asian World''|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnicnow"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.ethnicnow.com/channels/business/press-release/20/7798/nominees-for-8th-annual-scottish-asian-business-awards-are-revealed.html|title=Nominees for 8th annual Scottish Asian Business Awards are revealed|work= |location= |publisher=''Ethnic Now''|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asianimage"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/news/business/10870763.print/|title=Scottish Asian Business Awards winners|work= |location= |publisher=''Asian Image''|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asiansuk"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.asiansuk.com/scottish-asian-business-awards-finalists/|title=Scottish Asian Business Awards Presented by the Bank of Scotland Winners 2013|work= |location= |publisher=''AsiansUK''|date=December 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theasianbusinessawards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theasianbusinessawards.info/scotland/2013.html|title=2013 Winners|publisher=The Scottish Asian Business Awards|date=December 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldscotland"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright|first=Scott|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/people/high-flyers-honoured-at-eighth-scottish-asian-business-awards-ceremony.22933814|title=High flyers honoured at eighth Scottish Asian Business Awards ceremony|work= |location=Glasgow|publisher=''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]''|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, she was named among the ''[[British Bangladeshi Power &amp; Inspiration 100]]''&lt;ref name="sundaymail"&gt;{{cite news |last=Silvester|first=Norman|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dialysis+lawyer%27s+power+award.-a0358093256|title=Dialysis Lawyer's Power Award|work= |location=Glasgow|publisher=''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]''|date=9 February 2014|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for demonstrating success and inspiration.&lt;ref name="bdnews24"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/01/30/uk-bangladeshis-who-inspire|title=UK Bangladeshis who inspire|work= |location=Bangladesh|publisher=''[[Bdnews24.com]]''|date=30 January 2014|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theasians2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.theasians.co.uk/story/20140123_bbp_honor_2014|title=British Bangladeshi to Honor 2014 Contributions|work= |location= |publisher=''The Asians''|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britbangla24"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.britbangla24.com/beta/british-bangladeshi-power-inspiration-launch-of-the-2014-list-and-the-peoples-choice/|title=British Bangladeshi Power &amp; Inspiration – Launch of The 2014 List and The List "People's Choice"|work= |location= |publisher=''BritBangla24''|date=4 November 2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastlondonadvertiser"&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnett|first=Adam|url=http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/top_100_british_bangladeshis_list_to_be_revealed_by_cllr_abdal_ullah_1_3237927|title=Top 100 British Bangladeshis list to be revealed by Cllr Abdal Ullah|work= |location=London|publisher=''[[East London Advertiser]]''|date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theasians3"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.theasians.co.uk/story/20140123_bbp_honor_2014|title=Chosen to Inspire, British Bangladeshi List Revealed|work= |location= |publisher=''The Asians''|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Chambers''' (c. 1839 – 27 September 1903) was a British citizen who became a New Zealand businessman and [[ironsand]]s entrepreneur.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Bishop's Stortford]], [[Hertfordshire]], England in about 1839&lt;ref name="DNZB Chambers"&gt;{{DNZB|title=John Chambers|first= Peter|last= Lowe|id=2c14|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived in New Zealand in 1866.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Zealand Ironsands: an Historical Account of an Attempt to Smelt Ironsands at Onehunga in 1883, Art. XXIV |url=http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_50/rsnz_50_00_002640.pdf|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand|author=Evan Parry|year=1918|volume=50|issue=Art. XXIV|pages=223–230|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steel production in Onehunga==
Chambers arrived in New Zealand in 1866 and realised that the ironsands on the beaches of [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] had [[Iron#Industrial production|iron production]] potential.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt; 
The area takes its name from [[Mount Taranaki]], a volcano that rises above the beaches. Chambers twice tried to further international interest in the resources of the sands, but was thwarted at first by the lack of interest and [[smelting]] difficulties.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt; He tried in 1876, when he approached smelters in the UK and US, but a general lack of interest produced only a few laboratory test smelts. In 1886 John Parry managed to persuade [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] to experiment with the sands; the results were promising, though Bessemer was in his twilight years and unable to continue with development.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt;

Chambers attended the [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia Exhibition]] of 1876, which proved unsuccessful; America had plentiful iron-ore resources that were cheap to smelt and so no interest was shown. Before leaving the US, Chambers heard about a smelting process invented by Joel Wilson of [[Dover, New Jersey]], which proved promising. Chambers formed a company with Guy H. Gardner and bought the New Zealand rights to the patent.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt; Wilson sent one of his men, W. H. Jones, to New Zealand to demonstrate the process and help manage the smelting once the furnace was built. This resulted in a furnace being built in the [[Onehunga]] suburb of [[Auckland]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name=TeAra&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron and steel – Attempts to extract iron|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/iron-and-steel/2|work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=20 July 2012|author=Fleur Templeton|page=2|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work was completed in February 1883 at a cost of £500, with its first steel produced on 27 February of that year using sand from North Head of Manukau Heads under a sixty-year contract from the New Zealand government.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt;

However, the company ceased trading after a series of events led to a gradual reduction in quality of the steel produced. Jones got drunk in Onehunga and argued with one of their bricklayers in December 1883. Jones shot and killed the man and was sentenced to 14 years hard labour.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt; The company tried to carry on but Edmund Otway, Jones' successor, was taken ill and died in June 1884. His successor was an iron-master from the [[River Clyde#Industrial growth|Clyde]] region of [[Scotland]], James McAndrew,&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt; who tried his best to carry on against mounting problems with the [[Smelting|de-oxidation]] part of the process. Production from the ironsands was eventually discontinued, as no-one was able to produce the same quality of iron as Jones had managed,&lt;ref name=TeAra/&gt; and the company resorted to producing [[wrought iron]] from scrap metal. This was a much reduced profit margin and eventually the shareholders were left with debts of £20,000 and the works were broken up and shipped to China.&lt;ref name=RSNZIaO1918/&gt;

==Later life==
Chambers continued in various other iron-related companies and other businesses around the Auckland region, including gold-mining, eventually taking a position as manager of T. and S. Morrin &amp; Son. Chambers started a company with his son in 1892, John Chambers and Son, importing mining equipment and other products; the company became a [[limited company]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="DNZB Chambers"/&gt;

Chambers died in 1903 in the [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]] suburb of Auckland.&lt;ref name="DNZB Chambers"/&gt;

'''Karel Janeček''' (born 26 July 1973 at [[Plzeň]], [[Czechoslovakia]]) is a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[mathematician]], [[entrepreneur]], anti-[[Corruption#Government.2FPublic Sector|corruption]] campaigner and author of voting system [[Democracy 2.1]] and online game President 21.

==Education==
Janeček graduated from the Faculty of [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] of [[Charles University in Prague]] in the field of [[Probability]] and [[Mathematical Statistics]].&lt;ref name=biz&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=115284062&amp;privcapId=23712517 Executive Profile], ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He is  an [[MBA]] in [[Finance]] graduate of [[Bradley University]], [[Peoria, Illinois]], USA, and a [[Ph.D.]] graduate in the field of [[Mathematical Finance]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

==Academia==
During the period 2007-2013, Janeček lectured at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague. He specializes in [[optimal control]] in [[mathematical finance]].&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

Janeček has authored and co-authored several research articles in scientific journals in the area of applied [[stochastic calculus]], where his work has numerous citations,&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; such as "Optimal investment with high-watermark performance fee," ''SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization'', 2012; "Futures trading with transaction costs," ''Illinois Journal of Mathematics'', 2010; "Asymptotic analysis for optimal investment and consumption with transaction costs," ''Finance and Stochastics'', 2004; and others.

==Business==
From 1998 to 2000, Janeček worked as a mathematical analyst for the [[hedge fund]] Market Research Ltd, and from 2004 to 2005, served as Researcher in the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; On the basis of his experience, he started the firm RSJ Algorithmic Trading.&lt;ref name=praha&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/one-on-one/businessman-and-anti-corruption-pioneer-karel-janecek-whistle-blowing-is-a-brave-thing-to-do "Businessman and anti-corruption pioneer Karel Janeček: Whistle-blowing is a brave thing to do"], [[Radio Prague]], 28 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-corruption campaign==
{{More|Corruption in the Czech Republic}}
According to media reports, by 2013, the Czech government was "buffeted" by a series of corruption scandals that have threatened to bring it down.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/world/europe/foes-want-czech-leader-prosecuted-over-amnesty.html?_r=0 "Foes Want Czech Leader Prosecuted Over Amnesty"], by [[Dan Bilefsky]],  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Václav Klaus]], then president of the republic, in his last days in office, granted [[amnesty]] to a number of people accused of [[corruption]], Janeček financed the publishing of online videos and newspaper advertisements urging Czechs to sign a [[petition]] calling Klaus to account.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The signatures were published on a website called "High Treason" in [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The movement convinced 28 Senators to back a proposal in the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]] for the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] to undertake [[high treason]] proceedings against Klaus.&lt;ref name=monde&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/03/01/milliardaire-et-croise-anticorruption_1841515_3210.html "Karel Janecek, milliardaire et croisé anticorruption"], by Martin Plichta, ''[[Le Monde]]'', 1 March 2013 (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus, who was eventually not charged by the Supreme Court, had previously stated he did not regret the amnesty, and on an official visit to [[Slovakia]]  dismissed the move as "political games."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Political reform==
In 2012, he proposed a new electoral system primarily based on a minus vote, i.e. the possibility to vote against a candidate. The idea was promoted as a part of the Positive Evolution project. In May 2013, Janecek created the electoral system [[Democracy 2.1]] or D21&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.d21.me/en/ Democracy 21] website&lt;/ref&gt; which, he argues, will bring about a major improvement comparable to "an upgrade from DOS to Windows". The main effect of D21 lies in the use of multiple votes - each voter has twice as many votes than the number of seats available to winners. More concretely, for the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, he designed two-mandate districts in which voters could use four votes, with the possibility to use one minus vote.&lt;ref name=pw&gt;[http://praguewandering.com/2013/12/06/lessons-from-the-blackjack-table/ "Billionaire Mystifies Public as He Tries to Fight Corruption with Math"], ''Prague Wandering'', 6 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship==
The Karel Janeček Benevolent Fund for Support of Science and Research was established in 2010 (renamed as Neuron Fund for Support of Science in 2013) a non-profit organisation, which promotes the idea of benefactors supporting the science and research in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=neu&gt;[http://www.nfneuron.cz/en/about-us/ Neuron Fund for Support of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Neuron has supported a number of scientists and their projects through grants worth over 13 million [[Czech koruna|Czech crowns]].&lt;ref name=neu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [[United States dollar|$]] 600,000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gambling==
[[File:SBA_diskette.jpg|thumb|right|150px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;SBA [[floppy disk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

Janeček, in the 1990s, and after playing the game in various [[casino]]s in the United States and elsewhere, created a [[simulation software]] for [[Advantage gambling|advantage play]] in [[Blackjack]], which he marketed under the brand "Statistical Blackjack Analyzer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba21.com/Details.html SBA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The sim program has been praised by many gambling researchers.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Don Schlesinger]]: "[Janeček]'sStatistical Blackjack Analyzer software was the original, all-purpose simulator, and it has come to be known as the standard against which all other such products are measured." [http://www.sba21.com/Reviews.html Reviews], SBA website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba21.com/Reviews.html SBA sample reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; He has acted as a consultant for the casino games industry, including the creators of [[Blackjack Switch]], which, before it became operational, was tested by Janeček-created software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professional-poker.com/interviews/geoff-hall/blackjack-switch.htm "Blackjack Switch - interview with Geoff Hall"], ''Professional Poker''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/switch/ Blackjack Switch] at the [[Michael Shackleford|Wizard of Odds]] website for the game's analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

Janeček, along with Brett Harris, [[R. Michael Canjar|Mike Canjar]], Winston Yamashita, Pete Moss, [[Steven L. Heston|Kim Lee]], and other gambling theorists, contributed to the development of what has become known as "[[Gambling and information theory|optimal betting theory]]", and the discovery that it is possible to calculate a [[Card counting#Running counts versus True counts in Balanced counting systems|true count for unbalanced counting systems]] in casino Blackjack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjinsider.com/newsletter_112_unbalanced.shtml "The truth about unbalanced counts"] by Dr Brett Harris, ''Blackjack Insider''&lt;/ref&gt;  He has regularly contributed articles in gambling-research websites, such as [[Stanford Wong]]'s BJ21.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bj21.com/bj_reference/pages/certaintyequivalentanalysis.shtml "Certainty Equivalent Analysis"] by Karel Janeček, bj21.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Janeček recommends treating the handling of advantage play "as just another [[Investment#In finance|investment]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bj21.com/bj_reference/pages/fluctuations.shtml "Fluctuations - A Personal Perspective"] by [[MathProf]], bj21.com,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2015, Janeček married for the second time. His wife was [[Demographics of Tunisia|Tunisian]] Mariem Mhadhbi, a [[structural engineering|structural engineer]] who studied at [[Mines ParisTech|L'École des Mines]], on [[AngelList]] and they have one child. Janeček has two daughters from his first marriage. Since October 2017, he is in a relationship with Lilia Khousnoutdinova, and they have a daughter.&lt;ref name=lili&gt;{{cite news |last=Herrmannová|first=Nela|date=4 June 2018 |title=Karel Janeček má se svou neoficiální ženou dceru, porod byl výjimečný|language=Czech|trans-title=Karel Janeček has a daughter with his unofficial wife, the birth was exceptional |url=https://revue.idnes.cz/karel-janecek-lilia-khousnoutdinova-porod-dite-dcera-isabella-p6g-/lidicky.aspx?c=A180604_101834_lidicky_nh |dead-url=no |work=Revue iDnes |location=Prague |access-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Lindner family's rise to prominence began with Carl Lindner Sr. opening a dairy processing plant in [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]], Ohio in 1940. The business, [[United Dairy Farmers]], had expanded to thirty stores by 1960, and the family bought the [[American Financial Group]] with their savings. By the mid-1960s, Carl Sr.'s sons were running the family's businesses: [[Carl Lindner Jr.|Carl Jr.]] was running American Financial Group and Richard was running United Dairy Farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/citywiseblog/lindner-milk-money-fortune-500/|title=The Lindner Family: From Milk Money to The Fortune 500|last=Murtha|first=Lisa|date=October 30, 2014|work=[[Cincinnati (magazine)|Cincinnati]]|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the Lindner family founded and funded the [[Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy]].

In 1999, Carl Jr. bought controlling ownership in the [[Cincinnati Reds]], which he held until selling to [[Robert Castellini]] in 2005.

==Content==

The MFT-MBA is based on MBA core curriculum.  Unlike tests that are not aligned to anything but their own curriculum, the MFT-MBA emphasizes content validity.   In order to display [[normative|normativity]] and ensure a consensus of what best reflects core curriculum, the content is constructed using results of a national curriculum survey.  According to ETS, content experts from a diverse representation of higher education institutions (including Major Field Test users and nonusers) participate in this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/ |title=Test Content Overview |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basing the exam on core curriculum makes it a level playing field exam, giving it meaningful results and enabling it to measure reasoning ability.&lt;ref name="Honors Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t10mba.com/admission |title=Membership Admission Requirements |publisher=T10 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;

The test contains 124 [[multiple-choice]] questions. There are approximately 32 [[management]] questions, 31 [[marketing]] questions, 33 [[finance]] questions, and 28 [[management accounting|managerial accounting]] questions.  Half of the questions require the strategic integration of two or more subject areas.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;  In addition to factual knowledge, the test evaluates the student's abilities to interpret materials, understand relationships, and analyze and solve problems.&lt;ref name="Hays Post" /&gt; 

The Major Field Test for MBA can only be taken once.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt; The amount of time allotted for taking the test is three hours.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; It is taken on a computer.  All exams are given at proctored facilities. Test takers are provided with scratch paper and pencils, but calculators are not permitted. All test questions present four answer options to choose from, only one of which is correct.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt;

A national scoring guide is issued annually. Scores range from 220-300.  According to ETS, the overall scaled score on the MFT-MBA measures [[critical thinking]] and [[reason]]ing within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; The chart on the right provides a scoring summary at approximately every 10th percentile.

Form 4BMF was last used in 2009 making the 2009 scoring guide 4BMF's last scoring guide.&lt;ref name="2009 4BMF Scoring Guide" /&gt; Form 4FMF was last used in 2013 making the 2013 scoring guide 4FMF's last scoring guide.&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide" /&gt;  The 2015 scoring guide is the most up to date guide for 4JMF (the current test form).&lt;ref name="2015 4JMF Data Guide" /&gt;

==Personal==
Hunt was born in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]], but lived most of his life in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="JBS"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nelson Bunker Hunt
| publisher = The John Birch Society, Inc.| url = http://www.jbs.org/about-jbs/nelson-bunker-hunt| accessdate = October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Lyda Bunker and [[Petroleum|oil]] [[Business magnate|tycoon]] [[H.

==Business career==
Hunt played a very significant role in the discovery and development of the oil fields in [[Libya]], which were nationalized by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Libya"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Greenwood| first = C. J.| title = International Law Reports| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 1984| volume = 66| page = 340| isbn = 0-521-46411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nationalization later resulted in the House of Lords decision in [[BP Exploration Co (Libya) v Hunt (No 2)]] [1983] 2 AC 352.

Hunt owned the [[Dallas]]-based Titan Resources Corporation, which is still involved in the exploration of oil in North Africa.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg_2008&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&amp;sid=aRCsmu51x92A&amp;refer=africa |title=Ethiopia, U.S. Billionaire's Titan Resources Signs Oil Accord'|author=McLure, Jason |work=Bloomberg |date=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chairman of Hunt Exploration and Mining Company (HEMCO).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Silver manipulation==
{{main|Silver Thursday}}
Beginning in the early 1970s, Hunt and his brothers William Herbert and Lamar began accumulating large amounts of silver. By 1979, they had nearly cornered the global market.&lt;ref name="TEXAS"&gt;{{cite magazine| last = Gwynne| first = S. C.| title = Bunker Hunt|magazine= Texas Monthly| volume = 29
| issue = 9|page=78| publisher = Emmis Communications Corporation| location = Austin, Texas, United States| date = September 2001
| url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion in silver [[speculation]], with estimated silver holdings of {{convert|100|e6ozt|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Time1"&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Bunker Hunt's Comstock Lode
|magazine=Time Magazine| volume = 115| issue = 2| publisher = Time Inc.| date = January 14, 1980|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921789,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily because of the Hunt brothers' accumulation of the precious metal, prices of silver [[futures contract]]s and silver bullion rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later.&lt;ref name="loe"&gt;{{cite report | url=http://loe.org/images/content/080919/Act1.pdf | title=The Accidental Hunt Brothers: How Institutional Investors Are Driving Up Food And Energy Prices | publisher=LOE | date=31 July 2008 | accessdate=26 February 2016 | pages=51 | author1=Masters, Michael W. | author2=White,  Adam K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest single day drop in the price of silver occurred on "[[Silver Thursday]]."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; In February 1985 the Hunt brothers were charged "with manipulating and attempting to manipulate the prices of silver futures contracts and silver bullion during 1979 and 1980" by the [[United States]] [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In September 1988 the Hunt brothers filed for bankruptcy under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code]] largely due to lawsuits incurred as a result of their silver speculation.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In 1989, in a settlement with the CFTC, Nelson Bunker Hunt was fined US$10 million and banned from trading in the commodity markets as a result of civil charges of conspiring to manipulate the silver market.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; This fine was in addition to a multimillion-dollar settlement to pay back taxes, fines and interest to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] for the same period. His brother{{which?|date=November 2018}} made a similar settlement.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

==Politics==
Nelson Bunker Hunt was extremely active in conservative political causes&lt;ref name="Kingdom"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tuccille| first = Jerome | title = Kingdom: The Story of the Hunt Family of Texas| publisher = Beard Books| year = 2004| page = 311
| isbn = 1-58798-226-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the Council of the [[John Birch Society]].&lt;ref name="JBS" /&gt;

Hunt also mentored [[Zahid Bashir]], former spokesman and press secretary to the Pakistani Prime Minister, in oil trading.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
In 1955, Hunt bought his first thoroughbreds and by the 1970s his breeding program had become one of the world's largest and most productive. Winner of the U.S. [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder]] in 1976, 1985, and 1987, he owned the {{convert|8000|acre|ha|adj=on}} Bluegrass Farm in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and raced thoroughbreds in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Among his horses, Hunt bred or raced  [[Vaguely Noble]], [[Dahlia (horse)|Dahlia]], [[Empery]], [[Youth (horse)|Youth]], [[Exceller]], [[Trillion (horse)|Trillion]], [[Glorious Song]], [[Dahar (horse)|Dahar]] and [[Estrapade (horse)|Estrapade]].&lt;ref name="HORSE1" /&gt;

In 1973 and 1974, Hunt was the [[British flat racing Champion Owner]] and in 1976 won [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref name="HORSE1" /&gt;

The United States [[National Thoroughbred Racing Association]] (NTRA) awarded Hunt the title of "legendary owner-breeder".&lt;ref name="HORSE2"&gt;{{cite web

Hunt's bankruptcy forced him to liquidate his thoroughbred operations. A 1988 dispersal sale of 580 horses at [[Keeneland Sales]] brought in $46,911,800, at that time the highest amount in the history of thoroughbred auctions.&lt;ref name="HORSE1" /&gt; In 1999, he returned to thoroughbred ownership, spending a total of $2,075,000 on 51 juveniles and yearlings. At the time he said, "At my age, I don't plan to do any breeding or buy a farm, I just want to have some fun and try to get lucky racing."&lt;ref name="HORSE2" /&gt;

This article is about the important technologies that have historically increased [[productivity]] and is intended to serve as the History section of [[Productivity]] from which it was moved.

Productivity in general is a ratio of output to input in the production of goods and services.  Productivity is increased by lowering the amount of labor, capital, energy or materials that go into producing any given amount of economic goods and services. Increases in productivity are largely responsible for the increase in per capita living standards.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The [[spinning jenny]] and [[spinning mule]] (shown) greatly increased the productivity of thread manufacturing compared to the [[spinning wheel]].]]

==History==
{{See also|History of technology}}
Productivity improving technologies date back to antiquity, with rather slow progress until the late Middle Ages.  Important examples of early to medieval European technology include the [[water wheel]], the [[horse collar]], the spinning wheel, the three-field system (after 1500 the four-field system—see [[Crop rotation]]) and the [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological progress was aided by literacy and the diffusion of knowledge that accelerated after the [[spinning wheel]] spread to Western Europe in the 13th century.  The spinning wheel increased the supply of rags used for pulp in [[paper]] making, whose technology reached Sicily sometime in the 12th century.  Cheap paper was a factor in the development of the [[movable type]] [[printing press]], which led to a large increase in the number of books and titles published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Francis Bacon]] (1561-1626) is known for the [[scientific method]], which was a key factor in the [[scientific revolution]].  Bacon stated that the technologies that distinguished Europe of his day from the Middle Ages were paper and printing, gunpowder and the magnetic compass, known as the [[four great inventions]].  The [[four great inventions]] important to the development of Europe were of Chinese origin.&lt;ref name="Simon and Schuster"&gt;{{cite book

Mining and metal refining technologies played a key role in technological progress.  Much of our understanding of fundamental chemistry evolved from ore smelting and refining, with ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' being the leading chemistry text for 180 years.&lt;ref name="Musson &amp; Robinson"/&gt;  Railroads evolved from [[minecart|mine carts]] and the first steam engines were designed specifically for pumping water from mines.  The significance of the blast furnace goes far beyond its capacity for large scale production of cast iron.  The blast furnace was the first example of [[continuous production]] and is a [[countercurrent exchange]] process, various types of which are also used today in chemical and petroleum refining.  [[Hot blast]], which recycled what would have otherwise been waste heat, was one of engineering's key technologies.  It had the immediate effect of dramatically reducing the energy required to produce pig iron, but reuse of heat was eventually applied to a variety of industries, particularly steam boilers, chemicals, petroleum refining and pulp and paper.

Before the 17th century scientific knowledge tended to stay within the intellectual community, but by this time it became accessible to the public in what is called "open science".&lt;ref name="Mokyr 2004"&gt;{{ Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Near the beginning of the Industrial Revolution came publication of the [[Encyclopédie]], written by numerous contributors and edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751–72). It contained many articles on science and was the first general encyclopedia to provide in depth coverage on the mechanical arts, but is far more recognized for its presentation of thoughts of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Economic historians generally agree that, with certain exceptions such as the [[steam engine]], there is no strong linkage between the 17th century scientific revolution (Descartes, Newton, etc.) and the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Mokyr 2004"/&gt; However, an important mechanism for the transfer of technical knowledge was scientific societies, such as The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, better known as the [[Royal Society]], and the Académie des Sciences.  There were also technical colleges, such as the [[École Polytechnique]].  Scotland was the first place where science was taught (in the 18th century) and was where [[Joseph Black]] discovered [[heat capacity]] and [[latent heat]] and where his friend [[James Watt]] used knowledge of heat to conceive the [[Watt steam engine#Separate condenser|separate condenser]] as a means to improve the efficiency of the steam engine.&lt;ref&gt;

Probably the first period in history in which economic progress was observable after one generation was during the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/agricultural_revolution_01.shtml Mark Overton: Agricultural Revolution in England 1500–1850 (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, technological and economic progress did not proceed at a significant rate until the English Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century, and even then productivity grew about 0.5% annually.  High productivity growth began during the late 19th century in what is sometimes call the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].  Most major innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution were based on the modern scientific understanding of [[chemistry]], [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic theory]] and [[thermodynamics]] and other principles known to profession of engineering.

==Major sources of productivity growth in economic history==

=== New forms of energy and power===
Before the industrial revolution the only sources of power were water, wind and muscle.  Most good water power sites (those not requiring massive modern dams) in Europe were developed during the medieval period.  In the 1750s [[John Smeaton]], the "father of civil engineering," significantly improved the efficiency of the water wheel by applying scientific principles, thereby adding badly needed power for the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  However water wheels remained costly, relatively inefficient and not well suited to very large power dams.  [[Benoît Fourneyron]]'s highly efficient turbine developed in the late 1820s eventually replaced waterwheels.  Fourneyron type turbines can operate at 95% efficiency and used in today's large hydro-power installations.  Hydro-power continued to be the leading source of industrial power in the United States until past the mid 19th century because of abundant sites, but steam power overtook water power in the UK decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1711 a [[Newcomen steam engine]] was installed for pumping water from a mine, a job that typically was done by large teams of horses, of which some mines used as many as 500. Animals convert feed to work at an efficiency of about 5%, but while this was much more than the less than 1% efficiency of the early Newcomen engine, in coal mines there was low quality coal with little market value available.  Fossil fuel energy first exceeded all animal and water power in 1870. The role energy and machines replacing physical work is discussed in Ayres-Warr (2004, 2009).&lt;ref name="Ayres-Warr2004"&gt;{{Cite journal

While steamboats were used in some areas, as recently as the late 19th Century thousands of workers [[burlaks|pulled barges]].  Until the late 19th century most coal and other minerals were mined with picks and shovels and crops were harvested and grain threshed using animal power or by hand.  Heavy loads like 382 pound bales of cotton were handled on hand trucks until the early 20th century.

Excavation was done with shovels until the late 19th century when steam shovels came into use.  It was reported that a laborer on the western division of the Erie Canal was expected to dig 5 cubic yards per day in 1860; however, by 1890 only 3-1/2 yards per day were expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Dynamite]], a safe to handle blend of [[nitroglycerin]] and [[diatomaceous earth]] was patented in 1867 by [[Alfred Nobel]]. Dynamite increased productivity of mining, tunneling, road building, construction and demolition and made projects such as the Panama Canal possible.

Steam power was applied to [[threshing machine]]s in the late 19th century.  There were steam engines that moved around on wheels under their own power that were used for supplying temporary power to stationary farm equipment such as threshing machines.  These were called ''road engines,'' and Henry Ford seeing one as a boy was inspired to build an automobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite book |last1= Ford |first1=Henry |author1-link= Henry Ford |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel |title= My Life and Work: An Autobiography of Henry Ford |year= 1922 |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steam tractors were used but never became popular.

With internal combustion came the first mass-produced tractors ([[Fordson tractor|Fordson]] c. 1917).   Tractors replaced horses and mules for pulling reapers and combine harvesters, but in the 1930s self powered combines were developed.  Output per man hour in growing wheat rose by a factor of about 10 from the end of World War II until about 1985, largely because of powered machinery, but also because of increased crop yields.&lt;ref name="MS &amp; SJ"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Energy efficiency===
In engineering and economic history the most important types of energy efficiency were in the conversion of heat to work, the reuse of heat and the reduction of friction.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp"&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a dramatic reduction energy required to transmit electronic signals, both voice and data.

====Conversion of heat to work====
{{Main|Steam engine|Timeline of steam power|Thermal power station|Engine efficiency}}
The early [[Newcomen steam engine]] was about 0.5% efficient and was improved to slightly over 1%  by [[John Smeaton]] before [[Watt steam engine|Watt's]] improvements, which increased [[thermal efficiency]] to 2%. In 1900 it took 7 lbs coal/ kw hr.

Electrical generation was the sector with the highest productivity growth in the U.S. in the early twentieth century.  After the turn of the century large central stations with high pressure boilers and efficient steam turbines replaced reciprocating steam engines and by 1960 it took 0.9 lb coal per kw-hr.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most electricity today is produced by thermal power stations using steam turbines.

The Newcomen and Watt engines operated near atmospheric pressure and used atmospheric pressure, in the form of a vacuum caused by condensing steam, to do work.  Higher pressure engines were light enough, and efficient enough to be used for powering ships and locomotives.  Multiple expansion (multi-stage) engines were developed in the 1870s and were efficient enough for the first time to allow ships to carry more freight than coal, leading to great increases in international trade.&lt;ref name="Wells1891"&gt;{{cite book

The first important diesel ship was the ''[[MS Selandia]]'' launched in 1912.  By 1950 one-third of merchant shipping was diesel powered.&lt;ref name="Williams 1993"/&gt;  Today the most efficient prime mover is the [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C|two stroke marine diesel engine]] developed in the 1920s, now ranging in size to over 100,000 horsepower with a [[thermal efficiency]] of 50%.&lt;ref name="McNeil 1990 pp"&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam locomotives that used up to 20% of the U.S. coal production were replaced by diesel locomotives after World War II, saving a great deal of energy and reducing manpower for handling coal, boiler water and mechanical maintenance.

Improvements in steam engine efficiency caused a large increase in the number of steam engines and the amount of coal used, as noted by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in ''[[The Coal Question]]''.  This is called the [[Jevons paradox]].

The main forms of pre-electric power transmission were [[line shaft]]s, [[hydraulic power network]]s and pneumatic and wire rope systems. [[Line shaft]]s were the common form of power transmission in factories from the earliest industrial steam engines until factory electrification.  Line shafts limited factory arrangement and suffered from high power losses.&lt;ref name = "Hunter&amp;Bryant 1991"/&gt; Hydraulic power came into use in the mid 19th century.  It was used extensively in the [[Bessemer process]] and for cranes at ports, especially in the UK.  London and a few other cities had hydraulic utilities that provided pressurized water for industrial over a wide area.&lt;ref name = "Hunter&amp;Bryant 1991"/&gt;

Pneumatic power began being used industry and in mining and tunneling in the last quarter of the 19th century.  Common applications included rock drills and jack hammers.&lt;ref name = "Hunter&amp;Bryant 1991"/&gt; Wire ropes supported by large grooved wheels were able to transmit power with low loss for a distance of a few miles or kilometers.  Wire rope systems appeared shortly before electrification.&lt;ref name = "Hunter&amp;Bryant 1991"/&gt;

====Reuse of heat====
Recovery of heat for industrial processes was first widely used as [[hot blast]] in [[blast furnace]]s to make pig iron in 1828.  Later heat reuse included the Siemens-Martin process which was first used for making glass and later for steel with the [[open hearth furnace]]. (See: [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)#Iron and steel|Iron and steel]] below).  Today heat is reused in many basic industries such as chemicals, oil refining and pulp and paper, using a variety of methods such as [[heat exchanger]]s in many processes.&lt;ref&gt;See various engineering texts on thermodynamics, heat transfer, distillation&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Multiple-effect evaporator]]s use vapor from a high temperature effect to evaporate a lower temperature boiling fluid.  In the recovery of kraft pulping chemicals the spent black liquor can be evaporated five or six times by reusing the vapor from one effect to boil the liquor in the preceding effect. [[Cogeneration]] is a process that uses high pressure steam to generate electricity and then uses the resulting low pressure steam for process or building heat.

Industrial process have undergone numerous minor improvements which collectively made significant reductions in energy consumption per unit of production.

====Reducing friction====
Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, U.K.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;“ A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Better lubrication, such as from petroleum oils, reduced friction losses in mills and factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|pp=298–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-friction bearings were developed using alloy steels and precision machining techniques available in the last quarter of the 19th century.  Anti-friction bearings were widely used on bicycles by the 1880s.  Bearings began being used on [[line shaft]]s in the decades before factory electrification and it was the pre-bearing shafts that were largely responsible for their high power losses, which were commonly 25 to 30% and often as much as 50%.&lt;ref name = "Hunter&amp;Bryant 1991"/&gt;

====Lighting efficiency====
Electric lights were far more efficient than oil or gas lighting and did not generate smoke, fumes nor as much heat.  Electric light extended the work day, making factories, businesses and homes more productive.  Electric light was not a great fire hazard like oil and gas light.&lt;ref name= "Nye 1990"&gt;*{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of electric lights has continuously improved from the first incandescent lamps to tungsten filament lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[fluorescent lamp]], which became commercial in the late 1930s, is much more efficient than incandescent lighting.  [[Light-emitting diode]]s or LED's are highly efficient and long lasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/articles/history-light-bulb History of the Light Bulb]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infrastructures ===
The relative energy required for transport of a tonne-km for various modes of transport are: pipelines=1(basis), water 2, rail 3, road 10, air 100.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990" /&gt;

====Roads====
Unimproved roads were extremely slow, costly for transport and dangerous.&lt;ref name="Grübler"/&gt;  In the 18th century layered gravel began being increasingly used, with the three layer [[Macadam]] coming into use in the early 19th century.  These roads were crowned to shed water and had drainage ditches along the sides.&lt;ref name="Grübler"/&gt;  The top layer of stones eventually crushed to fines and smoothed the surface somewhat.  The lower layers were of small stones that allowed good drainage.&lt;ref name="Grübler"/&gt; Importantly, they offered less resistance to wagon wheels and horses hooves and feet did not sink in the mud. Plank roads also came into use in the U.S. in the 1810s-1820s. Improved roads were costly, and although they cut the cost of land transportation in half or more, they were soon overtaken by railroads as the major transportation infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Grübler"/&gt;

====Ocean shipping and inland waterways====
Sailing ships could transport goods for over a 3000 miles for the cost of 30 miles by wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A horse that could pull a one-ton wagon could pull a 30-ton barge. During the English or First Industrial Revolution, supplying coal to the furnaces at Manchester was difficult because there were few roads and because of the high cost of using wagons.  However, canal barges were known to be workable, and this was demonstrated by building the [[Bridgewater Canal]], which opened in 1761, bringing coal from Worsley to Manchester.  The Bridgewater Canal’s success started a frenzy of canal building that lasted until the appearance of railroads in the 1830s.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grübler"&gt;{{Cite book

====Railroads====
{{see also|History of rail transport}}
Railroads greatly reduced the cost of overland transportation.  It is estimated that by 1890 the cost of wagon freight was U.S. 24.5 cents/ton-mile versus 0.875 cents/ton-mile by railroad, for a decline of 96%.&lt;ref name ="Fogel1964"&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0-8018-1148-1 |pages= |url= }} Cost is in 1890 gold standard dollars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric street railways ([[tram]]s, trolleys or streetcars) were in the final phase of railroad building from the late 1890s and first two decades of the 20th century. Street railways were soon displaced by motor buses and automobiles after 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|Slater}} {{ cite web | url = http://www.cliffslateralso.com/TQOrigin.pdf | title = General Motors and the Demise of Streetcars | author = Slater, Cliff | publisher = Transportation Quarterly | year = 1997 | pages = 45–66 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425092145/http://www.cliffslateralso.com/TQOrigin.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motorways====
Highways with internal combustion powered vehicles completed the mechanization of overland transportation.  When trucks appeared c. 1920 the price transporting farm goods to market or to rail stations was greatly reduced.  Motorized highway transport also reduced inventories.

The high productivity growth in the U.S. during the 1930s was in large part due to the highway building program of that decade.&lt;ref&gt;

Steam engines were also used instead of horses. Today both threshing and reaping are done with a [[combine harvester]].]]

====Mechanized agriculture====
The seed drill is a mechanical device for spacing and planting seed at the appropriate depth.  It originated in ancient China before the 1st century BC.  Saving seed was extremely important at a time when yields were measured in terms of seeds harvested per seed planted, which was typically between 3 and 5.  The seed drill also saved planting labor.  Most importantly, the seed drill meant crops were grown in rows, which reduced competition of plants and increase yields.  It was reinvented in 16th century Europe based on verbal descriptions and crude drawings brought back from China.&lt;ref name="Simon and Schuster"/&gt;  [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] patented a version in 1700; however, it was expensive and unreliable.  Reliable seed drills appeared in the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of agriculture threshing was done by hand with a [[flail]], requiring a great deal of labor.  The [[threshing machine]] (ca. 1794) simplified the operation and allowed it to use animal power.  By the 1860s threshing machines were widely introduced and ultimately displaced as much as a quarter of agricultural labor.&lt;ref&gt;

In Europe, many of the displaced workers were driven to the brink of starvation.
[[File:Claas-lexion-570-1.jpg|thumb|Harvesting oats in a [[Claas]] Lexion 570 combine with enclosed, air-conditioned cab with rotary thresher and laser-guided hydraulic steering]]

Before c. 1790 a worker could harvest 1/4 acre per day with a [[scythe]].&lt;ref name="Wells1891"/&gt;  In the early 1800s the [[grain cradle]] was introduced, significantly increasing the productivity of hand labor.
It was estimated that each of [[Cyrus McCormick|Cyrus McCormick's]] horse pulled [[reaper]]s (Ptd. 1834) freed up five men for military service in the U.S. Civil War.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"/&gt;  By 1890 two men and two horses could cut, rake and bind 20 acres of wheat per day.&lt;ref name="Wells1891"/&gt;  
In the 1880s the reaper and [[threshing machine]] were combined into the [[combine harvester]].  These machines required large teams of horses or mules to pull.  Over the entire 19th century the output per man hour for producing wheat rose by about 500% and for corn about 250%.&lt;ref name="MS &amp; SJ"/&gt;

Farm machinery and higher crop yields reduced the labor to produce 100 bushels of corn from 35 to 40 hours in 1900 to 2 hours 45 minutes in 1999.&lt;ref name="Constable_Ch7"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives, Chapter 7, Agricultural Mechanization

The peak years for tractor sales in the U.S. were the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Tractors"/&gt;   There was a large surge in horsepower of farm machinery in the 1950s.

====Industrial machinery====
{{Details|Industrial Revolution}}
{{Details|Second Industrial Revolution}}
The most important mechanical devices before the Industrial Revolution were water and wind mills.  Water wheels date to Roman times and windmills somewhat later.  Water and wind power were first used for grinding grain into flour, but were later adapted to power [[trip hammer]]s for pounding rags into pulp for making paper and for crushing ore.  Just before the Industrial revolution water power was applied to bellows for iron smelting in Europe.  (Water powered blast bellows were used in ancient China.)  Wind and water power were also used in sawmills.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The technology of building mills and mechanical clocks was important to the development of the machines of the Industrial Revolution.{{sfn|Musson|Robinson|1969|pp=}}

The [[spinning wheel]] was a medieval invention that increased thread making productivity by a factor greater than ten.  One of the early developments that preceded the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the [[stocking frame]] (loom) of c. 1589.  Later in the Industrial Revolution came the [[flying shuttle]], a simple device that doubled the productivity of weaving.  Spinning thread had been a limiting factor in cloth making requiring 10 spinners using the [[spinning wheel]] to supply one weaver.  With the [[spinning jenny]] a spinner could spin eight threads at once.  The [[water frame]] (Ptd. 1768) adapted water power to spinning, but it could only spin one thread at a time. The water frame was easy to operate and many could be located in a single building.  The [[spinning mule]] (1779) allowed a large number of threads to be spun by a single machine using water power.  A change in consumer preference for cotton at the time of increased cloth production resulted in the invention of the [[cotton gin]] (Ptd. 1794).  Steam power eventually was used as a supplement to water during the Industrial Revolution, and both were used until electrification.  A graph of productivity of spinning technologies can be found in Ayres (1989), along with much other data related this article.&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The machine, operated by a two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day.  The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.

====Machine tools====
{{Main|Machine tool}}
[[Machine tools]], which cut, grind and shape metal parts, were another important mechanical innovation of the Industrial Revolution.  Before machine tools it was prohibitively expensive to make precision parts, an essential requirement for many machines and [[interchangeable parts]].    Historically important machine tools are the [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]] and metal [[planer (metalworking)]], which all came into use between 1800 and 1840.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt; However, around 1900, it was the combination of small electric motors, specialty steels and new cutting and grinding materials that allowed machine tools to mass-produce steel parts.&lt;ref name="Smil 2006" &gt;

Modern manufacturing began around 1900 when machines, aided by electric, hydraulic and pneumatic power, began to replace hand methods in industry.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;  An early example is the [[Michael Joseph Owens|Owens]] automatic glass bottle blowing machine, which reduced labor in making bottles by over 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Joseph Owens |url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5612.pdf |quote= |publisher=[[ASME]] |date=May 17, 1893 |accessdate=2007-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405015937/http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5612.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  See also: [[Mass production#Factory electrification]]

====Mining====
Large mining machines, such as steam shovels, appeared in the mid-nineteenth century, but were restricted to rails until the widespread introduction of [[continuous track]] and pneumatic tires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Until then much mining work was mostly done with pneumatic drills, jackhammers, picks and shovels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=135–6, 455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal seam undercutting machines appeared around 1890 and were used for 75% of coal production by 1934.  Coal loading was still being done manually with shovels around 1930, but mechanical pick up and loading machines were coming into use.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;  The use of the coal boring machine improved productivity of sub-surface coal mining by a factor of three between 1949 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Mechanized materials handling====

=====Bulk materials handling=====
{{Main|Bulk material handling}}
[[Image:P&amp;H 4100XPB Shovel-1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|P &amp; H 4100 XPB cable loading shovel, a type of mobile crane]][[File:Unloading cotton from steamboat 001.jpg|thumbnail|Unloading cotton c. 1900.

Today non-bulk freight is [[containerization|containerized]].]]

Dry [[bulk materials handling]] systems use a variety of stationary equipment such as conveyors, stackers, reclaimers and mobile equipment such as [[power shovel]]s and loaders to handle high volumes of ores, coal, grains, sand, gravel, crushed stone, etc.   Bulk materials handling systems are used at mines, for loading and unloading ships and at factories that process bulk materials into finished goods, such as steel and paper mills.

[[File:Pompwagen.jpg|thumb|left|The handle on this [[pumpjack]] is the lever for a hydraulic jack, which can easily lift loads up to 2-1/2 tonnes, depending on rating. Commonly used in warehouses and in retail stores.]]

Mechanical stokers for feeding coal to locomotives were in use in the 1920s.  A completely mechanized and automated coal handling and stoking system was first used to feed pulverized coal to an electric utility boiler in 1921.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

Liquids and gases are handled with [[centrifugal pump]]s and compressors, respectively.

Conversion to powered material handling increased during WW 1 as shortages of unskilled labor developed and unskilled wages rose relative to skilled labor.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"&gt;{{Cite book

A noteworthy use of conveyors was [[Oliver Evans#Automatic flour mill|Oliver Evans's automatic flour mill]] built in 1785.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

Around 1900 various types of conveyors ([[belt conveyor|belt]], slat, bucket, screw or auger), [[overhead crane]]s and industrial trucks began being used for handling materials and goods in various stages of production in factories.  See: [[Conveyor system#Types of conveyor systems|Types of conveyor systems]]  See also: [[Mass production]].

A well known application of conveyors is Ford. Motor Co.'s [[assembly line]] (c. 1913), although Ford used various industrial trucks, overhead cranes, slides and whatever devices necessary to minimize labor in handling parts in various parts of the factory.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

=====Cranes=====
Cranes are an ancient technology but they became widespread following the Industrial Revolution.  Industrial cranes were used to handle heavy machinery at the [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company]] (Bridgewater foundry) in the late 1830s.{{sfn|Musson|Robinson|1969|pp=491–495}} Hydraulic powered cranes became widely used in the late 19th century, especially at British ports.  Some cities, such as London, had public utility hydraulic service networks to power.  Steam cranes were also used in the late 19th century. Electric cranes, especially the overhead type, were introduce in factories at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Nye 1990"/&gt;  Steam cranes were usually restricted to rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Continuous track]] (caterpillar tread) was developed in the late 19th century.

The important categories of [[crane (machine)|crane]]s are:
*[[Crane (machine)#Overhead crane|Overhead crane]] or bridge cranes-travel on a rail and have trolleys that move the hoist to any position inside the crane frame.  Widely used in factories.
*[[Crane (machine)#Mobile|Mobile crane]] Usually gasoline or diesel powered and travel on wheels for on or off-road, rail or [[continuous track]].  They are widely used in construction, mining, excavation handling bulk materials. 
*[[Crane (machine)#Fixed|Fixed crane]] In a fixed position but can usually rotate full circle.  The most familiar example is the tower crane used to erect tall buildings.

=====Palletization=====
{{Main|Pallet}}
Handling goods on [[pallet]]s was a significant improvement over using hand trucks or carrying sacks or boxes by hand and greatly speeded up loading and unloading of trucks, rail cars and ships.  Pallets can be handled with [[pallet jack]]s or [[forklift truck]]s which began being used in industry in the 1930s and became widespread by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;  [[Loading dock]]s built to architectural standards allow trucks or rail cars to load and unload at the same elevation as the warehouse floor.

=====Piggyback rail=====
{{Main|Piggyback (transportation)}}
[[Piggyback (transportation)|Piggyback]] is the transporting of trailers or entire trucks on rail cars, which is a more fuel efficient means of shipping and saves loading, unloading and sorting labor.  Wagons had been carried on rail cars in the 19th century, with horses in separate cars.  Trailers began being carried on rail cars in the U.S. in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levinson|2007|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Piggyback was 1% of freight in 1958, rising to 15% in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Field|2011|pp=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Containerization=====
{{Main|Containerization}}
Either loading or unloading [[break bulk cargo]] on and off ships typically took several days.  It was strenuous and somewhat dangerous work.  Losses from damage and theft were high. The work was erratic and most longshoreman had a lot of unpaid idle time.  Sorting and keeping track of break bulk cargo was also time consuming, and holding it in warehouses tied up capital.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;

Old style ports with warehouses were congested and many lacked efficient transportation infrastructure, adding to costs and delays in port.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;

By handling freight in standardized containers in compartmentalized ships, either loading or unloading could typically be accomplished in one day.  Containers can be more efficiently filled than break bulk because containers can be stacked several high, doubling the freight capacity for a given size ship.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;

Loading and unloading labor for containers is a fraction of break bulk, and damage and theft are much lower.  Also, many items shipped in containers require less packaging.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;

[[Containerization]] with small boxes was used in both world wars, particularly WW II, but became commercial in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"&gt;{{cite book | author = Marc Levinson | title = The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger | publisher = Princeton Univ.

=== Work practices and processes===

====Division of labor====

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Division of labor]] was practiced in antiquity but became increasingly specialized during the Industrial Revolution, so that instead of a shoemaker cutting out leather as part of the operation of making a shoe, a worker would do nothing but cut out leather.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson_1989"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Adam Smith]]'s famous example of a pin factory, workers each doing a single task were far more productive than a craftsmen making an entire pin.

Starting before and continuing into the industrial revolution, much work was subcontracted under the [[putting out system]] (also called the domestic system) whereby work was done at home.  Putting out work included spinning, weaving, leather cutting and, less commonly, specialty items such as firearms parts.  Merchant capitalists or master craftsmen typically provided the materials and collected the work pieces, which were made into finished product in a central workshop.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factory system====
{{Main|Factory system}}
During the industrial revolution much production took place in workshops, which were typically located in the rear or upper level of the same building where the finished goods were sold.   These workshops used tools and sometimes simple machinery, which was usually hand or animal powered.  The master craftsman, foreman or merchant capitalist supervised the work and maintained quality.   Workshops grew in size but were displaced by the factory system in the early 19th century.  Under the [[factory system]] capitalists hired workers and provided the buildings, machinery and supplies and handled the sale of the finished products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interchangeable parts====
{{Main|Interchangeable parts}}
Changes to traditional work processes that were done after analyzing the work and making it more systematic greatly increased the productivity of labor and capital.  This was the changeover from the European system of craftsmanship, where a craftsman made a whole item,  to the [[American system of manufacturing]] which used special purpose machines and machine tools that made parts with precision to be [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]]. The process took decades to perfect at great expense because interchangeable parts were more costly at first.  [[Interchangeable parts]] were achieved by using fixtures to hold and precisely align parts being machined, jigs to guide the machine tools and gauges to measure critical dimensions of finished parts.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientific management====
{{Main|Scientific management}}
Other work processes involved minimizing the number of steps in doing individual tasks, such as bricklaying, by performing [[time and motion study|time and motion studies]] to determine the one best method, the system becoming known as [[Taylorism]] after [[Fredrick Winslow Taylor]] who is the best known developer of this method, which is also known as ''[[scientific management]]'' after his work ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]''.&lt;ref name="Nelson_1980"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standardization====
{{Main|Standardization}}
[[Standardization]] and interchangeability are considered to be main reasons for U.S. exceptionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Standardization]] was part of the change to [[interchangeable parts]], but was also facilitated by the railroad industry and [[mass production|mass-produced goods]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Railroad [[track gauge]] standardization and standards for rail cars allowed inter-connection of railroads.  [[Railway time]] formalized time zones.  Industrial standards included screw sizes and threads and later electrical standards.  Shipping container standards were loosely adopted in the late 1960s and formally adopted ca. 1970.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;  Today there are vast numbers of [[technical standard]]s.  Commercial standards includes such things as bed sizes.  Architectural standards cover numerous dimensions including stairs, doors, counter heights and other designs to make buildings safe, functional and in some cases allow a degree of interchangeability.

====Rationalized factory layout====
[[Electrification]] allowed the placement of machinery such as [[machine tools]] in a systematic arrangement along the flow of the work.  Electrification was a practical way to motorize conveyors to transfer parts and assemblies to workers,  which was a key step leading to [[mass production]] and the [[assembly line]].&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"/&gt;

====Modern business management====
Business administration, which includes management practices and accounting systems is another important form of work practices.  As the size of businesses grew in the second half of the 19th century they began being  organized by departments and managed by professional managers as opposed to being run by sole proprietors or partners.&lt;ref name="Chandler_1993"/&gt;

Business administration as we know it was developed by railroads who had to keep up with trains, railcars, equipment, personnle and freight over large territories.&lt;ref name="Chandler_1993"&gt;

====Continuous production====
[[Continuous production]] is a method by which a process operates without interruption for long periods, perhaps even years.  Continuous production began with [[blast furnaces]] in ancient times and became popular with mechanized processes following the invention of the Fourdrinier [[paper machine]] during the Industrial Revolution, which was the inspiration for continuous rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Misa|1995|pp=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It began being widely used in chemical and petroleum refining industries in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  It was later applied to [[Continuous casting#direct strip casting|direct strip casting]] of steel and other metals.

Early steam engines did not supply power at a constant enough load for many continuous applications ranging from cotton spinning to rolling mills, restricting their power source to water.  Advances in steam engines such as the [[Corliss steam engine]] and the development of [[control theory]] led to more constant engine speeds, which made steam power useful for sensitive tasks such as cotton spinning.  AC motors, which run at constant speed even with load variations, were well suited to such processes.

=== Scientific agriculture ===
Losses of agricultural products to spoilage, insects and rats contributed greatly to productivity.  Much hay stored outdoors was lost to spoilage before indoor storage or some means of coverage became common.  Pasteurization of milk allowed it to be shipped by railroad.&lt;ref name="Wells1891"/&gt;

Keeping livestock indoors in winter reduces the amount of feed needed.  Also, feeding chopped hay and ground grains, particularly corn (maize), was found to improve digestibility.&lt;ref name="Wells1891"/&gt;  The amount of feed required to produce a kg of live weight chicken fell from 5 in 1930 to 2 by the late 1990s and the time required fell from three months to six weeks.&lt;ref name="Smil 2006"/&gt;

The [[Green Revolution]] increased crop yields by a factor of 3 for soybeans and between 4 and 5 for corn (maize), wheat, rice and some other crops.  Using data for corn (maize) in the U.S., yields increased about 1.7 bushels per acre from the early 1940s until the first decade of the 21st century when concern was being expressed about reaching limits of photosynthesis.  Because of the constant nature of the yield increase, the annual percentage increase has declined from over 5% in the 1940s to 1% today, so while yields for a while outpaced population growth, yield growth now lags population growth.

High yields would not be possible without significant applications of fertilizer,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipni.net/ipniweb/portal.nsf/0/35A687BDB628E999852572050049A51A International Plant Nutrition Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfi.org/ The Fertilizer Institute&lt;/ref&gt; particularly nitrogen fertilizer which was made affordable by the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch]] ammonia process.&lt;ref name = "Smil 2004"&gt;{{cite book |title= Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production

Land is considered a form of capital, but otherwise has received little attention relative to its importance as a factor of productivity by modern economists, although it was important in classical economics.  However, higher crop yields effectively multiplied the amount of land.

=== New materials, processes and de-materialization ===

====Iron and steel====
{{Main|Cast iron|Steel}}

The process of making [[cast iron]] was known before the 3rd century AD in China.&lt;ref name="Temple 1986 pp"&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cast iron production reached Europe in the 14th century and Britain around 1500.  Cast iron was useful for casting into pots and other implements, but was too brittle for making most tools.  However, cast iron had a lower melting temperature than wrought iron and was much easier to make with primitive technology.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wrought iron]] was the material used for making many hardware items, tools and other implements.  Before cast iron was made in Europe, wrought iron was made in small batches by the [[bloomery]] process, which was never used in China.&lt;ref name="Temple 1986 pp"/&gt;  Wrought iron could be made from cast iron more cheaply than it could be made with a bloomery.

The inexpensive process for making good quality wrought iron was [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]], which became widespread after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Puddling involved stirring molten cast iron until small globs sufficiently decarburized to form globs of hot wrought iron that were then removed and hammered into shapes. Puddling was extremely labor-intensive. Puddling was used until the introduction of the Bessemer and open hearth processes in the mid and late 19th century, respectively.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp"/&gt;

Blister steel was made from wrought iron by packing wrought iron in charcoal and heating for several days. See: [[Cementation process]] The blister steel could be heated and hammered with wrought iron to make shear steel, which was used for cutting edges like scissors, knives and axes.  Shear steel was of non uniform quality and a better process was needed for producing watch springs, a popular luxury item in the 18th century.  The successful process was [[crucible steel]], which was made by melting wrought iron and blister steel in a crucible.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil 1990 pp"/&gt;

Production of steel and other metals was hampered by the difficulty in producing sufficiently high temperatures for melting.  An understanding of thermodynamic principles such as recapturing heat from flue gas by preheating combustion air, known as [[hot blast]], resulted in much higher energy efficiency and higher temperatures.  Preheated combustion air was used in iron production and in the [[open hearth furnace]].  In 1780, before the introduction of hot blast in 1829, it required seven times as much coke as the weight of the product pig iron.&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"&gt;{{Cite journal

Steel has much higher strength than [[wrought iron]] and allowed long span bridges, high rise buildings, automobiles and other items.  Steel also made superior threaded fasteners (screws, nuts, bolts), nails, wire and other hardware items.  Steel rails lasted over 10 times longer than [[wrought iron]] rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Bessemer and open hearth processes were much more efficient than making steel by the [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] because they used the carbon in the pig iron as a source of heat.  The [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] (patented in 1855) and the [[open hearth furnace|Siemens-Martin]] (c. 1865) processes greatly reduced the cost of [[steel]]. By the end of the 19th century, Gilchirst-Thomas “basic” process had reduced production costs by 90% compared to the puddling process of the mid-century.

Today a variety of [[alloy steel]]s are available that have superior properties for special applications like automobiles, pipelines and drill bits.  High speed or tool steels, whose development began in the late 19th century, allowed machine tools to cut steel at much higher speeds.&lt;ref name="Misa 1995"&gt;{{cite book

Some of the most important specialty materials are [[steam turbine]] and [[gas turbine]] blades, which have to withstand extreme mechanical stress and high temperatures.&lt;ref name="McNeil 1990 pp"/&gt;

The size of blast furnaces grew greatly over the 20th century and innovations like additional heat recovery and pulverized coal, which displaced coke and increased energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="Smil2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=Transforming the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations and Their Consequences

Bessemer steel became brittle with age because nitrogen was introduced when air was blown in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bessemer process was also restricted to certain ores (low phosphate hematite).  By the end of the 19th century the Bessemer process was displaced by the open hearth furnace (OHF).  After World War II the OHF was displaced by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which used oxygen instead of air and required about 35–40 minutes to produce a batch of steel compared to 8 to 9 hours for the OHF. The BOF also was more energy efficient.&lt;ref name="Smil2006"/&gt;

By 1913, 80% of steel was being made from molten pig iron directly from the blast furnace, eliminating the step of casting the "pigs" (ingots) and remelting.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

The continuous wide strip rolling mill, developed by ARMCO in 1928, was most important development in steel industry during the inter-war years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|pp=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuous wide strip rolling started with a thick, coarse ingot.  It produced a smoother sheet with more uniform thickness, which was better for stamping and gave a nice painted surface.  It was good for automotive body steel and  appliances.  It used only a fraction of the labor of the discontinuous process, and was safer because it did not require continuous handling.  Continuous rolling was made possible by improved sectional speed control:  See: [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)#Automation, process control and servomechanisms|Automation, process control and servomechanisms]]

After 1950 [[continuous casting]] contributed to productivity of converting steel to structural shapes by eliminating the intermittent step of making slabs, billets (square cross-section) or blooms (rectangular) which then usually have to be reheated before rolling into shapes.&lt;ref name ="Smil2005" /&gt;  Thin slab casting, introduced in 1989, reduced labor to less than one hour per ton.  Continuous thin slab casting and the BOF were the two most important productivity advancements in 20th-century steel making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

As a result of these innovations, between 1920 and 2000 labor requirements in the steel industry decreased by a factor of 1,000, from more than 3 worker-hours per tonne to just 0.003.&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"/&gt;

====Sodium carbonate (soda ash) and related chemicals====
{{Main|Sodium carbonate}}
Sodium compounds: carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide are important industrial chemicals used in important products like making glass and soap.  Until the invention of the [[Leblanc process]] in 1791, sodium carbonate was made, at high cost, from the ashes of seaweed and the plant [[barilla]].  The Leblanc process was replaced by the [[Solvay process]] beginning in the 1860s.  With the widespread availability of inexpensive electricity, much sodium is produced along with chlorine by electro-chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp"/&gt;

====Cement====
Cement is the binder for [[concrete]], which is one of the most widely used construction materials today because of its low cost, versatility and durability.  [[Portland cement]], which was invented 1824-5, is made by [[Calcination|calcining]] limestone and other naturally occurring minerals in a [[kiln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great advance was the perfection of rotary cement kilns in the 1890s, the method still being used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforced concrete, which is suitable for structures, began being used in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paper====
{{Further|Paper|Pulp (paper)|Paper machine|Sulfite process|Kraft process|Containerboard|Paperboard}}
Paper was made one sheet at a time by hand until development of the Fourdrinier [[paper machine]] (c. 1801) which made a continuous sheet.  Paper making was severely limited by the supply of cotton and linen rags from the time of the invention of the printing press until the development of wood pulp (c. 1850s)in response to a shortage of rags.&lt;ref name ="Febvre-Martin1976"/&gt;  The [[sulfite process]] for making wood pulp started operation in Sweden in 1874. Paper made from sulfite pulp had superior strength properties than the previously used ground wood pulp (c. 1840).&lt;ref name="TAPPI"/&gt; The [[Kraft process|kraft]] (Swedish for ''strong'') pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s.  Pulping chemicals are recovered and internally recycled in the kraft process, also saving energy and reducing pollution.&lt;ref name="TAPPI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kraft [[paperboard]] is the material that the outer layers of corrugated boxes are made of.  Until Kraft corrugated boxes were available, packaging consisted of poor quality paper and paperboard boxes along with wood boxes and crates. Corrugated boxes require much less labor to manufacture than wooden boxes and offer good protection to their contents.&lt;ref name="TAPPI"&gt;See publications by the Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI)&lt;/ref&gt;  Shipping containers reduce the need for packaging.&lt;ref name="Levinson2006"/&gt;

====Rubber and plastics====
{{Main|Elastomer}}
[[Vulcanization|Vulcanized rubber]] made the pneumatic tire possible, which in turn enabled the development of on and off-road vehicles as we know them.  [[Synthetic rubber]] became important during the Second World War when supplies of natural rubber were cut off.

Rubber inspired a class of chemicals known as [[elastomer]]s, some of which are used by themselves or in blends with rubber and other compounds for seals and gaskets, shock absorbing bumpers and a variety of other applications.

[[Plastics]] can be inexpensively made into everyday items and have significantly lowered the cost of a variety of goods including packaging, containers, parts and household piping.

====Optical fiber====

[[Optical fiber]] began to replace copper wire in the telephone network during the 1980s.  Optical fibers are very small diameter, allowing many to be bundled in a cable or conduit.  Optical fiber is also an energy efficient means of transmitting signals.

====Oil and gas====
[[reflection seismology|Seismic exploration]], beginning in the 1920s, uses reflected sound waves to map subsurface geology to help locate potential oil reservoirs.  This was a great improvement over previous methods, which involved mostly luck and good knowledge of geology, although luck continued to be important in several major discoveries.  Rotary drilling was a faster and more efficient way of drilling oil and water wells.  It became popular after being used for the initial discovery of the East Texas field in 1930.

====Hard materials for cutting====
Numerous new hard materials were developed for cutting edges such as in machining.  [[Mushet steel]], which was developed in 1868, was a forerunner of [[High speed steel]], which was developed by a team led by [[Fredrick Winslow Taylor]] at [[Bethlehem Steel Company]] around 1900.&lt;ref name="Nelson_1980"/&gt;  High speed steel held its hardness even when it became red hot.  It was followed by a number of  modern alloys.

From 1935 to 1955 machining cutting speeds increased from 120–200&amp;nbsp;ft/min to 1000&amp;nbsp;ft/min due to harder cutting edges, causing machining costs to fall by 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=65, Note 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important new hard materials for cutting is [[tungsten carbide]].

====Dematerialization====
{{Main|Dematerialization (economics)}}
[[Dematerialization (economics)|Dematerialization]] is the reduction of use of materials in manufacturing, construction, packaging or other uses.  In the U.S. the quantity of raw materials per unit of output decreased approx 60% since 1900.  In Japan the reduction has been 40% since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;

Dematerialization is made possible by substitution with better materials and by engineering to reduce weight while maintaining function.  Modern examples are plastic beverage containers replacing glass and paperboard, plastic [[shrink wrap]] used in shipping and light weight plastic packing materials.  [[Dematerialization (economics)|Dematerialization]] has been occurring in the U. S. steel industry where the peak in consumption occurred in 1973 on both an absolute and per capita basis.&lt;ref name="Smil2006"/&gt; At the same time, per capita steel consumption grew globally through [[Outsourcing#Industrialization|outsourcing]].&lt;ref name="worldsteel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldsteel.org/dms/internetDocumentList/bookshop/Word-Steel-in-Figures-2013/document/World%20Steel%20in%20Figures%202013.pdf |format=PDF |title=World Steel in Figures 2013 |work=worldsteel |publisher=worldsteel Association |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101150040/http://www.worldsteel.org/dms/internetDocumentList/bookshop/Word-Steel-in-Figures-2013/document/World%20Steel%20in%20Figures%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulative global GDP or wealth has grown in direct proportion to energy consumption since 1970, while [[Jevons paradox]] posits that efficiency improvement leads to increased energy consumption.&lt;ref name="Garrett 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inscc.utah.edu/~tgarrett/Economics/GDP_is_not_Wealth.html |title=GDP is not Wealth |last=Garrett |first=T.

It is estimated that one teletypist replaced 15 Morse code operators.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

====Telephone====
The early use of telephones was primarily for business.  Monthly service cost about one third of the average worker's earnings.&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"/&gt; The telephone along with trucks and the new road networks allowed businesses to reduce inventory sharply during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;

Telephone calls were handled by operators using [[Electric switchboard|switchboard]]s until the automatic switchboard was introduced in 1892.   By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

Automatic telephone switching originally used electro-mechanical switches controlled by vacuum tube devices, which consumed a large amount of electricity.  Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting [[Bell Labs]] to begin research on the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives

Natural gas began being supplied to households in the late 19th century.

Household appliances followed household electrification in the 1920s, with consumers buying electric ranges, toasters, refrigerators and washing machines.  As a result of appliances and convenience foods, time spent on meal preparation and clean up, laundry and cleaning decreased from 58 hours/week in 1900 to 18 hours/week by 1975.  Less time spent on housework allowed more women to enter the labor force.&lt;ref name="Legergott1993" /&gt;

=== Automation, process control and servomechanisms===
{{Main|Automation|Process control}}

[[Automation]] means automatic control, meaning a process is run with minimum operator intervention.  Some of the various levels of automation are: mechanical methods, electrical [[relay]], feedback control with a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] and computer control.  Common applications of automation are for controlling temperature, flow and pressure. Automatic speed control is important in many industrial applications, especially in sectional drives, such as found in metal rolling and paper drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|The concept of the feedback loop to control the dynamic behavior of the system: this is negative feedback, because the sensed value is subtracted from the desired value to create the error signal, which is processed by the controller, which provides proper corrective action.  A typical example would be to control the opening of a valve to hold a liquid level in a tank.  [[Process control]] is a widely used form of automation.  See also: [[PID controller]]]]

The earliest applications of process control were mechanisms that adjusted the gap between mill stones for grinding grain and for keeping windmills facing into the wind.  The [[centrifugal governor]] used for adjusting the mill stones was copied by James Watt for controlling speed of steam engines in response to changes in heat load to the boiler; however, if the load on the engine changed the governor only held the speed steady at the new rate.  It took much development work to achieve the degree of steadiness necessary to operate textile machinery.&lt;ref name="Bennett 1979"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A mathematical analysis of control theory was first developed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].  Control theory was developed to its "classical" form by the 1950s.&lt;ref name ="Bennett1993"/&gt; See: [[Control theory#History]]

Factory [[electrification]] brought simple electrical controls such as [[ladder logic]], whereby push buttons could be used to activate [[relay]]s to engage motor starters.  Other controls such as interlocks, timers and limit switches could be added to the circuit.

Today automation usually refers to feedback control.  An example is cruise control on a car, which applies continuous correction when a sensor on the controlled variable (Speed in this example) deviates from a set-point and can respond in a corrective manner to hold the setting.  [[Control theory|Process control]] is the usual form of automation that allows industrial operations like oil refineries, steam plants generating electricity or paper mills to be run with a minimum of manpower, usually from a number of control rooms.

The need for instrumentation grew with the rapidly growing central electric power stations after the First World War.  Instrumentation was also important for heat treating ovens, chemical plants and refineries.  Common instrumentation was for measuring temperature, pressure or flow.  Readings were typically recorded on circle charts or strip charts.  Until the 1930s control was typically "open loop", meaning that it did not use feedback.  Operators made various adjustments by such means as turning handles on valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If done from a control room a message could be sent to an operator in the plant by color coded light, letting him know whether to increase or decrease whatever was being controlled.  The signal lights were operated by a switchboard, which soon became automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Automatic control became possible with the feedback controller, which sensed the measured variable, measured the deviation from the setpoint and perhaps the rate of change and time weighted amount of deviation, compared that with the setpoint and automatically applied a calculated adjustment.  A stand-alone controller may use a combination of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electronic analogs to manipulate the controlled device.  The tendency was to use electronic controls after these were developed, but today the tendency is to use a computer to replace individual controllers.

By the late 1930s feedback control was gaining widespread use.&lt;ref name ="Bennett1993"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   Feedback control was an important technology for [[continuous production]].

Automation of the telephone system allowed dialing local numbers instead of having calls placed through an operator.  Further automation allowed callers to place long distance calls by [[Direct distance dialing|direct dial]]. Eventually almost all operators were replaced with automation.

[[Machine tools]] were automated with [[Numerical control]] (NC) in the 1950s.  This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).

[[Servomechanism]]s are commonly position or speed control devices that use feedback.  Understanding of these devices is covered in [[control theory]].  Control theory was successfully applied to steering ships in the 1890s, but after meeting with personnel resistance it was not widely implemented for that application until after the First World War.  Servomechanisms are extremely important in providing automatic stability control for airplanes and in a wide variety of industrial applications.

[[Industrial robot]]s were used on a limited scale from the 1960s but began their rapid growth phase in the mid-1980s after the widespread availability of microprocessors used for their control.  By 2000 there were over 700,000 robots worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smil 2006"/&gt;

Early electric data processing was done by running [[punched card]]s through [[tabulating machine]]s, the holes in the cards allowing electrical contact to increment electronic counters. Tabulating machines were in a category called [[unit record equipment]], through which the flow of punched cards was arranged in a program-like sequence to allow sophisticated data processing.  Unit record equipment was widely used before the introduction of computers.

The usefulness of tabulating machines was demonstrated by compiling the 1890 U.S. census, allowing the census to be processed in less than a year and with great labor savings compared to the estimated 13 years by the previous manual method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives

====Stored program computers====
The first digital computers were more productive than tabulating machines, but not by a great amount.  Early computers used thousands of [[vacuum tube]]s (thermionic valves) which used a lot of electricity and constantly needed replacing.  By the 1950s the vacuum tubes were replaced by [[transistor]]s which were much more reliable and used relatively little electricity.  By the 1960s thousands of transistors and other electronic components could be manufactured on a silicon [[semiconductor]] wafer as [[integrated circuits]], which are universally used in today's computers.

Computers used paper tape and punched cards for data and programming input until the 1980s when it was still common to receive monthly utility bills printed on a punched card that was returned with the customer’s payment.

In 1973 IBM introduced [[point of sale]] (POS) terminals in which electronic cash registers were networked to the store mainframe computer. By the 1980s [[bar code reader]]s were added. These technologies automated inventory management. [[Wal-Mart]] was an early adopter of POS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated  that bar code scanners at checkout increased ringing speed by 30% and reduced labor requirements of cashiers and baggers by 10-15%.&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995"&gt;{{cite book| author = Rifkin, Jeremy | title = The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era | publisher = Putnam Publishing Group | year = 1995|pages=153| isbn = 0-87477-779-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data storage became better organized after the development of [[relational database]] software that allowed data to be stored in different tables.  For example, a theoretical airline may have numerous tables such as: airplanes, employees, maintenance contractors, caterers, flights, airports, payments, tickets, etc. each containing a narrower set of more specific information than would a flat file, such as a spreadsheet.  These tables are related by common data fields called ''keys''. (See: [[Relational model]]) Data can be retrieved in various specific configurations by posing a ''query'' without having to pull up a whole table.  This, for example, makes it easy to find a passenger's seat assignment by a variety of means such as ticket number or name, and provide only the ''queried'' information.  See: [[SQL]]

Since the mid-1990s, interactive web pages have allowed users to access various [[Server (computing)|servers]] over Internet to engage in e-commerce such as [[online shopping]], paying bills, trading stocks, managing bank accounts and renewing auto registrations.  This is the ultimate form of back office automation because the transaction information is transferred directly to the database.

Computers also greatly increased productivity of the communications sector, especially in areas like the elimination of telephone operators. In engineering, computers replaced manual drafting with [[Computer-aided design|CAD]], with a 500% average increase in a draftsman's output.&lt;ref name="Smil 2006"/&gt;  Software was developed for calculations used in designing electronic circuits, stress analysis, heat and material balances.  [[Process simulation]] software has been developed for both steady state and dynamic simulation, the latter able to give the user a very similar experience to operating a real process like a refinery or paper mill, allowing the user to optimize the process or experiment with process modifications.

[[Automated teller machine]]s (ATM's) became popular in recent decades and self checkout at retailers appeared in the 1990s.

The [[Airline Reservations System]] and banking are areas where computers are practically essential. Modern military systems also rely on computers.

In 1959 Texaco’s Port Arthur refinery became the first chemical plant to use digital process control.&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995"/&gt;

Computers did not revolutionize manufacturing because automation, in the form of [[control system]]s, had already been in existence for decades, although computers did allow more sophisticated control, which led to improved product quality and process optimization.

The computer and computer-like semiconductor devices used in automation are the most significant productivity improving technologies developed in the final decades of the twentieth century; however, their contribution to overall productivity growth was disappointing. Most of the productivity growth occurred in the new industry computer and related industries.&lt;ref name ="Field 2004"/&gt;  Economist [[Robert J. Gordon]] is among those who questioned whether computers lived up to the great innovations of the past, such as electrification.&lt;ref name="Gordon2000" /&gt; This issue is known as the [[productivity paradox]]. Gordon's (2013) analysis of productivity in the U.S. gives two possible surges in growth, one during 1891–1972 and the second in 1996–2004 due to the acceleration in [[Moore's law]]-related technological innovation.&lt;ref name="Gordon 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. Productivity Growth: The Slowdown Has Returned After a Temporary Revival |journal=International Productivity Monitor, Centre for the Study of Living Standards |date=Spring 2013 |last=Gordon |first=Robert J. |volume=25 |pages=13–19 |url=http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/economics/Gordon/SAN-to-NBER%20Baily-Sharpe%20as%20published_130327.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-07-19 |quote=The U.S. economy achieved a growth rate of labour productivity of 2.48 per cent per year for 81 years, followed by 24 years of 1.32 per cent, then a temporary recovery back to 2.48 per cent per cent, and a final slowdown to 1.35 per cent.

Improvements in productivity affected the relative sizes of various economic sectors by reducing prices and employment. Agricultural productivity released labor at a time when manufacturing was growing. Manufacturing productivity growth peaked with factory electrification and automation, but still remains significant. However, as the relative size of the manufacturing sector shrank the government and service sectors, which have low productivity growth, grew.&lt;ref name="Bjork_1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won’t: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=0-275-96532-5 |pages=| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvement in living standards==
[[File:Cost of chicken in time worked.jpg|thumb|320px|right|An hour's work in 1998 bought 11 times as much chicken as in 1900. Many consumer items show similar declines in terms of work time.]]
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including England and France, until the latter part of the 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years, and only slightly higher in England.  The U.S. population of the time was adequately fed, were much taller and had life expectancies of 45–50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 0-521-80878-2 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepr.org/meets/wkcn/1/1679/papers/Pamuk-van-Zanden-Chapter.pdf] Standards of Living 1700-1870&lt;/ref&gt;  (See also: [[British Agricultural Revolution]])

The gains in standards of living have been accomplished largely through increases in productivity.  In the U.S. the amount of personal consumption that could be bought with one hour of work was about $3.00 in 1900 and increased to about $22 by 1990, measured in 2010 dollars.&lt;ref name="Legergott1993"&gt;{{cite book |title= Pursuing Happiness: American Consumers in the Twentieth Century |last=Lebergott|first=Stanley |year=1993 |publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton, NJ |isbn= 0-691-04322-1 |pages=a:Adapted from Fig. 9.1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, a U. S. worker today earns more (in terms of buying power) working for ten minutes than subsistence workers, such as the English mill workers that [[Fredrick Engels]] wrote about in 1844, earned in a 12-hour day.

The '''proletariat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|l|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|t}} from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|proletarius}} "producing offspring") is the [[Social class|class]] of [[Wage labor|wage-earner]]s in an economic society whose only possession of significant material value is their [[labour-power]] (how much work they can do).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proletariat proletariat]. Accessed: 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A member of such a class is a '''proletarian'''.

In [[Marxist theory]], a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is for the proletariat, of the proletariat, and by the proletariat. On the Marxist view, this will endow the proletarian with the power to abolish the conditions that make a person a proletarian and, thus, build [[communism]].

== {{lang|la|Proletarii}} of the Roman Republic ==
{{See|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The {{lang|la|proletarii}} constituted a [[social class in ancient Rome|social class of Roman citizens]] owning little or no property. The origin of the name is presumably linked with the [[census]], which Roman authorities conducted every five years to produce a register of citizens and their property from which their military duties and voting privileges could be determined. For citizens with property valued 11,000 {{lang|la|[[as (Roman coin)|assēs]]}} or less, which was below the lowest census for military service, their children—{{lang|la|proles}} (from Latin {{lang|la|prōlēs}}, "offspring")—were listed instead of their property; hence, the name {{lang|la|proletarius}}, "the one who produces offspring". The only contribution of a {{lang|la|proletarius}} to the Roman society was seen in his ability to raise children, the future Roman citizens who can colonize new territories conquered by the [[Roman Republic]] and later by the [[Roman Empire]]. The citizens who had no property of significance were called {{lang|la|[[capite censi]]}} because they were "persons registered not as to their property...but simply as to their existence as living individuals, primarily as heads ({{lang|la|caput}}) of a family."&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1953) at 380; 657.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee]], especially in his ''[[A Study of History]]'', uses the word "proletariat" in this general sense of people without property or a stake in society. Toynbee focuses particularly on the generative spiritual life of the "internal proletariat" (those living within a given civil society). He also describes the "heroic" folk legends of the "external proletariat" (poorer groups living outside the borders of a civilization). Compare Toynbee, ''A Study of History'' (Oxford University 1934–1961), 12 volumes, in Volume V ''Disintegration of Civilizations, part one'' (1939) at 58–194 (internal proletariat), and at 194–337 (external proletariat).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Working man-obrero 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[manual labor]]er at work in [[Venezuela]]. Manual laborers are generally considered to be part of the proletariat.]]
Although included in one of the five support {{lang|la|[[centuria]]e}} of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} (English: [[Centuriate Assembly]]), {{lang|la|proletarii}} were largely deprived of their voting rights due to their low social status caused by their lack of "even the minimum property required for the lowest class"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (1953) at 351; 657 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt; and a class-based hierarchy of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}}. The late Roman historians, such as [[Livy]], not without some uncertainty, understood the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} to be one of three forms of popular assembly of early Rome composed of {{lang|la|centuriae}}, the voting units whose members represented a class of citizens according to the value of their property. This assembly, which usually met on the {{lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]|italic=no}} to discuss public policy issues, was also used as a means of designating military duties demanded of Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Livius ({{circa|59 BC}} – AD 17), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1, 43; the first five books translated by Aubrey de Sélincourt as Livy, ''The Early History of Rome'' (Penguin 1960, 1971) at 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; One of reconstructions of the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} features 18 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of cavalry, and 170 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of infantry divided into five classes by wealth, plus 5 {{lang|la|centuriae}} of support personnel called {{lang|la|[[adsidui]]}}. The top infantry class assembled with full arms and armor; the next two classes brought arms and armor, but less and lesser; the fourth class only spears; the fifth slings. In voting, the cavalry and top infantry class were enough to decide an issue; as voting started at the top, an issue might be decided before the lower classes voted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''The Constitution of the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University 1999) at 55–61, re the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last centuries of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–44 BC), the {{lang|la|Comitia Centuriata}} became impotent as a political body, which further eroded already minuscule political power the {{lang|la|proletarii}} might have had in the Roman society.

Following a series of wars the Roman Republic engaged since the closing of the [[Second Punic War]] (218–201 BC), such as the [[Jugurthine War]] and conflicts in Macedonia and Asia, the significant reduction in the number of Roman family farmers had resulted in the shortage of people whose property qualified them to perform the citizenry's [[political history of the Roman military|military duty to Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Theodor Mommsen]], {{lang|de|[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Römisches Geschichte]]|italic=yes}} (1854–1856), 3 volumes; translated as ''History of Rome'' (1862–1866), 4 volumes; reprint (The Free Press 1957) at vol. III: 48–55 (Mommsen's Bk. III, ch. XI toward end).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Marian reforms]] initiated in 107 BC by the Roman general [[Gaius Marius]] (157–86), the {{lang|la|proletarii}} became the backbone of the [[Roman army]].&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Scullard, ''Gracchi to Nero. A History of Rome from 133 BC to AD 68'' (London: Methuen 1959, 4th ed. 1976) at 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]], who studied [[Roman law]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Sidney Hook]], ''Marx and the Marxists'' (Princeton: Van Nostrand 1955) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''proletariat'' in his socio-political theory of [[Marxism]] to describe a [[working class]] unadulterated by [[private property]] and capable of a revolutionary action to topple [[capitalism]] in order to create [[classless society]]. Marx most likely encountered the term while studying the works of the liberal economist and historian {{lang|fr|[[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]|italic=no}}, who was the first to apply it to the working class created under capitalism, and whose writings were frequently cited by Marx.&lt;ref name="Ekins"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekins |first1=Paul |last2=Max-Neef |first2=Manfred |title=Real Life Economics |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |pages=91-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekelund Jr |first1=Robert B. |last2=Hébert |first2=Robert F. |title=A History of Economic Theory and Method: Fifth Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Waveland Press |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lutz |first1=Mark A. |title=Economics for the Common Good: Two Centuries of Economic Thought in the Humanist Tradition |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |pages=55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stedman Jones |first1=Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l’Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the proletariat is the [[social class]] that does not have ownership of the [[means of production]] and whose only means of subsistence is to sell their [[labor power]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Das Kapital, Kritik der politischen Ökonomie|trans-title=Capital: Critique of Political Economy|year=1887|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm|authorlink=Karl Marx|editor=Frederick Engels|accessdate=10 February 2013|chapter=Chapter Six: The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[wage]] or [[salary]]. Proletarians are wage-workers, while some refer to those who receive salaries as the ''salariat''. For [[Marx]], however, wage labor may involve getting a salary rather than a wage ''per se''. Marxism sees the proletariat and [[bourgeoisie]] (capitalist class) as occupying conflicting positions, since workers automatically wish their wages to be as high as possible, while owners and their proxies wish for wages (costs) to be as low as possible.

[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A 1911 ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' publication advocating industrial unionism based on a critique of capitalism. The proletariat "work for all" and "feed all".]]
In Marxist theory, the borders between the proletariat and some layers of the [[petite bourgeoisie]], who rely primarily but not exclusively on self-employment at an income no different from an ordinary wage or below it – and the [[lumpenproletariat]], who are not in legal employment – are not necessarily well defined. Intermediate positions are possible, where some wage-labor for an employer combines with self-employment. Marx makes a clear distinction between proletariat as salaried workers, which he sees as a progressive class, and [[Lumpenproletariat]], "rag-proletariat", the poorest and outcasts of the society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes, which he considers a retrograde class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat Lumpen proletariat –  Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=February 1848|publisher=Progress Publishers|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm|accessdate=10 February 2013|chapter=Bourgeois and Proletarians}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialism|Socialist]] parties have often struggled over the question of whether they should seek to organize and represent all the lower classes, or just the wage-earning proletariat.

According to Marxism, [[capitalism]] is a system based on the [[Exploitation of labor|exploitation]] of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. This exploitation takes place as follows: the workers, who own no [[means of production]] of their own, must use the means of production that are property of others in order to produce, and consequently earn, their living. Instead of hiring those means of production, they themselves get hired by capitalists and work for them, producing goods or services. These goods or services become the property of the capitalist, who sells them at the market.

One part of the wealth produced is used to pay the workers' wages (variable costs), another part to renew the means of production (constant costs) while the third part, [[surplus value]] is split between the capitalist's private takings (profit), and the money used to pay rents, taxes, interests, etc. Surplus value is the difference between the wealth that the proletariat produces through its work, and the wealth it consumes to survive and to provide labor to the capitalist companies.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. The Capital, volume 1, chapter 6. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the surplus value is used to renew or increase the means of production, either in quantity or quality (i.e., it is turned into [[Capital (economics)|capital]]), and is called capitalized surplus value.&lt;ref&gt;Luxemburg, Rosa. [[The Accumulation of Capital]]. Chapter 6, Enlarged Reproduction, http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1913/accumulation-capital/ch06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; What remains is consumed by the capitalist class.

The commodities that proletarians produce and capitalists sell are valued for the amount of [[labor (economics)|labor]] embodied in them. The same goes for the workers' [[labor power]] itself: it is valued, not for the amount of wealth it produces, but for the amount of labor necessary to produce and reproduce it. Thus the capitalists earn wealth from the labor of their employees, not as a function of their personal contribution to the productive process, which may even be null, but as a function of the juridical relation of property to the means of production. Marxists argue that new wealth is created through labor applied to [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [[Critique of the Gotha Programme]], I. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx argued that the proletariat would displace the capitalist system with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a [[communist]] society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. [[The Communist Manifesto]], part II, Proletarians and Communists http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prole drift==
Prole drift, short for proletarian drift, is the tendency in advanced industrialized societies for everything inexorably to become proletarianized, or to become commonplace and commodified. This trend is attributed to mass production, mass selling, mass communication and mass education. Examples include best-seller lists, films and music that must appeal to the masses, and shopping malls.&lt;ref name="class"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fussell|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Fussell|title=Class, A Guide Through the American Status System|publisher=Ballantine|date=October 1992|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-31816-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPbF1kuayJYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''purchase order request''' or '''purchase requisition''' is a request sent internally within a company to obtain purchased goods and services, including [[Inventory|stock]]. The request is a document which tells the [[purchasing department]] or manager exactly what items and services are requested, the quantity, source and associated costs.

A Purchase Requisition Form (PRF) is filled out prior to purchasing goods as a form of tangible authorisation. Purchase request forms are often used in smaller business who do not have a computer-based system. However, many computer (included web-based solution) systems are available on the market that can facilitate the capture of purchase request information. [[Purchase order]] requests can also be passed to the purchasing department via a [[management information system]].

A PRF may contain budget and purchase values to make the individual aware of the annual and remaining budget before a purchase is made. Such a system is there to guarantee that goods and services are purchased with the consent of the line manager and that a sufficient budget is available.

'''Re-exportation''', also called '''entrepot trade''', may occur when one member of a [[free trade agreement]] charges lower [[tariff|tariffs]] to external nations to win trade, and then re-exports the same product to another partner in the trade agreement, but tariff-free. Re-exportation can be used to avoid sanctions by other nations. 

== Definition of re-export ==
Re-exports consist of foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported, from the free circulation area, premises for inward processing or industrial free zones, directly to the rest of the world and from premises for customs warehousing or commercial free zones, to the rest of the world.

When dealing with trade data, it is essential to subtract re-exports from normal exports to arrive at the final value of exports.  This is necessary because re-exports do not undergo any value-added processes, so cannot be counted towards a nation's exports.

==Examples==
For example, the [[United Arab Emirates]] may have engaged in re-exportation of goods to [[Iran]] as a way for Iran to avoid U.S. [[trade sanctions]] against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/United-Arab-Emirates.html United Arab Emirates]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus re-exportation involves export without further processing or transformation of a good that has been imported. In contrast, [[Finland]] imported crude oil from the [[Soviet Union]] as part of bilateral trade between these two countries and refined the oil for export to other Western European countries, while the Soviet Union did not intend to sell oil to these capitalist countries, but this was not re-exportation because the crude oil was refined before selling.
[[Dubai]] has emerged as the major re-export center for the entire [[Middle East]] region.

'''Redshift''' is a techno-economic theory suggesting hypersegmentation{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} of [[information technology]] markets based on whether individual computing needs are over or under-served by [[Moore's law]], which predicts the doubling of computing transistors (and therefore roughly computing power) every two years.  The theory,
proposed and named by [[New Enterprise Associates]] partner and former [[Sun Microsystems]] CTO [[Greg Papadopoulos]], categorized a series of high growth markets (redshifting) while predicting slower GDP-driven growth in traditional computing markets (blueshifting). Papadopoulos predicted the result will be a fundamental redesign of components comprising computing systems.

==Hypergrowth market segments (redshifting)==
According to the Redshift theory, applications "redshift" when they grow dramatically faster than Moore's Law allows, growing quickly in their absolute number of systems.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"&gt;Greg Papadopoulos: Sun Analyst Summit 2007, http://sun.feedroom.com/linking/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=FEEDROOM178646&amp;hl=false&lt;/ref&gt;  In these markets, customers are running out of datacenter real-estate, power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, June 14, 2006: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ex=1307937600&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dell]] Senior Vice President Brad Anderson, “Businesses requiring [[hyperscale]] computing environments – where infrastructure deployments are measured by up to millions of servers, storage and networking equipment – are changing the way they approach IT.”&lt;ref&gt;Dell Press Release: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_27_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&lt;/ref&gt;

While various Redshift proponents offer minor alterations on the original presentation, “Redshifting” generally includes:&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

=== ΣBW (Sum-of-[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]) ===
These are companies that drive heavy [[Internet]] traffic.  This includes popular web-portals like [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[AOL]] and [[MSN]].  It also includes [[Telecommunications service provider|telecoms]], multimedia, television over IP, online games like [[World of Warcraft]] and others.{{which|date=November 2010}}  This segment has been enabled by widespread availability of high-bandwidth Internet connections to consumers through a [[DSL]] or [[cable modem]]. A simple way to understand this market is that for every [[byte]] of content served to a PC, mobile phone or other device over a network, there must exist computing systems to send it over the network.

=== [[High performance computing]] (HPC) ===
These are companies that do complex simulations that involve (for example) weather, stock markets or drug-design simulations.  This is a generally elastic market because businesses frequently spend every "available" dollar budgeted for IT. A common anecdote claims that cutting the cost of computing by half causes customers in this segment to buy at least twice as much, because each marginal IT dollar spent contributes to business advantage.

=== *prise (or "Star-prise") ===
These are companies that aggregate traditional computing applications and offer them as services, typically in the form of [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]].  For example, companies that deploy [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] are over-served by Moore's Law, but companies that aggregate CRM functions and offer them as a service, such as [[Salesforce.com]], grow faster than Moore's Law.

=== The eBay crisis ===
A prime example of redshift was a crisis at [[eBay]].  In 1999 eBay suffered a database crisis when a single [[Oracle Database]] running on the fastest [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] machine available (these tracking Moore's law in this period) was not enough to cope with eBay's growth.  The solution was to massively parallelise their system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/youve-already-had-a-multicore-crisis-and-just-didnt-realize-it/ You’ve Already Had a Multicore Crisis and Just Didn’t Realize It!] (Bob Warfield, ''SmoothSpan Blog'', 2007-08-30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shoup and Dan Pritchett. [http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf "The eBay Architecture: Striking a balance between site stability, feature velocity, performance, and cost."] SD Forum 2006 proceedings, November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional computing markets (blueshifting)==
Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets, such as those serving [[enterprise resource planning]] or [[customer relationship management]] applications, have reached relative saturation in industrialized nations.  Thereafter, proponents argued further market growth will closely follow [[gross domestic product]] growth, which typically remains under 10% for most countries annually. Given that Moore's Law continues to predict accurately the rate of computing transistor growth, which roughly translates into computing power doubling every two years, the Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets will ultimately contract as a percentage of computing expenditures over time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

Functionally, this means “Blueshifting” customers can satisfy computing requirement growth by swapping in faster processors without increasing the absolute number of computing systems.

==Consequences and industry commentary==
Papadopoulos argued that while traditional computing markets remain the dominant source of revenue through the late 2000s, a shift to hypergrowth markets will inevitably occur.  When that shift occurs, he argued computing (but not computers) will become a utility, and differentiation in
the IT market will be based upon a company's ability to deliver computing at massive scale, efficiently and with predictable service levels, much like electricity at that time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

If computing is to be delivered as a utility, [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] suggested Papadopoulos' vision compares with [[Microsoft]] researcher Jim Hamilton, who both agree that computing is most efficiently generated in [[shipping containers]]&lt;!-- Makes no sense --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rough Type (Nicholas Carr's blog): http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/the_future_of_c.php and http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/showdown_in_the_1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts are also beginning to quantify Redshifting and Blueshifting markets.  According to [[International Data Corporation]] vice president Matthew Eastwood, "IDC believes that the IT market is in a period of hyper segmentation... This a class of customers that is Moore's law driven and as price performance gains continue, IDC believes that these organizations will accelerate their consumption of IT infrastructure.”&lt;ref&gt;IDC Link: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcUS20623507&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
Key portions of Papadopoulos' theory were first presented by Sun Microsystems CEO [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]] in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Blackbox Press Conference: http://sun.feedroom.com/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=73d774789da2b024c111f8cfc7948af6d1577827&amp;rf=bm&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos later gave a full presentation on Redshift to Sun's annual Analyst Summit&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt; in February 2007. The term [[Redshift]] refers to what happens when electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light, moves away from an observer.  Papadopoulos chose this term to reflect growth markets because redshift helped cosmologists explain the expansion of the universe.

Papadopoulos originally depicted traditional IT markets as green to represent their revenue base, but later changed them to “blueshift,” which occurs when a light source moves toward an observer, similar to what would happen during a contraction of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, April 12, 2007: http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9013563&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7466">The '''Research and Development Expenditure Credit''' (RDEC), introduced in 2013, is a [[UK]] [[tax]] incentive designed to encourage large companies to invest in [[R&amp;D]] in the UK. Companies can reduce their [[tax bill]] or claim payable cash credits as a proportion of their R&amp;D expenditure.

The initiative builds on the existing R&amp;D Tax Credit scheme which has been in operation for large companies since 2002 and is one of a number of [[Technology Tax Relief | technology tax relief]] schemes introduced by successive UK Governments.  Originally referred to as to as "Above the Line R&amp;D Tax Relief", because the payable credit for large companies is now shown above the tax line and can effectively be accounted for as income in the [[profit and loss statement]], RDEC is now the common terminology used for the scheme.

==History==
R&amp;D tax relief is designed to incentivise [[investment]] in R&amp;D. The scheme was introduced in 2000 for [[small and medium enterprises]], with a separate scheme for large companies launched in 2002.

Any company carrying out R&amp;D is likely to qualify for the relief. The definitions of eligible R&amp;D and costs are reasonably broad, and eligible R&amp;D can be found in completely unexpected areas.

Large companies could previously only offset the credit against [[UK corporation tax|corporation tax]] liabilities. This meant large businesses running R&amp;D [[cost centre (business)|cost centres]] in the UK, but with [[profit centre]]s outside the UK, were unable to benefit from the relief. It also meant the credit was largely invisible to R&amp;D decision-makers because it was embedded in the tax computation.

As a result of lobbying from industry, the government launched a consultation in the [[2012 United Kingdom budget|2012 Budget]] on changes to the Large Company R&amp;D Tax Relief scheme. In the [[2013 United Kingdom budget|March 2013 Budget]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] confirmed the new R&amp;D Expenditure Credit for large companies with a payable rate of 10 per cent for R&amp;D expenditure incurred after 1 April 2013 (an increase on the original proposal of a 9.1 per cent payable credit).

This credit is designed to make R&amp;D relief more visible to those making R&amp;D budgeting and investment decisions. It should also provide better cash flow for companies with no corporation tax liability, and thus should promote the UK as the preferred location for multi-national corporations deciding where to site their R&amp;D operations. It will also help to improve corporate earnings because it now appears above the tax line.

==Overview==
The 10 per cent payable credit rate equates to a net benefit post-tax of 7.7 per cent of eligible expenditure for large companies (at 23 per cent corporation tax from April 2013). The definitions of large and small company size are driven by the [[European Union|EU]] classifications (and adjusted for UK R&amp;D Tax Credit purposes) including revenues, number of employees and balance sheet assets.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his 2014 Autumn Statement that the taxable credit available to companies claiming under the RDEC regime has been increased from 10% to 11% providing an after tax benefit of 8.8% of the qualifying R&amp;D expenditure incurred after April 2015. &lt;ref&gt;2014 Autumn Statement [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382327/44695_Accessible.pdf"2014 Autumn Statement"] Retrieved 01 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing large company superdeduction scheme will continue to run in parallel with the RDEC until April 2016, allowing a large company to claim the payable credit above the line ''or'' to deduct an additional 30 per cent of its eligible R&amp;D costs in its tax computation.

The steady state cost of the RDEC, after the initial phasing-in period, is forecast to be approximately £265 million per annum (£170 million per the original proposal, plus £95 million for the increase in the payable rate to 10 per cent)&lt;ref&gt;2012 and 2013 Budget&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by [[HM Treasury]].

==How it works==
In all respects, the RDEC will work like the existing R&amp;D Tax Credit. The nature of the tax relief has not changed, only the method of delivery of the tax relief.

There are various principles which need to be respected. Eligible R&amp;D must be:
*seeking to achieve an advance in science or technology
*subject to scientific or technological uncertainty
*conducted in a systematic and thorough fashion

Eligible costs include staffing costs, consumable costs, software, subcontractors and research contributions. Critically these costs must be mapped to the eligible activities.

==How to claim==
The claim process is as follows:
*assess qualifying R&amp;D activity
*calculate qualifying R&amp;D expenditure
*submit the figures in the CT600 [[tax return]]
[[HMRC]] recommend adequate record-keeping of eligible activities and eligible costs to provide a coherent audit trail in case of an enquiry by HMRC.

==Details in the legislation to look out for==
*eligible R&amp;D activity
*eligible R&amp;D costs

===Techfast Holdings===
In May 2014, Wong made an offer of to acquire Techfast Holdings. The offer was submitted on the same day that Techfast held its AGM raising speculation that the offer may turn hostile. Wong had previously built a 14.45% stake in the company. TechFast noted its listing status is expected to be maintained should Wong's offer be accepted.&lt;ref name="Rakyatpost160514"&gt;[http://www.therakyatpost.com/business/2014/05/16/ricky-wong-launches-takeover-techfast/ "Ricky Wong launches takeover of TechFast"]. ''RakyatPost'', 16 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This offer has been perceived as a takeover, an attempt by Wong to control three public-listed companies.&lt;ref name="BornePost170514"&gt;[http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/05/17/techfast-gets-takeover-notice-at-26-sen-per-share/ "Techfast gets takeover notice at 26 cents per share"].

''MalaysianReserve'', 17 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Techfast Holdings's conditional voluntary takeover offer by Wong to acquire all the remaining shares in the company could only gather 22.48% of the share capital in Techfast with the offer tabled. The offer failed to meet the acceptance conditions within the proposed timeline.&lt;ref name="MalaysianReserve "&gt;[http://www.nama.com.my/PRINT_NEWS/2014/06/30/20140630_N60_RSV_CR_2_BW_WONG~SKS~TAKEOVER~OFFER~FOR~TECHFAST~FAILS.JPG "Wong SK's Takeover Offer for Techfast Fails "] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144652/http://www.nama.com.my/PRINT_NEWS/2014/06/30/20140630_N60_RSV_CR_2_BW_WONG~SKS~TAKEOVER~OFFER~FOR~TECHFAST~FAILS.JPG |date=14 July 2014 }}. ''MalaysianReserve'', 28 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the failed takeover by Wong in May 2014, Wong through his personal investment company Wong SK Holdings Sdn Bhd, has quietly emerged as the second largest shareholder of Techfast Holdings bearing 24,518,700 shares which equivalent to 16% of the share capital.

According to its Annual Report 2014, the largest shareholder is AVB Ventures Sdn Bhd which is controlled by its Managing Director Mr. Yap Yoon Seng, bearing 18.42% of its share capital. It remain to be seen that Wong emergence as the second largest shareholder of Techfast Holdings will again turn hostile to the incumbent Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="Techfast 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcements/4719553|title=Annual Report TECHFAST HOLDINGS BERHAD|accessdate=13 August 2015 |date=28 April 2015 |publisher=''[[Bursa Malaysia]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Techfast 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcements/4825885|title=Changes in Sub.

He lives freely in [[Moscow]], and has three children. He is most closely associated with the [[Solntsevskaya Bratva]] crime group.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Mogilevich was born in 1946 to a [[History of the Jews in Kiev|Jewish]] family in [[Kiev]]'s [[Podil|Podol]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Alan A.; Weaver, Constance A. (2004) ''All Is Clouded by Desire: Global Banking, Money Laundering, and International Organized Crime''. Greenwood Publishing Group: Westport. {{ISBN|0-275-98330-7}} p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  

His first significant fortune derived from scamming fellow Russian Jews eager to emigrate to countries including the United States and Israel; Mogilevich made deals to buy their assets, sell them for fair market value, and forward the proceeds. Instead he simply sold the assets and pocketed the proceeds. He served two terms in prison, of 3 and 4 years, for currency-dealing offenses.&lt;ref name="Friedman1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-05-26/news/the-most-dangerous-mobster-in-the-world/full/|title=The Most Dangerous Mobster in the World|author=Robert I. Friedman|date=22 January 2008|work=villagevoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1980s, according to the FBI, Mogilevich was the key money-laundering contact for the [[Solntsevskaya Bratva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate |title=Trump's Russian Laundromat; How to use Trump Tower and other luxury high-rises to clean dirty money, run an international crime syndicate, and propel a failed real estate developer into the White House. |author=[[Craig Unger]] |date=July 13, 2017 |website=Newrepublic.com |access-date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
In early 1991, Mogilevich moved to Hungary and married his Hungarian girlfriend Katalin Papp. He had three children with her, and obtained a Hungarian passport. Living in a fortified villa outside [[Budapest]], he continued to invest in a wide array of enterprises, including buying a local armament factory, "Army Co-Op," which produced anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.budapestsun.com/full_story.asp?ArticleID=%7B6493A16274FB46438BE680B4A19AEE86%7D&amp;From=News| title = Article about activities in Hungary| accessdate = October 7, 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065332/http://www.budapestsun.com/full_story.asp?ArticleID=%7B6493A16274FB46438BE680B4A19AEE86%7D&amp;From=News| archivedate = March 2, 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the Mogilevich group obtained control over [[Inkombank]], one of the largest private banks in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://russianlaw.org/Morgent1.htm| title = New York court document, 2000| accessdate = October 7, 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701095350/http://russianlaw.org/Morgent1.htm| archivedate = July 1, 2007| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a secret deal with bank chairman [[Vladimir Vinogradov]], getting direct access to the world financial system. The bank collapsed in 1998 under suspicions of money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://moscowtelegraph.com/mt050801.htm | title = Moscow Telegraph on investigation of Inkombank management |publisher=Moscow Telegraph| accessdate = October 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech raid ===
In May 1995, a meeting in [[Prague]] between Mogilevich and [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]], head of the [[Solntsevskaya bratva|Solntsevo group]], was raided by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] police. The occasion was a birthday party for one of the deputy Solntsevo mafiosi. Two hundred partygoers (including dozens of [[prostitute]]s) in the restaurant "U Holubů", owned by Mogilevich, were detained and 30 expelled from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mvcr.cz/2003/casopisy/pol/0409/rusko_info.html| title = Journal of the Czech ministry of interior, article about Russian mafias| accessdate = 2006-10-07| language = Czech| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070114193653/http://www.mvcr.cz/2003/casopisy/pol/0409/rusko_info.html| archivedate = 2007-01-14| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police had been tipped off that the Solntsevo group intended to execute Mogilevich at the party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.volny.cz/vyber_cr/vyber2/pribeh_muze.html| title = Biography of Mogilevich| work = [[Lidové Noviny]]| accessdate = 2006-10-07| language = Czech| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041109154007/http://www.volny.cz/vyber_cr/vyber2/pribeh_muze.html| archivedate = 2004-11-09| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; over a disputed payment of $5 million. But Mogilevich never showed up and it is believed that a senior figure in the Czech police, working with the [[Russian mafia]], had warned him.&lt;ref&gt;Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, the Czech Interior Ministry imposed a 10-year entry ban on Mogilevich, while the Hungarian government declared him ''[[persona non grata]]'' and the British barred his entry into the UK, declaring him "one of the most dangerous men in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pp 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toronto exchange ===
In 1997 and 1998, the presence of Mogilevich, Mikhailov and others associated with the [[Russian Mafia]] behind a public company trading on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] (TSX), YBM Magnex International Inc., was exposed by Canadian journalists. On May 13, 1998, dozens of agents for the FBI and several other U.S. government agencies raided YBM's headquarters in [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania]]. Shares in the public company, which had been valued at $1 billion on the TSX, became worthless overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/panorama/transcripts/transcript_06_12_99.txt | title = BBC Panorama's "The Billion Dollar Don"| accessdate = 2007-09-15 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Money laundering and tax evasion ===
Until 1998, Inkombank and [[Bank Menatep]] participated in a US$10 billion [[money laundering]] scheme through the [[Bank of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3516.html##4|title=Overview of the money laundering schemes|accessdate=October 7, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005054117/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3516.html|archivedate=October 5, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 5, 1999: "A Scheme for Ducking Taxes May Be a Key In Russia Money Probe"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financialservices.house.gov/banking/92299ren.htm |title=Testimony of Thomas Renyi, CEO of the bank, 1999|accessdate=October 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929094324/http://financialservices.house.gov/banking/92299ren.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russianlaw.org/bridge3.htm|title=Senior manager of BoNY indicted, 2001|accessdate=2006-10-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814044808/http://russianlaw.org/bridge3.htm|archivedate=2007-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogilevich was also suspected of participation in large-scale tax fraud, where untaxed heating oil was sold as highly taxed car fuel – one of the greatest scandals that broke around 1990–1991.

Estimates are that up to one-third of fuels sold went through this scheme, resulting in massive tax losses for various countries of [[Central Europe]] (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.volny.cz/noviny/zdomova/clanek/~volny/IDC/124259/volby-by-nyni-vyhrala-cssd.html|title=Overview of fuels scandal|work=[[Lidové Noviny]]|accessdate=2006-10-07|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Czech Republic the scandal is estimated to have cost the taxpayers around 100 billion CZK (≈US$5 billion)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/40954-podvody-s-lto-zrejme-prisly-stat-na-100-miliard.html Podvody s LTO zřejmě přišly stát na 100 miliard] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; and involved, besides others, murders and assassination attempt of a journalist writing about the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epravo.cz/top/clanky/nelegalni-obchody-s-lto-prinesly-danove-uniky-i-vrazdy-28351.html?mail Nelegální obchody s LTO přinesly daňové úniky i vraždy] (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] put Mogilevich on the "Wanted List" for participation in the scheme to defraud investors in Canadian company YBM Magnex International Inc. Frustrated by their previous unsuccessful efforts to charge him for [[arms trafficking]] and [[prostitution]], they had now settled on the large-scale fraud charges as their best hope of running him to ground. He was, however, considered to be the most powerful Russian mobster alive.&lt;ref name="alive"&gt;Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pg 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 interview, former Clinton administration anti-organized-crime czar Jon Winer said: "I can tell you that Semion Mogilevich is as serious an organized criminal as I have ever encountered and I am confident that he is responsible for [[contract killing]]s."&lt;ref name="alive" /&gt;

Mogilevich was arrested in Moscow on January 24, 2008, for suspected [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Guy Faulconbridge |date=January 25, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSL2537376820080125 |publisher=Reuters |title=Russia detains crime boss wanted by FBI |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3253243.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bail was placed, and he was released on July 24, 2009. On his release, the Russian interior ministry stated that he was released because the charges against him "are not of a particularly grave nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090727/155636705.html|title=Suspects in Arbat Prestige case released with travel ban|date=27 July 2009|work=rian.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE56Q0JT20090727 Russia frees crime boss wanted by U.S.], [[Reuters]] (July 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ill|Ivan Fursin|uk|Фурсін Іван Геннадійович}} has been closely linked to Mogilevich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-reveals-new-manafort-link-to-organized-crime |title=Mueller Reveals New Manafort Link to Organized Crime |author=Betsy Woodruff |date=2 November 2017 |website=[[TheDailyBeast.com]] |access-date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FBI Ten Most Wanted list ===
On October 22, 2009, he was named by the FBI as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 2000s|494th fugitive to be placed]] on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/oct09/mogilevich_102109.html |title=FBI — New Top Ten - Global Con Artist |work=FBI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008000445/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/oct09/mogilevich_102109.html |archivedate=2010-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 he was removed from the list. The FBI indicated he no longer met list criteria, for reasons relating to living in a country with which the United States does not maintain an [[Extradition#Extradition treaties or agreements|extradition treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Babay, Emily (December 17, 2015) [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20151218_Philly_fugitive_bumped_off_FBI__Most_Wanted__list.html Philly fugitive bumped off FBI 'Most Wanted' list] ''Philadelphia Inquirer''. Retrieved January 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the warrants issued against him, he still lives freely in Moscow, according to the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/semion-mogilevich/view|title=FBI — SEMION MOGILEVICH|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to Mogilevich himself, government law enforcement agencies from throughout the world had by then been trying to prosecute him for over 10 years. But he had, in the words of one journalist, "a knack for never being in the wrong place at the wrong time".&lt;ref&gt;Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pg 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Mogilevich and his associate Mikhailov ceased to travel to the west in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="alive" /&gt;

The '''Small Business Development Corporation''' (SBDC) is an independent statutory authority, established in 1984&lt;ref&gt;The West Australian, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; under the Small Business Development Corporation Act 1983 by the [[Government of Western Australia]].

The primary role of the SBDC is to encourage, promote, facilitate and assist the establishment, growth and development of small business in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by providing education and skill development programs, and advice and guidance to small business owners on the establishment, development and expansion of their businesses.

The SBDC communicates with the small business sector directly as well as liaising with industry and business associations to exchange information and provide support and assistance to their members. The SBDC also provides advice and support to Western Australia's Minister for Small Business on matters impacting the sector, including the effect of government policy and legislation on small business. Through these avenues, the SBDC helps to raise public awareness of the importance of small business to the economy and the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the SBDC investigates any matters impacting small businesses, and advises small business on the means of obtaining financial assistance. The SBDC also maintains an information centre with a comprehensive range of business resources and provides a comprehensive range of business workshops for small business operators, existing and potential.

The current Minister for Small Business in Western Australia is Paul Papalia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/memblist.nsf/WAllMembersFlat/Papalia,+Paul?opendocument&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[McGowan Ministry]].

'''Sosthenes Behn''' (January 30, 1884 – June 6, 1957) was an American businessman widely known for founding [[ITT Corporation|ITT]]. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Sosthenes Behn was born in the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], then part of the [[Danish West Indies]]. His ancestry was [[Danes|Danish]] on his paternal side, and [[French people|French]] on his maternal side.

Behn served in the [[United States Army]] and was commissioned a Captain, Signal Corps, on June 19, 1917. He later achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, having served with distinction during World War I. Behn served with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France until February 1919. He was given command of the 232nd Field Signal Battalion, [[Château-Thierry]], [[Saint-Mihiel]], Argonne. In recognition of his meritorious service during the war he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM).

===Puerto Rico Telephone Company and ITT===
After his return from military service, Colonel Behn co-founded the [[Puerto Rico Telephone Company]] which eventually spawned ITT&lt;ref&gt;Morales Cortés, Ramón. [http://www.vii.org/papers/puer.htm Telecommunications in Puerto Rico] (paper). New York, USA: ''Virtual Institute of Information''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction ITT was granted the [[monopoly]] of telephone service in [[Spain]] ([[Telefónica|Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España]]) in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;García-Algarra, Javier: [https://www.scribd.com/doc/53101811/The-American-Influence-in-Telefonica%E2%80%99s-Public-Relations-Strategyduring-the-20%E2%80%99s-and-30%E2%80%99s "The American influence in Telefónica's public relations strategy during the 20s and 30s"], IEEE HISTELCON 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and purchased the international division of [[Western Electric]].

According to Anthony Sampson's book  ''[[The Sovereign State of ITT]]'', one of the first American businessmen Hitler received after taking power in 1933 was Sosthenes Behn, then the CEO of ITT, and his German representative, Henry Mann. [[Antony C. Sutton]], in his book ''Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler'', makes the claim that ITT subsidiaries made cash payments to [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leader [[Heinrich Himmler]].

ITT, through its subsidiary [[C. Lorenz AG]] of [[Berlin]], owned 25% of [[Focke-Wulf]], the German aircraft manufacturer, builder of some of the most successful [[Luftwaffe#Interwar period|Luftwaffe]] [[fighter aircraft]]. In addition, Sutton’s book uncovers that ITT owned Dr. Erich F. Huth GmbH (Signalbau Huth, Berlin), which made [[radio]] and [[radar]] parts that were used in equipment going to the [[Wehrmacht]].

Behn, along with his brother, [[Hernan Behn|Hernan]], built the ''Two Brothers Bridge'' &amp;mdash;''Puente Dos Hermanos'' in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]&amp;mdash; in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. The bridge links the districts of [[Condado, Puerto Rico|Condado]] and [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico|Old San Juan]].

Colonel Behn and [[Ludwig Roselius]], founder of the company [[KAFFEE HAG]], owned 74% of German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf after the company reconstitution in 1936. [[Barbara Goette]] referred to Colonel Behn as a huge global player.&lt;ref&gt;Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell sbpra, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-62516-346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sosthenes Behn met with Hitler on 3/8/1933 and in 1936 there was a high-level meeting in Berlin where it was proposed that Behn through ITT gain 50% of [[Focke-Wulf]] and oust [[Café HAG]] completely, but after Barbara Goette intervened with Hitler, Ludwig Roselius' life was spared and he became majority shareholder in Focke-Wulf with 46% and a massive capital injection occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Military Government US Zone in Post-War Germany 1946-1949, declassified per Executive Order 12958, Section 3.5 NND Project Number: NND 775057 by: NND Date: 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the war, all of ITT's German holdings were put under Nazi control. These included a minority share in airplane manufacturer Focke-Wulf, which ITT had acquired through its contacts with German financier [[Kurt Baron von Schröder]]. After the end of the war, the US authorities returned these assets to their rightful US owner.

Behn appointed [[Gerhard Westrick]] to the board of Focke-Wulf after the reconstitution in 1936. He was ITT's corporation chairman in Germany. After Pearl Harbour, at meetings with Baron Kurt von Schröder and Behn in Switzerland, Westrick nervously admitted he had run into a problem. Wilhelm Ohnesorge, the elderly minister in charge of post offices, who was one of the first fifty Nazi party members, was strongly opposed to ITT's German companies continuing to function under New York management in time of war. Behn told Westrick to use Schröder and the protection of the Gestapo against Ohnesorge. In return, Behn guaranteed that ITT would substantially increase its payments to the Gestapo through the Circle of Friends. A special board of trustees was set up by the Nazis to cooperate with Behn and his thirty thousand staff in Occupied Europe. Ohnesorge savagely fought these arrangements and tried to obtain the support of Himmler. However, Schröder had Himmler's ear, and so, of course did his close friend and associate Walter Schellenberg. Ohnesorge appealed directly to Hitler and condemned Westrick as an American sympathiser. However, Hitler realized the importance of ITT to the German economy and proved supportive of Behn.

In 1943, ITT became majority shareholder of Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH with 29% due to Ludwig Roselius' Kaffee HAG share falling to 27% after he died on May 15.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Pfliegensdörfer; Volker Bergmann; Willi Elmers; Manfred Fittkau; Michael Jung; Michael Wolf; Wolfgang Günther.

===Death===
Behn died on 6 June 1957.

'''The FCPA Blog''' is an international website for commentary and news about anti-corruption compliance and enforcement founded by [[Richard L. Cassin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/rupert-murdoch-not-fit-to-run-a-major-company-says-a-british-panel/2012/05/01/gIQApey9tT_story.html The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/regulation/story/2012-05-02/foreign-bribes-in-corporate-world/54706232/1 USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's primary focus is compliance with and enforcement of the United States [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/business/11tyson.html The New York Times - Tyson Settles U.S. Charges of Bribery]&lt;/ref&gt; Topics covered by posts have included developments and trends in international anti-corruption enforcement, relevant [[international treaties]] and conventions, correlations between corruption and national and global [[security]], other criminal activity, and economic development and [[poverty]]. Commentary on the FCPA Blog has dealt with the effects of corruption on government institutions, individuals, and society in general, and how government and transnational anti-corruption enforcement policies impact [[international relations]] and global investment practices.

==History==

The FCPA Blog has also been cited in academic research papers&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1629483 Discovering Secrets: Act of State Defenses to Bribery Cases By Elizabeth Spahn]&lt;/ref&gt; published in the United States and France.

'''''The Predators' Ball: The Inside Story of Drexel Burnham and the Rise of the Junk Bond Raiders''''', by ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' writer [[Connie Bruck]], largely recounts the rise of [[Michael Milken]], his firm [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], and the [[leveraged buyout]] boom they helped to fuel in the 1980s.

==Overview==
As the book was published at the apex of the leveraged buyout boom, it was subsequently updated to also address the impending collapse of Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken's conviction on various securities and reporting violations.

The title of the book is a reference to an event that Drexel Burnham hosted annually.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/18/business/junk-bond-conferees-put-accent-on-quality.html Junk Bond Conferences Put Accent on Quality].

TIME, Mar. 21, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the participants in the Predator's Ball were an array of [[private equity]] investors, [[corporate raider]]s such as [[Ron Perelman]] and [[Carl Icahn]] as well as [[institutional investor]]s in [[high-yield bond]]s and management teams from companies that either had been or would be the targets of leveraged buyouts.

[[Michael Milken]] reportedly offered to pay the author for all of the copies of the book that would have been sold in exchange for stopping her work on ''Predators' Ball''.&lt;ref name=stop /&gt;

The '''Wadia family''' is a [[Parsi]] family from [[Surat, India]] currently based in [[Mumbai, India]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/The%20Wadias%20of%20India.htm|title=The Wadias of India|date=28 May 2018|publisher=Vohuman, A Zoroastrian Educational Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family is related to the politically prominent [[Jinnah family]]—[[Neville Wadia]] was married to [[Dina Jinnah]]—the only child of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Rattanbai Petit]].&lt;ref name="Dawn"/&gt; The present head of the house is [[Nusli Wadia]], son of Neville and Dina, who runs the [[Wadia Group]] of companies.  The Wadia family has three main branches: textiles, shipping, and jewelry.  Descendants from each of these branches have made significant contributions to their fields, to their communities, to India, and to the global economy; they have been industrialists, government leaders, medical doctors, and scholars.

==History==
[[Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia]] advanced the Wadia shipbuilding dynasty in 1736, when he obtained a contract from the [[British East India Company]] for building docks and ships in Bombay (present-day [[Mumbai]]). Although the Wadias would eventually come to be considered a Bombay family, many of them remained in Surat, where one branch of the family established a [[ship breaking]] yard (where ships are dismantled) that remains one of the largest of its kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/The%20Wadias%20of%20India.htm|title=The Wadias of India|date=28 May 2018|publisher=Vohuman, A Zoroastrian Educational Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem whose words would become the lyrics of [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], the [[national anthem]] of the [[United States]], were written in 1812 on board a Wadia-built British [[Royal Navy]] ship, {{HMS|Minden}} by [[Francis Scott Key]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/american-anthem-written-on-made-in-india-ship-hms-minden|title=The US National Anthem Was Written Aboard This Made-In-India Ship|date=5 April 2017|publisher=The Quint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1840s, the family was one of the leading forces in the Indian shipbuilding industry. At that time they had built over a hundred warships for [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and had trading networks around the world.

The prominent women of the Wadia family, including Motlibai Maneckji Wadia, Jerbai Nusserwanji Wadia, and Lady Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir, were known for their philanthropy in providing financial support to [[Zoroastrian]] temples, establishing schools and hospitals, and supporting the arts in the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/The%20Wadias%20of%20India.htm|title=The Wadias of India|date=28 May 2018|publisher=Vohuman, A Zoroastrian Educational Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Neville Wadia]] continued the philanthropic tradition of his family by continuing to establish hospitals and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryneville-wadia-1308408.html|title=Obituary: Neville Wadia|date=6 August 1996| first=Kuldip | last=Singh | newspaper=The Independent | accessdate=10 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wadia family has endowed [[Nowrosjee Wadia College]] in Pune. Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia's great grandsons, [[JBH Wadia]] and [[Homi Wadia]] founded [[Wadia Movietone]] in 1933, which had its studios at Lovji Castle (Lovejee Castle) in [[Chembur]], [[Mumbai, India]]. The company has a ship as its logo, honoring their family legacy.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite web | title = Surat's Wadias created Fearless Nadia | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Surats-Wadias-created-Fearless-Nadia/articleshow/6668162.cms?referral=PM# |date=2 Oct 2010| accessdate = 2014-09-18 | publisher = The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family is related to [[Pakistan]]'s politically prominent [[Jinnah family]], through [[Neville Wadia]], who was married to [[Dina Jinnah]] from 1938 to 1943, and had two children together, Diana and [[Nusli Wadia]]. Dina was the daughter of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Rattanbai Petit]], the former is the founder of [[Pakistan]], while the later was the daughter of [[Tata family#Prominent members|Sylla Tata]] and [[Petit baronets|Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]].&lt;ref name="Wadia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C06%5C30%5Cstory_30-6-2009_pg7_32 |title=Aslam Jinnah's claim of being Quaid's family disputed |date=30 June 2009 |work=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |first=Amar |last=Guriro |accessdate=11 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 November 2017|url=https://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2017/11/dina-wadia-said-last-meeting-jinnah/|title=Dina Wadia’s last meeting with Quaid-e-Azam–in her own words|agency=PTI|work=Samaa|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/510759/fact-file-jinnahaes-family|title=Fact file: Jinnah's family|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=26 December 2009|accessdate=1 November 2017|quote=Dina and Neville lived in Mumbai and had two children, a boy and a girl, before the couple divorced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Dina took divorce from Neville in 1943, she remained a prominent member of the Wadia family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 November 2017|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/166321-dina-wadia-and-her-darling-papa|title=Dina Wadia and her darling papa|agency=PTI|work=[[Geo News]]|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1551486/6-remembering-dina/|title=Remembering Dina|date=17 November 2017|website=Tribune.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zablon Simintov''' (born 1959) is an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] carpet trader and restaurateur who is believed to be the last remaining [[Jews|Jew]] living in Afghanistan. He is also the caretaker of the only synagogue in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39702-2005Jan26.html |title=Afghan Jew Becomes Country's One and Only |work=[[Washington Post]] |author=N.C.

==Personal life==
Simintov was born and grew up in the western city of [[Herat]], before moving to [[Kabul]]. His house was damaged during the bloody [[Afghan Civil War (1992-96)|civil war]] (by which time almost all Jews left the country) forcing him to move into the synagogue. For a few years he was in [[Turkmenistan]] but he returned to Kabul in 1998, during the brutal [[Taliban]] regime. He was put to detention and beaten several times by the Taliban, and his carpets warehouse was robbed by them in 2001. Simintov had lived in the synagogue with the second last remaining Jewish man in Afghanistan, Ishaq (Isaac) Levin, who died on January 26, 2005, aged around 80. The story of Simintov and Levin was the basis for a British play.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Schraer, Totally Jewish.com, August 15, 2006 [http://www.totallyjewish.com/entertainment/features_and_reviews/?content_id=4097 Fringe Benefits]&lt;/ref&gt; Simintov deprecated Levin in an interview with British journalist [[Martin Fletcher]]. Levin had initially welcomed Simintov but the two fell out permanently when Simintov offered the caretaker help to emigrate to Israel to join the rest of the former Kabul Jewish community. Simintov was adamant he made the suggestion only as he thought Kabul was too cold for the old man, but the older man took umbrage, claiming Simintov was trying to take over the synagogue. A feud ensued, with the Taliban becoming involved after both men reported each other to the authorities for alleged wrongdoings ranging from running a brothel to misappropriating religious objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12005855|work=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|title=In Afghanistan, a Jewish Community of One|author=Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson|date=July 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Levin's death, Simintov said he was not sad and would not miss him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39702-2005Jan26.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Simintov says it is not easy to practise his religion alone. However, he has obtained special permission from the nearest rabbi, in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]], to slaughter his own meat in line with ''[[kosher]]'' dietary laws which can normally only be done by a specially trained Jewish [[shochet|butcher]]. Simintov lives alone in a small room next to an old [[synagogue]] on Flower Street in [[Kabul]] and receives donations from Jewish groups abroad and sympathetic [[Muslim]] locals.&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/02/MNU8RH93C.DTL |title=The last Jew in Afghanistan |author=Jason Motlagh |date=September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and two daughters live in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Afghanistan.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour (Afghanistan)] by Alden Oreck, Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; When asked during an interview whether he would emigrate to Israel, Simintov 
retorted, "Go to Israel? What business do I have there? Why should I leave?"&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; In a video interview by ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' on 17 September 2007, Simintov suggested that he may be interested in moving to Israel to join his two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Dj8tqcFyPtU|The last Jew in Afghanistan - 12 Sep 07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He says that he receives special kosher packages for [[Passover]] from Afghan Jews living in [[New York City|New York]]. Sometimes, he says, Jewish foreigners visit his home for the high holidays.{{clarify|date=May 2011}} Simintov has also been quoted as saying: "I don't want my Jewish heritage erased. My father was a rabbi, my grandfather was a rabbi. We were a big, religious family..." However he wears his ''[[yarmulke]]'' only in private and is hesitant to take visitors inside the synagogue he calls home.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, Jonathan (May 29, 2013). [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/132099/a-congregation-of-one/2 A Congregation of One]. tabletmag.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 Simintov announced that he would close his kebab restaurant in March 2014 due to a decline in business, after the reduction of [[NATO]] forces, specifically there has been a fall in both the numbers of people eating out in Kabul and hotel catering orders.&lt;ref&gt;Donati, Jessica and Harooni, Mirwais (Nov 12, 2013) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/12/us-afghanistan-jews-idUSBRE9AB0A120131112 Last Jew in Afghanistan faces ruin as kebabs fail to sell] reuters.com&lt;/ref&gt;
