The '''A368''' is a part [[primary status]] [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in [[North Somerset]], England. It runs from [[Marksbury]] (near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]) to [[Banwell]] (near [[Weston-super-Mare]]) along the northern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]] and past the reservoir at [[Chew Valley Lake]]. 
[[File:A368 at Chelwood - geograph.org.uk - 1206920.jpg|thumb|left|The A368 at Chelwood&lt;BR&gt;photographed March 2009]]
The road runs through the village of [[Chelwood]], where there is a roundabout for the junction with the [[A37 road|A37]], then via the village of [[Bishop Sutton]] to the large reservoir at Chew Valley Lake before crossing the B3114 at [[West Harptree]]. It then runs via [[Compton Martin]] to another smaller reservoir at [[Blagdon Lake]]. At [[Burrington, Somerset|Burrington]], there is a turning for the B3134 which leads through [[Burrington Combe]]. The road crosses the [[A38 road|A38]] at traffic lights just west of [[Churchill, Somerset|Churchill]], and goes through [[Sandford, Somerset|Sandford]] before ending at [[Banwell]] on the [[A371 road|A371]].

[[File:Puffinus puffinus -Iceland -flying-6 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Manx shearwater]]s can fly straight home when released, navigating thousands of miles over land or sea.]]

'''Animal navigation''' is the ability of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the [[Arctic tern]], insects such as the [[Monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]] and fish such as the [[salmon]] regularly [[Animal migration|migrate]] thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds,&lt;ref name="DingleDrake"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dingle, Hugh |author2=Drake, V. Alistair |year=2007 |title=What is migration? |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=113–121 |url= http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/B570206 |doi=10.1641/B570206}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.

[[Dead reckoning]], navigating from a known position using only information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1873 as a possible mechanism. In the 20th century, [[Karl von Frisch]] showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. [[William Tinsley Keeton]] showed that [[homing pigeons]] could similarly make use of a range of navigational cues, including the sun, [[earth's magnetic field]], [[olfaction]] and vision. [[Ronald Lockley]] demonstrated that a small seabird, the [[Manx shearwater]], could orient itself and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.

Several species of animal can integrate cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the [[earth's magnetic field]] or from the sky) to identify where they are and so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including [[olfaction]] and [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] may also be used.

The ability of wild animals to navigate may be adversely affected by products of human activity. For example, there is evidence that pesticides may interfere with bee navigation, and that lights may harm turtle navigation.

==Early research==

[[File:Waggle dance.png|thumb|upright|[[Karl von Frisch]] (1953) discovered that [[European honey bee|honey bee]] workers can navigate, and indicate the range and direction to food to other workers with a [[waggle dance]].]]
In 1873, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote a letter to [[Nature (magazine)|''Nature'' magazine]], arguing that animals including man have the ability to navigate by dead reckoning, even if a magnetic 'compass' sense and the ability to navigate by the stars is present:&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=24 April 1873 |title=Origin of Certain Instincts |journal=Nature |volume=7 |pages=417–418 |doi=10.1038/007417a0 |issue=179| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1760&amp;pageseq=1 |bibcode=1873Natur...7..417D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance, a striking account, in relation to man, will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North [[Siberia]], by [[Ferdinand von Wrangel|Von Wrangell]].{{efn|The book was ''A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea'' (2 vols.), London, 1841. ''Wrangel'' is variously spelt ''Vrangel'' or ''Wrangell''.}} He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot, whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice, with incessant changes of direction, and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea. He states (but I quote only from memory of many years standing) that he, an experienced surveyor, and using a compass, failed to do that which these savages easily effected. Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us. We must bear in mind that neither a compass, nor the north star, nor any other such sign, suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country, or through hummocky ice, when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable, unless the deviations are allowed for, or a sort of "dead reckoning" is kept. All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree, and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent, though probably in an unconscious manner. This is effected chiefly, no doubt, by eyesight, but partly, perhaps, by the sense of muscular movement, in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed (and some men much better than others) for a short distance in a nearly straight line, or turn at right angles, or back again. The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly disarranged in very old and feeble persons, and the feeling of strong distress which, as I know, has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction, leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction.}}

Later in 1873, Joseph John Murphy{{efn|JJ Murphy (d 1894), of [[County Antrim]], was treasurer and then president of the [https://archive.org/stream/belfastliterarys00belf/belfastliterarys00belf_djvu.txt Belfast Literary Society]. He attempted to harmonise evolution and religion, publishing a book ''The Scientific Bases of Faith'' in 1872.}} replied to Darwin, writing back to ''Nature'' with a description of how he, Murphy, believed animals carried out dead reckoning, by what is now called [[inertial navigation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. ''Instinct: a Mechanical Analogy''. ''Nature'' 7:483. 24 April 1873. {{doi|10.1038/007483b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If a ball is freely suspended from the roof of a railway carriage it will receive a shock sufficient to move it, when the carriage is set in motion: and the magnitude and direction of the shock … will depend on the magnitude and direction of the force with which the carriage begins to move … [and so] … every change in … the motion of the carriage … will give a shock of corresponding magnitude and direction to the ball. Now, it is conceivably quite possible, though such delicacy of mechanism is not to be hoped for, that a machine should be constructed … for registering the magnitude and direction of all these shocks, with the time at which each occurred … from these data the position of the carriage … might be calculated at any moment.}}

[[Karl von Frisch]] (1886–1982) studied the [[European honey bee]], demonstrating that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark [[beehive]].{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}}

[[William Tinsley Keeton]] (1933–1980) studied [[Homing (biology)|homing]] pigeons, showing that they were able to navigate using the [[earth's magnetic field]], the sun, as well as both [[Olfactory navigation|olfactory]] and visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Keeton|Keeton, William]] (1974) ''The orientational and navigational basis of homing in birds''. pages 47–132 in ''Advances in the Study of Behavior'', Vol. 5. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Griffin]] (1915–2003) studied [[Animal echolocation|echolocation in bats]], demonstrating that it was possible and that bats used this mechanism to detect and track prey, and to "see" and thus navigate through the world around them.&lt;ref name=GriffinNYT&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/14/nyregion/donald-r-griffin-88-dies-argued-animals-can-think.html ''Donald R. Griffin, 88, Dies; Argued Animals Can Think''], [[The New York Times]], 14 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Lockley]] (1903–2000), among many studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered the science of bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the [[Manx shearwater]], living on the remote island of [[Skokholm]].{{sfn|Lockley|1942}} These small seabirds make one of the longest migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This behaviour led to the question of how they navigated.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|pp=114–117}}

==Mechanisms==

Lockley began his book ''Animal Navigation'' with the words:{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=9}}
{{quote|How do animals find their way over apparently trackless country, through pathless forests, across empty deserts, over and under featureless seas? ... They do so, of course, without any visible [[compass]], [[sextant]], [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] or [[Nautical chart|chart]]...}}

Many mechanisms have been proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence for a number of them. Investigators have often been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.

=== Remembered landmarks ===

Animals including mammals, birds and insects such as bees and wasps (''[[Ammophila (Sphecidae)|Ammophila]]'' and ''[[Sphex]]''),{{sfn|Tinbergen|1984|pp=58–79}} are capable of learning landmarks in their environment, and of using these in navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Collett, Thomas S; Graham, Paul. "Animal Navigation: Path Integration, Visual Landmarks and Cognitive Maps" ''Current Biology'', Vol. 14, R475–R477, June 22, 2004. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orientation by the sun ===
{{main article|Sun compass in animals}}

[[File:Talitrus saltator 2c.jpg|thumb|The sandhopper, ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'', uses the sun and its [[Circadian rhythm|internal clock]] to determine direction.]]
Some animals can navigate using celestial cues such as the position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their [[circadian rhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunlap, Jay C.; Loros, Jennifer; DeCoursey, Patricia J. |year=2003 |title=Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0878931491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that use sun compass orientation are [[fish]], birds, sea-turtles, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[bee]]s, [[sandhopper]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[ant]]s.&lt;ref name=Alcock140&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=John |title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach |year=2009 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-225-2 |pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[sandhopper]]s (such as ''[[Talitrus saltator]]'') are taken up a beach, they easily find their way back down to the sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=74}}

Experiments with [[Puffinus puffinus|Manx shearwater]]s showed that when released "under a clear sky" far from their nests, the seabirds first oriented themselves and then flew off in the correct direction. But if the sky was overcast at the time of release, the shearwaters flew around in circles.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|pp=114–117}}

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] use the sun as a compass to guide their southwesterly autumn migration from Canada to Mexico.&lt;ref name=Alcock140/&gt;

=== Orientation by the night sky ===

In a pioneering experiment, Lockley showed that [[warbler]]s placed in a planetarium showing the night sky oriented themselves towards the south; when the planetarium sky was then very slowly rotated, the birds maintained their orientation with respect to the displayed stars. Lockley observes that to navigate by the stars, birds would need both a "sextant and chronometer": a built-in ability to read patterns of stars and to navigate by them, which also requires an accurate time-of-day clock.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=136}}

In 2003, the African [[dung beetle]] ''[[Scarabaeus zambesianus]]'' was shown to navigate using [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] patterns in [[moonlight]], making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/424033a| title=Animal behaviour: Insect orientation to polarized moonlight| journal=Nature| volume=424| issue=6944| pages=33| year=2003| last1=Dacke | first1=M. | last2=Nilsson | first2=D.

=== Orientation by polarised light ===
[[File:degpolred.jpg|thumb| [[Rayleigh sky model]] shows how polarization of light can indicate direction to bees.]]
{{main article|Rayleigh sky model}}

Some animals, notably insects such as the [[honey bee]], are sensitive to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. [[Karl von Frisch]]'s work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the [[Beehive|hive]] to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a [[waggle dance]]. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction,{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}} though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Grüter | first1=C. | last2=Balbuena | first2=M.| last3=Farina | first3=W. | title=Informational conflicts created by the waggle dance  | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | year=2008 | volume=275 | issue=1640 | pages=1321–1327 | pmc=2602683 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0186 | pmid=18331980}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).{{sfn|von Frisch|1953|pp=93–96}}

=== Magnetoreception===
[[File:Homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|The [[homing pigeon]] can quickly return to its home, using cues such as the earth's magnetic field to orient itself.]]
{{main article|Magnetoreception}}

Some animals, including mammals such as blind mole rats (''[[Spalax]]'') &lt;ref name=Kimchi&gt;Kimchi, Tali; Etienne, Ariane S.; Terkel, Joseph (2004). [http://www.pnas.org/content/101/4/1105.full.pdf A subterranean mammal uses the magnetic compass for path integration.]  PNAS, 27 January, vol. 101, no. 4, 1105–1109.&lt;/ref&gt; and birds such as pigeons, are sensitive to the earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lindauer and H. Martin, in S.R. Galler et al. ''Animal Orientation and Navigation'' 559/1, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homing pigeons use magnetic field information with other navigational cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |author=Walcott, C. |title=Pigeon homing: Observations, experiments and confusions |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=21–27 |pmid=9317262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly on a clear sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer to rely on the direction of the sun, but switch to using a magnetic field cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Keeton | first1=W. T. | year=1971 | title=Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=68 | issue=1 | pages=102–6 | pmc=391171 | pmid=5276278 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | bibcode=1971PNAS...68..102K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfaction ===

[[Olfactory navigation]] has been suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the [[odours]] in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour.&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F. |year=1990 |title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli |journal=Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=301–305 |doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues that there is a steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However it is not clear that such stable gradients exist.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, H.G. (1974). ''Das Navigationssystem der Vögel. Ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen.'' Schriftenreihe 'Kybernetik'. München, Wien: R. Oldenbourg Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltschko |first=W. |author2= Wiltschko, R. |year=1996 |title=Magnetic Orientation in Birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=29–38|pmid=9317275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olfactory cues may be important in [[salmon]], which are known to return to the exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers.{{sfn|Lockley|1967|p=180}} Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, K.

===Gravity receptors===
{{see|Gravity gradiometry}}

[[GPS]] tracing studies indicate that gravity anomalies could play a role in homing pigeon navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nicole Blaser |author2=Sergei I.

===Other senses===

Biologists have considered other senses that may contribute to animal navigation. Many marine animals such as seals are capable of [[hydrodynamic reception]], enabling them to track and catch prey such as fish by sensing the disturbances their passage leaves behind in the water.&lt;ref name="S-P 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.02708 |pmid=17297138 |year=2007 |author1=Schulte-Pelkum |first1=N. |title=Tracking of biogenic hydrodynamic trails in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=210 |issue=5 |pages=781–7|last2=Wieskotten |first2=S. |last3=Hanke |first3=W. |last4=Dehnhardt |first4=G. |last5=Mauck |first5=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine mammals such as dolphins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schevill | first1=W. E. | last2=McBride | first2=A. F. | year=1956 | title=Evidence for echolocation by cetaceans |  journal=Deep-Sea Research | volume=3 | issue=2| pages=153–154 | doi=10.1016/0146-6313(56)90096-x | bibcode=1956DSR.....3..153S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and many species of bat,&lt;ref name=GriffinNYT/&gt; are capable of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]], which they use both for detecting prey and for orientation by sensing their environment.

===Way-marking===

The [[wood mouse]] is the first non-human animal to be observed, both in the wild and under laboratory conditions, using movable landmarks to navigate. While foraging, they pick up and distribute visually conspicuous objects, such as leaves and twigs, which they then use as landmarks during exploration, moving the markers when the area has been explored.&lt;ref name="Stopka Macdonald 2003 p=3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stopka | first=Pavel | last2=Macdonald | first2=David W. | title=Way-marking behaviour: an aid to spatial navigation in the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) | journal=BMC Ecology | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=2003 | doi=10.1186/1472-6785-3-3 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path integration ==
[[File:Path integration diagram.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5&lt;!--width for readable text--&gt;|[[Path integration]] sums the [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]]s of distance and direction travelled from a start point to estimate current position, and so the path back to the start.]]
{{main article|Path integration}}

[[Dead reckoning]], in animals usually known as [[path integration]], means the putting together of cues from different sensory sources within the body, without reference to [[Visual perception|visual]] or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path that is not necessarily straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/pathintegration.html | title=Path Integration | publisher=Animal Behavior Online | year=2001 | accessdate=10 December 2012 | author=Breed, Michael D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''On the Origins of Certain Instincts''&lt;ref name="DarwinNature"/&gt; (quoted above) in 1873, path integration has been shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel. The Organization of Learning. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whishaw | first1=I.Q. | last2=Hines | first2=D.J. | last3=Wallace | first3=D.G. | year=2001 | title=Dead reckoning (path integration) requires the hippocampal formation: evidence from spontaneous exploration and spatial learning tasks in light (allothetic) and dark (idiothetic) tests | url=http://hsinnamon.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/NSB-Psyc255/Readings/17.%20Spatial%20Limbic%20System/Whishaw.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Behavioural Brain Research | volume=127 | issue=1–2| pages=49–69 | doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(01)00359-x | pmid=11718884}}&lt;/ref&gt; When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on ''[[idiothetic]]'' cues from within the body.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstaedt, H.; Mittelstaedt, M.-L. (1973). ''Mechanismen der orientierung ohne richtende aussenreize''. Forschr. Zool., 21:46–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mittelstaedt | first1=M.-L. | last2=Mittelstaedt | first2=H. | year=1980 | title=Homing by path integration in a mammal | url=| journal=Naturwissenschaften | volume=67 | issue=11| pages=566–567 | doi=10.1007/bf00450672| bibcode=1980NW.....67..566M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Wehner in the [[Sahara desert ant]] (''Cataglyphis bicolor'') demonstrate effective path integration to determine directional heading (by polarized light or sun position) and to compute distance (by monitoring leg movement or optical flow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Desert ant navigation: how miniature brains solve complex tasks |author=Wehner R | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=2003 |volume=189 |issue=8 |pages=579–588 |url=http://www.zool.uzh.ch/static/research/nb_wehner/literatur/pdf03/wehner20038.pdf | doi=10.1007/s00359-003-0431-1 | pmid=12879352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Path integration in mammals makes use of the [[vestibular organs]], which detect accelerations in the three [[dimension]]s, together with [[Efference copy|motor efference]], where the motor system tells the rest of the brain which movements were commanded,&lt;ref name=Kimchi/&gt; and [[optic flow]], where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Perception of the Visual World | author=Gibson, J.J.| publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The [[hippocampus]] is the part of the brain that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Path integration and the neural basis of the 'cognitive map' |author1=McNaughton, BL |author2=Battaglia FP |author3=Jensen O |author4=Moser EI |author5=Moser MB | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |date=August 2006 | volume=7 | issue=8 | pages=663–678 | pmid=16858394 | doi=10.1038/nrn1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Redish states that "The carefully controlled experiments of Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt (1980) and Etienne (1987) have demonstrated conclusively that [path integration in mammals] is a consequence of integrating internal cues from vestibular signals and motor efferent copy".{{sfn|Redish|1999|p=67}}

==Effects of human activity==

[[Neonicotinoid]] pesticides may impair the ability of bees to navigate. Bees exposed to low levels of [[thiamethoxam]] were less likely to return to their colony, to an extent sufficient to compromise a colony's survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17535769 | title=BBC News: Science &amp; Environment | publisher=BBC | work=Pesticides hit queen bee numbers | date=29 March 2012 | accessdate=30 March 2012 | author=Black, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light pollution]] attracts and disorients photophilic animals, those that follow light.  For example, hatchling sea turtles follow bright light, particularly bluish light, altering their navigation. Disrupted navigation in moths can easily be observed around bright lamps on summer nights.  Insects gather around these lamps at high densities instead of navigating naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Behavioral Approaches to Conservation in the Wild | publisher=Cambridge University Press | authors=Witherington, Blair E. in Clemmons, Janine Rhea, and Buchholz, Richard (editors)| year=1997 | pages=301–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bounty bay.jpg|thumb|right|Bounty Bay, Pitcairn Island, at dawn]]
'''Bounty Bay''' is an [[embayment]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] into [[Pitcairn Island]].

Bounty Bay is named after the [[HMS Bounty|''Bounty'']], a [[United Kingdom|British]] naval vessel whose eighteenth century [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny]] was immortalized in the [[novel]] ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', and the numerous subsequent motion pictures made of it. The mutineers sailed the ''Bounty'' to Pitcairn Island and destroyed it by fire in Bounty Bay. Current [[Pitcairn Islanders]] are largely lineal descendants of the mutineers, as exhibited by some of their surnames. 

Travellers to Pitcairn are usually brought in by [[longboat]] into Bounty Bay.

The following is a summary of the use of '''capital punishment by country'''.

==Global overview==

Historically, [[capital punishment]] has been used in almost every part of the world. Currently, the large majority of countries have either abolished or discontinued the practice. [[Japan]] has the highest [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|inequality-adjusted HDI]] (Human Development Index, of the United Nations Development Programme) of any country to use the death penalty; [[Singapore]] has the highest unadjusted HDI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/001/2013/en/] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bienen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leigh B.

* '''54''' retain it in both law and practice.
* '''29''' have abolished it ''[[de facto]]'', namely, according to Amnesty International standards, that they have not executed anyone during the last decade or more ''' ''and'' ''' are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions.&lt;ref name="amnesty2015"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/3487/2016/en/ |title=DEATH SENTENCES AND EXECUTIONS REPORT 2015 |date=April 2016 |publisher=Amnesty International|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''7''' have abolished it ''[[de facto]]'', namely that they have not executed anyone during the last 14 or more years ''' ''and'' ''' have abolished it ''[[de jure]]'', but retain it for exceptional or special circumstances (such as crimes committed in wartime).
* '''105''' have abolished it for all crimes, most recently: [[Madagascar]] (2015), [[Fiji]] (2015), [[Republic of the Congo]] (2015), [[Suriname]] (2015), [[Nauru]] (2016), [[Benin]] (2016), [[Mongolia]] (2017), [[Guinea]] (2017), [[Burkina Faso]] (2018).

;Extrajudicial execution: In some countries  the practice of [[extrajudicial execution]] outside their own formal legal frameworks occurs sporadically or systematically. Information on this is not covered in this article.

===Countries categorized as 'very high' on Human Development Index===
Of the countries/regions categorized as 'very high' on the [[Human Development Index]], 10 countries perform capital punishment: the [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]], [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]], [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Capital punishment in the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Oman]], and [[Capital punishment in Taiwan|Taiwan]]. In [[Capital punishment in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Capital punishment in South Korea|South Korea]], and [[Capital punishment in Russia|Russia]], there is a moratorium. [[Qatar]], [[Capital punishment in the Bahamas|the Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], and [[Brunei]] have a moratorium in practice. In [[Capital punishment in Israel|Israel]], [[Capital punishment in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], and [[Chile]], it can only be used for crimes committed in wartime.

===Africa===
In Africa, there are several countries that use the death penalty. Chad abolished the death penalty in 2014, but reintroduced it for acts of terrorism in 2015. Botswana and Nigeria are examples of countries that still execute people. Most recently, [[Burkina Faso]] repealed the death penalty in 2018. In 2018, The Gambia announced a moratorium as a first step toward abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gambia suspends death penalty en route to abolition|url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/02/19/gambia-suspends-death-penalty-en-route-to-abolition//|website=African News|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
In the [[Caribbean]] countries, the death penalty exists at least ''de jure'', except in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which abolished it in 1966 and 1987, respectively. The last execution in the Caribbean, and the last in the Americas outside the [[United States]], was in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] in 2008. In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the death penalty exists in Belize and Guyana, though it has not been used for years. In [[Capital punishment in Brazil|Brazil]], Chile, El Salvador, [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|Guatemala]], and Peru, the death penalty is only legal in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime and was abolished for other crimes. Opinion polls state sentiment for governments to return to capital punishment remains high in many Caribbean countries and pressure on politicians to retain it factors high.

===Asia===
Most executions worldwide take place in Asia. [[Capital punishment in China|China]] is the world's most active death penalty country. In [[Capital punishment in Iran|Iran]] and [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], the numbers of executions are also very high. In [[Capital punishment in North Korea|North Korea]], the state utilizes the death penalty against high level criminals and those suspected of committing "grave" offenses. Of the 10 countries with a "very high" [[Human Development Index]] which practice executions, 9 are in Asia: Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. In 2017, [[Mongolia]] repealed the death penalty, and [[Malaysia]] announced a moratorium in 2018. [[Capital punishment in India|India]] executes criminals only in extreme cases. Only 26 executions have taken place in India since 1991, the last of the terrorist [[Yakub Memon]] in 2015.

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] holds a strong position against the death penalty; its abolition is a key objective for the Union's human rights policy. Abolition is also a pre-condition for entry into the European Union. In Europe, only [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]] and the unrecognized [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]] continue to actively use capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=European External Action Service |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm |title=European Union - EEAS (European External Action Service) &amp;#124; EU Policy on Death Penalty |publisher=Eeas.europa.eu |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/belarus-and-ukrainan-rebels-keep-death-penalty-alive-in-europe/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-un-report-dire-situation-fighting/28912171.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation and former Soviet republics===
[[Capital punishment in Russia|Russia]] retains the death penalty in law, but there is a [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]]. The last execution on Russian territory was in Chechnya in 1999.
Of the other former Soviet republics, only [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Capital punishment in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] have not formally abolished capital punishment, and only Belarus uses it in practice. In Kazakhstan, it may only be used in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime, and only one individual is on death row.

===Oceania===
Nearly all countries in this region have abolished the death penalty as a form of punishment, and the two countries that still have it in law ([[Capital punishment in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Capital punishment in Tonga|Tonga]]) have not used it in years. The last known executions in this region took place in Tonga in 1982.

===Numbers executed in 2017===

At least 23 countries performed executions in 2017:

* '''Africa (3 countries):''' Egypt (35+), Somalia (24 [Puntland 12, Federal Government of Somalia 12]), South Sudan (4) 
* '''Americas (1 country):''' United States (23)
* '''Asia-Pacific (18 countries):''' Afghanistan (5), Bahrain (3), Bangladesh (6), China (1,551+), Iran (506+), Iraq (125+), Japan (4), Jordan (15), Kuwait (7), Malaysia (4), North Korea (+), Pakistan (60+), State of Palestine  (6 [Hamas authorities, Gaza]),  Saudi Arabia (146), Singapore (8), Syria (unknown number), United Arab Emirates (1), Vietnam (unknown number), Yemen (2+)
* '''Europe (1 country):''' Belarus (2)

Precise numbers are not available for many countries, so the total number of executions is unknown. Other countries like Libya conducted extrajudicial executions.

==Capital punishment by continents==

===Africa===
Of the 54 independent states in Africa that are UN members:

*15 (28%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
*18 (33%) permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years ''and'' are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions, or it is under a moratorium.
*21 (39%) have abolished it.

Many African countries have carried out no executions for over 10 years, but are not believed to have an abolitionist policy or established practice.

The information above is accurate {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, when Guinea abolished capital punishment. Chad abolished the death penalty in 2014, but restored it for terrorism in 2015.

*In 2017, [[Egypt]] was Africa's leading executioner. [[Libya]] has conducted extrajudicial executions. This century the following African countries have abolished capital punishment; Ivory Coast (2000), Senegal (2004), Rwanda (2007), Burundi (2009), Togo (2009), Gabon (2010), Congo (2015), Madagascar (2015), Benin (2016), Guinea (2017), and Burkina Faso (2018).

In 2018, The Gambia announced a moratorium as a first step toward abolition.

===Americas===
Of the 35 independent states in the Americas that are UN members:

*13 (37%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice. 
*5 (14%) retain it for crimes committed in exceptional circumstances (such as in time of war).
*1 (3%) permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years ''and'' are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions, or it is under a moratorium.
*16 (46%) have abolished capital punishment.

Many Caribbean countries have carried out no executions for over 10 years, but are not believed to have an abolitionist policy or established practice.

Currently (2018), the [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] is the only country in the Americas to conduct executions. The last execution elsewhere in the region was in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] in 2008. The countries in the Americas that most recently abolished the death penalty are [[Capital punishment in Suriname|Suriname]] (2015), [[Argentina]] (2009), and [[Bolivia]] (2009). [[Guatemala]] abolished the death penalty for civil cases in 2017.

Hanging (in the past, for civil offences), firing squad (military offences). Brazil has always maintained the death penalty in wartime as part of its Military Code but, after Brazil became a Republic in 1889, capital punishment for civil offenses or for military offences committed in peacetime was abolished by the first republican Constitution, adopted in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated (in 1938-46 and 1969–74), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered "internal warfare".&lt;ref name="Lei 6620"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL/LEIS/1970-1979/L6620.htm |title=Law 6620, 17 December 1978 |publisher=Presidency of Brazil |language=Portuguese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416164224/http://www.planalto.gov.br/CCIVIL/LEIS/1970-1979/L6620.htm |archivedate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decreto-Lei 431"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/1937-1946/Del0431.htm |title=Law Decree 431, 18 May 1938 |accessdate=3 February 2009 |publisher=Presidency of Brazil |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lei 1802"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/LEIS/1950-1969/L1802.htm#art47 |title=Law 1802, 5 January 1953 |accessdate=3 February 2009 |publisher=Presidency of Brazil |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decreto-Lei 898"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil/Decreto-Lei/1965-1988/Del0898.htm |title=Law Decree 898, 29 September 1969 |publisher=Presidency of Brazil |language=Portuguese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429043946/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil/Decreto-Lei/1965-1988/Del0898.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Only one civilian was sentenced to death in the republican period, in 1969, but the sentence was commuted and was not carried out. In the republican era, all military death sentences imposed for crimes committed during wartime (the Second World War was Brazil's last international military conflict) were similarly commuted and not carried out. The current [[Constitution of Brazil]] (1988) expressly forbids the use of capital punishment, except for military offences committed during a war duly declared by Congress.&lt;ref name="Brazilian Embassy UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/humanrights/deathpenalty.html |title=Death penalty in Brazil |accessdate=3 February 2009 |publisher=Brazilian Embassy in London |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225193317/http://www.brazil.org.uk/humanrights/deathpenalty.html |archivedate=25 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last person to suffer the death penalty in Brazil was executed in 1876, during the Imperial era. After 1876, Emperor Pedro II adopted in practice an abolitionist policy through his prerrogative of Mercy as Head of State, by directing that all death sentences be submitted by the Courts to the Imperial Government for examination regarding commutation (even without a request for pardon or commutation from the person condemned), and by granting commutations for all death sentences that were passed.

===Asia===
Of the 44 independent countries in Asia that are UN member or observer states:

*25 (44%) maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
*7 (16%) permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years ''and'' are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions, or it is under a moratorium.
*2 (3%) retain it for crimes committed in exceptional circumstances (such as in time of war).
*20 (37%) have abolished it.
The information above is accurate {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, when Mongolia abolished the death penalty, and does not include Taiwan, which is not currently a UN member; Taiwan practises the death penalty by shooting, and conducted one execution in 2016 and one in 2018. Hong Kong and Macau are also listed below (they have abolished the death penalty), but they are not included in the figures above as they do not have UN membership separate from China.

*In 2017, Asia had the world's five leading practitioners of capital punishment – China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Pakistan. The most recent countries to abolish capital punishment in Asia are Timor-Leste (2002), Bhutan (2004), Philippines (2006), Kyrgyzstan (2007), Uzbekistan (2008), and Mongolia (2017).

|[[Hanging]]. Murder; treason and crimes against the State. Judges usually impose death penalty in case of multiple homicides; death sentence for a single murder is extraordinary. Between 1946 and 2003 766 people were sentenced to death, 608 of whom were executed. For 40 months from 1989 to 1993 successive ministers of justice refused to authorise executions, which amounted to an informal moratorium. See also [[capital punishment in Japan]].

{{Main|Capital punishment in Europe}}
Of the 49 independent states in Europe that are UN members or have UN Observer status:

*1 (2%), [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]], maintains the death penalty.
*1 (2%), [[Capital punishment in Russia|Russia]], maintains the death penalty, but has a moratorium.
*47 (96%) have completely abolished it.

Abolition of death penalty is a pre-condition for entry into the [[European Union]], which considers capital punishment a "cruel and inhuman" practice and "not been shown in any way to act as a deterrent to crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm|title=EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, Belarus has been the only recognized country in Europe to carry out executions. 2009 and 2015 were the first two years in recorded history when Europe was completely free of executions. This century the following European countries have abolished capital punishment: Ukraine (2000), Malta (2000), Cyprus (2002), Turkey (2004), Greece (2004), Moldova (2005), Albania (2007), and Latvia (2012).

|On 30 November 1786 the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] (then independent, now a part of Italy) became the first state in the modern era to completely abolish the death penalty. The short lived Roman Republic of Feb–July 1849 abolished the death penalty before being overthrown by French troops. When the Kingdom of Italy was formed in 1861 all the constituent states except Tuscany allowed capital punishment until it was abolished from the penal code in 1889 – although it was maintained under military and colonial law. In 1926 Mussolini reintroduced the death penalty into Italian law. It was re-abolished from the penal code in 1944. Art. 27 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]] of the Italian Republic (1948) completely abolished it for all common military and civil crimes during peacetime. The death penalty was still, formally, in force in Italy in the military penal code, only for high treachery against the Republic or only in war theatre perpetrated crimes (though no execution ever took place) until it was abolished completely from there as well, in 1994. Article 27 of Italian Constitution was changed, in 2007, to impede the reintroduction of death penalty in time of war too. See [[Capital punishment in Italy]].

| [[Execution by firing squad|Firing squad]]. Russia retains the death penalty, but it is rarely used. There have been 4 brief periods when Russia has completely abolished the death penalty, in the 18th century Russian empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] abolished it, but it was restored by the next emperor, [[Peter III of Russia]]; then, on 12 March 1917 to 12 July 1917 following the [[February Revolution|overthrow of the Tsar]], 27 October 1917 to 16 June 1918 following the seizure of power by the [[Bolsheviks]], and 1947–1950 after the end of the [[Second World War]] ([[Joseph Stalin]] abolished it in 1947, but he had restored it in 1950, and for this short period, the strictest punishment in [[USSR]] was [[penal servitude]] in [[GULAG]] for 25 years). Currently the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation envisages the death penalty for five crimes: murder with aggravating circumstances, assassination attempt against a state or public figure, attempt on the life of a person administering justice or preliminary investigations, attempt on the life of a law-enforcement officer, and genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/7/topic/11 |title=Russian Federation: Death Penalty |publisher=Legislationline |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 1997 Russia signed the Sixth Protocol to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but has yet to ratify it.

*2 (14%) permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years ''and'' are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions, or it is under a moratorium.
*12 (86%) have abolished it.

Only [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Tonga]] have not formally abolished capital punishment despite not using the practice since 1975 and 1982 respectively. The most recent countries to abolish capital punishment in Oceania are Samoa (2004), Fiji (2015), and Nauru (2016).

==Abolition chronology==
The table below lists in chronological order the 105 independent states, that are either UN members or have UN observer status, that have completely abolished the death penalty. In the hundred years following the abolition of capital punishment by Venezuela in 1863 only 11 more countries followed, not counting temporary abolitions which were later reversed. From the 1960s onwards, abolition became far more popular. 4 countries abolished capital punishment in the 1960s (a record up to that time for any decade), 11 in the 1970s, and a further 10 in the 1980s. After the end of the [[Cold War]], many more countries followed. 35 countries abolished capital punishment in the 1990s, with 9 in 1990 alone, and a further 23 in the 2000s. 11 countries have abolished so far in the 2010s. Since 1985, there have been only 6 years when no country has abolished the death penalty: 1988, 2001, 2003, 2011, 2013 and 2014.

'''Note''': Where a country has abolished, re-instated, and abolished again (e.g. Philippines, Switzerland, Portugal) only the later abolition date is included. Countries who have abolished and since reinstated (e.g. Liberia) are not included. Non-independent territories are considered to be under the jurisdiction of their parent country – which leads to unexpectedly late abolition dates for the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where Jersey (UK), the Cook Is (NZ), and the Netherlands Antilles, were the last territories of those states to abolish capital punishment, and all were rather later than the more well known abolitions on the respective mainlands. Defunct countries such as the GDR (East Germany), which abolished capital punishment in 1987 but was dissolved in 1990, are also not included. References are in the continental tables above and not repeated here.

[[Image:Christaller's central place theory animation.gif|thumb|right]]
'''Central place theory''' is a [[geography|geographical]] [[theory]] that seeks to explain the number, size and location of [[human settlement]]s in a [[residential system]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was created by the [[Germany|German]] geographer [[Walter Christaller]], who asserted that settlements simply functioned as 'central places' providing services to surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Building the Theory ==
To develop the theory, Christaller made the following simplifying assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;http://uprav.ff.cuni.cz/?q=system/files/christaller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All areas have:
* an unbounded [[isotropic]] (all flat), homogeneous, limitless surface ([[abstract space]])
* an evenly distributed population
* all settlements are equidistant and exist in a triangular lattice pattern
* evenly distributed resources
* distance decay mechanism
* perfect competition and all sellers are economic people maximizing their profits
* consumers are of the same income level and same shopping behaviour
* all [[consumer]]s have a similar purchasing power and demand for goods and services
* Consumers visit the nearest central places that provide the function which they demand. They minimize the distance to be travelled
* no provider of goods or services is able to earn excess profit (each supplier has a monopoly over a hinterland)
Therefore, the trade areas of these central places who provide a particular good or service must all be of equal size
* there is only one type of transport and this would be equally easy in all directions
* transport cost is proportional to distance traveled in example, the longer the distance traveled, the higher the transport cost()

The theory then relied on two concepts: ''threshold'' and ''range''. 
*[[Threshold population|Threshold]] is the minimum market (population or income) needed to bring about the selling of a particular good or service.
*Range is the maximum distance consumers are prepared to travel to acquire goods - at some point the cost or inconvenience will outweigh the need for the good.

The result of these consumer preferences is that a system of centers of various sizes will emerge. Each center will supply particular types of goods forming levels of hierarchy.  In the functional hierarchies, generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements.

#The larger the settlements are in size, the fewer in number they will be, i.e. there are many small villages, but few large cities.
#The larger the settlements grow in size, the greater the distance between them, i.e. villages are usually found close together, while cities are spaced much further apart.
#As a settlement increases in size, the range and number of its functions will increase .
#As a settlement increases in size, the number of higher-order services will also increase, i.e. a greater degree of specialization occurs in the services.

The higher the order of the goods and services (more durable,Heidi valuable and variable), the larger the range of the goods and services, the longer the distance people are willing to travel to acquire them.

At the base of the hierarchy pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods. These centres are small. At the top of the pyramid are centres selling high order goods. These centres are large. Examples for low order goods and services are: newspaper stalls, groceries, bakeries and post offices. Examples for high order goods and services include jewelry, large shopping malls and arcades. They are supported by a much larger threshold population and demand.

==Predictions==
He deduced that settlements would tend to form in a triangular/hexagonal lattice, as it is the most efficient pattern to serve areas without any overlap.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

In the orderly arrangement of an urban hierarchy, seven different principal orders of settlement have been identified by Christaller, providing different groups of goods and services. Settlement are regularly spaced - equidistant spacing between same order centers, with larger centers farther apart than smaller centers. Settlements have hexagonal market areas, and are most efficient in number and functions.

The different layouts predicted by Christaller have ''K''-values which show how much the Sphere of Influence of the central places takes in &amp;mdash; the central place itself counts as 1 and each portion of a satellite counts as its portion:

=== ''K'' = 3 Marketing principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 3 Principle]]
According to the marketing principle ''K'' = 3, the market area of a higher-order place(node) occupies 1/3rd of the market area of each of the consecutive lower size place(node) which lies on its neighbor; the lower size nodes (6 in numbers and 2nd larger circles) are located at the corner of a largest hexagon around low value the high-order settlement.  Each high-order settlement gets 1/3rd of each satellite settlement (which are 6 in total), thus ''K'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;times;1/3 = 3.

However, although in this ''K'' = 3 marketing network the distance traveled is minimized, the transport network is not the

=== ''K'' = 4 Transport/Traffic principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 4 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 4 transport principle, the market area of a higher-order place includes a half of the market area of each of the six neighbouring lower-order places, as they are located on the edges of hexagons around the high-order settlements. This generates a hierarchy of central places which results in the most efficient transport network. There are maximum central places possible located on the main transport routes connecting the higher order center.The transportation principle involves the minimization of the length of roads connecting central places at all hierarchy levels. In this system of nesting, the lower order centres are all located along the roads linking the higher order centres. This alignment of places along a road leads to minimization of road length. However, for each higher order centre, there are now four centres of immediate lower order,as opposed to three centres under the marketing principle.

=== ''K'' = 7 Administrative principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 3.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 7 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 7 administrative principle (or political-social principle), settlements are nested according to sevens. The market areas of the smaller settlements are completely enclosed within the market area of the larger settlement.  Since tributary areas cannot be split administratively, they must be allocated exclusively to a single higher-order place. Efficient administration is the control principle in this hierarchy.

==Evaluation==

The validity of the place theory may vary with local factors, such as climate, topography, history of development, technological improvement and personal preference of consumers and suppliers. However, it is still possible to discern Christaller patterns in most distributions of urban centres, even though these patterns will often be distorted by the terrain or imperfect because of suboptimal (with regard to the optimal distribution of centres) historical development decisions.

Economic status of consumers in an area is also important. Consumers of higher economic status tend to be more mobile and therefore bypass centers providing only lower order goods. The application of central place theory must be tempered by an awareness of such factors when planning shopping center space location.

Purchasing power and density affect the spacing of centers and hierarchical arrangements. Sufficient densities will allow, for example, a grocery store, a lower order function, to survive in an isolated location.

Factors shaping the extent of market areas: 
*  [[Land use]]: industrial areas can provide little in the way of a consuming population
*  Poor [[accessibility]]: this can limit the extent of a center's market area
* [[Competition]]: this limits the extent of market areas in all directions
* [[Technology]]: high mobility afforded by the automobile allows overlapping of market areas

Market area studies provide another technique for using central place theory as a retail location planning tool. The hierarchy of shopping centers has been widely used within the planning of "[[new town]]s". In this new town, the hierarchy of business centers is evident. One main [[shopping center]] provides mostly [[Durable good|durable goods]] (higher order); district and local shopping centers supply, increasingly, convenience (lower order) goods. These centers provided for in the new town plan are not free from outside competition. The impacts of surrounding existing centers on the new town centers cannot be ignored.

==Examples==
The newly reclaimed [[polders]] of the [[Netherlands]] provide an isotropic plane on which settlements have developed and in certain areas 6 small towns can be seen surrounding a larger town, especially in the Noord-Oostpolder and Flevoland.
The [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] in the UK also provide a large expanse of flat land with no natural barriers to settlement development.  [[Cambridge]] is a good example of a K=4 Transport Model Central Place, although it is surrounded by 7, rather than 6, settlements.  Each satellite is 10–15 miles from Cambridge and each lies on a major road leading out of Cambridge:
* [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] - A10 north
* [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] - A1303 (now bypassed by A14/A11) northeast
* [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]] - A1307 southeast
* [[Saffron Walden]] - A1301 south
* [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] - A10 southwest
* [[St Neots]] - A428 west
* [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] - A14 northwest

As all of the satellite settlements are on transport links, this is a good example of a K=4 CPT model (although in this case it is K=4.5 due to 7 rather than 6 settlements).

Another example of the use of CPT was in the delineation of Medical Care Regions in California.  A hierarchy of primary, secondary and tertiary care cities was described,
and the population size and income needed to support each medical care specialty in California determined.

== Criticism ==
The Central Place Theory has been criticized for being static; it does not incorporate the temporal aspect in the development of central places. Furthermore, the theory holds up well when it comes to agricultural areas, but not industrial or postindustrial areas due to their diversified nature of various services or their varied distribution of natural resources.

== Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT ==
Newer theoretical developments have shown that it is possible to overcome the static aspect of CPT. Veneris (1984) developed a theoretical model which starts with (a) a system of evenly distributed ("medieval") towns; (b) new economic activities are located in some towns thus causing differentiation and evolution into an hierarchical ("industrial") city system; (c) further differentiation leads into a post-hierarchical ("postindustrial") city system.
This evolution can be modelled by means of the three major CPT theories: stage (a) is a system of von Thunen "isolated states"; stage (b) is a Christallerian hierarchical system; stage (c) is a Löschian post-hierarchical system. Furthermore, stage (b) corresponds to [[Christopher Alexander]]'s "tree" city, while (c) is similar to his "lattice" system (following his dictum "the city is not a tree").

==The importance of a City and other Theoretical Considerations==
According to Smith, Walter Christaller erred in his development of CPT in 1930 by using size of population and number of telephones in determining the importance of a city.  Smith recognized that although population size was important to the area served by a city, the '''number of kinds of services''' offered there was more important as a measure of the importance of a city in attracting consumers.  In applying CPT to describe the delivery of medical care in California, Smith counted the number of physician specialties to determine the importance of a city in the delivery of medical care.

Christaller also erred in the assumption that cities "emerge".  In California and much of the United States, many cities were situated by the railroads at the time the tracks were laid.  In California, towns founded by the railroads were 12 miles apart, the amount of track a section crew could maintain in the 1850s; larger towns were 60 miles apart, the distance a steam engine could travel before needing water.  Older towns were founded a day's horse ride apart by the Spanish priests who founded early missions.

In medical care regions described by Smith, there is a hierarchy of services, with primary care ideally distributed throughout an area, middle sized cities offering secondary care, and metropolitan areas with tertiary care.  Income, size of population, population demographics, distance to the next service center, all had an influence on the number and kind of specialists located in a population center. (Smith, 1977, 1979)

For example, orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry are more likely to be found in high income areas. It was possible to estimate the size of population (threshold) needed to support a specialty, and also to link specialties that needed to cooperate and locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.

Her work is important for the study of physician location—where physicians choose to practice and where their practices will have a sufficient population size to support them. The income level of the population determines whether sufficient physicians will practice in an area and whether public subsidy is needed to maintain the health of the population.

The distribution of medical care in California followed patterns having to do with the settlement of cities.  Cities and their hinterlands having characteristics of the Traffic Principle (See K=4 above) usually have six thoroughfares through them—the thoroughfares including highways, rivers, railroads, and canals.  They are most efficient and can deliver the lowest cost services because transportation is cheaper.  Those having settled on the market principle (K=3 above) have more expensive services and goods, as they were founded at times when transportation was more primitive.  In Appalachia, for example, the market principle still prevails and rural medical care is much more expensive.

== Making Central Place Theory operational ==
CPT is often criticized as being "unrealistic". However, several studies show that it can describe existing urban systems.  An important issue is that Christaller's original formulation is incorrect in several ways (Smith). These errors become apparent if we try to make CPT "operational", that is if we try to derive numerical data out of the theoretical schemata. These problems have been identified for by Veneris (1984) and subsequently by Openshaw and Veneris (2003), who provided also theoretically sound and consistent solutions, based on a K=3, 37-centre CP system:

1. Closure problem. Christaller's original scheme implies an infinite landscape. Although each market has finite size, the total system has no boundaries to it. Neither Christaller, nor the early related literature provide any guidance as to how the system can be "contained". Openshaw and Veneris (2003) identified three different types of closure, namely (a) isolated state, (b) territorial closure and (c) functional closure. Each closure type implies different population patterns.

2. Generating trips. Following the basic Christallerian logic and the closure types identified, Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate trip patterns between the 27 centres.

3. Calculating inter- and intra-zonal costs/distances. Christaller assumed freedom of movement in all directions, which would imply "airline" distances between centres. At the same time, he provided specific road networks for the CP system, which do not allow for airline distances. This is a major flaw which neither Christaller, nor early related literature have identified.  Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate costs/distances which are consistent with the Christallerian principles.

=== Central Place Theory and Spatial Interaction Models ===
{{Details|Spatial Interaction Models}}
It was once thought that central place theory is not compatible with spatial interaction models (SIM). It is paradoxical however that some times towns or shopping centres are planned with CPT, and subsequently evaluated with SIM.

Openshaw and Veneris (2003) succeeded in linking these two major regional theories in a clear and theoretically consistent way: using the data they derived from the operationalization of CPT, they experimented with several SIM. Following a thorough investigation via computer simulation, they reached important theoretical and practical conclusions.

Smith was able to delineate medical care regions (the range), describe the hierarchy of medical services, the population base required of each medical specialty (threshold), the efficiency of regions, and the importance of how an area was settled to the delivery of medical care, that is, according to traffic, market or administrative principles. What is central place?

'''Contamination''' is the presence of an unwanted constituent, contaminant or [[impurity]] in a material, [[physical body]], [[natural environment]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], etc.
Contaminants are biological, chemical, physical or radiological substance.

==Sciences==
"Contamination" has also more specific meanings in science:
*In [[chemistry]], the term usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of [[impurity]]. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional [[chemical reaction]]s. The additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial, in which case the label ‘contaminant’ is replaced with [[reactant]] or [[catalyst]]. If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as [[toxin]], [[poison]] or [[pollutant]], depending on the type of [[molecule]] involved. A major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying, isolating, and studying contaminants.
*In [[environmental chemistry]] the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to [[pollution]], where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans.
*In [[radiation protection]] the [[radioactive contamination]] is radioactive substances on surfaces, or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, or the process giving rise to their presence in such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

: Also used less formally to refer to a quantity, namely the amount of [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|radioactivity]] in a location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter. 
:Contamination may include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of a site where there was a [[nuclear reactor]], such as a [[power plant]], [[experimental reactor]], [[isotope reactor]] or a [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear powered ship]] or [[nuclear submarine|submarine]].
:The term [[radioactive contamination]] may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of [[radioactivity]], and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved.
*In [[organic agriculture]] contamination with [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) has been a cause for decertification of a farm.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/26549/7/26549.pdf  Organic versus GMO farming: Contamination, what contamination?]. Journal of Organic Systems, 9 (1), pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western Australia]] a Parliamentary Inquiry was set up in December 2017 to examine mechanisms for compensating farmers where there has been contamination by [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37501069/Compensation_for_GMO_contamination  Compensation for GMO contamination].

*In [[food chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]], the term "contamination" is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of [[toxin]]s or [[pathogen]]s in [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, see [[food contaminant]].
*In [[forensic science]], a contaminant can be [[fingerprint]]s, [[hair]], [[human skin|skin]] or [[DNA]] from [[first responder]]s or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects. 
*In the [[biology|biological sciences]], accidental introduction of "foreign" material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living [[microorganism]], it can often multiply and take over the experiment, especially cultures, and render them useless.
*In [[geology]] and especially [[geochemistry]], it can have similar effects where even a few grains of "modern" dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments.
*the term "contamination" is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another.
*it has even been used in the "directed [[panspermia]]" hypothesis about the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with [[microbe]]s from their own world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Edme Mentelle''' (11 October 1730 - 28 April 1816) was a [[French people|French]] geographer.

==Biography==
Student of [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier]] at the [[Collège de Beauvais]] (at the time a constituent college of the [[University of Paris#Colleges|University of Paris]]), he found employment with the ''[[Ferme générale]]''.

The poems and comedic plays he published early in his career were not successful. He turned to the study of geography and taught geography at the ''[[École Militaire]]'' during the 1760s. During the 1780s he taught geography to the royal household and in 1786 designed a globe, which is still on display in the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s apartments at the [[Palace of Versailles]].

A supporter of the [[French Revolution]], he taught at the ''[[:fr:École centrale (Révolution française)|Écoles centrales]]'' and at the ''[[École Normale Supérieure]]''. He was elected to the [[National Institute of Sciences and Arts|Institut de France]] in 1795.

'''Emba Soira''' (also transliterated '''Sowera''') is the highest mountain in [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref name="pb"/&gt; Rising {{convert|3018|m|ft|0}} above sea level, it is part of the [[Eritrean Highlands]], one side of the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]] which cuts through Eritrea and joins the [[Red Sea]]. The mountain is situated in the southeastern part of the [[Debub Region|Debub]] (Southern) administrative region in central Eritrea.

Emba Soira is reached by a paved road from the city of [[Senafe]], located 135 kilometres south of the national capital [[Asmara]]. From there, a very difficult and perilous dirt track heading east for almost 20 kilometres leads to the mountain. The last part must be trekked and takes at least a few hours of travel.

The '''Fairfax Line''' was a surveyor's line run in 1746 to establish the limits of the "[[Northern Neck Proprietary|Northern Neck land grant]]" (also known as the "Fairfax Grant") in [[colonial Virginia]].

The land grant, first contrived in 1649, encompassed all lands bounded by the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River]]s, an area of {{convert|5,282,000|acre|km2}}. By 1719, the lands had been inherited by [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1693–1781). By that time the question of the boundaries of the designated lands had also become highly contentious. In 1745 it was decided that a line between the sources of the [[North Branch Potomac River]] and the [[Rappahannock River]] would constitute the western limit of Lord Fairfax's lands.

==History==
[[File:JeffFryDetail.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail from the "[[Fry-Jefferson map]]" of Virginia (1751) showing "Lord Fairfax his Boundary Line".]]

===Background===
The Northern Neck Grant, commonly referred to as the "Fairfax Grant", has its genesis in 1649 when the exiled King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of Britain rewarded the two [[John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper|Colepeper (Culpeper) brothers]] and five other loyal friends by issuing a grant for a "porcon of Virginia ... bounded by and within the heads of the Rivers Rappahannock and Patawomecke....". The grant actually took force when Charles was restored to the throne in 1660 and it was recorded and a "[[Proprietary colony|Proprietary]]" created in the New World. At that time, the territory encompassed by the grant had not been explored and was not known. The seven original shares ultimately devolved to [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1657–1710), who married the only child, a daughter named Catherine, of [[Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper]] (1635–89). Thus the Northern Neck grant is commonly referred to as the "Fairfax Grant".

===Disputes===
The Commonwealth of Virginia frequently disputed the boundaries of the Fairfax Grant. In 1745, the Privy Council in London decided in favor of the [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|6th Lord Fairfax]], designating that "the boundary of the petitioners land doth begin at the first spring of the South Branch of the River Rappahannack now called Rappidan[,] which first spring is the spring of that part of the said River Rappidan as is called in the plans returned by the name of Conway River[,] and that the said boundary be from thence drawn in a straight line North West to the place in the Allagany Mountains where that part of the River Pattawomeck alias Potowmack which is now called Cohongoroota alias Cohongoronton first arises."&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fairfax Line: A Historic Landmark, including "The Fairfax Line: Thomas Lewis's Journal of 1746"|year=1990|publisher=The Henkel Press (1925, reprinted by Shenandoah County Historical Society)|location=New Market, VA|editor=John Wayland|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imaginary line between the sources of the Conway River and the North Branch Potomac River is commonly referred to as "the Fairfax Line".

===Surveys===
In 1736 [[John Savage (surveyor)|John Savage]] and his survey party had located the site of the source of the North Branch Potomac River (the northern boundary of the tract), but had made no attempt to establish the western boundaries of Lord Fairfax's lands. A 1746 survey (the "Survey of the Fairfax Line"), however, was accomplished by Colonel [[Peter Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Thomas Lewis]] under extremely arduous conditions and resulted in both the emplacement of a boundary marker (the "[[Fairfax Stone]]") at the source and the official demarkation of the Fairfax Line, extending from the Stone south-east to the headwater of the [[Conway River (Virginia)|Conway River]]. Lewis's journal of the expedition provides a vivid account of the extraordinarily difficult terrain of the pre-settlement [[Allegheny Mountains]].

==Geography==
The Fairfax Line runs in a northwesterly direction for about 77 miles (124&amp;nbsp;km) through exceptionally rugged terrain: from the crest of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] in [[Virginia]], to that of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] in [[West Virginia]], traversing the headwaters of the [[Shenandoah River]] along the way. The southeastern terminus of the line is the source of the [[Conway River (Virginia)|Conway River]], a tributary of the Rappahannock. The source is on the eastern slope of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], near mile marker 55 on the [[Skyline Drive]] (approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]), where the borders of the Virginia counties of [[Page County, Virginia|Page]], [[Madison County, Virginia|Madison]] and [[Greene County, Virginia|Greene]] meet. In the [[Shenandoah Valley]], the line coincides with the southern boundary of the town of [[New Market, Virginia]], and marks the boundary between Virginia counties of [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham]] and [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah]]. Continuing northwestward, the line marks the state boundary between [[Hardy County, West Virginia]] and [[Rockingham County, Virginia]], and passes through the city of [[Petersburg, West Virginia]]. The northwestern terminus of the line — at the [[Fairfax Stone Historical Monument State Park|Fairfax Stone]] — is the source of the North Branch of the Potomac River. The stone's location is on the borders of the present [[West Virginia]] counties of [[Preston County, West Virginia|Preston]], [[Tucker County|Tucker]] and [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant]], and one mile south of the southwestern tip of [[Western Maryland|Maryland Panhandle]].

A feature called the [[Burckle crater]] lies about {{convert|1,700|km|mi}} east-southeast of the Madagascar chevrons and in deep ocean. it is hypothesized to be an [[impact crater]] by the [[Holocene Impact Working Group]]. Although its [[sediment]]s have not been directly sampled, cores from the area contain high levels of [[nickel]] and magnetic components that are argued to be associated with impact ejecta. Abbott estimates the age of this feature to be about 4,500 to 5,000 years old.&lt;ref name="ScheffersOther2008"/&gt;

'''George Babcock Cressey''' (December 15, 1896 – October 21, 1963) was an American [[geographer]], author, and academic.  Born in [[Tiffin, Ohio]], he attended [[Denison University]] and then the [[University of Chicago]], where he received a [[PhD]] in [[geology]].  After receiving his degree, he taught at [[University of Shanghai]] and traveled widely in [[China]].  Upon his return to the United States in 1929, he completed a pioneering book on the country, ''China's Geographic Foundations.''

In 1931, Cressey received a second PhD from [[Clark University]] in geography.  He then joined the faculty of [[Syracuse University]], where he remained for the rest of his professional career.  At Syracuse, Cressey wrote on a variety of subjects, but focused on "population problems as related to the worldwide distribution of land and arable resources,"&lt;ref name = "nyobit"&gt;{{cite news|title = George Cressey, Geographer, Dies | work = The New York Times | date = October 22, 1963 | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and primarily studied Asia, though he traveled to 75 countries on six continents (all but Australia), over the course of his career.&lt;ref name = "james254"&gt;James, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;  Cressey also served as chair of the department and helped to develop the geography graduate program at Syracuse into one of the best in the country.

In addition to his academic work, Cressey consulted for the [[US Department of State]], the [[Board of Economic Warfare]], and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]] during [[World War II]].  After the war, he was also an outspoken advocate of better relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] and traveled widely in East Asia and the Middle East with a variety of fellowships.  Cressey was also highly involved in a number of professional organizations, serving as President of the [[International Geographical Union]], the [[Association for Asian Studies]], and the [[Association of American Geographers]].

==Early life==
Cressey was born in [[Tiffin, Ohio]], on December 15, 1896.  His father, Frank G. Cressey, was a Baptist minister and his mother, Frances Babcock, the first woman to graduate from the [[University of Chicago]], taught Latin at [[Denison University]].&lt;ref name  ="james254"/&gt;  After high school, Cressey attended [[Denison University]], graduating in 1919 with a [[B.S.]]  He then entered the [[University of Chicago]], where he studied under the noted geologist [[Rollin D. Salisbury]], receiving a [[Master's degree]] in 1921 and a [[PhD]] in 1923, both in [[geology]].&lt;ref name = "nyobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "h360"&gt;Herman, p.360&lt;/ref&gt;  His dissertation was entitled "A Study of Indiana Sand Dunes."&lt;ref name = "h360"/&gt;

After receiving his degree, Cressey went to China with the [[American Baptist Missionary Union]] and took a position at [[University of Shanghai]] in [[Shanghai, China]], teaching both geology and geography.&lt;ref name ="james254"/&gt;  While in China, he met Marion Chatfield, an American missionary, whom he married in 1925.&lt;ref name ="james254"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "h360"/&gt;  The two went on to have one son and three daughters.&lt;ref name = "nyobit"/&gt; Cressey also used his time in China to travel in East Asia, visiting [[Mongolia]] and the [[Ordos Desert]] with particular frequency.  His trips were often dangerous and took him far from other Westerners; during one of his trips, in [[Hebei]], he was beaten and robbed by a group of bandits.&lt;ref name = "h360"/&gt;  His travels in China covered more than 30,000 miles,&lt;ref name = "clark"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.2307/2143232|title = Reviews:China's Geographic Foundations|first2 = George Babcock|last2 = Cressey | first = Grover | last = Clark | journal = Political Science Quarterly | volume = 49 |issue = 3 |date=September 1934 | pages = 461–462|jstor = 2143232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the basis of a book he began writing, ''China's Geographic Foundations: A Survey of the Land and its Peoples''.  Cressey finished the book shortly before leaving China and gave the manuscript to the [[Commercial Press]] in Shanghai to prepare for publication.  In 1932, however, the press was bombed by the Japanese and the manuscript was lost in the ensuing fire.&lt;ref name ="james254"/&gt;

==Second PhD and academic career==
In 1929, Cressey left China&lt;!--the manuscript-destroying bombing wasn't until 1932?  Why was it still a MS so late after his departure?--&gt;, returning to the United States for a year of study at [[Harvard University]].  In 1931, he earned a second PhD, in geography, from [[Clark University]], writing his dissertation on the Ordos Desert.&lt;ref name = "h360"/&gt;  The same year, Cressey joined the faculty of [[Syracuse University]] as a professor of geography and geology, and soon became chairman of the department.&lt;ref name = "nyobit"/&gt;  After the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in September 1931, Cressey's travels in Asia made him a sought-after expert and lecturer on China, and he traveled frequently, giving lectures to academic audiences and the general public.  Cressey also began to reconstruct his book, ''China's Geographic Foundations'', from his original notes, finishing it in 1934.&lt;ref name = "james255"&gt;James, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''China's Geographic Foundations'', Cressey focused on describing the 15 geographic regions of China, but he also devoted chapters to "history, topography, climate, agriculture, and foreign trade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Review of China's Geographic Foundations by G.B. Cressey and The Chinese by K.S. Latourette|first = Ellsworth|last = Faris|journal = American Journal of Sociology|volume = 40 | year = 1934 | pages = 379–380|url = http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Faris/Faris_1934c.html|accessdate = 2009-08-10|doi=10.1086/216755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'', Grover Clark called the book "a clear, comprehensive and yet comprehensible description of the land and the people's relation to it."&lt;ref name = "clark"/&gt;  The book went on to become "the standard work in its field."&lt;ref name = "stamp"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Review: Asia's Lands and Peoples | first = Dudley | last = Stamp | journal = Geographical Review|volume = 35|issue = 2 |date=April 1945|pages = 332–333 | doi=10.2307/211487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although welcomed by the [[Kuomintang]], the book was "strongly criticized" by the [[Communist Party of China]] because of Cressey's judgment that China lacked the resources to quickly become a great industrial power.&lt;ref name = "h361"&gt;Herman, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching at Syracuse, Cressey continued his travels, and in 1937, he visited [[Moscow]], where he was invited to consult on the production of the ''Great Soviet World Atlas''.  After his trip to Moscow, Cressey traveled widely in the [[Soviet Union]], and after returning to the United States he spoke of the great economic potential of the country, despite anti-Soviet sentiment.  As a result, he earned "the trust and gratitude of his Soviet colleagues," allowing him access to their knowledge and resources.&lt;ref name = "h361"/&gt;  Cressey also spent the 1930s developing the academic offerings at Syracuse, building "one of the best Master of Arts programs in geography available in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;James, pp. 255-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "dickinson"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Obituary: George Babcock Cressey | first = Robert | last = Dickinson | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 130 | issue = 1 |date=March 1964 | page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After the US entry into [[World War II]], Cressey became a consultant to several government bodies, including the [[US Department of State]], the [[Board of Economic Warfare]], and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]].  Cressey also taught and lectured on Asia, for the Army's training program at Syracuse University, and lectured publicly on East Asia throughout the country.&lt;ref name = "h361"/&gt;  In 1943 and 1944, he served as a special representative in China through the State Department's cultural exchange program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = China Post for Dr. Cressey | work = The New York Times | date = September 9, 1943 | page = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that capacity, Cressey worked with the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to help establish Chinese universities, and promote better relations with China.&lt;ref name ="h361"/&gt;

During the war, Cressey also wrote his second book: ''Asia's Lands and Peoples: A Geography of One-Third the Earth and Two-Thirds its People'', published in 1944.  The book was aimed at the ordinary American as a general overview of Asia in light of rising American interest in the region due to the war.  In the book, Cressey also entered into the debate on how to divide [[Asia]] from [[Europe]] by arguing that Europe was really only one of the six regions of [[Eurasia]], the other five being the Soviet Union, East Asia, Southeast Asia, India, and Southwest Asia.&lt;ref name = "stamp"/&gt; Cressey also made the controversial argument in the book that "the key to enduring peace in eastern Asia is a strong China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Review: Asia's Lands and Peoples | first = Paul | last = Clyde |journal = The Pacific Historical Review | volume = 13 | issue = 4 |date=December 1944 | pages = 435–436 | doi=10.2307/3634331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was well received, and [[Dudley Stamp]] wrote that it had "the sure touch of the man who has been to see for himself."&lt;ref name = "stamp"/&gt;

==Post-war career==
After the war, Cressey became chair of the newly independent Department of Geography at Syracuse, and worked to make Syracuse a top institution for the study of Asia.  He brought Asian scholars and graduate students to Syracuse, and used his department's funds to send maps and books to the geography departments within Asian universities.  During the years following the war, he was also active within the [[Association of American Geographers]], [[International Geographical Union]] and the [[Association for Asian Studies]].&lt;ref name = "h361"/&gt;

During the 1950s period of [[McCarthyism]], Cressey's interest in China and his "outspoken comments on the shortcomings of American foreign policy" led to his inclusion on various "lists of scholars suspected of sympathy with the Communists," but the accusations were baseless and Syracuse University continued to fully support him.  Ironically, at the same time that Cressey was accused of communist sympathies, the Chinese government included him on its list of its capitalist enemies.&lt;ref name = "james256"&gt;James, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Cressey retired as chairman of the geography department at Syracuse and became Maxwell Distinguished Professor of Geography, a newly created position.&lt;ref name = "nyobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "h362"&gt;Herman, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next ten years, he traveled frequently and published prolifically.  He also received several honors.  From 1949 to 1952, he served as President of the [[International Geographical Union]] and in 1952 he was elected as a Vice President, a position he held until 1956.&lt;ref name = "h362"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Geographers Elect | work = The New York Times | date = August 16, 1952 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, he received the [[George Davidson Medal]] of the [[American Geographical Society]] and in 1958 he received a distinguished service award from the [[National Council for Geographic Education]].&lt;ref name = "nyobit"/&gt; In 1961-1962, he was a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] National Visiting Scholar and in 1962-1963 he was served as a Department of State Visiting Professor in Asia.&lt;ref name ="h362"/&gt;  Cressey also served as Honorary President of the [[Association of American Geographers]] in 1957 and President of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1959 and 1960.&lt;ref name = "dickinson"/&gt;

In 1955 and 1956, Cressey held a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] in [[Iraq]] and in 1957 and 1958 he served as a [[Smith-Mundt Act|Smith-Mundt Professor]] in [[Lebanon]].  From his research and travel during these fellowships, Cressey wrote the book ''Crossroads: Land and Life in Southwest Asia'', which was published in 1960.&lt;ref name = "james256"/&gt;  In the first section of the book, Cressey dealt with the general geographical features of the [[Middle East]].  The next eight chapters dealt with the specific countries of the region from [[Egypt]] to [[Afghanistan]], creating a picture of the whole region.  Cressey focused in detail on the role of natural resources for the countries of the region, concentrating particular attention on the role of water and water shortages.  W.B. Fisher, writing in ''[[Geographical Review]]'', called the book "an authoritative and compelling study,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Review: Crossroads | journal = Geographical Review | first = W.B. | last = Fisher |date=April 1962 | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–307 | doi=10.2307/212964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leonard Kasdan wrote in the ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' that the book was the "most useful single compendium of the aspects covered that exists in the literature to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Review: Crossroads | first = Leonard | last = Kasdan | volume = 64 | issue = 6 |date=December 1962 | pages = 1329–1331|journal = American Anthropologist | doi=10.1525/aa.1962.64.6.02a00270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he broadened his regional interests in the 1950s, Cressey remained interested in China and his "enduring concern was to restore contact between China and the United States," after the break in their relations following the Communist victory.  He also promoted the study of China, hoping to educate a new generation of geographers with knowledge of China and East Asia.&lt;ref name ="h362"/&gt;

Cressey died of [[cancer]] on October 21, 1963 at his home in [[Syracuse, New York]].&lt;ref name ="nyobit"/&gt;

'''Grassland degradation''', also called '''vegetation''' or '''steppe degradation''' is a [[biotic material|biotic]] [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] in which [[grass]] struggles to grow or can no longer exist on a piece of land due to causes such as [[overgrazing]], [[burrow]]ing of small [[mammal]]s, and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akiyama and Kawamura|title=Grassland degradation in China: Methods of monitoring, management and restoration|journal=Grassland Science|date=March 2007|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/j.1744-697X.2007.00073.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-697X.2007.00073.x/abstract|accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s,&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jin-Tun|first=Zhang|title=Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies: A Case from Shanxi Province, China|journal=Rangelands|date=Feb 2006|volume=28|issue=1|pages=37–43|jstor=4002228|doi=10.2111/1551-501x(2006)28.1[37:gdaosa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been noticed to affects plains and plateaus of [[alpine tundra|alpine meadows]] or grasslands, most notably being in the [[Philippines]] and in the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Inner Mongolia]]n region of [[China]] where 2460&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of [[grassland]] is [[Environmental degradation|degraded]] each year.&lt;ref name="Filipino Grassland degradation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abit Jr.|first=Sergio M.|author2=Victor B.

==Causes==

===Overgrazing===

It is thought that grassland degradation is principally attributed to overgrazing.&lt;ref name="Causes and Restoration of"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baoxiong|first=Chen|author2=Tao Jian |author3=Wu Jianshuang |author4=Wang Jingsheng |author5=Zhang Junlong |author6=Shi Peili |author7=Zhang Xianzhou |author8=Shen Zhenxi |title=Causes and Restoration of Degraded Alpine Grassland in Northern Tiber|journal=Journal of Resources and Ecology|date=March 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=43–49|doi=10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2013.01.006|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2013.01.006|accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quantitative Analysis of Driving"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sha|first=Zongyao|author2=Yichun Xie|title=Quantitative Analysis of Driving Factors of Grassland Degradation: A Case Study in Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia|journal=The Scientific World Journal|date=April 24, 2012|volume=2012|issue=169724|pages=1–14|doi=10.1100/2012/169724|pmc=3349114|pmid=22619613}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This unfortunate occurrence occurs when animals consume grass at a faster rate than it can grow back.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  Lately overgrazing has become more apparent partially because of the increase in [[urbanization]], which makes less room for available farmland.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  With these hence smaller plots, farmers try to maximize their space and profits by densely packing their land with animals.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  Another point that comes with the high density of owned animals is that farmers need to be able to provide for them in the winter months; so they must gather much grass, since the winter is often harsh and long in alpine meadows.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  As a result, grass is given less of a chance to grow back due to either the rapid consumption of grass or the continual stomping of the feet of these animals.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt; This latter suppression also encourages rats and insects to subsist here, both of which further inhibit the growth of grass.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;

===Small mammals===

An increase in some small animal populations has led to some [[grassland]]s being degraded.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  These animals include the Himalayan [[marmot]]s, the Brandt’s and plateau [[vole]], and the plateau [[pika]] and [[zokor]].&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt; They damage this environment mainly through their [[burrow]]ing into the ground and gnawing at the grass and other plants.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grassland Degredation on the"&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony |last=Arthur |author2=Roger Pech |author3=Jiebu |author4=Zhang Yanming |author5=Lin Hui |title=Grassland degradation on the Tibetan Plateau: the role of small mammals and methods of control|url=http://aciar.gov.au/publication/tr067|work=ACIAR Technical Report|publisher=Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these actions encourage soil [[erosion]] and make it more difficult for plants to firmly ground themselves to this poor [[terrain]].&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  Hence grass has a tougher time growing and the [[terrain]] becomes spottily doused with grass.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;
However, there are those who do not think that these animals contribute to grassland degradation.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  They claim that such [[burrow]]ing aids in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and that the rise in population is only normal since [[grazing]] levels in these areas have also risen.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grassland Degredation on the" /&gt;

===Climate change===

Climate Change has had noticeable role in grassland degradation, for its characteristics are not suitable for the growth of grass.&lt;ref name="Grasslands of the World"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Daniel J.|title=Grasslands of the World|date=2005|publisher=Fod{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|isbn=9251053375|pages=305–337|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/y8344e/y8344e00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in average temperatures of regions makes them less suitable for grass to grow due to the more rapid [[evaporation]] of water that was formerly utilized by the grass.&lt;ref name="Soil-Quality Effects" /&gt;  Furthermore, neither periods of much rain nor stretches of [[drought]], both of which become more prevalent with climate change, encourage the growing of grass.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  It is especially harmful when the times of drought are during growing season, as is the case near the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s in China.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  Additionally, since alpine regions, where degradation typically occurs, are commonly of high elevation, they are more easily affected by climate and its changes.&lt;ref name="Spatial Analysis of driving"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Suying |author2=Li, Lv |author3=Verburg, Wu|title=Spatial analysis of the driving factors of grassland degradation under conditions of climate change and intensive use in Inner Mongolia, China|journal=Regional Environmental Change|date=September 2012|volume=12|issue=3|pages=461–474|doi=10.1007/s10113-011-0264-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10113-011-0264-3|accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scientists, however, write off climate change as an insignificant cause of degradation.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;

===Human interference===

[[Human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] factors also play a role in the disturbance of grasslands.&lt;ref name="Spatial Analysis of driving" /&gt;  Degradation has been shown to appear when humans move into such areas to build, for example, roads or settlements.&lt;ref name="Quantitative Analysis of Driving" /&gt;  Roads reduce the area, in which grass can grow successfully; and the settlements constructed by herdsmen have proven to be the most damaging to grassland, since they are accompanied by their animals who further harm the region. Also when humans convert natural grassland into farmland, they often harshly farm it by repeatedly planting the same crops year after year and by having to do this, the soil quality is lowered when these crops suck the nutrients out of the ground.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  When the farmer is finally done with the land, it is in extremely poor condition for grass to grow.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt; Another cause of degradation by man is [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  When these trees are demolished and taken away, the soil lacks the strong root system formerly contributed by trees; therefore, the soil is upturned, cannot support plant life as well, and is more susceptible to landslides.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  Gathering of medicinal plants, particularly in China, also contributed to a certain extent to degraded grasslands, but this practice is not done as frequently anymore.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;

==Degrees of severity==

There are three main degrees of degraded grassland.&lt;ref name="Causes and Restoration of" /&gt;  In order of decreasing frequency, they are lightly, moderately, and highly degraded grassland.&lt;ref name="Causes and Restoration of" /&gt;  These stages are sequential so no grassland can be highly degraded without first being lightly and moderately degraded and so forth.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  Lightly degraded grassland is the least potent of the three and is characterized by patches of dead or no grass, spottily dispersed throughout the land.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;   Plant and animal diversity starts to lessen but becomes really apparent in moderately degraded grasslands, in which patches of dead grass increase in size and number.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spatial Analysis of driving" /&gt;  Also during this stage pests, be they rats, insects, or other grassland animals, start to disturb the environment by damaging the soil through, for instance, extracting from the soil nutrients vital to a plant’s well-being or by just damaging to plants themselves.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  The grasslands that are affected the worst are those that are highly degraded which can be recognized by its wide expanse of dead grass, a quality which makes this land neither arable nor suitable for [[livestock]].&lt;ref name="Soil-Quality Effects" /&gt;  Hence it makes sense that the animal and plant diversity is extremely low.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  The few plants that do inhabit this area are quite poisonous and ward off any animals or plants potentially trying to move back in.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;

Some specific names are given to highly degraded grasslands that are particularly damaged.&lt;ref name="Soil-Quality Effects" /&gt;  Heitutan is a term that simply signifies severely degraded grasslands.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  A more common and more extreme term to describe degraded grassland is “black beach” or “black-soil-land”, which is exactly what it sounds like: land with nothing but black, unusable soil that extends 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm below the ground level.&lt;ref name="Grasslands of the World" /&gt;  In the winter and autumn seasons, this land is naked of any vegetation whatsoever; but in the summer and spring, it is at least populated by toxic herbage.&lt;ref name="Soil-Quality Effects" /&gt;

==Consequences==
There are many results stemming from grassland degradation. Two of the more logical outcomes are the decrease in [[arable land]] and a drop off in the amount of crops harvested.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  These two similar outcomes in some way only lead to more degradation in that farmers, who now see their land as useless, just move on to perhaps a smaller plot of land, since that is all their money can afford, after having to surrender their prior property.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  Hence, smaller plots are easier to be overgrazed and worked to exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  Also, the numbers of livestock tend to decrease with grassland degradation, mainly because there is less grass to be eaten.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;

Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the [[biodiversity]] of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.&lt;ref name="Effect of Degradation Intensity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dong|first=Shikui |author2=Xiaoyan Li |author3=Yuanyuan Li |author4=Demei Liu |author5=Yushou Ma |author6=Jianjun Shi |author7=Yanlong Wang |author8=Lu Wen |title=Effect of Degradation Intensity on Grassland Ecosystem Services in the Alpine Region of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China|journal=PLOS ONE|date=March 4, 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=1–13|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058432|pmc=3587591|pmid=23469278}}&lt;/ref&gt; With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when [[disaster]]s strike it&lt;ref name="Spatial Analysis of driving" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quantitative Analysis of Driving" /&gt;  It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt; It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.&lt;ref name="Soil-Quality Effects" /&gt;  As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms.  Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.&lt;ref name="Spatial Analysis of driving" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Estimation of Grassland Degradation" /&gt;  [[Erosion]] of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.&lt;ref name="Estimation of Grassland Degradation" /&gt;

==Restorative methods==
Having significantly impacted many areas, some attempts of restoration have been made.&lt;ref name="Causes and Restoration of" /&gt;  In general, though, it takes some time for implanted methods to fully restore degraded grassland.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  Also, there are certain ways that degraded land should be counteracted, depending upon its severity.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  For an area that is lightly degraded, fencing, [[fertilizer|fertilizing]], or [[weed control|weeding]].&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt; Fencing an area off allows for that plot of land to be reprieved from grazing until it reaches its normal, healthy state, in which no more patches of dead grass exist.&lt;ref name="Causes and Restoration of" /&gt;  The earlier the problem is addressed, the easier it is to restore that plot of land.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  In some cases, grazing can even be continued as long as its intensity is decreased and the situation is monitored.&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  For instance, a method as simple as seasonally rotating fields in which animals graze have been see as effective.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  More structured efforts must be put into place to combat moderately degraded grasslands.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  These actions include reseeding and rodent control, whose goal is not to extinguish that population but rather to manage it so that it does not further degrade the land.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  Rodent control can be in the form of either shooting, [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilizing]], or [[poison]]ing the rodents.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt; The administered poison must have a low toxicity so that it does not cause further damage to other animals or plants; a popular toxin that has worked well is [[botulinum toxin|Botulin toxin]] C.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degredation on the" /&gt;

As for highly degraded plots of land, planting semi-artificial grassland is the umbrella-term that is used to address this type of restoration.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  It includes weed control, fertilizing, reseeding, rodent control, and [[scarification (botany)|scarification]].&lt;ref name="Grassland degradation in China: Methods" /&gt;  Since weeds are so numerous in highly degraded grasslands and since they suck so many nutrients from the soil, it is important to eradicate them as much as possible; and this is done so quite successfully by herbicide solutions.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  Semi-artificial grassland works best when the highly degraded land has 30% or more plant coverage.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  For degraded plots that are worse off, and hence typically fall under the category of black soil or severely degraded Heitutan grassland, artificial grassland is required and entails weed and rodent control, plowing, seeding, and fertilizing.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt; These two methods are successful at restoring plant life to a certain extent but are also somewhat expensive.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;  For this reason research must be done to foretell if this method would be successful by, for instance, determining whether such seeds would thrive in that environment.&lt;ref name="Restoration prospects for" /&gt;  Once an area of land is reduced from, for instance, heavily degraded to moderately degraded, the methods of restoring it must also change.&lt;ref name="Grassland Degradation and Our Strategies" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40284">'''Hispanophone'''{{efn-lr|{{lang-es|hispanohablante}}, {{lang|es|hispanoparlante|italic=yes}}, or {{lang|es|hispanófono|italic=yes}}}} and '''Hispanosphere''' are terms used to refer to [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-language speakers and the Spanish-speaking world, respectively. The terms derive from the [[Latin language|Latin]] political name of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Hispania]]. In addition to the general definition of Hispanophone, some groups in the Hispanic world make a distinction between Castilian-speaking{{efn-lr|{{lang-es|castellanohablante}}, {{lang|es|castellanoparlante|italic=yes}}, or {{lang|es|castellanófono|italic=yes}}}} and Spanish-speaking, with the former term denoting the speakers of the Spanish language—[[names given to the Spanish language|also known as Castilian]]—and the latter the speakers of the Spanish or Hispanic languages (i.e. the [[languages of Spain]] or the [[languages of Hispanic America|languages of the Hispanic nations]]).

In a cultural, rather than merely linguistic sense, the notion of "Hispanophone" goes further than the above definition. The [[Hispanic culture]] is the legacy of the [[Spanish Empire]], and so the term can refer to people whose cultural background is primarily associated with Spain, regardless of [[ethnicity|ethnic]] or geographical differences. The whole sense of identity of the Hispanic population and the Hispanophones is sometimes referred by the term ''[[Hispanidad]]'' (Hispanicity).

==Hispanosphere==
{{See also|Hispanicity|Spanish Empire}}

During the Spanish period between 1492 and 1898, many people from Spain [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|migrated to the new lands they had conquered]]. The [[Spaniards]] took with them their language and culture,
and integrated within the society they had settled, creating a large empire that stretched all over the world and producing several multiracial populations. Their influences are found in the following continents and countries that were originally colonized by the Spaniards.

====Spain====
{{Main|Languages of Spain}}
[[File:Spain languages-en.svg|thumb|300px|The languages of Spain]]

The modern-day people that live in the region of ancient [[Hispania]] are the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Andorra]]n and [[Gibraltarian]] people. [[History of Spain|Historically]], the modern country of Spain was formed by the accretion of several independent [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] kingdoms through dynastic inheritance, conquest and the will of the local elites. These kingdoms had their own nationalistic loyalties and political borders.

Today, there is no single Castilian–Spanish identity for the whole country. Spain is a ''de facto'' [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]]. Many Spanish citizens feel no conflict in recognising their multiple ethnic identities at the same time. Spain is a culturally heterogeneous country, home to a wide range of cultures, each one with its own customs and [[tradition]]s. Some such cultures have [[languages of Spain|their own language]]. Since the beginning of the [[transition to democracy in Spain]] and the creation of the Spanish ''[[autonomous communities]]'', after [[Francoist Spain]], there have been many movements towards more autonomy ([[decentralisation|delegation of powers]]) in certain territories of the country, some with the aim of achieving full independence and others with the goal of improving the system of devolution and the state of the autonomies (or self-government entities) .

The existence of multiple distinct cultures in Spain allows an analogy to be drawn to the [[United Kingdom]]. Using the term Spanish for someone of Spanish descent would then be expected to be equivalent to using [[British people|Briton]] to describe someone descending from some part of the United Kingdom. Cultures within the United Kingdom, such as [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and [[Welsh people|Welsh]], would then correspond in this analogy to cultures within Spain such as [[Castilian people|Castilian]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]], [[Galician people|Galician]] and [[Basque people|Basque]] among others. In contrast with Spain, because of centuries of gradual and mutual consolidation across the Iberian Peninsula, such distinctions tend to be blurred. It is a subtle, yet important, distinction.

In Spain, as in the United Kingdom, the economically dominant territories—[[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[England]]—spread their language for mutual communication. However, the political dominance in the United Kingdom tends to be sharper compared to Spain, where most of [[History of Spain#Kingdom of Spain|medieval realms]] do not correspond with the actual boundaries of the autonomous communities, and the crown was unified into a sole [[Monarchy of Spain|monarch]]. For instance, Spanish people in modern times never refer to King Felipe VI of Spain as "the King of Castile," whereas the British sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, is sometimes referred to colloquially as "the Queen of England."

=====Origins and demography=====
U.S. Hispanics are citizens of the [[United States]] whose ancestry or national origin is of any of the nations composing the Hispanosphere. A Hispanic person's status is independent from whether or not he or she speaks the Spanish language, for not all Hispanic Americans speak Spanish. A Hispanic person may be of any race (White, Amerindian, mixed, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander). {{As of|2013}} Hispanics accounted for 17.1% of the population, around 53.2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/hispanic/files/2013/CPS-2013%20-%20Hispanic%20-%20FINAL%20tab1.xlsx Table 1. Population by Sex, Age, Hispanic Origin, and Race.] US Census Bureau, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase of 29% since 2004, when Hispanics were 14.1% of the population (around 41.3 million people). The Hispanic growth rate over the July 1, 2003 to July 1, 2004 period was 3.6% — higher than any other ancestral group in the United States — and more than three times the rate of the nation's total population (at 1.0%). The projected Hispanic population of the United States for July 1, 2050, is 105.6 million people. According to this projection, Hispanics will constitute 25% of the nation’s total population by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/001720.html | title = Census Bureau Projects Tripling of Hispanic and Asian Populations in 50 Years; Non-Hispanic Whites May Drop To Half of Total Population | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313083717/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/001720.html | archivedate = 2008-03-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a continuous Hispanic presence in the territory of the United States has existed since the 16th century, earlier than any other group after the [[Native Americans in the United States|Amerindians]]. Spaniards pioneered the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing on the continent was that of [[Juan Ponce de León]], who landed in 1513 on the shore he christened ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''. Within three decades of Ponce de León's landing, the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Grand Canyon]], and the [[Great Plains]]. Spanish ships sailed along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], penetrating to present-day [[Bangor, Maine]], and up the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] as far as [[Oregon]]. From 1528 to 1536, four castaways from a Spanish expedition, including a black [[Moors|Moor]], journeyed all the way from Florida to the [[Gulf of California]], 267 years before the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1540 [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] undertook an extensive exploration of the present United States. In the same year [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] led 2,000 Spaniards and Mexican Indians across today's [[Arizona]]–[[Mexico]] border and traveled as far as central [[Kansas]], close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States. Other Spanish explorers of the United States make up a long list that includes, among others, [[Lucas Vásquez de Ayllón]], [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]], [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], [[Gaspar de Portolà]], [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], [[Tristán de Luna y Arellano]], and [[Juan de Oñate]]. In all, Spaniards probed half of today's lower 48 states before the first English colonization attempt at [[Roanoke Island]] in 1585.

The Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States, at [[St. Augustine, Florida]], in 1565. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] also predates [[Jamestown, Virginia]] (founded in 1607) and [[Plymouth Colony]] (of ''[[Mayflower]]'' and [[Pilgrims]] fame, founded in 1620). Later came Spanish settlements in [[San Antonio]], [[Tucson]], [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[San Francisco]], to name just a few. The Spanish even established a [[Jesuit]] [[Ajacán Mission|mission]] in [[Virginia]]'s [[Chesapeake Bay]] 37 years before the founding of Jamestown.

Two iconic American stories have Spanish antecedents, too. Almost 80 years before [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]]'s alleged rescue by [[Pocahontas]], a man by the name of [[Juan Ortiz de Zárate|Juan Ortiz]] told of his remarkably similar rescue from execution by an Indian girl. Spaniards also held a [[thanksgiving]]—56 years before the famous Pilgrims [[Harvest festival|festival]]—when they feasted near St. Augustine with Florida Indians, probably on stewed pork and garbanzo beans. As late as 1783, at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Spain held claim to roughly half of today's continental United States (see [[New Spain]]); in 1775, Spanish ships even reached [[Alaska]]. From 1819 to 1848, the United States and its army increased the nation's area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, including today's three most populous states: [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[Florida]]. Hispanics became the first American citizens in the newly acquired [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] territory and remained the ancestral majority in several states until the 20th century.

Hispanic Americans have fought in all the [[List of United States military history events|wars of the United States]] and have earned some of the highest distinctions awarded to U.S. soldiers ([[list of Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.army.mil/otf/speech.php?story_id_key=9575 U.S. Army document] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325083030/http://www4.army.mil/otf/speech.php?story_id_key=9575 |date=2007-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/memorial.html The Hispanic Experience - Contributions to America's Defense].

Rochin and Lionel Fernández&lt;/ref&gt; Historic figures in the United States have been Hispanic from early times. Some recent famous people include actress [[Rita Hayworth]] and baseball legends [[Lefty Gomez]] and [[Ted Williams]].

=====National Hispanic Heritage Month=====
The National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated in the United States from September 15 to October 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/hispanic/|title=Hispanic Heritage Month -- National Register of Historic Places Official Website--Part of the National Park Service|work=nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial diversity====
{{Main|Hispanic}}
The term ''Hispanic'' is cultural and not racial. The racial diversity found among Hispanics stems from the fact that Hispanic America has always been, since 1492, an area of immigration until late in the 20th century, when the region has increasingly become an area of emigration. Even outside the broad U.S. definition of Hispanic, the term encompasses a very racially and ethnically diverse population. While in the United States, Hispanics are often treated as a group apart from [[white (people)|whites]], [[black (people)|blacks]] or other races, they actually include people who may identify with any or all of those racial groups.

In the American mass media as well as popular culture, Hispanic is often incorrectly used to describe a subject's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[human physical appearance|physical appearance]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In general, Hispanics are assumed to have traits such as dark hair and eyes, and brown or olive skin. Many others are viewed as physically intermediate between [[whites]], [[Black people|blacks]] and/or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] and/or [[Asian people|Asians]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Hispanics with mostly [[Caucasoid]] or [[Negroid]] features may not be recognized as such in the [[United States]] in spite of the ethnic and racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations. Hispanics who do not look like the stereotypical Hispanic may have their ancestral status questioned or even challenged by others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Actors [[Martin Sheen]], [[Alexis Bledel]] and [[Cameron Diaz]], for example, are Hispanic even though they may be presumed not to be so because, being white, they do not fit the stereotype. If Hispanics with mostly [[Caucasoid]] features are to be considered Hispanic, they have stereotypical [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]/Southern European appearance - [[olive skin]], dark hair, and dark eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlcatp.org/typical-stereotypes-of-hispanics/ "Typical stereotypes of Hispanics"], NLCATP (National Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco Prevention), March 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100503161421.htm Genetic makeup of Hispanic/Latino Americans influenced by Native American, European and African-American ancestries], Science Daily, May 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watch this YouTube video that shows faces of white Latin Americans, look for the white Latin Americans with Mediterranean/Southern European pigmentation that stereotypes most of white Latin Americans and white Hispanic and Latino Americans. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoISFZvzYsg&lt;/ref&gt;

A great proportion of Hispanics identify as [[mestizo|half-caste]] (mixed European and Amerindian) regardless of national origin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This is largely because most Hispanics have their origins in majority half-caste Hispanic American countries. [[El Salvador]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Mexico]] are examples of mostly half-caste populations, with 90% of Salvadorans, 95% of Paraguayans, and 70% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Mexico%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia|title=Mexico|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Mexicans identifying as mestizo, with Mexico having the largest total mestizo population at over 66 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title=The World Factbook |accessdate=2008-06-23 |date=July 2008 &lt;!-- estimates --&gt; |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many individuals identified as Hispanics (based on the U.S. definition) are of unmixed [[Amerindian]] ancestry. For example, many of those from [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Peru]] constitute a majority or plurality of the population as do a considerable proportion in [[Mexico]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Many Hispanics born in or with descent from the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Uruguay]], and other countries may be of African descent, be it [[mulatto]] (mixed European and black African), [[zambo]] (mixed Amerindian and black African), [[Multiracial|triracial]] (specifically European, black African, and Amerindian), or unmixed black African. Recently, Hispanics of unmixed black African blood are perceived and defined by American mass media and popular culture as Hispanic, because of existing mulatto Hispanics of Negroid phenotypes and the dark-skinned stereotype of Hispanics.

The majority of people in [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Chile]] are largely of European descent; not only of [[Spaniards|Spanish]] Europeans, but [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[German people|German]], [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[British people|British]], etc. In countries like [[Mexico]], there was a process of [[miscegenation]], which resulted in many people having both indigenous and European origins. Many [[white Mexicans]], though labeled ''Hispanic'' by the U.S. definition because of their assimilated culture and country of birth, trace their ancestries to European countries other than Spain, and some to non-European countries (see next paragraph). Nevertheless, in most cases, they have some Spanish ancestry, as the waves of European immigrants to these countries tended to quickly assimilate, intermarrying with the country's local population. (From 1850 to 1920, the U.S. Census form did not distinguish between whites and Mexican Americans.&lt;ref name="rutgers"/&gt;  In 1930, the U.S. Census form asked for "color or race," and census enumerators were instructed to write ''W'' for white and ''Mex'' for Mexican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogybranches.com/1930census.html|title=US Population in the 1930 Census by Race|first=Joe|last=Beine|website=Genealogybranches.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1940 and 1950, the census reverted its decision and made Mexicans be classified as white again and thus the instructions were to "Report ''white'' (W) for Mexicans unless they were definitely of full Indigenous Indian or other non-white races (such as Black or Asian)."&lt;ref name="rutgers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~vbashi/soc108-handout-census.htm|title=The Race Question&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Rci.rutgers.edu|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Initially colonial [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Chile]] had predominately mestizo population, but because of a massive European migration (mostly Spaniards and Italians, with Germans, British, Polish, etc.) in the 19th century, and the repeated intermarriage with white Europeans and Middle Easterners, like white Mexicans, they also have some Spanish blood, wherein the mestizo population became a so-called [[castizo]] population; with more European settlers arriving in the early 20th century, the population of Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile has overwhelmingly become white and European (some Middle Eastern) in race, culture and tradition.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Like mentioned above, the Hispanics of Caucasian race, including white Mexicans, white Argentines, and white Uruguayans, who are perceived by U.S. mass media as well as general U.S. popular culture as Hispanic usually possess stereotypical Mediterranean appearance 

Likewise, a percentage of Hispanics as defined by the U.S. government trace their ancestries to the [[Middle East]], for example [[Colombia]]ns, [[Ecuador]]ians and [[Mexico|Mexican]]s of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] or [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ancestry; Hispanics of Middle Eastern ancestry are usually to be considered Hispanic by the U.S. government, because they possess stereotypical Southern European appearance. Many Hispanics are of [[East Asia]]n ancestry, as in the case of [[Cubans]], [[Mexicans]], [[Panama]]nians and [[Peru]]vians of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and/or [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent. If they were to migrate to the United States, the definition most frequently advocated would consider them Hispanic (''see also: [[Asian Latin American|Asian Hispanic American]] and [[Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans]]'').

The presence of these mentioned ethnic groups are not country-specific, since they can be found in every Hispanic American country, whether as larger of smaller proportions of their respective populations. Even in Spain, the European [[motherland]] of Hispanicity, recent decades has seen a growing population of mestizos and mulattoes and of unmixed Amerindian and African descent due to the reversal of the historic [[Old World]]-to-[[New World]] migration pattern, i.e.: Latin American immigration to Spain.

Of the over 35 million Hispanics counted in the [[United States Census, 2000|Federal 2000 Census]], 47.9% identified as [[White (people)|White]] (termed [[white Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanic]] by the Census Bureau); 42.2% some other race; 6.3% two or more races; 2% Black or African American; 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native; 0.3% Asian; and 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/cenbr01-1.pdf | title = Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin | accessdate = 2006-12-27 |date= March 2001 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that even among those Hispanics who reported one race only, most would also possess at least some ancestral lineage from one or more other races, despite the fact that only 6.3% reported as such (this is also applicable to the non-Hispanics counted in the U.S. Census, although maybe in less proportion).

According to one study (Stephens et al. 2001), from the genetic perspective, Hispanics generally represent a differential mixture of European, Native American, and African ancestry, with the proportionate mix typically depending on country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shrn.stanford.edu/workshops/revisitingrace/Risch_confound.pdf Stephens' study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227091932/http://shrn.stanford.edu/workshops/revisitingrace/Risch_confound.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}, Standord University&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations of Iberia (both Spain and Portugal), like all European populations, have received multiple other influences, even though they are still largely descended from the prehistoric European populations, and to a greater degree than any other major group.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Cite journal|last=Dupanloup|first=Isabelle|last2=Bertorelle|first2=Giorgio|last3=Chikhi|first3=Lounès|last4=Barbujani|first4=Guido|date=2004-07-01|title=Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/21/7/1361/1080442|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1361–1372|doi=10.1093/molbev/msh135|issn=0737-4038}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancestry of Iberians has thus received many, (limited and often very localized) influences from the many people who settled on its territory throughout history, including [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Punics]], [[Celts]], [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], [[Visigoths]], [[Alans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] ([[saqaliba]]), [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Arabs]], [[Magyars]], [[Jews]], and—particularly in Andalusia—[[Romani people|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Genetic history of the Iberian Peninsula]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
====Angola====
The former Portuguese colony has a community of Afro-Cubans known as Amparos. They descend from Afro-Cuban soldiers brought to the country in 1975 as a result of the Cuban involvement in the [[Cold War]]. [[Fidel Castro]] deployed thousands of troops to the country during the [[Angolan Civil War]]. As a result of this era, there exists a small Spanish-speaking community in [[Angola]] of Afro-Cubans numbering about 100,000.

====Equatorial Guinea====
{{Main|Spanish Guinea}}
In the former Spanish province of [[Equatorial Guinea]], the majority of the population speak Spanish{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, there is a small minority of African people who possessed Spanish and other European ancestry. These individuals form less than 1% of the population.

====Morocco====
{{Main|Spanish Morocco}}
In the former Spanish protectorate of [[Morocco]], Spanish speakers are present in small numbers, located in the northern coastal region of the country. However the majority of Moroccan people are predominantly Muslims of [[Berber people|Berber]] and African ancestry.

====Nigeria====
The small Amaro population are descendants of repatriated [[Afro-Cuban]] indentured servants.

====Spanish territories in North Africa====
{{Main|Autonomous cities of Spain}}{{dn|date=September 2017}}
{{See also|Plazas de soberanía|Ceuta|Melilla|Chafarinas Islands|Peñón de Alhucemas|Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Canary Islands}}
Since the [[Reconquista]], [[Spain]] has held numerous emplacements in [[North Africa]]. Most of them were promptly lost, but to date, with an approximate population of 143,000 people, the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|autonomous cities]] of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], which constitute the two ''plazas de soberanía mayores'' (Major Territories under [Spanish] Sovereignty) remained Spanish, and the [[Chafarinas Islands]], the [[Peñón de Alhucemas]] and the [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera]], which constitute the three ''plazas de soberanía menores'' (Minor Territories under [Spanish] Sovereignty), still forming part of Spain. The [[Canary Islands]], a constituent part of Spain's main territorial subdivisions, are also located in North Africa.

====Western Sahara====
{{Main|Spanish Sahara}}
In the former Spanish province of [[Western Sahara]], Spanish is ''de facto'' official (however, in the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], one of the claimants to the territory, it is ''de jure'' co-official).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/cr/471/471192/471192fr.pdf ''Rapport de la Présidente de la délégation ad hoc Sahara Occidental, Mme Catherine Lalumière, Vice-Présidente du Parlement européen'']&lt;/ref&gt; Most Arabic speakers speak Spanish as second language.

===Asia===
====Philippines====
{{see also|Spanish Filipino|Philippine Spanish|Chavacano|Captaincy General of the Philippines}}

In the [[Philippines]], a [[Spanish Filipino]] is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] who has Spanish or Hispanic lineage and descent, mostly born and raised in the Philippines. Most common languages spoken today by Spanish Filipinos are [[Philippine Spanish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; [[Chavacano]], the only Spanish-based creole language in Asia and is spoken by over a million people; and [[English language|English]], which is used in the public sphere. A number of Spanish Filipinos also speak other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].

Section 7, Article XIV of the [[1987 Constitution|1987 Philippine Constitution]] specifies Spanish (along with [[Arabic]]) as a language to "be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis", while the [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language]] ({{lang-es|Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española}}) remains the state regulating body for the language. [[Castilian Spanish]] is the sole dialectal standard taught in schools, while [[Philippine Spanish]] currently has a few thousand native speakers left.

Despite its rapid decline in the 20th century, there has been a revival of interest in the Spanish language in the first decade of the 21st century. Since the rule of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] (herself a fluent speaker), Spanish is slowly being re-introduced into the [[Education in the Philippines|educational system]], with a revival of Spanish-language media including ''Filipinas Ahora Mismo'' ({{lang-tl|Filipinas Ora Mismo}}), a radio programme broadcast on [[Radio Manila FM]].

Many [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] including [[Filipino language|Filipino]] notably contain numerous [[Spanish language in the Philippines#Influence on the languages of the Philippines|loanwords of Spanish origin]].

===Pacific Islands===
====Easter Island (Rapa Nui)====
Spanish is the official language of [[Easter Island]], a territorial possession of [[Chile]] in [[Polynesia]].

====Mariana Islands====
{{Main|Guam|Northern Mariana Islands}}
The [[Mariana Islands]] (today split between the [[United States territory]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]]) were formerly governed as a part of the [[Spanish East Indies]], and thus many [[Chamorros]] possess some degree of Spanish admixture.

While most people living on these islands no longer speak Spanish, the native [[Chamorro language]] exhibits a noticeable Spanish influence in its vocabulary. Many Chamorros have also preserved Hispanic cultural elements such as [[party|fiesta]]s, [[cockfight]]ing, and the [[Catholic]] faith despite having integrated with the American way of life.

Spanish surnames are still prevalent on Guam, it is spoken by Catholic people and [[Puerto Ricans]], and the custom of women keeping their [[maiden name]]s after marriage is a both byproduct of Spanish culture on these islands as well as the [[matrilineal]] structure of indigenous [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] culture.

'''ISO 3166-2:PY''' is the entry for [[Paraguay]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Paraguay, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[departments of Paraguay|1 capital and 17 departments]]. The capital of the country [[Asunción]] has special status equal to the departments.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|PY}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Paraguay. The second part is either of the following:
* two digits (1&amp;ndash;16, 19): departments
* three letters: capital district

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''John Dunkin''' (1782–1846) was an English [[topographer]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}}

==Life==
He was the son of John Dunkin of Bicester, Oxfordshire, by his wife, Elizabeth, widow of [[John Telford]], and daughter of Thomas and [[Johanna Timms]], was born at Bicester on 16 May 1782. While attending the free school of that town, he met with a severe accident, and for many years it was feared that he would remain a cripple for life. He employed the leisure thus imposed upon him chiefly by scribbling verses, but contrived at the same time to pick up some knowledge of history and archæology.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}}

After serving an apprenticeship to a printer, and living for a while in London, he established himself before 1815 as a bookseller, stationer, and printer at [[Bromley, Kent]]. Here he published his first topographical work, a compilation in part from Philipott, [[Edward Hasted|Hasted]], and Lysons, entitled ''Outlines of the History and Antiquities of Bromley in Kent. … To which is added an investigation of the Antiquities of Holwood Hill'' … by … [[A. J. Kempe]], octavo, Bromley, 1815. It was followed the next year by ''The History and Antiquities of Bicester. .. To which is added an Inquiry into the History of Alchester, a city of the Dobuni. … With an Appendix and … Kennetts Glossary'', 2 parts, octavo, London, 1816.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}}

In 1819, he commenced arranging for the press his account of the hundreds of Bullington and Ploughley, Oxfordshire, for which he had previously collected large materials. His son writes:{{quote|The following year was devoted principally to re-examinations of the towns, villages, &amp;c., together with a personal superintendence of the great excavations he was conducting at Ambrosden and Bicester,}} the particulars of which will be found detailed in the Appendix. In 1823, the work appeared under the title of ''Oxfordshire: the History and Antiquities of the Hundreds of Bullington and Ploughley'', &amp;c., 2 vols. quarto, London. The impression was limited to a hundred copies, of which seventy only were for sale.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=203}}

In 1837, Dunkin moved to Dartford, where three years previously he had commenced to build himself a large printing establishment. Shortly afterwards he opened a branch business at Gravesend. In 1844, he published his ''History and Antiquities of Dartford with Topographical Notices of the Neighbourhood'', octavo, London, Dartford [printed]. 
Thenceforward, he occupied himself in arranging the materials he had accumulated for the histories of Oxfordshire and Kent.{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=202}} He was an original member of the [[British Archæological Association]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=203}}

He died on 22 December 1846, and by his desire was buried on the eastern side of the lichgate of St. Edmund's cemetery, Dartford, as near as possible to the burying-ground of Noviomagus, which he had described in his last work. {{sfn|Goodwin|1888|p=203}}&lt;ref&gt;A brass was erected to his memory in that part of Dartford parish church which by the 1870s was occupied by the organ ({{harvnb|Goodwin|1888|p=203}} cites the ''[[Dartford Chronicle]]'', 8 February 1879).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunkin|first1=John|title=The History and Antiquities of Dartford|date=1844|page=xxiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cn8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=noviomagus&amp;pg=PR24#v=onepage&amp;q=noviomagus&amp;f=false|quote=After these extracts from Mr Alfred John Dunkin's articles in the Gentleman's Magazine and his Kentish Chronicles probably the reader will expect some reasons should be assigned for considering Dartford the antient Roman station of Noviomagus ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunkin's collections were given to the Guildhall Library by his daughter Ellen in 1886 and since 1954 those relating to Oxfordshire have been housed in the [[Bodleian Library]].{{sfn|Goodwin|Bell|2004}}

==Family==
In 1807, he married Anne, the daughter of [[William Chapman (engineer)|William Chapman]] of Lincolnshire, a well-known civil engineer, by whom he left issue a son, [[Alfred John Dunkin]], and a daughter, Ellen Elizabeth Dunkin. His widow survived him nineteen years, dying at Dartford on 12 March 1865, aged 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|1888|p=203}} cites ''[[Gentlemen's Magazine]]''. 3rd series volume 18 page 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ogilby''' (also ''Ogelby'', ''Oglivie''; November 1600 &amp;ndash; 4 September 1676) was a Scottish [[translator]], [[impresario]] and [[cartographer]]. Best known for publishing the first British [[road atlas]], he was also a successful translator, noted for publishing his work in handsome illustrated editions.

==Life==
Ogilby was born in or near Killemeare (Kirriemuir), Scotland in November 1600.  When his father was made a prisoner within the jurisdiction of the [[King's Bench]], presumably for [[bankruptcy]] or [[debt]], young John supported the family and used some of the money he earned to buy two lottery tickets, which won him a minor prize. This he used to apprentice himself to a dancing master and to obtain his father's release. By further good management of his finances, he was able to buy himself an early completion of his apprenticeship and set up a dancing school of his own. However, a fall while dancing in a [[masque]] lamed him for life and ended this career.

Using contacts made among his high-born clients, Ogilby was eventually taken to Ireland by [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], on his appointment as [[lord deputy]] there, and became tutor to his children.  Ogilby then went on to establish Ireland's first theatre, the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]], as a consequence of which he was made deputy-[[Master of the Revels]] in 1637. For the four years that the theatre was open it was a great success but it had to be closed as a result of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]].

Having narrowly missed being blown up in the castle he was defending, and after being shipwrecked on his homeward journey, Ogilby arrived back in England penniless and without a patron during the closing years of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Finding his way on foot to [[Cambridge]], he learned [[Latin]] from kindly scholars who had been impressed by his industry. He then ventured to translate [[Virgil]] into English verse (1649–1650), which brought him a considerable sum of money. The success of this attempt encouraged Ogilby to learn Greek from David Whitford, who was usher in the school kept by [[James Shirley]] the dramatist.

After his return to London in 1650, he married the widow Christina Hunsdon, who had three children by her earlier marriage. In the following year he published the first edition of his politicised ''The fables of Aesop paraphras'd in verse, and adorn'd with sculpture and illustrated with annotations'', illustrated by [[Francis Cleyn]]. The next few years were spent in translating and the opening of a publishing business in London. The Restoration of Charles II brought favour back to Ogilby with a commission to help in the arrangements for the coronation in 1660 with the composing of speeches and songs. In that year too he brought out his translation of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', dedicated to his royal patron. A year later he was again made Master of the Revels in Ireland and he set about the building of a [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|new theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin]]. The libretto of the musical play ''Pompey'' by [[Katherine Philips]], performed at Smock Alley in 1663, credits him as the composer of the tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=John Ogilby|author=Brian Boydell|access-date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1665 Ogilby had returned to London and published a second, revised edition of ''The Fables of Aesop'', this time illustrated by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]]'s renowned prints. He had to republish the book in 1668&lt;ref&gt;A facsimile edition was published in 1965 by the Augustan Reprint Society, Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt; since his property was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666. Rebuilding in [[Whitefriars, London|Whitefriars]], he set up a printing press there from which he issued many magnificent books, the most important of which were a series of [[atlases]], with engravings and maps by Hollar and others. 

In 1674 Ogilby had been appointed "His Majesty's Cosmographer and Geographic Printer". The ''Britannia'' atlas of 1675 set the standard for the road maps that followed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} At that period some of the minor roads used the local mile rather than the standard mile of 1760 standard yards which Ogilby adopted in his atlas. One hundred strip road maps are shown, accompanied by a double-sided page of text giving additional advice for the map's use. Another innovation was Ogilby's scale of one inch to the mile (1/63360). These are marked and numbered on each map, the miles further being divided into furlongs. In his 2008 [[Terry Jones' Great Map Mystery|television series]] Terry Jones claimed that one of the map's purposes was to facilitate a Catholic takeover of the kingdom, an interpretation that one historian agreed was 'significant and highly plausible'.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Parker, ''Map Addict: A Tale of Obsession, Fudge &amp; the Ordnance Survey'', London UK 2010, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xhMcRPOV4vUC&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;ots=cgWVRQxgBS&amp;dq=Terry%20Jones%20%20Ogilby's%20maps&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q=Terry%20Jones%20%20Ogilby's%20maps&amp;f=false pp.214-16]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the map's publication, Ogilby died in 1676 and was buried at [[St Bride's Church]], one of Sir [[Christopher Wren]]'s new London churches.

==Literary reputation==
In the years that followed, Ogilby's reputation as a translator was to suffer from the attacks made on him by [[John Dryden]] in his satirical ''[[MacFlecknoe]]'', and by [[Alexander Pope]] in ''[[The Dunciad]]''. Whatever the justice of these, it should be borne in mind that Dryden had himself translated the work of Virgil, as Pope had of Homer, so it was in their interest to encourage a preference for their own products. Following their lead, the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] used Ogilby's work to illustrate the idea that common sense frequently appeals to a "standard of taste" in aesthetic matters: 'Whoever would assert an equality of genius and elegance between Ogilby and [[John Milton|Milton]], or [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]] and [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], would be thought to defend no less an extravagance, than if he had maintained a [[mole-hill]] to be as high as [[Tenerife|Teneriffe]], or a pond as extensive as the ocean.' (Hume, "Of the Standard of Taste", originally published in his ''Four Dissertations'' (1757).)

Such judgments stuck and it is only recently that Ogilby's work has again been given scholarly attention, particularly his versions of Aesop's Fables.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Eames, ''John Ogilby and his Aesop'', Bulletin of the New York Public Library 65 (1961), pp 73-88

* Katherine Acheson: ''The Picture of Nature: Seventeenth-Century English Aesop's Fables'', Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies (IX.2, Fall/Winter 2009), pp. 25-50&lt;/ref&gt; These, according to the short life of him published by [[Theophilus Cibber]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CzcJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=john+ogilby&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EhhjTMC1DoisOPG6-P4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20ogilby&amp;f=false ''The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol 2, London 1753, pp265-8; an online version is at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; were 'generally confessed to have exceeded whatever hath been done before in that kind'. They renewed interest in the fable as a literary medium and led the way in suggesting their adaptation to the troubled politics of the time. Both Dryden and Pope were as indebted to him in this as Dryden was for certain lines in his own translation of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mRsNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=john+ogilby&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GRZjTI6lI8ybOP3PyOwJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20ogilby&amp;f=false L.

'''Ladd Reef''' ({{lang-vi|Đá Lát}}; {{zh|c=日积礁|p=Rìjī jiāo}}) is a [[Vietnam]]-controlled [[reef]] in the [[Spratly]] group of islands, [[South China Sea]].  [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] are also claimants of the reef. Like [[Spratly Island]], Ladd Reef lies to the west of the Philippines-defined "[[Kalayaan Islands]]" claim area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/1978/06/11/presidential-decree-no-1596-s-1978/ |year=1978 |title=Presidential Decree No. 1596 (Philippines) |publisher=The Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The English name ''Ladd Reef'' was coined by [[Richard Spratly]] in late March 1843, after Captain Ladd of the ship ''Austen'', who seemed to be the first to have seen the reef.&lt;ref name=Durham&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hancox, David |author2=Prescott, Victor |title=A Geographical Description of the Spratly Islands and an Account of Hydrographic Surveys amongst Those Islands |year=1995 |publisher=University of Durham, International Boundaries Research Unit|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ibru/publications/view/?id=229 |series=Maritime Briefings |volume=1 |isbn=978-1897643181 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Qu9fi-luTYC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=%22ladd+reef%22+spratly+%22atoll%22&amp;hl=vi 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese name ''Rìjī Jiāo'' was coined in 1947 to replace the 1935 name ''Lādé Jiāo'' (拉德礁),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hnszw.org.cn/data/news/2009/06/43675/ |script-title=zh:南海诸岛中外地名对照表 |publisher=海南史志网 |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |language=Chinese}} (Contains a list of maritime features in the South China Sea, with their English names, and their Chinese names in 1935, 1947 and 1983.)&lt;/ref&gt; which was transliterated from the English name ''Ladd''.

==Geography==
Ladd Reef lies west of [[Dangerous Ground (Spratly Islands)|Dangerous Ground]] in the western half of the [[List of maritime features in the Spratly Islands|Spratly Islands]], to the south of [[Coronation Bank]], southwest of [[West London Reef]] (West Reef) and {{convert|15|nmi}} west of  [[Spratly Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sta Ana |first1=D.J. |title=Vietnam also has garrisons in PH zone of Spratlys |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/4119/vietnam-also-has-garrisons-in-ph-zone-of-spratlys |accessdate=6 June 2014 |publisher=Interaksyon |date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coral reef lies on a northeast-southwest axis, {{convert|3|nmi}} in length, {{convert|1|nmi}} in width, and spans over an area of {{convert|9.9|km2|ha acre sqmi}}. It is entirely submerged during high tide, but there are some stones jutting out of the sea during low tide.&lt;ref name="vnnavy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Những điều cần biết về hai quần đảo Hoàng Sa, Trường Sa và khu vực thềm lục địa phía nam [What you need to know about Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands and southern continental shelf] |year=2011 |publisher=Political Department, Naval Command (Vietnam)|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures ==
The reef is uninhabited but contains a Vietnamese [[lighthouse]] (built in 1994)&lt;ref name=lighthouse&gt;{{cite web |title= Lighthouses of the Spratly Islands |date= 15 November 2013 |author= Russ Rowlett |publisher= University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |accessdate= 6 June 2014 |url= http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/spr.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the inscription ''Hải đăng đá Lát''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photo of Lighthouse on Ladd reef |url=http://www.timawa.net/forum/index.php?topic=32563.15 |website=timawa.net/ |publisher=Timawa - Forum |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "Ladd Reef Lighthouse"). The lower portion of the lighthouse consists of quarters for a handful of Vietnamese soldiers and the lighthouse keeper.

==Other information==
In 1945, towards the end of the [[Second World War]], a Dutch submarine ([[HNLMS O-19]]) ran aground on Ladd Reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spruijt |first1=Siem |title=The Ladd reef Incident |url= http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/specials/special_fatalpatrolo19.htm |website=dutchsubmarines.com |publisher=Dutch Submarines |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each official flag is based on the coat of arms for the county, see [[Commons:Coat of arms of counties of Sweden|gallery]], and used on buildings etc. used by respective county administration. Unofficial flags are used by private and local people.

Swedish municipals often use flags that simply are the actual coat of arms transferred into a flag. See [[List of municipalities of Sweden]] where you can see the arms and links to each municipal.

This is a '''list of slums'''. A [[slum]] as defined by the [[United Nations]] agency [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-Habitat]], is a run-down area of a city characterized by substandard housing, squalor, and lacking in tenure security. According to the United Nations, the percentage of urban dwellers living in slums decreased from 47 percent to 37 percent in the developing world between 1990 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, 2007.

'''Livonia''' ({{lang-liv|Līvõmō}}, {{lang-et|Liivimaa}}, [[German language|German]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]]: ''{{lang|de|Livland}}'', [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and {{lang-lt|Livonija}}, {{lang-pl|Inflanty}}, archaic English ''Livland'',&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |noprescript=1 |wstitle=Livonia |volume=16|pages=816–817}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liwlandia''; {{lang-ru|Лифляндия|Liflyandiya}}) is a [[historical region]] on the eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Originally named after the [[Livonians]], who lived on the shores of present-day [[Latvia]], the term was first used to denote the area inhabited by the Livonian tribes.

By the end of the 13th century the name was extended to most of present-day [[Estonia]] and Latvia that had been conquered during the [[Livonian Crusade]] (1193–1290) by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]. Medieval Livonia, or [[Terra Mariana]], reached its greatest extent after [[Saint George's Night Uprising]] that forced [[Denmark]] in 1346 to sell the [[Duchy of Estonia (1219–1346)|Duchy of Estonia]] (northern Estonia conquered by Denmark in the 13th century) to the [[State of the Teutonic Order]]. Livonia, as understood after the retreat of Denmark in 1346, bordered on the [[Gulf of Finland]] in the north, [[Lake Peipus]] and [[Russia]] to the east, and [[Lithuania]] to the south.

As a consequence of the [[Livonian War]] in the 16th century, the territory of Livonia was reduced to the southern half of Estonia and the northern half of Latvia.

The indigenous inhabitants of Livonia were various [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] tribes in the north and [[Balts|Baltic]] tribes in the south. The descendants of the crusaders formed the nucleus of the new ruling class of Livonia after the Livonian Crusade, and eventually became known as [[Baltic Germans]].

== History ==

[[File:Europe mediterranean 1190.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Livonia in [[Europe]], 1190 [[AD]]]]
Beginning in the 12th century, Livonia was an area of economic and political expansion by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] and [[Germans]], particularly by the [[Hanseatic League]] and the [[Cistercian Order]]. 
Around 1160, Hanseatic traders from [[Lübeck]] established a trading post on the site of the future city of [[Riga]], which [[Albert of Riga|Albrecht von Buxthoeven]] founded in 1201.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He ordered the construction of a cathedral and became the first [[Prince-Bishop]] of Livonia.

=== Livonian Brothers of the Sword 1204–1237 ===
{{main|Livonian Brothers of the Sword}}

Bishop [[Albert of Riga]] (Albert of Buxhoeveden) founded the [[Military order (society)|military order]] of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword ({{lang-la|Fratres militiæ Christi Livoniae}}, {{lang-de|Schwertbrüderorden}}) in 1202; [[Pope Innocent III]] sanctioned the establishment in 1204. The membership of the order comprised [[Germans|German]] "warrior [[monk]]s".  Alternative names of the order include the Christ Knights, Sword Brethren, and The Militia of Christ of Livonia. Following their defeat by [[History of Lithuania (1219–1295)|Lithuania]] in the [[Battle of Saule]] in 1236, the surviving Brothers merged into the [[Teutonic Order]] as an autonomous branch and became known as the [[Livonian Order]].

[[Albert of Riga|Albert]], bishop of [[Riga]] (or [[Prince-Bishop]] of Livonia), founded the Brotherhood to aid the [[Bishopric of Riga]] in the conversion of the [[paganism|pagan]] [[Curonians]], [[Livonian people|Livonians]], [[Semigallians]], and [[Latgalians]] living on the shores of the [[Gulf of Riga]]. From its foundation, the undisciplined Order tended to ignore its supposed [[vassal]]age to the bishops. In 1218, Albert asked King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] for assistance, but Valdemar instead arranged a deal with the Brotherhood and conquered the [[Danish Estonia|north of Estonia]] for Denmark. The Brotherhood had its headquarters at [[Viljandi|Fellin (Viljandi)]] in present-day [[Estonia]], where the walls of the Master's castle {{As of|2008|alt=still}} stand. Other strongholds included [[Cēsis|Wenden (Cēsis)]], [[Sigulda|Segewold (Sigulda)]] and [[Aizkraukle|Ascheraden (Aizkraukle)]]. The commanders of Fellin, [[Kuldīga|Goldingen (Kuldīga)]], [[Alūksne|Marienburg (Alūksne)]], [[Tallinn|Reval (Tallinn)]], and the [[bailiff]] of [[Paide|Weißenstein (Paide)]] belonged to the five-member entourage of the Order's Master.

[[Pope Gregory IX]] asked the Brothers to defend [[Finland]] from the [[Finnish-Novgorodian Wars|Novgorodian attacks]] in his letter of November 24, 1232;&lt;ref&gt;

however, no known information regarding the knights' possible activities in Finland has survived. ([[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] eventually took over Finland after the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in 1249.) In the Battle of Saule in 1236 the [[Lithuanians]] and [[Semigallians]] decimated the Order. This disaster led the surviving Brothers to become incorporated into the Order of [[Teutonic Knights]] in the following year, and from that point on they became known as the [[Livonian Order]]. They continued, however, to function in all respects ([[monastic rule|rule]], clothing and policy) as an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Order, headed by their own Master (himself ''de jure'' subject to the Teutonic Order's [[Hochmeister|Grand Master]]).

=== Livonian Crusade 1206–1227 ===
{{main|Livonian Crusade}}

The [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] from the 1220s gives a firsthand account of the Christianization of Livonia, granted as a [[fief]] by the [[Hohenstaufen]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]], de facto but not known as the King of Germany, [[Philip of Swabia]], to Bishop [[Albert of Riga|Albert of Buxthoeven]], nephew of the [[Hartwig of Uthlede|Hartwig II]], [[Archbishop of Bremen]], who sailed with a convoy of ships filled with armed crusaders to carve out a Catholic territory in the east during the [[Livonian Crusade]].

{{main|Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights}}

[[File:Teutonic state 1250.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]].]]

Livonia consisted of the following subdivisions: 
* a state ruled by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] founded by Albert in 1202, which was assimilated into the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1237;
* the [[Archbishopric of Riga|Bishopric of Riga]] (an archbishopric since 1255);
* the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Courland|Courland]], [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek|Ösel-Wiek]], and [[Bishopric of Dorpat|Dorpat]], where Albert's brother Hermann established himself as the prince-bishop ([[Terra Mariana]]). The conquest of Livonia by the Germans is described in the [[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]].

=== Livonian Order 1237–1561 ===
{{main|Livonian Order}}

[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|right|thumb|200px|[[Medieval Livonia]] ca. 1260.]]

The Livonian Order was a largely autonomous branch of the [[Teutonic Knights]] (or Teutonic Order) and a member of the [[Livonian Confederation]] from 1418&amp;ndash;1561. After being defeated by [[History of Lithuania (1219–1295)|Lithuania]] in the 1236 [[Battle of Saule]], the remnants of the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] were incorporated into the Teutonic Knights as the Livonian Order in 1237. Between 1237 and 1290, the Livonian Order conquered all of [[Courland]], Livonia, and [[Semigallia]], but their attack on northern Russia was repelled in the [[Battle of Wesenberg (1268)|Battle of Rakvere]] (1268). In 1346, after [[St. George's Night Uprising]] the Order bought the rest of [[Estonia]] from King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]. Life within the Order's territory is described in the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] and the [[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]]. The Teutonic Order fell into decline following its defeat in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410 and the secularization of its Prussian territories by [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg]] in 1525, but the Livonian Order managed to maintain an independent existence. During many years of [[Livonian War]] (1558–1582), however, they suffered a decisive defeat by troops of [[Muscovy|Muscovite Russia]] in the [[Battle of Ergeme]] in 1560 and continued living under great threat. Letters to the Emperor arrived from many European countries, warning, ''that Moscow has its eyes on much more than only a few harbors or the province of Liefland'' ... the East Sea (Ostsee-[[Baltic Sea]] and the West Sea (Atlantic) are equally in danger. Duke Barnim the Elder, 50 years duke of Pomerania, warned, ''that never before did he experience the fear than now, where even in his land, where people send by Moscow are everywhere''. At stake was the [[Narva]]-Trade-Route and practically all trade in the North, and with that all of Europe. Due to religious upheavals of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the empire could not send troops, which it could not afford and which were too far away anyway. Prussia was not able to help for much of the same reason, and Duke Albrecht was under continuous ban by the emperor. The Hanseatic League was greatly weakened by this and the city state of Luebeck fought its last great war. The emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] diffused the greatest threat by remaining on friendly terms with the czar, but not sending him troops as requested, in his struggles with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Czar Ivan of Moscow installed Duke Magnus as [[King of Livonia]]. This was opposed by the other forces. The Livonian Order saw no other way than to seek protection from [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|King of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], who had intervened in a war between Bishop [[William of Brandenburg|William]] of Riga and the Brothers in 1557. After coming to an [[Wilno Pact|agreement]] with Sigismund II Augustus and his representatives (especially [[Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł]]), the last Livonian Master, [[Gotthard Kettler]], secularized the Order and converted to [[Lutheranism]]. In the southern part of the Brothers' lands he created the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] for his family. Most of the remaining lands were seized by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The north of Estonia was taken back by Denmark and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]].

From the 14th to the 16th centuries, [[Middle Low German]] as spoken in the towns of the [[Hanseatic League]] was the established language, but was subsequently succeeded by [[High German]] as official language in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name=Koch59&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Kristine|title=Deutsch als Fremdsprache im Russland des 18.

=== Livonian Confederation 1418–1561 ===
{{main|Livonian Confederation}}

The five Ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire in Medieval Livonia were organized into the [[Livonian Confederation]] in 1418.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&amp;pg The History of the Baltic States] By Kevin O'Connor; {{ISBN|0-313-32355-0}}; p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A diet or ''[[Landtag]]'' was formed in 1419. The city of [[Walk, Livonia|Walk]] was chosen as the site of the diet.

=== Livonian War 1558–1583 ===
{{main|Livonian War}}

[[File:Europe 1550.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Europe]], 1550.]]

[[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] once again asked for help of [[Gustav I of Sweden]], and The [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)]] also began direct [[negotiation]]s with Gustav, but nothing resulted because on September 29, 1560, Gustav I Vasa died. The chances for success of [[Magnus von Lyffland|Magnus]] and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 (and 1570). In the former case, he had been [[Recognition (international law)|recognised]] as their [[Monarch|sovereign]] by The [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]] and The [[Bishopric of Courland]], and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of The [[Bishopric of Dorpat]]; The [[Bishopric of Reval]] with the [[Harrien]]-[[Wierland]] [[gentry]] were on his side; [[Livonian Order]] conditionally recognised his right of [[ownership]] of [[Estonia]] ([[Principality of Estonia]]). Then along with [[Archbishop]] [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg]] of The [[Archbishopric of Riga]] and his [[Coadjutor archbishop|Coadjutor]] [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch|Christoph von Mecklenburg]], Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of The [[Kingdom of Livonia]], which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land.

Once [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] became king he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued [[peace]] with [[Muscovy]] and spoke to the [[Burgess (title)|burghers]] of [[Reval]] [[city]]. He offered them goods to submit to him as well as threatening them. By June 6, 1561 they submitted to him contrary to the [[persuasion]]s of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish [[princess]] [[Catherine Jagiellon]]. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the [[castle]]s they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to [[Finland]], Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent.

Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of [[Riga]]. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his [[inheritance]] of [[Holstein]]. After Sweden [[Military occupation|occupied]] Reval, [[Frederick II of Denmark]] made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on August 7, 1562 in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and The [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between The [[Free City of Lübeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568 Erik XIV became [[insane]] and his brother Johan III took his place.

Johan III ascended to the [[throne]] of Sweden and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], know that he was ready for peace. On December 15, 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded.

It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to The Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the [[Livonian War]] a pro-[[independence]] wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called "Peace Party". Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with Ivan the Terrible, proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.

The Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces – scattered bands of household troops (''[[Hofleute]]'') under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 ([[Battle of Pärnu, 1565]] and [[Siege of Reval, 1565]]), in 1570–1571 ([[Siege of Reval, 1570-1571]]; 30 weeks), and in 1574–1576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of [[Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek|Ösel–Wiek]] to the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]], and the loss of the territory to [[Tsardom of Russia]]). In 1575 after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition as well as the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Rzeczpospolita]]. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.

Having rejected peace proposals from its enemies, [[Ivan the Terrible]] found himself in a difficult position by 1579, when [[Crimean Khanate]] devastated Muscovian territories and burnt down [[Moscow]] (see [[Russo-Crimean Wars]]), the [[drought]] and [[epidemics]] have fatally affected the economy, [[Oprichnina]] had thoroughly disrupted the government, while The [[Grand Principality of Lithuania]] [[Union of Lublin|had united with]] The [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)]] and acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], supported by [[Ottoman Empire]] (1576). Stefan Batory replied with a series of three [[Offensive (military)|offensives]] against Muscovy, trying to cut The [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579, with 22,000 men, he retook [[Polatsk|Polotsk]]; during the second, in 1580, with 29,000-strong army, he took [[Wielkie Łuki|Velikie Luki]], and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the [[Siege of Pskov]]. [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway]] had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and Poland. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden|John III]] in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish–Lithuanian control of [[Ducatus Ultradunensis]] only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]] died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in The [[Duchy of Courland]] and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of [[inheritance]]. Except for the island of [[Œsel]], [[Denmark]] was out of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] by 1585. As of 1598 [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] was divided onto:
 
* [[Wenden Voivodeship]] (''województwo wendeńskie'', [[Kieś]])
* [[Dorpat Voivodeship]] (''województwo dorpackie'', [[Dorpat]])
* [[Parnawa Voivodeship]] (''województwo parnawskie'', [[Parnawa]])

Based on a guarantee by Sigismund II Augustus from the 1560s, the German language retained its official status.&lt;ref name=Koch59/&gt;

[[File:LIVONIAE NOVA DESCRIPTIO 1573-1578.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Livonia, as shown in the map of 1573 of [[Theatrum orbis terrarum]].]]

The armies of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] were initially successful, taking [[Polock]] (1563) and [[Parnawa]] (1575) and overrunning much of Grand Duchy of Lithuania up to [[Vilnius]]. Eventually, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland formed the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569 under the [[Union of Lublin]]. [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] did not like this and the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between the [[Free City of Lübeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, [[Frederick II of Denmark]] and [[Magnus von Lyffland]] of the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek|Œsel-Wiek]] did not fare well. But in 1569, Erik XIV became [[insane]] and his brother [[John III of Sweden]] took his place. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus|Zygmunt II August]], know that he was ready for peace. On December 15, 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded.

In the next phase of the conflict, in 1577 Ivan IV took advantage of the Commonwealth's internal strife (called the war against [[Gdańsk]] in Polish historiography), and during the reign of [[Stefan Batory]] in Poland, invaded Livonia, quickly taking almost the entire territory, with the exception of [[Riga]] and [[Reval]]. In 1578, [[Magnus of Livonia]] recognized the [[sovereignty]] of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (not ratified by the [[Sejm]] of Poland-Lithuania, or recognized by Denmark). The Kingdom of Livonia was beaten back by Muscovy on all fronts. In 1578, Magnus of Livonia retired to The [[Bishopric of Courland]] and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.

===Swedish Livonia 1629–1721===
{{main|Swedish Livonia}}

[[File:Sw BalticProv en.png|right|thumb|200px|The Baltics in the 17th century]]

[[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] was given roughly the same area as the former Duchy of Livonia after the 1626–1629 [[Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629)|Polish–Swedish War]]. The area, usually known as [[Swedish Livonia]], became a very important Swedish dominion, with Riga being the second largest Swedish city and Livonia paying for one third of the Swedish war costs. Sweden lost Swedish Livonia, [[Swedish Estonia]] and [[Ingria]] to [[Russia]] almost 100 years later, by the [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710 and the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721.

The Livonian Voivodeship ({{lang-lt|Livonijos vaivadija}}; {{lang-pl|Województwo inflanckie}}) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the [[Inflanty Voivodeship|Duchy of Livonia]], part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], since it was formed in the 1620s out of the [[Wenden Voivodeship]] till the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] in 1772.

The [[Russian Empire]] conquered Swedish Livonia during the course of the [[Great Northern War]] and acquired the province in the [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710, confirmed by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721. Peter the Great confirmed German as the exclusive official language.&lt;ref name=Koch59/&gt; Russia then added Polish Livonia in 1772 during the [[Partitions of Poland]].

{{main|Governorate of Livonia}}

[[File:Europe1815 1905.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Europe]], 1815.]]

In 1796 the Riga Governorate was renamed as the Governorate of Livonia ({{lang-ru|Лифляндская губе́рния}} / {{lang|ru-latn|Liflyandskaya guberniya}}, {{lang-lv|Vidzemes guberņa}}, {{lang-et|Liivimaa kubermang}}). Livonia remained within the Russian Empire until the end of [[World War I]], when it was split between the newly independent states of Latvia and Estonia. In 1918–1920, both [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops and German [[Freikorps]] fought against Latvian and Estonian troops for control over Livonia, but their attempts were defeated.

From 1845 to 1876, the Baltic governorates of [[Governorate of Estonia|Estonia]], Livonia, and [[Courland Governorate|Courland]]—an area roughly corresponding to the historical [[medieval Livonia]]—were administratively subordinated to a common [[Governor-General]]. Amongst the holders of this post were Count [[Alexander Arkadyevich Suvorov]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804024941 Suvorov A.A. governor-general in 1861-66 :: ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF SAINT PETERSBURG]&lt;/ref&gt; and Count [[Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov]].

In independent [[Latvia]] between the World Wars, southern Livonia became an administrative region under the traditional Latvian name [[Vidzeme]], encompassing the then much larger counties of [[Riga District|Riga]], [[Cēsis District|Cēsis]], [[Valmiera District|Valmiera]], and [[Valka District|Valka]].

=== Ostland 1941–1944 ===
{{main|Reichskommissariat Ostland}}

[[File:Invasion1941.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] advances 22 June to 25 August 1941.]]

Ostland was one of the Reichskommissariats established, by a Decree of the Führer dated 17 July 1941, as administrative units of the "Großdeutsches Reich" (Greater Germany). The structure of the Reichskommissariats was defined by the same decree. Local administration in the Reichskommissariats was to be organized under a "National Director" (''Reichskomissar'') in Estonia, a "General Director" in Latvia and a "General Adviser" in Lithuania. The local administration of the Reichskommissariat Ostland was under ''Reichskomissar'' [[Hinrich Lohse]]. Below him there was an administrative hierarchy: a ''[[Generalkomissar]]'' led each ''Generalbezirke'', ''[[Gebietskomissar]]s'' and ''[[Hauptkommissar]]s'' administered ''Kreigsbietes'' and ''Hauptgenbietes'', respectively. [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s (Minister für die besetzten Ostgebiete (Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories) ministerial authority was, in practice, severely limited. The first reason was that many of the practicalities were commanded elsewhere: the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] managed the military and security aspects, [[Fritz Saukel]] (Reich Director of Labour) had control over manpower and working areas, [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Albert Speer]] had total management of economic aspects in the territories and the Reich postal service administered the East territories' postal services. These German central government interventions in the affairs of Ostland, overriding the appropriate ministries was known as  "[[Sonderverwaltungen]]" (special administration). Later, from September, the civil administration that had been decreed in the previous July was actually set up. Lohse and, for that matter, Koch would not bow to his authority seeking to administer their territories with the independence and authority of gauleiters. on 1 April 1942 an ''arbeitsbereich'' (lit. "working sphere", a name for the party cadre organisation outside the reich proper) was established in the civil administration part of the occupied Soviet territories, whereupon Koch and Lohse gradually ceased communication with him, preferring to deal directly with Hitler through [[Martin Bormann]] and the party chancellery. In the process they also displaced all other actors including notably the SS, except in central Belarus where HSSPF [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky]] had a special command encompassing both military and civil administration territories and engaged in "anti-partisan" atrocities.

=== Baltic countries since 1990 ===
{{main|Estonia|Latvia}}

The historical land of Livonia has been split between [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] ever since. The [[Livonian language]] is spoken by fewer than 100 individuals as a second language, and is understood to be fast approaching [[dead language|extinction]]. The last native Livonian speaker died in June 2013.
The anthem (unofficial) of Livonians is ''Min izāmō, min sindimō'' sharing the melody of [[Finland|Finnish]] and [[Estonia]]n anthems.

{{Nihongo|'''Lot's Wife'''|孀婦岩|Sōfu Iwa or Sōfu Gan|extra="Widow's Crag"}} is a [[volcano|volcanic]], [[deserted island]] located in the [[Philippine Sea]] approximately {{convert|650|km|mi}} south off the coast of [[Tokyo]], at the southernmost tip of the [[Izu Islands|Izu archipelago]], [[Japan]]. Though only 0.01&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area, it reaches almost 100 meters in height.

==Geography==
The island is a [[basalt]] [[Stack (geology)|pillar]] with sheer sides, the only visible portion of a submarine [[volcanic caldera]] extending {{convert|2.6|km}} south-east at an average depth of {{convert|240| m}}. The above sea-level portion measures approximately 84 metres east-west and 56 metres north-south, with a summit height of {{convert|99|m}}. The sides of the island features several [[Joint (geology)|geological joints]] facing the water's surface.

The island lies approximately {{convert|650|km}} south off the coast of [[Tokyo]] and {{convert|76|km}} from nearby [[Tori-shima (Izu Islands)|Torishima]]. Due to its shape and heavy seas it is almost impossible to disembark on the island, although attempts have been made by [[rock climbing|rock climbers]] successfully in 1972 and 2003 (though several accidents have been registered). The site is also known for the transparency of its surrounding waters and abundance of [[fish]], which makes it a popular [[scuba diving]] spot.

The only vegetation on the island is a few clumps of [[Poaceae]], and the island attracts a small number of [[seabird]]s for nesting.

==History==
On April 9, 1788, British merchant sailor [[John Meares]] sighted what he came to describe as “the most marvellous thing” he had ever set his eyes on, a small island he and the ship’s crew decided to baptize as [[Lot's wife|Lot's Wife]], referring to the [[Book of Genesis]] 19:26. The Japanese name Sōfu Iwa (“The Widow Crag”) is rather freely translated from English.&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo|孀婦岩||Sōfu Iwa}}. ''Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia'' (Japanese ed.)[[:ja:孀婦岩]] browsed 2008-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Pacific War]], Sofu Gan was used by US Navy submariners as a reference marker for calibration of instruments as they entered Japanese waters.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kane, Richard H. ''Clear the Bridge! The War Patrols of the USS Tang'' London  Macdonald &amp; Jane's  1978  p.210  {{ISBN|0354011855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uninhabited/uninhabitable island was the southernmost Japanese island not occupied by the [[United States]] after the 1952 [[San Francisco Treaty]]. It is currently administratively part of Tokyo Metropolis.

[[Image:John Rodgers.jpg|thumb|150px|[[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]]]]
The '''North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition''', also known as the '''Rodgers-Ringgold Expedition''' was a United States scientific and exploring project from 1853 to 1856. 

Commander [[Cadwalader Ringgold]] (1802&amp;ndash;1867) led the expedition until he was relieved of command in [[Hong Kong]] by a commission convened by Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]]. Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] (1812&amp;ndash;1882) then commanded the expedition until its conclusion.

==The expedition under Ringgold==
[[Image:Commodore Cadwalader Ringgold.jpg|thumb|left|upright |[[Cadwalader Ringgold]] ]]
Ringgold sailed on [[USS Porpoise (1836)|USS ''Porpoise'']], a ship he had commanded during the [[U.S. Exploring Expedition]] years before. [[USS John Hancock (1850)|USS ''John Hancock'']], commanded by Lt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] and three other vessels including [[USS Vincennes (1826)|USS ''Vincennes'']] would be the other vessels in the expedition.

''Porpoise'' joined the squadron at Hampton Roads, and with it, stood out to sea 11 June 1853. After stopping at [[Funchal]], [[Madeira Islands]]; [[Porto Praya]]; and [[Simonstown]], [[False Bay]]; the expedition arrived [[Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Java (island)|Java]], 12 December and in [[China]] in March 1854. 

Five months were devoted to surveying the waters surrounding the large islands off the coast of Southeast Asia. Early in May 1854, ''John Hancock'', with Rodgers commanding, departed for [[Hong Kong]], where she arrived 24 May. The squadron operated from that port as its base throughout the summer, surveying nearby coasts, islands and rivers. At this time [[China]] was plagued by rebellion and [[pirate]]s endangering foreigners and threatening their property. The American ships helped protect American citizens and interests. While steaming up the [[Pearl River (China)|Canton River]], two armed boats from ''John Hancock'' were fired upon by rebel batteries, which ''Hancock'''s cannon promptly silenced.

In July 1854, Ringgold became sick with malaria and was sent home, according to at least one source.&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FvPM4s2QZ207lH0LK4PgT4g5LlKhs6gCQ1xQ1GqhpZC1lPQMQKQR!15464514?a=o&amp;d=5002380544 Questia.com] Questia Online Library Web site copy of: Houston, Alan Fraser, "Cadwalader Ringgold, U. S. Navy" an article in ''California History'' magazine, Volume 79, Issue 4, Winter 2000, page 208, Web site accessed October 19, 2006, Footnote 11&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nathaniel Philbrick, in his book "Sea of Glory" about the U.S. Exploring Expedition, writes that in the later expedition Ringgold "began to act strangely" once in China, keeping his ships in port "ceaselessly repairing his vessels". Commodore Perry, on his own expedition, sailed in and convened an official panel which relieved Ringgold from command of the expedition and sent him home. Philbrick quotes Perry as declaring Ringgold "insane."&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''Sea of Glory: America's voyage of discovery, The U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842'' (Viking: 2003), {{ISBN|0-670-03231-X}} pages 351,-352&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] was given full command of the expedition and completed it.

The squadron headed north along the coast as far as the [[Bering Sea]], surveying as it went.
The squadron at that time also explored islands well off the coast of Asia, including the [[Bonins]], the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones]], and the [[Marianas]]. ''Porpoise'' parted company with the other vessels 21 September 1854 between [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and China, and was never heard from again. It is supposed that she foundered in a heavy typhoon which occurred a few days after her separation from the squadron.

At the Bering sea, the expedition turned south along the western coast of North America. In March 1856, the expedition arrived at [[Puget Sound]] to help suppress Indian uprisings which threatened to wipe out white settlements and Army outposts established in the early 1850s.

==Results of the expedition==
Besides greatly increasing knowledge of the western and northern Pacific, stimulating commerce, and easing navigation in previously unknown seas, the expedition has been credited with helping to establish friendly relations between the United States and several nations of East Asia.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Nicaragua:

'''[[Nicaragua]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of sovereign states|sovereign]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic and the most extensive nation in [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 7, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nu.html|title=Nicaragua|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the least densely populated with a demographic similar in size to its smaller neighbors. The country is bordered by [[Honduras]] to the north and by [[Costa Rica]] to the south. The [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the west of the country, while the [[Caribbean Sea]] lies to the east. Falling within the [[tropics]], Nicaragua sits 11 degrees north of the [[Equator]], in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

The country's name is derived from [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} the name of the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]-speaking tribe which inhabited the shores of [[Lago de Nicaragua]] before the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas]], and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word {{lang|es|Agua}}, meaning [[water]], due to the presence of the large lakes [[Lago de Nicaragua]] (Cocibolca) and [[Lago de Managua]] (Xolotlán), as well as lagoons and rivers in the region.&lt;ref name="MN"&gt;{{cite news | title=Origen del nombre de Nicaragua: | publisher=Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Nicaragua | url =http://www.cancilleria.gob.ni/tmp2007/noticias/mo_capitulo1.html | accessdate = 2007-08-21 | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Nicaragua|Spanish conquest]], Nicaragua was the name given to the narrow strip of land between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean. Chief [[Nicarao (cacique)|Nicarao]] ruled over the land when the first conquerors arrived. The term was eventually applied, by extension, to the Nicarao or [[Niquirano]] groups that inhabited that region.

The Nicarao tribe migrated to the area from northern regions after the fall of [[Teotihuacán]], on the advice of their religious leaders. According to tradition, they were to travel south until they encountered a lake with two volcanoes rising out of the waters, and so they stopped when they reached [[Ometepe]], the largest fresh-water volcanic island in the world.

'''Pidurutalagala''' ({{lang-si|පිදුරුතලාගල}}, pronounced {{IPA-si|ˌpidurutaˈlaːɡələ|}}, ''Straw Plateau Rock''), or '''Mount Pedro''' in English, is an [[ultra prominent peak]], and the tallest [[mountain]] in [[Sri Lanka]], at {{convert|2524|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Pidurutalagala|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/459678/Mount-Pidurutalagala|accessdate=21 April 2011|author=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is situated North-North-East from the town of [[Nuwara Eliya]], and is easily visible from most areas of the [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|Central Province]].
Its summit is home to the central communications array of the [[Government of Sri Lanka]] and armed forces, and serves as an important point in the country's radar system. The peak is currently designated as an "Ultra-high security zone", and is protected by a large military base; being strictly off limits to the general public.

On 1 March 2010, a small [[wildfire]] broke out over the mountain's forest cover. The fire destroyed {{Convert|3|acres|km2|3|abbr=on}} of forest, before being doused by the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] and nearly 300 local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fire erupts at Mount Pedro|url=http://www.newsfirst.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8625|accessdate=21 April 2011|newspaper=Newsfirst.lk|date=1 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007211400/http://www.newsfirst.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8625|archivedate=7 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Residents help army and forest officers to douse pidurutalagala fire|url=http://www.newsfirst.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8650|accessdate=21 April 2011|newspaper=Newsfirst.lk|date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">'''Pirate havens''' are ports or harbors that are a safe place for [[pirate]]s to repair their vessels, resupply, recruit, spend their plunder, avoid capture, and/or lie in wait for merchant ships to pass by. The areas have governments that are unable or unwilling to enforce [[maritime law]]s. This creates favorable conditions for piracy.

These havens were often near [[ocean|maritime]] [[shipping]] lanes. Although some havens were merely hidden coves, some were established by governments who employed [[privateer]]s to disrupt the overseas trade of rival nations.

Some historic pirate havens included [[Barataria Bay]], [[Port Royal]], and [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]. These provided some [[autonomy]] for privateers and buccaneers.

== On the Barbary Coast ==
Historically, the [[Barbary Coast]] contained a number of pirate havens, notably [[Salé]], [[Algiers]] and [[Tunis]]. These pirate havens were used by [[Barbary corsairs|Corsairs]] from the 16th to the 19th century. The pirates, dubbed "[[Barbary Pirates]]", ravaged European shipping and enslaved thousands of captives. The Pirate Republic of [[Salé]], in 17th century Morocco, was a [[micronation]] with its own seaport [[argot]] known as "Franco," since like other pirate states, it from time to time made treaties with European governments, agreeing not to attack their fleets.

The [[United States Navy#From reestablishment to the Civil War|United States Navy was founded]], in part, to counter the activities of the Barbary pirates, and the United States fought the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1801–1805, 1815) to end this threat to its shipping.

Some pirate havens were supposed to have formed [[anarchist]] societies called [[pirate utopia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no8/pirate.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the Somali Coast==
In the early 2000s piracy became common place off the coast of Somalia. During this period, pirate havens included [[Eyl]], in the [[Puntland]] region of northern [[Somalia]], and [[Harardhere]] (Xarard-heere), in the [[Mudug]] province of Somalia. During the same time period Transitional Federal Government of [[Somalia]] was believed to unable to enforce maritime laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=U.S. Captain is Hostage of Pirates; Navy Ship Arrives |journal=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/world/africa/09pirates.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Eyl&amp;st=cse |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first1=Mark | last1=Mazzetti | first2=Sharon | last2=Otterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern havens included [[Garaad]] and [[Hobyo]] in central Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tiede.fi, the Finnish science magazine Tiede, no 5/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Submarine navigation''' underwater requires special skills and technologies not needed by [[surface ship]]s. The challenges of underwater [[navigation]] have become more important as [[submarines]] spend more time underwater, travelling greater distances and at higher speed. Military submarines travel underwater in an environment of total darkness with neither windows nor lights. Operating in stealth mode, they cannot use their [[Sonar#Active sonar|active sonar]] systems to [[Acoustic location|ping]] ahead for underwater hazards such as [[Seamount|undersea mountains]], [[drilling rig]]s or other submarines. Surfacing to obtain [[Fix (position)|navigational fixes]] is precluded by pervasive [[anti-submarine warfare]] [[Anti-submarine warfare#Technologies used|detection systems]] such as [[radar]] and [[Spy satellite|satellite]] surveillance.  [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna masts]] and antenna-equipped [[periscope#Naval use|periscopes]] can be raised to obtain navigational signals but in areas of heavy surveillance, only for a few seconds or minutes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bivens | first = Arthur Clarke | title = From Sailboats to Submarines  |date=July 2004 | publisher = Infinity Publishing | isbn = 978-0-7414-2152-4 | pages = 184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; current radar technology can detect even a slender periscope while submarine shadows may be plainly visible from the air.

==Navigational technologies==
Surfaced submarines entering and leaving port navigate similarly to traditional ships but with a few extra considerations because most of the ship rides below the waterline, making them hard for other ships to see and identify.
Submarines carry an inertial navigation system, which measures the boat’s motion and constantly updates position. Because it does not rely on radio signals or celestial sightings, it allows the boat to navigate while remaining hidden under the surface. To maintain accuracy, the submarine must periodically update its position using outside navigational radio signals. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Transit satellites and LORAN shore stations provided those signals. GPS has now replaced both.


===Surface and near-surface navigation===
On the surface or at [[periscope depth]], submarines have used these methods to fix their position:
*Satellite navigation:
**[[Global positioning system]] (GPS) — by entering waypoints internally, able to navigate at a more precise level. 
**[[Transit (satellite)|NAVSAT]] 
*Terrestrial [[Radio navigation|radio-based navigation]] systems; largely superseded by satellite systems
**[[LORAN]]— no longer in use
**[[CHAYKA]], the Russian counterpart of LORAN
**[[Omega (navigation system)|OMEGA]], the Western counterpart of the Alpha Navigation System, no longer in use
**[[Alpha (navigation)|Alpha]], the Russian counterpart of the Omega Navigation System
*[[Celestial navigation]] using the periscope, or sextant—seldom used anymore due to advancement in technology
*[[Radar navigation]]; radar signals are easily detected so radar is normally only used in friendly waters entering and exiting ports. With the implementation of a more advanced radar system, many new techniques have been implemented in this process.   
*[[Active sonar]]; like radar, active sonar systems are readily detected, so active sonar is usually used only entering and exiting ports.
*[[Pilotage]] — in coastal and [[internal waters]], surfaced submarines rely on the standard system of navigational aids (buoys, navigational markers, lighthouses, etc.), utilizing the periscopes for obtaining lines of position to plot a triangulation fix.
*[[Voyage Management System]]—referred to as the VMS, utilizes digital charts with other external sources fed in, to establish the ship's position. Other information may also be entered in manually in establishing a high quality fix or position.

===Deep water navigation===
At depths below periscope depth submarines determine their position using:
*[[Dead reckoning#Marine navigation|Dead reckoning]] [[Course (navigation)|course information]] obtained from the ship's [[gyrocompass]], [[Pit sword|measured speed]] and estimates of local ocean currents, this could also be considered an estimated position as long as the ocean current is computed in.
*[[Inertial navigation system]] is an estimated position source, utilizing acceleration, deceleration, and pitch and roll for computing.
*Bottom contour navigation may be used in areas where detailed [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] data has been charted and there is adequate variation in sea floor topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ku.edu/~kunrotc/academics/300/Lesson14%20Electronic%20Navigation.ppt |title=Lesson 14: Electronic Navigation |accessdate=2007-11-14 |format=[[Microsoft PowerPoint]] |work=Navigation and Operations I |publisher=[[University of Kansas]], [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] |pages=Slides 19 to 21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911053132/http://www2.ku.edu/~kunrotc/academics/300/Lesson14%20Electronic%20Navigation.ppt |archivedate=September 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3725">'''Sustainable refurbishment''' describes working on existing buildings to improve their environmental performance using sustainable methods and materials.

Sustainable refurbishment is the equivalent of [[sustainable development]] which relates to new developments of cities, buildings or industries etc.
Sustainable refurbishment includes [[building insulation|insulation]] and related measures to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, installation of [[renewable energy]] sources such as solar water heating and [[photovoltaics]], measures to reduce water consumption, and changes to reduce overheating, improve ventilation and improve internal comfort. The process of sustainable refurbishment includes minimizing the waste of existing components, [[recycling]] and using [[environmentally friendly]] materials, and minimizing energy use, noise and waste during the refurbishment.

The importance of sustainable refurbishment is that the majority of buildings in use are not new and thus were constructed when energy standards were low or non-existent, and are otherwise incompatible with current standards or the expectations of users. Much of the existing building stock is likely to be in use for many years to come since demolition and replacement is often unacceptable owing to cost, social disruption or because the building is of architectural and/or historical interest. The solution is to refurbish or renovate such buildings to make them appropriate for current and future use and to satisfy current requirements and standards of energy use and comfort.

Sustainable refurbishment is not a new concept but is gaining recognition and importance owing to current concerns about high energy use leading to [[climate change]], overheating in buildings, the need for healthy internal environments, waste and environmental damage associated with materials production. Many governments are beginning to realize the importance of sustainably renovating their existing building stock, rather than just raising standards for new buildings and developments, and are producing guidance and grants and other support and stimulation activities. Think-tanks, lobby groups and voluntary organizations continue to publicize and promote the need for and practice of sustainable refurbishment. Examples and demonstration projects abound in many countries.

The techniques of sustainable refurbishment have been developing over many years and though the principles are very similar to those used on new buildings, the practice and details appropriate for the wide range of situations found in old buildings has required development of specific solutions and guidance to optimize the process and avoid subsequent problems. Detailed technical guidance is widely available from government-sponsored sources.

[[File:Maryland Dove.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A modern reconstruction and replica of a small 17th Century English trading ship, the ''[[Maryland Dove]]'' at [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]] is approximately the same size as her namesake, the c. 1630 ''Dove'' which accompanied the ''Ark'' on the historic trans-oceanic voyage in late 1633 and early 1634.]] 
'''''Ark''''' was a 400-ton [[Kingdom of England|English]] merchant ship hired by [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] (1605–1675), to bring roughly 140 English colonists and their equipment and supplies to the new colony and [[Province of Maryland]], one of the [[Original 13 states|original thirteen colonies]] of [[British North America]] on the Atlantic Ocean eastern seaboard. On the historic trans-oceanic voyage from England in late 1633 and early 1634, ''Ark'' was accompanied by the smaller 40-ton [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]] ''[[Maryland Dove|Dove]]''.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Maryland expedition==
On {{start date and age|1633|11|22|df=y|paren=y}}, after several delays, the two ships, ''Ark'' and ''Dove'', sailed from the [[Isle of Wight]] off the south coast of England. Three days later a storm in the [[English Channel]] separated ''Ark'' from ''Dove''. When ''Dove'' disappeared from view, she was flying distress lanterns, and those aboard ''Ark'' assumed she had sunk in the storm. A second more violent storm hit ''Ark'' on 29 November 1633 and lasted three days, finally subsiding on 1 December. In the midst of the storm the mainsail was split in half and the crew was forced to tie down the tiller and whipstaff so the ship [[Lying ahull|lay ahull]]', keeping her bow to the wind and waves as she drifted. This was the last bad weather ''Ark'' encountered on the trans-Atlantic voyage.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

On 25 December 1633, wine was passed out to celebrate [[Christmas]]. The following day, 30 colonists fell ill with a fever brought on by excessive drinking and 12 died, including two of the Roman Catholic colonists. These were the only losses suffered on the voyage.  On 3 January 1633/34 (see below on the start of the new year), ''Ark'' arrived at the island of [[Barbados]] in the West Indies after a voyage of 42 days from England. About two weeks later, ''Dove'' arrived. As it later developed, ''Dove'' had been able to reach the shelter of [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth]] harbour where she rode out the storm.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

On 24 January 1633/34, the ships departed [[Barbados]]. An earlier departure was intended, but was delayed because [[Richard Orchard]], master (captain) the ''Dove'' had departed inland to collect some debts and could not be found on the intended sailing date. After making a few other stops in the [[Caribbean Sea]], on 24 February 1633/34, the ships arrived at [[Point Comfort]] (now called Old Point Comfort) at the mouths of the [[James River (Virginia)|James]], [[Nansemond River|Nansemond]], and [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth]] rivers, which formed the great harbor of [[Hampton Roads]] in Virginia. This ended their ocean voyage which had lasted slightly over three months, of which 66 days were actually spent at sea.  The two ships briefly stopped in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] up the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

After a week's stay, the Calvert colonists then sailed northward up the large expanse of the Bay, landing on [[St. Clement's Island State Park|St. Clement's Island]], also known as Blakistone Island, on the north shore of the [[Potomac River]], across from Virginia's northern border, on 25 March 1634. This day was thereafter celebrated annually in the colony and free State as "[[Maryland Day]]". The colonists planted a large cross, claiming the land in the name of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]), King of England, and holding their first communal [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] led by the accompanying [[Jesuit]] chaplain, Father [[Andrew White (Jesuit)|Andrew White]]. The day "25 March" has been traditionally taken to mark the end of the voyage, although, in fact, the voyage had actually ended earlier on 24 February, when the ''Ark'' and the ''Dove'' arrived at Point Comfort entering the North American continental waters. 25 March is the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a major festival day in the liturgical calendar.  Until 1752, when England finally adopted the [[Gregorian Calendar]] as opposed to the older, now inaccurate [[Julian Calendar]], 25 March was the start of the civil new year,&lt;ref&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|"old Style" and "New Style" dates]]&lt;/ref&gt; hence the practice of writing dates from 1 January to 25 March as 1633/34.&lt;ref&gt;The chronology given here is derived from Father [[Andrew White (Jesuit)|Andrew White's]] diary account of the voyage using the Barbara Lawatsch-Boomgaarden's translation:
White, Father Andrew, Lawatsch-Boomgaarden Barbara, trans. ''"Voyage to Maryland"'', Wauconda, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although too small for the intended settlement, St. Clement's provided a relatively secure base from which [[Leonard Calvert]], (1606-1647), new first [[Governor of Maryland]] and younger brother of Cecilius, could explore the area and negotiate the purchase of land for the new colony.  After a brief three-week stay on the island, the new Marylanders occupied a nearby [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataway]] Indian village they had purchased on the St. George's (later the [[St. Mary's River (Maryland)|St. Mary's]]) River, several miles (kilometers) southeast from St. Clement's and about {{convert|12|mi}} northwest from [[Point Lookout, Maryland|Point Lookout]], where the Potomac River enters the Chesapeake Bay. The new English settlement was named "[[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]]" in honor of The Virgin, which later became the provincial capital, and later the county seat/courthouse in the first county to be "erected" (established), [[St. Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's County]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In the early summer of 1634, the ''Ark'' returned to England. The ''Dove'', which had been also purchased by Calvert and the gentry investors in the new colony, remained for the settlers' use in and around the Bay and coasts of Maryland.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In August 1635, the ''Dove'' sailed for England carrying timber and beaver pelts, but she never arrived home and was presumed lost in a storm. ''[[Maryland Dove]]'' is a modern replica of the vessel.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===Passengers===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="829">'''Tuscia''' is a historical region of [[Italy]] that comprised the territories under [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] influence and the name adopted for [[Etruria]] after the Roman conquest. While it later came to coincide with today’s [[province of Viterbo]], it was originally much larger, including the whole region of [[Tuscany]], a great part of [[Umbria]] and the northern parts of [[Lazio]].

A zenana (literally meaning "pertaining to women") was the part of the household reserved for women in Muslim south Asian households. These zenanas would be visited by the wives of missionaries as part of mission work.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''zenana missions''' were established in the mid 19th century to send women missionaries into the homes of Indian women with the aim of converting them to [[Christianity]]. These missions expanded from purely evangelical work to providing medical and education services. Hospitals and schools established by these missions are still active in India.

==History==
[[File:Christian missions and social progress; a sociological study of foreign missions (1897) (14756890926).jpg|thumb|Lady missionaries in the court of the Zenana Mission House, Peshawar (above); The station class at Sa-yong, Fuhkien, China (below)]]
The [[Baptist Missionary Society]] inaugurated zenana missions in India in the mid 19th century. The first zenana mission resulted from a proposal by [[Thomas Smith (missionary)|Thomas Smith]] in 1840, with the mission beginning in 1854, under the supervision of [[John Fordyce (missionary)|John Fordyce]].&lt;ref&gt;"When he [Thomas Smith] went to India, it was impossible for male missionaries to reach the women, all of whom above the very lowest class were shut off from the society of men. Smith's proposal in the 'Christian Observer' in 1840 to send lady missionaries and governesses, both European and Indian, into the zenana bore fruit in the first Zenana mission, which was started in 1854."--William Forbes Gray [[s:Smith, Thomas (1817-1906) (DNB12)|Smith, Thomas (1817-1906) (DNB12)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in India at this time were segregated under the [[purdah]] system, being confined to a women's quarters known as a [[zenana]], which men unrelated to them were forbidden to enter. The zenana missions were made up of female missionaries who could visit Indian women in their own homes with the aim of converting them to Christianity.

The purdah system made it impossible for many Indian women, especially high status women, to access [[health care]], and many were needlessly dying and suffering. By training as doctors and nurses, the women of the zenana missions could be accepted by the women of India in a way that men would not have been.

By the 1880s, the "zenana missions" had expanded their ministry, opening schools to provide education for girls, including the principles of the Christian faith. This programme also included home visits, the establishment women's hospitals and the opening of segregated women's wards in general hospitals. One society, the [[International Service Fellowship|Zenana Bible and Medical Mission]], was involved in recruiting female doctors, both by persuading female doctors in [[Europe]] to come to India and by encouraging Indian women to study medicine in their pursuit of conversion. As a result, the Zenana missions helped break down the male bias against colonial medicine in India to a small extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql0QAAAAIAAJ|title=A history of missions in India|author=Richter|first=Julius|publisher=Oliphant, Anderson &amp; Ferrier|year=1908|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Baptists inspired the formation of a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Anglican]] missionary society, the [[Church of England Zenana Missionary Society]] (founded 1880), which was involved in sending missionaries to mission stations in countries such as India (19th and 20th centuries) and late [[Qing dynasty]] [[China]], beginning in 1884.&lt;ref name="WardStanley2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVXuAAAAMAAJ|title=The Church Mission Society and World Christianity: 1799 - 1999|last=Murray|first=Jocelyn|publisher=William B.
