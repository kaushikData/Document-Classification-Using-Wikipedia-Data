'''Théodore-Agrippa d'Aubigné''' (8 February 1552{{snd}}29 April 1630) was a [[France|French]] [[poet]], [[soldier]], [[propagandist]] and [[chronicler]]. His epic poem ''Les Tragiques'' (1616) is widely regarded as his masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;A colloquy featuring Aubigné and the poets of his generation, ''Une volée de poètes : D’Aubigné et la génération poétique des années 1570-1610'' organised by Association des Amis d’Agrippa d’Aubigné is scheduled for October 2008 at Laboratoire Forell (Université de Poitiers) ([http://www.agrippadaubigne.org/Archives/colloque-poetes-2008/appel-contribution.htm Colloquy website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420060432/http://www.agrippadaubigne.org/Archives/colloque-poetes-2008/appel-contribution.htm |date=April 20, 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born at the Aubigné [[Château of Saint-Maury]] near [[Pons, Charente-Maritime|Pons]] in the present day [[Charente-Maritime]], the son of [[Jean d'Aubigné]], who was implicated in the [[Huguenot]] [[Amboise conspiracy]] to kidnap the King (1560). According to his own account he knew [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] at six years of age, and he had translated the ''[[Crito]]'' of [[Plato]] before he was eleven. His father strengthened his [[Protestant]] sympathies by showing him, while they were passing through that town on their way to Paris, the heads of the conspirators exposed upon the scaffold, and instructing him not to spare his own head in order to avenge their death.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aubigné, Théodore Agrippa d'|volume=2|pages=890–891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief residence he was obliged to flee from Paris to avoid persecution, but was captured and threatened with death. Escaping through the intervention of a friend, he went to [[Montargis]]. In his fourteenth year he was present at the [[Siege of Orléans (1563)|siege of Orléans]], at which his father was killed.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1567 he made his escape from tutelage, and attached himself to the Huguenot army under the prince of Condé. Aubigné studied in [[Paris]], [[Orléans]], [[Geneva]] (under the tutelage of [[Theodore Beza]]) and [[Lyon]] before joining the Huguenot cause of [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]] (Henry IV) as both soldier and counsellor. After a furious battle at [[Casteljaloux]], and suffering from fever from his wounds, he wrote his ''Tragiques'' in 1571. He was in the [[battle of Coutras]] (1587), and at the [[siege of Paris (1590)]]. His career at camp and court, however, was a somewhat chequered one, owing to the roughness of his manner and the keenness of his criticisms, which made him many enemies and severely tried the king's patience. In his tragédie-ballet ''Circe'' (1576) he did not hesitate to indulge in the most outspoken sarcasm against the king and other members of the royal family.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Henry's accession to the throne of [[France]] entailed an, at least nominal, conversion to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Aubigné left his service to tend to his own [[Poitou]] estates, even though his Huguenot confederates welcomed Henry's religious tolerance. However he never entirely lost the favour of Henry, who made him governor of [[Maillezais]]. d'Aubigné remained true to the Huguenot cause, and a fearless advocate of the Huguenot interests. The first two volumes of the work by which he is best known, his ''Histoire universelle depuis 1550 jusqu'à l'an 1601'', appeared in 1616 and 1618 respectively. The third volume was published in 1619, but, being still more free and personal in its satire than those which had preceded it, it was immediately ordered to be burned by the common hangman.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

When [[Marie de' Medici]] became regent following Henry's assassination in 1610, she embraced the [[Counter-Reformation]] and Aubigné's isolation made him an easy target. He was proscribed in 1620 and fled to Geneva where he lived for the rest of his life, though the hatred of the French court showed itself in procuring a sentence of death to be recorded against him more than once. He devoted the period of his exile to study, and supervising the fortifications of [[Bern]] and [[Basel]] which were designed as a material defence of the cause of Protestantism.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Legacy==
His daughter Louise Arthemise d'Aubigné, [[Madame de Villette]], was born in 1584 at Mursay to Suzanne de Lusignan de Lezay; at an early age on 22 October 1610 she married [[Benjamin Valois de Vilette]] in Maillezais.

His son, [[Constant d'Aubigné]], led a scandalous life of adventure; still, his son Theodore (1613–1670) continued on the d'Aubigné line.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Between his two sons, and then later his three grandsons, the family eventually sailed to England in the late 1680s, or America, avoiding the Huguenot persecution in Europe. Later in 1715 or thereabouts, most if not all of the main family had sailed to the new world and settled on the east coast near the North River around [[Falls Church, Virginia]], and changed their name to Dabney. His great grand daughter [[Françoise Charlotte d'Aubigné]] married into the [[Dukes of Noailles|House of Noailles]].

===Les Tragiques===

Written over some three decades, the [[French alexandrine|alexandrine verse]] of this epic poem relies on multiple genres as well as stylistic familiarity with the work of the opposing, Catholic poets of the [[Pléïade]], headed by [[Pierre de Ronsard]]. Divided into seven books, a number symbolic of the author's ultimate, apocalyptic intent, the Tragiques incorporates literary influence from classical sources, such as [[tragedy]] and [[satire]], palpable in the first three books ("Les Misères," "Les Princes" and "La Chambre Dorée" respectively), before resorting to influence from genres like ecclesiastical history, martyrology and [[apocalypse]] in the creation of the remaining books ("{{lang|fr|Les Feux}}," "{{lang|fr|Les Fers,}}" "{{lang|fr|Vengeances,}}" and "{{lang|fr|Jugement}}").

In the first of two liminal paratexts, the introduction "Aux Lecteurs," Aubigné endorses the account (also found in his autobiographical ''{{lang|fr|Sa Vie à Ses Enfants}}''), that the inception of the Tragiques came to him as an ecstatic vision during a [[near-death experience]]. In the second, "L'Auteur À Son Livre," Aubigné adopts the metaphor of father as author to name the text that follows (Les Tragiques) as a more pious son than the less religious works of his youth (c.f.: Le Printemps). The intent of the epic is subsequently spelled out as an attack against the falsely beautiful, verisimilar works written by the Catholic poets of the Pléïade for their patrons in the midst of the religious wars.

Snelling has been published in standard geological publications estimating the age of geological specimens in billions of years, but has also written articles for creationist journals in which he supports a [[young-earth creationism]] viewpoint.&lt;ref name=Ritchie/&gt; He worked in the [[RATE project]].&lt;ref name="icr"&gt;{{cite web|title=The RATE Project|url=http://www.icr.org/research/rate/|publisher=Institute for Creation Research|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snelling appeared in the 2017 creationist documentary film ''[[Is Genesis History?]]''

==Discrimination allegation lawsuit==
Snelling, like other [[young-Earth creationists]], believes the Grand Canyon formed after the [[Biblical flood]]; the rocks in Grand Canyon were formed billions of years ago and the Grand Canyon itself was [[Geology of the Grand Canyon area|formed]] millions of years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhouGuardian"/&gt;  In 2013 Snelling applied for a permit to collect 50-60 half-pound rocks from the park.&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Australian"/&gt; The application was denied because the National Park Service screens applications to take material from the Grand Canyon, in order to protect it.  One of the three geologists who reviewed the proposal for the National Park Service stated that the type of rock Snelling was trying to test could be found outside the park, and all three reviewers made it clear they did not consider the proposal scientifically valid.&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Sarah|title=A Creationist Sues the Grand Canyon for Religious Discrimination|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/grand-canyon-creationism/526467/|accessdate=4 June 2017|publisher=Atlantic Monthly|date=17 May 2017}}.  Article has link to [https://web.archive.org/web/20170606171220/http://www.adfmedia.org/files/SnellingComplaint.pdf lawsuit filing]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Snelling submitted a revised proposal in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amanda Reilly|title=Update: Creationist geologist wins permit to collect rocks in Grand Canyon after lawsuit|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/05/creationist-geologist-sues-us-park-service-after-it-rejects-request-collect-samples|work=E&amp;E News via '"Science''|date=June 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter dated May 5, 2017, the NPS said it found the application acceptable and it was willing to grant it, if changes were made to locations and methods of collecting rocks; Snelling proposed to chisel away rocks and to do so from highly visible rock faces, to take samples from land that was not park land but rather was on an [[Indian reservation]] and also from another location that was likely to have archeological remains.&lt;ref name=Cin/&gt;  The NPS had authorized a river trip for Snelling to survey locations but not to collect specimens; Snelling objected that this would take too much time and expense, and in response in the May 5 letter, the NPS offered to have staff work with Snelling to map locations in a meeting or conference call.&lt;ref name=Cin/&gt;

On May 9, 2017, Snelling, with the help of the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]], filed a religious discrimination lawsuit against the [[United States Department of the Interior]] and the [[Grand Canyon National Park]] authorities, citing the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]'s [[List of executive actions by Donald Trump#Executive orders|executive order]] of May 4, 2017 about [[religious liberty]].&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Blackford | first1=Linda | title=Creation Museum Researcher Alleges Religious Discrimination in Grand Canyon | url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article149693129.html | date=May 10, 2017 | publisher=''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' | accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite web | title=Christian Geologist Sues Grand Canyon for Religious Discrimination | url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/05/30/christian-geologist-sues-grand-canyon-for-religious-discrimination.html | date=May 30, 2017 | publisher=[[Fox News]] | accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2017 Answers in Genesis released a statement saying the National Park authorities had issued Snelling a permit to collect rock samples, and that Snelling had withdrawn the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="ZhouGuardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wartman|first1=Scott|title=NKY Notebook: Creation Museum researcher cleared to study Grand Canyon; Brent Spence traffic not a 'hell'|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/06/29/nky-notebook-creation-museum-researcher-cleared-study-grand-canyon/439019001/|work=Cincinnati.com|date=June 29, 2017|language=en}}.

The '''Battle of Meligalas''' ({{lang-el|Μάχη του Μελιγαλά|Machi tou Meligala}}) took place at [[Meligalas]] in [[Messenia]] in southwestern Greece, on 13–15 September 1944, between the [[Greek Resistance]] forces of the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) and the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Hellenic State (1941–1944)|collaborationist]] [[Security Battalions]].

During the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], ELAS [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] forces began operating in the [[Peloponnese]] from 1942, and in 1943 began to establish their control over the area. To confront them, the German occupation authorities formed the Security Battalions, which took part not only in anti-guerrilla operations but also in mass reprisals against the local civilian population. With the liberation of Greece drawing near in 1944, the Security Battalions were increasingly targeted by ELAS.

Following the withdrawal of German forces from the Peloponnese in September 1944, a part of the collaborationist forces in [[Kalamata]] withdrew to Meligalas, where a force of about 1,000 Battalionists gathered. There they were quickly surrounded by ELAS detachments, some 1,200 strong. After a three-day battle, the ELAS partisans broke through the fortifications and entered the town. The ELAS victory was followed by a massacre, during which prisoners and civilians were executed near a well (πηγάδα). The number of executed people is variously estimated at between 700 and 1,100 on different counts. After news of the massacre spread, the leadership of ELAS and of its political parent group, the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM) took steps to ensure a peaceful transition of power in most of the country, limiting reprisal occurrences.

During the post-war period and following the [[Greek Civil War]], the ruling right-wing establishment immortalized the Meligalas massacre as evidence of [[communist]] brutality, and memorialized the victims as patriotic heroes. Following the ''[[Metapolitefsi]]'', the official support of this commemoration ceased. The massacre continues to be commemorated by the descendants and ideological sympathizers of the Security Battalions, and remains a point of reference and a rallying cry both for the [[far-right politics|far right]] and the [[left-wing politics|left]] in Greece.

== Political and military background ==
=== Emergence of the Resistance in occupied Messenia ===
Following the [[German invasion of Greece]] in April 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] desired to quickly extricate German forces for the impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. As a result, the largest portion of the occupied country, including the [[Peloponnese]], came under Italian military control. [[Western Thrace]] and eastern [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] came under Bulgarian control, and various strategically important areas (notably [[Athens]] and [[Piraeus]], [[Crete]], and [[Thessaloniki]] with [[Central Macedonia]]) remained under German control.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=19–22}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=36–37}}

In the [[Kalamata Province]], the nascent [[Communist Party of Greece|communist]]-led [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM) began its activity in 1942, promoting [[passive resistance]] to the unpopular confiscation of crops by the Italian military authorities, and began the first steps to form [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] troops.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=112}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=97}} The first left-wing groups formed across the [[Peloponnese]]; their engagements were limited to skirmishes with the [[Greek Gendarmerie]] and the Italian Army, and by late 1942 they were almost all either destroyed or forced to evacuate to [[Central Greece]].{{sfn|Fleischer|1995|pp=98–99}} In April 1943, when the Peloponnese was considered "partisan-free" by the occupation authorities, the [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] [[Dimitris Michas]], who had previously been imprisoned by the Italians, formed a new partisan group on orders from EAM. Following his first successes, and with the arrival of reinforcements requested from the mainland, the group grew and began openly attacking Italian soldiers and their Greek informants.{{sfn|Fleischer|1995|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=113}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=97, 134–135, 182–183}} By June 1943, the number of [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) partisans in the Peloponnese reached about 500 men in total. Due to the lack of a central command and the difficulties of communication, they were dispersed and operated as quasi-autonomous groups.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=125, 187–188}} In August 1943, according to a German intelligence report, partisan activity spiked in the mountainous areas of Messenia, where 800 men under [[Kostas Kanellopoulos]] operated.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=158}}

In early 1943, the "[[Hellenic Army (resistance organization)|Hellenic Army]]" (ES), formed by mostly royalist former officers, was established as a Resistance group and formed its own small armed groups, which clashed with the Italians. Initially it declared itself a politically independent and neutral force, but after forging ties with royalist networks chiefly in the area and in Athens, it shifted to an anti-EAM stance by July.{{sfn|Fleischer|1995|pp=95–98, 109}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=158}} The British made efforts to unify the local Resistance groups in the Peloponnese, but these failed, and in August 1943 ES clashed with ELAS, while some of its most prominent leaders, such as {{ill|Dionysios Papadongonas|el|Διονύσιος Παπαδόγγονας}} and possibly also [[Tilemachos Vrettakos]], respectively sought collaboration with the Italian and German occupation authorities against ELAS. However, the apparent delay of German assistance, the losses suffered by Vrettakos' men in a clash with a German force at {{ill|Pyrgaki, Arcadia|el|Πυργάκι Αρκαδίας}}, and the cessation of Allied air drops to both ES and ELAS, resulted in the defeat and dissolution of the former at the hands of the latter in October. This left EAM/ELAS as the sole organized Resistance force in the Peloponnese.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=194, 201–204}}{{sfn|Fleischer|1995|pp=97, 100–108, 109–110}}

=== German takeover and the establishment of the Security Battalions ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-177-1459-26, Korfu, Vormarsch deutscher Truppen.jpg|thumb|German troops enter the formerly Italian zone, Corfu 1943]]
In the meantime, after the [[Italian capitulation]] in September 1943, the overall command of anti-partisan operations in the southern Peloponnese fell to the German major general [[Karl von Le Suire]], commander of the [[117th Jäger Division]], which had been moved to the area in July. In October, Le Suire was named the sole military commander in the Peloponnese.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=90, 117–118, 170, 228}} The town of [[Meligalas]] in northern Messenia, which under Italian occupation had housed a [[Carabinieri]] station, now became the seat of two German infantry companies.{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|p=110}}&lt;ref name="IOS"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Eleftherotypia]]|url=http://www.iospress.gr/ios2005/ios20050911.htm|title=Η μαύρη εθνική Πηγάδα|date=11 September 2005|accessdate=30 August 2018|author=|language=Greek|trans-title=The Black National Well}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian capitulation led to the immediate and considerable reinforcement of ELAS in morale, personnel, and materiel,{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=152}} and with British support ELAS forces began attacking German targets.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=175, 179}} In the mountainous districts of the Peloponnese, representatives of EAM/ELAS translated their monopoly of armed resistance into the exercise of authority, but faced difficulties with the mostly conservative and royalist local population.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=206–209}}{{sfn|Fleischer|1995|p=108}}{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=291}} Peasant disaffection was further fuelled by the requirement to feed the partisans amidst conditions of malnourishment and a general disruption of the agricultural production caused by the mounting [[hyperinflation]] and by the large-scale German anti-partisan sweeps (''Säuberungen'').{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=209–211}}{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=48–49, 170}} These operations involved reprisals against the civilian population, following a July order of the commander of the [[LXVIII Corps]], [[Hellmuth Felmy]].{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=96–97, 125–126}} In the Peloponnese, Le Suire carried these orders out with particular ruthlessness, particularly as the partisan threat mounted, resulting in the [[Kalavryta massacre]] in December.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=177, 179}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-179-1552-13, Griechenland, erhängter Mann in Ortschaft.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soldier of the Security Battalions next to an executed civilian (1943)]]
In 1943, the German commanders in Greece concluded that their own forces were insufficient to suppress ELAS. As a result, and in order to "spare German blood", the decision was taken to recruit the anti-communist elements of Greek society to fight EAM.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=501–502}}{{sfn|Fleischer|1982|p=196}} Apart from the "[[Evzone]] Battalions" (Ευζωνικά Τάγματα) established by the [[Hellenic State (1941–1944)|collaborationist government]] of [[Ioannis Rallis]], in late 1943 independent "[[Security Battalions]]" (Τάγματα Ασφαλείας, ΤΑ) began being raised, particularly in the Peloponnese, where the political affiliations of a large part of the population and the violent dissolution of ES provided a broad recruitment pool of anti-communists.{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=16–19}}{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=326–327}} By early 1944, five battalions were formed and placed under the overall command of Papadongonas. One of them was the Kalamata Security Battalion (Τάγμα Ασφαλείας Καλαμών), based at Meligalas, which controlled the road from [[Kalamata]] to [[Tripolis, Greece|Tripolis]] and the entire area of the south.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=16–19}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=543}} The Security Battalions were subordinated to the [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] in Greece, [[Walter Schimana]], but the development of relations of trust between the individual battalion commands and the local German authorities led to them enjoying a relative freedom of movement.{{sfn|Fleischer|1982|pp=190, 193}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=506, 507}} The Security Battalions served as garrisons in towns across the Peloponnese, but also increasingly participated in German anti-partisan operations; they chose those that would be executed among prisoners and themselves executed hostages as reprisals for partisan attacks on German targets (as happened after the [[execution of Major General Franz Krech]] by ELAS in April 1944),{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=172}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=507–515}} gaining a reputation for lack of discipline and brutality.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=326, 333–334}}

[[File:Borci na ELAS.jpg|thumb|ELAS fighters]]
After suffering some early blows, ELAS managed to recover its influence, and from 1944 conducted constant sabotage on the supply routes used by the German army.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=172}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=515–516}} In April 1944, ELAS for the first time attacked a town held by a German garrison at Meligalas, but the assault was beaten back.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=543–544}} In the same month, EAM leader [[Georgios Siantos]], following reports of indiscipline among the partisan forces in the Peloponnese, sent there [[Aris Velouchiotis]] as representative of the [[Political Committee of National Liberation]] (PEEA), EAM's newly established parallel government. Velouchiotis' task was to reorganize the [[3rd ELAS Division]], with a total strength of some 6,000 men.{{sfn|Gasparinatos|1998|p=336}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=544}}{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=300, 316}} Velouchiotis quickly imposed strict discipline, managing to reverse the decline in partisan numbers and increase the number of their attacks on enemy targets.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=208, 546}} The deterioration of the military situation led Felmy to declare the Peloponnese as a combat zone in May, which allowed Le Suire to in turn declare [[martial law]], limiting the civilian population's freedom of movement and assembly.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=172, 180}}{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=553–555}} Nevertheless, the sweeps and reprisals by the Germans and their collaborators were not enough to reverse ELAS penetration of the countryside in Messenia and neighbouring [[Laconia]].{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=40–42}} In the area of Kalamata, where during the occupation thousands of homes were torched and about 1,500 people had been executed, the reprisals of the Security Battalions continued until late summer.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=358}} In late August, while clashes between the ELAS and the Germans had decreased, those between ELAS and the Security Battalions increased steadily.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=581}}

In November 1943, the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|Moscow Conference]] issued a joint "Statement on Atrocities" by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders [[Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], concerning the prosecution and trial of those Germans responsible for [[war crimes]] against occupied nations. This also served as the basis for the condemnation of Axis collaborators in the occupied countries.{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|p=71}} In the spirit of this declaration, the [[Greek government in exile]] announced the revocation of Greek nationality from the members of the collaborationist governments, while PEEA issued a legal act proscribing the [[death penalty]] for [[high treason]] to those who collaborated with the occupation authorities, including the members of the Security Battalions.{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|pp=72, 75–76}} However, the burgeoning confrontation between EAM and the government in exile and its British backers, who at least since 1943 began to view EAM as an obstacle to their own plans for Britain's post-war role in Greece, led the British to consider the possibility of using the Security Battalions as part of the planned post-war national Greek army, or at least as a means of applying pressure and getting EAM to agree to support a [[national unity government]]. Thus, during negotiations on forming a new government, [[Georgios Papandreou]], head of the government in exile, resisted the pressure of the PEEA delegates to publicly condemn the Security Battalions, arguing that this had already been done in the [[Lebanon Conference]] in May 1944, and in June he caused the Allied propaganda against the Security Battalions, both through the dropping of leaflets and through radio emissions, to be suspended.{{sfn|Papastratis|1984|pp=209–210}}{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|p=77}}

With the [[Red Army]] advancing in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and the [[Battle of Romania|invasion of Romania]], on 23 August 1944 the German command decided to withdraw the 117th Division from the Peloponnese. Three days later the complete evacuation of German forces from mainland Greece was decided.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=583–586}}{{sfn|Gasparinatos|1998|p=321}} The British desired the maintenance of the status quo until the arrival of their forces and the Papandreou government, and above all wanted to avoid German arms and equipment from falling into the hands of the partisans.{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|p=137}} On the other hand, EAM/ELAS and its supporters were eager for revenge on the remnants of the collaborationist Gendarmerie and the Security Battalions.{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|p=137}} After the German troops withdrew from the Peloponnese, the position of their former allies became highly precarious, and fears of ELAS reprisals spread.{{sfn|Mazower|2000|p=28}} On 3 September, the military head of ELAS, [[Stefanos Sarafis]], issued a proclamation calling upon the members of the Security Battalions to surrender with their weapons, in order to safeguard their lives.{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|p=134}} On the same day the British lieutenant general [[Ronald Scobie]], appointed joint commander-in-chief of all Greek forces, issued an order to his deputy in Athens, the Greek lieutenant general [[Panagiotis Spiliotopoulos]], to recommend to the Security Battalions personnel to either desert or to surrender themselves to him, with the promise that they would be treated as regular [[prisoners of war]]. This order, however, either did not apply to the Security Battalions in the Peloponnese or was in the event ignored by them.{{sfn|Hondros|1990|p=268}} As EAM had joined the Papandreou government on 15 August, on 6 September a formal declaration of the new national unity government was issued, in which the members of the Security Battalions were designated as criminals against the fatherland, and called upon to "immediately abandon" their positions and join the Allies. At the same time, the declaration called on the Resistance forces to stop any acts of reprisal, insisting that dispensing justice was a right reserved by the state and not of "organizations and individuals", while promising that "the national [[nemesis]] will be implacable".{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|p=80}}{{sfn|Hondros|1990|p=267}}

=== German withdrawal and aftermath ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-178-1536-18A, Griechenland, griechische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Men of the Security Battalions rest in the countryside (1943)]]
During the last months of the German occupation, [[Walter Blume (SS officer)|Walter Blume]], the head of the German security police ([[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]) developed the so-called "chaos thesis", involving not only a thorough [[scorched earth]] policy, but also encouraging the slide of Greece into civil war and chaos. While Blume's more radical proposals concerning the elimination of the (mostly anti-communist and pro-British) pre-war political leadership were halted by more sober elements in the German leadership,{{sfn|Mazower|1993|pp=232–234}} as they withdrew from the Peloponnese in early September, the Germans destroyed bridges and railway lines and left weapons and ammunition to the Security Battalions, laying the groundwork for a civil war with ELAS.{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|p=134}}

Based on the denunciation of the Security Battalions by the national unity government, ELAS considered the Security Battalions as enemy formations.{{sfn|Mazower|2000|p=28}} At [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]], the capital of [[Elis Prefecture]], the commander of the local battalion, Georgios Kokkonis, announced that he placed his unit under the command of the exiled king [[George II of Greece|George II]] and the national government. Kokkonis conducted negotiations with ELAS, trying to prevent its entry into the city before the arrival of an official government representative, while ELAS demanded the immediate disarmament of the unit. In the end, ELAS attacked on 9 September and after a bloody struggle seized the city on the next day.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|pp=602–603}}{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|pp=136–137}} At Tripolis, the negotiations between Colonel Papadongonas and 3rd ELAS Division quickly broke down. As the partisans surrounded the city, mining the roads and cutting off its water supply, and their own ammunition began to run out, the Battalionists descended into panic. Some defected, but the remainder installed a regime of terror in the city: anyone even suspected of ties to the partisans was imprisoned and Papadongonas threatened to blow them up if ELAS attacked, while his men mined the city and executed people on the streets. Nevertheless, Papadongonas was able to hold out until the end of September, when he surrendered to a British unit.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=358}}

== Events in Messenia ==
At Kalamata, the Germans departed on 5 September, leaving the Gendarmerie as the sole official armed force in the city.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=571}} Using representatives of the Allied Middle East Headquarters as intermediaries, ELAS approached the prefect of Messenia, Dimitrios Perrotis, proposing the disarmament of the local Security Battalions and their confinement as prisoners until the arrival of the exiled national government. After the proposal was rejected, ELAS attacked the city at dawn of 9 September.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=571–572}} As the partisans overcame the Battalionists' resistance, large numbers of local civilians began arriving in the city to take revenge on them.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=572–573}} About 100–120 Battalionists, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Nikos Theofanous and Perrotis, managed to escape the city via the unguarded railway line and sought refuge at Meligalas. A strong force of {{circa|800}} Security Battalion men was already ensconced there, and was further reinforced by another 100–120 men who arrived from [[Kopanaki]] on 11 September.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=572, 574}}

Consequently, the capture of Meligalas assumed a major importance for ELAS in its bid to secure its control over the Peloponnese. The [[archimandrite]] {{ill|Ioil Giannakopoulos|el|Ιωήλ Γιαννακόπουλος}} along with two British officers, went to the town to deliver a proposal for the disarmament of the Battalionists and their transfer to a secure prisoner camp until the arrival of the government, in order to secure life and property for themselves and their families, but Perrotis rejected it. Pleas by relatives of the Battalionists who arrived from nearby villages had a similar fate.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=573–574}}

The Battalionists installed a heavy machine gun in the clock tower of the main church in Meligalas, Agios Ilias, and distributed the {{circa|50}} light machine guns they possessed in houses around the church and in semi-circular ramparts around the paddock of Meligalas.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=574}} ELAS forces, numbering {{circa|1,200}} men from the 8th and 9th Regiments, launched their attack on the morning of 13 September.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=574–575}} The attack followed a plan laid down with the participation of {{ill|Giannis Michalopoulos (Orion)|el|Γιάννης Μιχαλόπουλος (Ωρίων)|lt=Giannis Michalopoulos}} (''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Orion") from the staff of the 9th ELAS Brigade: 2/9 Battalion assumed the sector between the Meligalas–[[Anthousa, Messenia|Anthousa]] and Meligalas–Neochori roads, 1/9 Battalion assumed the sector northeast of Profitis Ilias height, 3/9 Battalion the northern sector up to the road towards [[Meropi]], and 1/8 Battalion the eastern plain until the road to [[Skala, Messenia|Skala]]. At the Skala heights, ELAS also positioned its sole 10.5 cm gun (lacking a [[gun carriage]]), commanded by the artillery captain Kostas Kalogeropoulos.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=574–575}} The ELAS plan aimed at the rapid advance of 2/9 Battalion, under Captain Tasos Anastasopoulos ("Kolopilalas") from the edge of the settlement to the main square, so that the Agios Ilias fort could be attacked on two sides.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=575}}

The attackers, however, encountered a minefield of improvised mines (boxes with dynamite) planted by the Battalionists the previous afternoon and evening, during the negotiations with ELAS.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=574, 575–576}} A new plan was made, aiming at the storming of Agios Ilias by a company of 2/9 Battalion under {{ill|Kostas Basakidis|el|Κώστας Μπασακίδης}}.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=575–576}} This new assault forced the Battalionists to dismount the heavy machine gun from the clock tower, while the attack of 1/8 Battalion forced the garrison of the railway station to retreat to the [[bedesten]], where a number of EAM sympathizers were being held hostage. From the afternoon to nightfall, the lines of the combatants remained the same, but the losses suffered by the Battalionists led to a fall in their morale and unwillingness to continue the battle.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=576, 578}} Their commander, Major Dionysios Papadopulos, sent a delegation to request aid from [[Panagiotis Stoupas]] in nearby [[Gargalianoi]], but the delegates abandoned their mission as soon as they left Meligalas.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=576–577}}

At noon of 14 September, a group of 30 partisans attacked by throwing German [[Teller mine]]s on the barbed wire protecting Agios Ilias, but was repulsed amidst a hail of fire by the Battalionists. A squad under Basakidis managed to breach the barricades of the defenders, but left without support, they were thrown back in a counterattack led by the sergeant major Panagiotis Benos.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=578}} The sight of wounded ELAS fighters, and news of a murder committed by Battalionists, heightened the hostile mood among the civilians observing the battle.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=577–578}}

On the morning of 15 September, the leaders of the Security Battalions met in council. Major Papadopoulos proposed attempting a breakthrough in the direction of Gargalianoi,  but the council was abruptly interrupted when the house was hit by a mortar bomb. In addition, rumours of the breakthrough plan were spread by Perrotis' men, panicking the wounded Battalionists, but also the imprisoned EAM sympathizers.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=578–579}} The council was terminated following a new ELAS attack on Agios Ilias, during which Basakidis' men, using hand grenades and submachine guns, managed to push the Battalionists back. From their new positions, four ELAS partisans began firing with their light machine guns into the interior of the town, while on the sector of 1/8 Battalion, Battalionists began raising white flags in surrender. A few dozen Battalionists under Major Kazakos tried to escape to the south and thence to [[Derveni, Arcadia|Derveni]], but suffered heavy casualties from the Reserve ELAS, the ''{{ill|Mavroskoufides|el|Μαυροσκούφηδες (ΕΛΑΣ)}}'' (Velouchiotis' personal guard), and a squad of 11th ELAS Regiment at the heights near Anthousa.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=579}}

=== Reprisals and executions ===
[[File:BRAVOS-1940.jpg|thumb|upright|The lawyer [[Vasilis Bravos]], head of the ELAS court martial that ordered the executions at the well]]
The end of the battle was followed by the invasion of Meligalas by civilians, and an unchecked plunder and massacre.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=579–580}} According to a contemporary report preserved in the archives of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), these were inhabitants of the village of Skala, which had been torched by the German army.{{sfn|Lymberatos|2009|p=93 (note 171)}} Among the captive Battalionists held in the bedesten, Velouchiotis—who arrived at Meligalas shortly after the end of the battle with his personal escort&lt;ref name="Velouchiotis" /&gt;—recognized a gendarme whom he had previously arrested and then released, and ordered his execution.{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=580}} The first reprisal wave, tacitly encouraged by ELAS through the deliberately loose guarding of its captives,{{sfn|Lymberatos|2009|p=93}} was followed by a series of organized executions.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=580}}

A partisan court martial was set up in the town, headed by the lawyers [[Vasilis Bravos]] and {{ill|Ioannis Karamouzis|el|Γιάννης Καραμούζης}}. This court summarily condemned not only the {{circa|60}} officers and other leaders of the Battalions—lists with their names had been provided by local EAM cells—but also many others, including for reasons having more to do with personal differences rather than any crime committed. The executions took place at an abandoned well ("πηγάδα") outside the town.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|pp=580–581}} According to usual practice, to avoid the executioners being recognized, the executions were carried out by an ELAS detachment from a different area, most likely a squad of 8th Regiment, whose men were from the area of [[Kosmas, Greece|Kosmas]] and [[Tsitalia]] in [[Arcadia]].{{sfn|Moutoulas|2004|p=581}}

On 17 September, Velouchiotis moved to Kalamata,&lt;ref name="Velouchiotis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ο Βελουχιώτης επιστρέφει στον Μελιγαλά|author=Marios Athanasopoulos|newspaper=[[Proto Thema]]|date=12 February 2017|accessdate=30 August 2018|url=http://www.platy-kalamatas-messinias.gr/2017/02/blog-post_13.html|language=Greek|trans-title=Hagiography Slaughters History}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Perrotis and other collaborationist officials were also brought. At the central square of the city, the enraged crowd broke the ranks of the ELAS militia and lynched some of the prisoners, while twelve of them were hanged from lampposts.{{sfn|Mazower|2000|p=28}}{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=358}}

=== Casualty estimates ===
[[File:Meligalas cemetery 1.jpg|thumb|The cemetery of the victims of the massacre]]
In an ELAS communique of 26 September 1944, Major General [[Emmanouil Mantakas]] reported that "800 ''Rallides'' [the derogatory nickname for the Battalionists, after the collaborationist PM [[Ioannis Rallis]]] were killed",&lt;ref&gt;Communique Nr. 68 of ELAS GHQ. Reproduced in {{cite book|title=Κείμενα της Εθνικής Αντίστασης|trans-title=Documents of the National Resistance|volume=I|page=414|publisher=Synchroni Epochi|location=Athens|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number repeated by Stefanos Sarafis in his own book on ELAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarafis|first=Stefanos|authorlink=Stefanos Sarafis|title=Ο ΕΛΑΣ|location=Athens|year=1946|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Red Cross]] report, which generally tried to be as objective as possible, stated that the number of dead "exceeded 1,000",{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=604}} while a year later, the team of the noted Greek coroner {{ill|Dimitrios Kapsaskis|el|Δημήτριος Καψάσκης}} reported that it recovered 708 corpses from Meligalas.{{sfn|Kalyvas|2009|p=44}}

The post-war right-wing establishment insisted on a considerably higher tally, with estimates ranging from 1,110 to over 2,500 victims. Thus the [[National Radical Union]] politician Kosmas Antonopoulos, whose father had been executed by ELAS, wrote about 2,100 executed people at Meligalas, although he cites data for 699 people.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Antonopoulos and his research, cf. {{harvnb|Kalyvas|2009|pp=47–48}}, {{harvnb|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=132–133}} and {{cite news|url=http://www.tovima.gr/opinions/article/?aid=308737|title=Η «κόκκινη» και η «μαύρη» βία|author=Hagen Fleischer|newspaper=[[To Vima]]|accessdate=30 August 2018|date=10 January 2010|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, authors sympathetic to EAM reduce the number of executions considerably: the most detailed account calculates 120 killed in action and 280–350 executed.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt; Ilias Theodoropoulos, whose brother was killed in Meligalas, in his book (distributed by the "Society of Victims of the Meligalas Well") mentions from 1,500 to over 2,000 dead, and provides a list with 1,144 names (of whom 108 from Meligalas) of those killed in action and those executed by ELAS (including some of those lynched in Kalamata, such as Perrotis).{{sfn|Theodoropoulos|1998|pp=204–269}} Among the victims are 18 elderly,&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt; 22 women and 9 adolescents (8 boys and a girl),{{sfn|Theodoropoulos|1998|pp=204–269}} while all the rest—with some exceptions where age is not mentioned{{sfn|Theodoropoulos|1998|pp=204–269}}—are men of fighting age.&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;{{Sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|p=67}}

== Aftermath ==
The events at Meligalas and Kalamata were detrimental to EAM, whose leadership initially denied that any massacre had taken place, only to be forced to acknowledge it later and issue a condemnation. The more moderate leaders of EAM, [[Alexandros Svolos]] and Sarafis, insisted that they faithfully carried out the orders of the national unity government, and issued orders to "stop all executions".{{sfn|Mazower|2000|p=28}}

These events demonstrated the willingness of ELAS to take into account significant losses in order to gain control before the arrival of British forces, and its ability to succeed in this goal, led to a shift in British policy: the British liaison officers in the Peloponnese, who until then were under orders not to get involved in events, were now directed to intervene to secure the surrender, safekeeping, and delivery of the Security Battalions' weapons to British forces, to avoid them falling in the hands of ELAS.{{sfn|Bærentzen|1981|pp=137–138, 140}} As a result, due to the mediation of British liaisons, the Red Cross, representatives of the Papandreou government, or even the local EAM authorities, in many towns of Central Greece and the Peloponnese the Security Battalions surrendered without resistance or bloodshed.{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=68–69}} There were nevertheless several cases where Battalionists, having surrendered, were killed, either by ELAS partisans, or by civilian mobs and relatives of Battalionist victims, as at Pylos or in some places in northern Greece. This was mainly the result of the widespread desire for vengeance among the population, but some cases involved the co-operation or even instigation of EAM cadres.{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=66–68}} The social polarization between EAM and its opponents, both [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal]] and nationalist anti-communists, resulted in the adoption of a sort of [[double speak]]. EAM proclaimed that it supported order and the restoration of government authority, while at the same time launching a large-scale bloody extrajudicial purge, in order to secure its political domination before the arrival of the British forces, improve its negotiating position within the government, and satisfy the popular demand for revenge, so as to then demonstrate self-restraint and respect before the law. EAM's rivals on the other hand guaranteed its participation in the government while simultaneously trying to preserve the lives of the collaborationists.{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|pp=109–110, 112}}

In general, however, in the power vacuum in the wake of the German withdrawal, the EAM/ELAS officials who assumed control tried to impose order, preventing rioting and looting, and resisted calls for revenge by the populace. According to [[Mark Mazower]], "ELAS rule was as orderly as was to be expected in the extraordinary circumstances that prevailed. Passions ran high, and intense suspicions were mingled with euphoria". Furthermore, EAM/ELAS was not a monolithic or tightly controlled organization, and its representatives displayed a variety of behaviour; as British observers noted, in some areas ELAS maintained order "fairly and impartially", while abusing their power in others.{{sfn|Mazower|1993|p=359}} When British forces landed in the Peloponnese, they found the [[National Civil Guard]], created by EAM in late summer to assume policing duties from the partisans and replace the discredited collaborationist Gendarmerie, maintained control and order. In [[Patras]], for example, joint patrols of British soldiers and Civil Guard men were carried out until November 1944.{{sfn|Mazower|2000|p=28}} Reprisals were also a common phenomenon in other European countries that suffered under Nazi occupation, from the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|mass expulsion of the Germans]] in eastern Europe to mass executions of collaborationists: over 10,000 in France, and between 12,000 and 20,000 in Italy.{{sfn|Lymberatos|2009|pp=87–88}}{{sfn|Lowe|2013|loc=Chapters 12 &amp; 13}}

On 26 September 1944, the [[Caserta Agreement]] was signed by Papandreou, [[EDES]] leader [[Napoleon Zervas]], Sarafis on behalf of ELAS, and Scobie. The agreement placed ELAS and EDES under Scobie's overall command, and designated the Security Battalions as "instruments of the enemy", ordering that they were to be treated as hostile forces if they did not surrender. After the agreement was signed, Scobie ordered his officers to intervene in order to protect the Battalionists, disarming them and confining them under guard.{{sfn|Kousouris|2014|p=91}}{{sfn|Hondros|1990|p=269}}

Following the Liberation of Greece in October 1944, in some occasions the families of Meligalas victims received pensions based on the collaborationist government's law 927/1943 on military and civil officials murdered "by anarchist elements" during the execution of their duties, a law which was retained by the post-war governments.{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|p=84}}

== Commemoration ==
Since September 1945, an annual memorial service for the victims has taken place. It is organized by the local authorities and has official representation, including government members during the [[Greek military junta]].&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;

The Meligalas events were utilized politically and ideologically.&lt;ref name="vima"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=476215|title=Ο Μελιγαλάς και ο «μύθος» του.

The slogans on both sides that wrote history, and those nostalgic of civil hatred|author=Giannis N. Boskozos|newspaper=[[To Vima]]|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing establishment after the [[Greek Civil War]] represented Meligalas as a symbol of "communist barbarity",{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=66–67}} while the Battalionists were commemorated exclusively as opponents or victims of the communists, since the post-war Greek state drew its legitimacy not from the collaborationist government, but from the government in exile. In newspaper announcements for the annual service and the speeches held there, every mention of the victims' membership in the Security Battalions was omitted; instead, they were referred to as "murdered ''ethnikofrones'' [national-minded persons]" or "patriots".{{sfn|Kostopoulos|2005|pp=87–89, 95–97}}

In 1982, following the [[Greek legislative election, 1981|electoral victory]] of the socialist [[PASOK]] the previous year, the [[Ministry of the Interior (Greece)|Ministry of the Interior]] declared that these commemorations were promoting intolerance and for 40 years had been promoting division, and decided the cessation of official authorities' attendance at the memorial service. Its organization henceforth was undertaken by the "Society of Victims of the Meligalas Well" (Σύλλογος Θυμάτων Πηγάδας Μελιγαλά), established in 1980. The relative marginalization of the memorial service was accompanied by the transformation of the speeches from celebratory to apologetic for the victims' role in the Security Battalions. In recent times, the service is attended by relatives of the victims and by far-right or even [[neo-Nazi]] groupings such as [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref name="IOS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=168197|title=Το κλούβιο «αβγό του φιδιού»|language=Greek|trans-title=The rotten "snake's egg"|author=Vasilis Nedos|newspaper=[[To Vima]]|date=11 September 2005|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EAM ELAS Meligalas graffiti.jpg|thumb|A 2011 graffiti of the "EAM-ELAS-Meligalas" slogan at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].]]
In the early 1980s, the Meligalas events became a point of reference in confrontations between university students close to the {{ill|"Rigas Feraios" (student organization)|el|ΕΚΟΝ Ρήγας Φεραίος - Β΄ Πανελλαδική|lt="Rigas Feraios" communist youth movement}} and the Leftist Clusters on the one side and the right-wing [[Youth Organisation of New Democracy|ONNED youth organization]] and its student wing, [[Renewing Democratic Leadership-New Democratic Student Movement|DAP-NDFK]]. After the PASOK government officially recognized EAM's contribution in the Greek Resistance in 1982, "Rigas Feraios" members coined the slogan "EAM-ELAS-Meligalas" ("ΕΑΜ-ΕΛΑΣ-Μελιγαλάς") as a counter to the positive portrayal of the Battalionists by the right-wing groups.&lt;ref name="vima" /&gt; The slogan remained current in the university students' conference of 1992, following Civil War-era and anti-communist slogans used by DAP.&lt;ref name="EfSyn" /&gt; In the late 2000s, when the political slogans and rhetoric of the 1940s increasingly resurfaced in Greek political discourse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.efsyn.gr/?p=143848|title=Μας ξανάρχονται ένα ένα…|language=Greek|trans-title=Here they come again, one by one...|author=Tasos Kostopoulos|newspaper=[[Efimerida ton Syntakton]]|date=22 October 2013|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Golden Dawn's entry into the [[Greek Parliament]] in [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|2012]], the Meligalas events were re-evaluated in a positive light by the Greek left as an example of [[militant anti-fascist]] action. Reference to them is now commonly combined with typically [[anti-authoritarian]] slogans.&lt;ref name="EfSyn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.efsyn.gr/?p=82540|newspaper=[[Efimerida ton Syntakton]]|title=ΕΑΜ-ΕΛΑΣ-Μελιγαλάς|language=Greek|trans-title=EAM-ELAS-Meligalas|author=Tasos Kostopoulos|date=30 July 2013|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Check dam Thadayana.jpg|thumb|A check Dam at Kudumboor across chandragiri River]]

== Function ==
A check dam placed in the [[ditch]], swale, or [[canal|channel]] interrupts the flow of water and flattens the gradient of the channel, thereby reducing the velocity. In turn, this obstruction induces [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] rather than [[Erosion|eroding]] the channel.&lt;ref name="Marsh, Landscape Planning"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=William M.|title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Applications|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Danvers, MA|isbn=978-0-470-57081-4|pages=267–268|edition=5th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 27, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used not only to slow flow velocity but also to distribute flows across a swale to avoid preferential paths and guide flows toward vegetation.&lt;ref name='Melbourne Water, "WSUD"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melbourne Water|title=Water Sensitive Urban Design Engineering Procedures: Stormwater|date=2005|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Australia|isbn=0-643-09092-4|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AF9K93GWw2AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA&amp;q=WSUD%20Engineering%20Procedures%3A%20Stormwater%3A%20Stormwater|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some [[sedimentation]] may result behind the dam, check dams do not primarily function as sediment trapping devices.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS)|title=Design Manual - Erosion and Sediment Control|date=2013|publisher=Institute for Transportation at Iowa State University|location=Ames, IA|url=http://www.iowasudas.org/manuals/design/Chapter07/7E-7.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Check dams could be designed to create small reservoirs, without possibility of silting. A self desilting design was published in 'Invention Intelligence, August, 1987, which while being permanent, would also remove silt as it is formed, keeping the reservoir capacity maximum. The design envisages an awning, going very near the bottom level, extending to the width of the dam, and embedding into the sides. When freshets occur, the silt is automatically carried over to down stream, keeping the reservoir clear.

== Applications ==

=== Grade control mechanism ===

Check dams have traditionally been implemented in two main environments: across channel bottoms and on hilly slopes.&lt;ref name='Garcia, Carmelo, "Check Dams"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Carmelo &amp; Mario Lenzi|title=Check Dams, Morphological Adjustments and Erosion Control in Torrential Streams|date=2010|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61761-749-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Check dams are used primarily to control water velocity, conserve soil, and improve land.&lt;ref&gt;A conceptual model of check dam hydraulics for gully control:efficiency, optimal spacing and relation with step-pools C. Castillo, R. Pérez, and J. A. Gómez from Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 18, 1705–1721, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They are used when other flow-control practices, such as lining the channel or creating [[bioswales]] is impractical.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt; Accordingly, they are commonly used in degrading temporary channels, in which permanent stabilization is impractical and infeasible in terms of resource allocation and funding due to the short life period.  Or, they are used when construction delays and weather conditions prevent timely installation of other erosion control practices.&lt;ref name=NCDENR&gt;{{cite book|last1=North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources|title=Practice Standards and Specifications|date=2006|publisher=NCDENR|location=Raleigh, N.C.|pages=6.83.1–6.83.3|url=http://portal.ncdenr.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=efbff6bd-e595-4828-be6a-394be4c404c2&amp;groupId=38334|accessdate=28 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically seen during the construction process of large-scale permanent [[dams]] or erosion control. As such, check dams serve as temporary grade-control mechanisms along waterways until resolute stabilization is established or along permanent swales that need protection prior to installation of a non-erodible lining.&lt;ref name="UDFCD, Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Urban Drainage and Flood Control District|title=Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual Volume 3|date=2010|publisher=Urban Drainage and Flood Control District|location=Colorado|url=http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/chapter%207%20fact%20sheets/EC-12%20Check%20Dam.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905051511/http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/chapter%207%20fact%20sheets/EC-12%20Check%20Dam.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water quality control mechanism ===
Many check dams tend to form [[stream pool]]s. Under low-flow circumstances, water either [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrates]] into the ground, [[Evaporation|evaporates]], or seeps through or under the dam. Under high flow - [[flood]] - conditions, water flows over or through the structure. Coarse and medium-grained sediment from [[Runoff (water)|runoff]] tends to be deposited behind check dams, while finer grains flow through. Extra nutrients, [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], [[heavy metals]], and floating garbage are also trapped by check dams, increasing their effectiveness as water quality control measures.

=== Arid regions ===
In arid areas, check dams are often built to increase groundwater recharge in a process called managed aquifer recharge. Winter runoff thus can be stored in aquifers, from which the water can be withdrawn during the dry season for irrigation, livestock watering, and even drinking water supply. This is particularly useful for small settlements located far from a large urban center as check dams require less reliance on machinery, funding, or advanced understandings as compared to large-scale dam implementation.&lt;ref&gt;S. Parimala Renganayaki, L. Elango (April 2013). "A review on managed aquifer recharge by check dams: a case study near Chennai, India". : International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology 2 (4): 416–423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Agoramoorthy, "The Check Dam Route"' /&gt;

Check dams can be used in combination with [[liman irrigation system|limans]] to stop and collect [[surface runoff]] water.

=== Mountainous regions ===
As a strategy to stabilize mountain streams, the construction of check dams has a long tradition in many mountainous regions dating back to the 19th century in Europe. Because of the steep slopes in the mountain region, it may be difficult for large construction machinery to reach mountain streams; therefore, check dams have been implemented in place of large-scale dams.  Because the typical high slope causes the flow velocity to move faster, a terraced system of multiple closely spaced check dams is typically necessary to reduce velocity and thereby counteract erosion.  Such consolidation check dams, built in terraces, attempt to prevent both headward and downward cutting into channel beds while also stabilizing adjacent hill slopes. They are further used to mitigate flood and debris flow hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazzorana|first1=Bruno|title=The susceptibility of consolidation check dams as a key factor for maintenance planning|journal=Österreichische Wasser- und Abfallwirtschaft|date=6 June 2014|volume=66|issue=5|pages=214–216|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00506-014-0160-4/fulltext.html|accessdate=5 October 2014|doi=10.1007/s00506-014-0160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations ==

=== Site ===
Before installing a check dam, careful inspection of the site must be undertaken. The [[Drainage basin|drainage area]] should be ten acres or less.&lt;ref name="MS DEQ, Erosion Stormwater Manual" /&gt;&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt;  The waterway should be on a slope of no more than 50% and should have a minimum depth to bedrock of 2&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name='Idaho DEQ, "Stormwater Best Management Practices"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Department of Environmental Quality|title=IDEQ Stormwater Best Management Practices Catalog: Check Dams BMP 32|date=2005|publisher=State of Idaho|pages=106–108|url=http://www.deq.idaho.gov/media/617590-32.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Check dams are often used in natural or constructed channels or swales. They should never be placed in live streams unless approved by appropriate local, state and/or federal authorities.&lt;ref name='Idaho DEQ, "Stormwater Best Management Practices"' /&gt;

=== Materials ===
Check dams are made of a variety of materials. Because they are typically used as temporary structures, they are often made of cheap and accessible materials such as rocks, gravel, logs, hay bales, and sandbags.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt; Of these, logs and rock check dams are usually permanent or semi-permanent; and the sandbag check dam is implemented primarily for temporary purposes. Also, there are check dams that are constructed with rockfill or wooden boards. These dams are usually implemented only in small, open channels that drain {{convert|10|acre|km2|2|abbr=on}} or less; and usually do not exceed {{convert|2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=NRCS&gt;{{cite web|last1=USDA Natural Resource Conservation Services (NRCS)|title=Urban BMPs: Water Erosion|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/checkdam.pdf|website=usda.gov|publisher=USDA|accessdate=28 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Woven-wire can be used to construct check dams in order to hold fine material in a gully. They are typically utilized in environments where the gully has a moderate slope (less than 10%), small drainage area, and in regions where flood flows do not typically carry large rocks or boulders.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{cite web|title=FAO Watershed Management Field Manual|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad082e/ad082e03.htm|website=fao.org|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organizations of the United Nations|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In nearly all instances, erosion control blankets, which are biodegradable open-weave blankets, are used in conjunction with check dams. These blankets help enforce vegetation growth on the slopes, shorelines and ditch bottoms.

===Size ===
A check dam should not be more than {{convert|2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="USDA BMPs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Urban BMPs: Water, erosion, check dams|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/checkdam.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the center of the dam should be at least {{convert|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}} lower than its edges.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt; They may kill grass linings in channels if water stays high or sediment load is great.  This criteria induces a weir effect, resulting in increased water surface level upstream for some, if not all flow conditions.&lt;ref name="UK pdf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rickard|first1=Charles &amp; Rodney Day, Jeremy Purseglove|title=River Weirs – Good Practice Guide|date=2003|publisher=Environment Agency|location=UK|page=xi|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/290655/sw5b-023-hqp-e-e.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacing ===

In order to effectively slow down water velocity to counter the effects of erosion and protect the channel between dams in a larger system, the spacing must be designed properly. The check dams should be spaced such that the toe of the upstream check dam is equal to the elevation of the downstream check dam's crest.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://wiki.sustainabletechnologies.ca/wiki/Check_dams |title=Check dams |author= Sustainable Technologies Evaluation Program |website= Low Impact Development Stormwater Management Planning and Design Guide |access-date= 28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By doing so, the water can pond between check dams and thus slow the flow's velocity down substantially as the water progresses downslope.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt;

== Advantages ==

Check dams are a highly effective practice to reduce flow velocities in channels and waterways.  Contrasting big dams, check dams have a faster implementation timeline, are cost effective, and are smaller in scope.  Because of this, their implementation will not typically displace people or communities nor will they destroy natural resources if careful design considerations are undertaken.&lt;ref name='Agoramoorthy, "Small Size, Big Potential"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agoramoorthy|first1=Govindasamy, and Minna J. Hsu|title=Small Size, Big Potential: Check Dams for Sustainable Development|journal=Environment|date=2008|volume=50|issue=4|pages=22–34|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/224015181?accountid=14749|accessdate=28 October 2014|doi=10.3200/envt.50.4.22-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the dams themselves are simple to construct and do not rely on advanced technologies – thereby they can be applied in more rural and less advanced communities, as they have been in India's drylands for some time now.&lt;ref name='Agoramoorthy, "Small Size, Big Potential"' /&gt;

== Limitations ==

Check dams still require maintenance and sediment removal practices.  They become more difficult to implement on steep slopes, as velocity is higher and thereby the distance between dams must be shortened.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt; Check dams, depending on the material used, can have a limited life span but if implemented correctly can be considered permanent though not encouraged.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
Check dams require regular maintenance as they are used primarily as a temporary structure and thereby are not designed to withstand long-term use.  Dams should be inspected every week that it is sited in the channel and after every large storm.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt; It is important that rubble, litter, and leaves are removed from the upstream side of the dam.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"'&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Environmental Protection Agency|title=Water Best Management Practices: Check Dams|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Check-Dams.cfm|website=water.epa.gov|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically done when the sediment has reached a height of one-half the original height of the dam.&lt;ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /&gt;

Further, maintenance is required when removing the check dam altogether.  In order to ensure the future flow is not adversely altered, the check dam must be fully removed, including any parts that may have been dislodged and washed downstream or any newly developed bare spots where the check dam once was situated.&lt;ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /&gt;

As [[Minor (law)|minors]] by law, children do not have autonomy or the right to make decisions on their own for themselves in any known jurisdiction of the world. Instead their adult caregivers, including [[parent]]s, [[social worker]]s, [[teacher]]s, [[youth worker]]s, and others, are vested with that authority, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Lansdown, G. "Children's welfare and children's rights," in Hendrick, H. (2005) ''Child Welfare And Social Policy: An Essential Reader.'' The Policy Press. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that this state of affairs gives children insufficient control over their own lives and causes them to be vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Lansdown, G. (1994). "Children's rights," in B. Mayall (ed.) ''Children's childhood: Observed and experienced.'' London: The Falmer Press. p 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Althusser]] has gone so far as to describe this legal machinery, as it applies to children, as "repressive state apparatuses".&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, C. (1996) "Conceptual limitations," ''Childhood.'' New York: Routledge. p 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structures such as government policy have been held by some commentators to mask the ways adults abuse and exploit children, resulting in [[child poverty]], lack of [[right to education|educational opportunities]], and [[child labour]]. On this view, children are to be regarded as a [[minority group]] towards whom society needs to reconsider the way it behaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thorne | first1 = B | year = 1987 | title = Re-Visioning Women and Social Change: Where Are the Children? | url = | journal = Gender &amp; Society | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 85–109 | doi=10.1177/089124387001001005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic definitions of children's rights ==

[[Sir William Blackstone]] (1765-9) recognized three parental duties to the child: maintenance, protection, and education.&lt;ref name="Blackstone1-16" &gt;Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Book One, [http://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-116/ Chapter Sixteen]. (1765-1769).&lt;/ref&gt; In modern language, the child has a right to receive these from the parent.

The [[League of Nations]] adopted the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child|''Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child'']] (1924), which enunciated the child's right to receive the requirements for normal development, the right of the hungry child to be fed, the right of the sick child to receive health care, the right of the backward child to be reclaimed, the right of orphans to shelter, and the right to protection from exploitation.&lt;ref name="childrights1924"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/childrights.html Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924], adopted Sept. 26, 1924, League of Nations O.J. Spec. Supp. 21, at 43 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) in Article 25(2) recognized the need of motherhood and childhood to "special protection and assistance" and the right of all children to "social protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |

author= | home= | title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights | url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf | date=10 December 1948 | accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the ''United Nations [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]]'' (1959), which enunciated ten principles for the protection of children's rights, including the universality of rights, the right to special protection, and the right to protection from discrimination, among other rights.&lt;ref name="childrights1959"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/k1drc.htm Declaration of the Rights of the Child], G.A. res. 1386 (XIV), 14 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 19, U.N. Doc. A/4354 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensus on defining children's rights has become clearer in the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, B. (2001) ''The new handbook of children's rights: comparative policy and practice.'' Routledge. p 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1973 publication by [[Hillary Clinton]] (then an attorney) stated that children's rights were a "slogan in need of a definition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rodham | first1 = H | year = 1973 | title = Children Under the Law | url =http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-43,-issue-4/herarticle/_991 | journal = Harvard Educational Review | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 487–514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some researchers, the notion of children’s rights is still not well defined, with at least one proposing that there is no singularly accepted definition or theory of the rights held by children.&lt;ref name="nesl.edu"&gt;Mangold, S.V.

Retrieved 4/3/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Children’s rights law]] is defined as the point where the law intersects with a child's life. That includes [[juvenile delinquency]], [[due process]] for children involved in the criminal justice system, appropriate representation, and effective rehabilitative services; care and protection for children in state care; ensuring education for all children regardless of their [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[national origin]], [[religion]], [[disability]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ethnicity]], or other characteristics, and; health care and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Ahearn, D., Holzer, B. with Andrews, L.

==Classification==

Children have two types of [[human rights]] under [[international human rights law]]. They have the same fundamental general human rights as adults, although some human rights, such as the ''right to marry'', are dormant until they are of age, Secondly, they have special human rights that are necessary to protect them during their minority.&lt;ref name="UNICEF1"&gt;UNICEF, [http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_protecting.html Convention on the Rights of the Child], 29 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; General rights operative in childhood include the ''right to security of the person'', ''to freedom from inhuman, cruel, or degrading treatment'', and the ''right to special protection during childhood''.&lt;ref name="ICCPR"&gt;{{vcite web |author= | home= | title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights | url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3ae6b3aa0.pdf | date= 16 December 1966 | accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular human rights of children include, among other rights, the ''right to life'', the ''right to a name'', the ''right to express his views in matters concerning the child'', the ''right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'', the ''right to health care'', the ''right to protection from economic and [[sexual exploitation]]'', and the ''right to education''.&lt;ref name="CRC" /&gt;

Children's rights are defined in numerous ways, including a wide spectrum of [[civil and political rights|civil, political]], [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. Rights tend to be of two general types: those advocating for children as [[autonomy|autonomous persons]] under the law and those placing a claim on society for protection from harms perpetrated on children because of their dependency. These have been labeled as the ''right of [[empowerment]]'' and as the ''right to protection''.&lt;ref name="nesl.edu"/&gt;

United Nations educational guides for children classify the rights outlined in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] as the "3 Ps": Provision, Protection, and Participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Young-Bruehl, Elisabeth |date=2012 |title=Childism: Confronting Prejudice Against Children |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-17311-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be elaborated as follows:

* '''Provision:''' Children have the [[right to an adequate standard of living]], [[health care]], [[education]] and services, and to [[Play (activity)|play]] and [[recreation]]. These include a [[balanced diet]], a warm bed to sleep in, and access to [[schooling]].
* '''Protection:''' Children have the right to protection from [[Child abuse|abuse]], neglect, exploitation and discrimination. This includes the right to safe places for children to play; constructive child rearing behavior, and acknowledgment of the [[evolving capacities]] of children.
* '''Participation:''' Children have the right to [[youth participation|participate in communities]] and have [[youth program|programs and services]] for themselves. This includes children's involvement in libraries and community programs, [[youth voice]] activities, and involving children as decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;(1997) "Children's rights in the Canadian context", ''Interchange. 8''(1–2). Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, the [[Child Rights Information Network|Child Rights International Network]] (CRIN) categorizes rights into two groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=13423 "A-Z of Children's Rights"], Children's Rights Information Network. Retrieved 2/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, M. (2000) "The Future of Children's Rights," ''Children &amp; Society. 14''(4) p 277-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic, social and cultural rights, related to the conditions necessary to meet basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, health care, and gainful employment. Included are rights to [[education]], adequate housing, food, water, the highest attainable standard of [[health]], the [[right to work]] and rights at work, as well as the [[cultural rights]] of minorities and indigenous peoples.
* Environmental, cultural and developmental rights, which are sometimes called "[[third generation rights]]," and including the right to live in safe and healthy environments and that groups of people have the right to cultural, political, and economic development.

[[Amnesty International]] openly advocates four particular children's rights, including the end to [[incarceration|juvenile incarceration]] without [[parole]], an end to the recruitment of [[military use of children]], ending the [[death penalty]] for people under 21, and raising awareness of [[student rights|human rights in the classroom]].&lt;ref name="Children's Rights"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]], an international advocacy organization, includes [[child labor]], [[juvenile justice]], [[orphan]]s and abandoned children, [[refugee]]s, [[street children]] and [[corporal punishment]].

Scholarly study generally focuses children's rights by identifying individual rights. The following rights "allow children to grow up healthy and free":{{according to whom|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, C.F. (1972) "Reviewed Work: Children's Rights: Toward the Liberation of the Child by Paul Adams", ''Peabody Journal of Education. 49''(4). p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Freedom of speech]]
* [[Freedom of thought]]
* [[Freedom from fear]]
* [[Freedom of choice]] and the [[Decision making|right to make decisions]]
* Ownership over one's body

===Physical rights===

A report by the Committee on Social Affairs, Health, and Sustainable Development of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] identified several areas the Committee was concerned about, including procedures such as "female genital mutilation, the circumcision of young boys for religious reasons, early childhood medical interventions in the case of [[Intersex human rights|intersex]] children and the submission to or coercion of children into piercings, tattoos or plastic surgery".&lt;ref name="report"&gt;Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development.

Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child enjoins parties to "take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation".&lt;ref&gt;UN (2012). 11.

Newell (1993) argued that "...pressure for protection of children's physical integrity should be an integral part of pressure for all children's rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |

The Committee on Bioethics of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) (1997), citing the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989), asserts that "every child should have the opportunity to grow and develop free from preventable illness or injury."&lt;ref name="religiousobjections"&gt;{{vcite journal | author=Committee on Bioethics | title=Religious objections to medical care. | journal=Pediatrics | date=1997 | volume=99 | issue= | pages=279 | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/99/2/279.full.pdf | doi=10.1542/peds.99.2.279 | pmid=9024462 | pmc= }} reaffirmed May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===

Other issues affecting children's rights include the [[military use of children]], [[sale of children]], [[child prostitution]] and [[child pornography]].

=== Difference between children's rights and youth rights ===
{{main|Youth rights}}

"In the majority of jurisdictions, for instance, children are not allowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have sex, or to engage in paid employment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-children/ "Children's Rights"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.'' Retrieved 2/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[youth rights movement]], it is believed that the key difference between ''children's'' rights and ''[[youth rights|youth]]'' rights is that children's rights supporters generally advocate the establishment and enforcement of protection for children and youths, while youth rights (a far smaller movement) generally advocates the expansion of freedom for children and/or youths and of rights such as [[suffrage]].

=== Parental powers ===
{{See also|Parents' rights movement}}

Parent are given sufficient powers to fulfill their duties to the child.&lt;ref name="Blackstone1-16" /&gt;

[[Parent]]s affect the lives of children in a unique way, and as such their role in children's rights has to be distinguished in a particular way. Particular issues in the child-parent relationship include [[child neglect]], [[child abuse]], [[freedom of choice]], [[corporal punishment]] and [[child custody]].&lt;ref&gt;Brownlie, J. and Anderson, S. (2006) "'Beyond Anti-Smacking': Rethinking parent–child relations," ''Childhood. 13''(4) p 479-498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutting, E. (1999) "Giving Parents a Voice: A Children's Rights Issue," ''Rightlines. 2'' ERIC #ED428855.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been theories offered that provide parents with rights-based practices that resolve the tension between "commonsense parenting" and children's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, S. and Noggle, R. (1997) "The Moral Status of Children: Children's Rights, Parent's Rights, and Family Justice," ''Social Theory and Practice. 23.''&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is particularly relevant in legal proceedings that affect the potential [[emancipation of minors]], and in cases where children sue their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Kaslow, FW (1990) Children who sue parents: A new form of family homicide? ''Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. 16''(2) p 151–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child's rights to a relationship with both their parents is increasingly recognized as an important factor for determining the [[best interests of the child]] in [[divorce]] and [[child custody]] proceedings.  Some governments have enacted laws creating a [[rebuttable presumption]] that [[shared parenting]] is in the [[best interests]] of children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fact.on.ca/ "What is equal shared parenting?"] Fathers Are Capable Too: Parenting Association. Retrieved 2/24/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Limitations of parental powers ====

Parents do not have absolute power over their children. Parents are subject to criminal laws against abandonment, abuse, and neglect of children. International human rights law provides that manifestation of one's religion may be limited in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref name="ICCPR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] as amended by Protocols No. 11 and No. 14''. Adopted at Rome, 4 XL 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts have placed other limits on parental powers and acts. The [[United States Supreme Court]], in the case of ''[[Prince v. Massachusetts]]'', ruled that a parent's religion does not permit a child to be placed at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0321_0158_ZO.html Prince v. Massachusetts], 321 U.S. 158 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] ruled, in the case of ''Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority and another'', that parental rights diminish with the increasing age and competency of the child, but do not vanish completely until the child reaches majority. Parental rights are derived from the parent's duties to the child. In the absence of duty, no parental right exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthlaw.swan.ac.uk/resource_files/sexual%20health/gillick.PDF Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503175113/http://healthlaw.swan.ac.uk/resource_files/sexual%20health/gillick.PDF |date=2005-05-03 }} [1985] 1 AC 112, [1985] 3 All ER 402, [1985] 3 WLR 830, [1986] 1 FLR 224, [1986] Crim LR 113, 2 BMLR 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Peter W.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"While children undeniably benefit from the Charter, most notably in its protection of their rights to life and to the security of their person, they are unable to assert these rights, and our society accordingly presumes that parents will exercise their freedom of choice in a manner that does not offend the rights of their children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1220/index.do B. (R.) v. Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto]. [1995] 1 S.C.R.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Timeline of children's rights in the United Kingdom|Timeline of children's rights in the United States}}

The 1796 publication of [[Thomas Spence]]'s ''[[Rights of Infants]]'' is among the earliest English-language assertions of the rights of children. Throughout the 20th century, children's rights activists organized for homeless children's rights and [[public education]]. The 1927 publication of ''[[The Child's Right to Respect]]'' by [[Janusz Korczak]] strengthened the literature surrounding the field, and today dozens of international organizations are working around the world to promote children's rights. In the UK the formation of a community of educationalists, teachers, youth justice workers, politicians and cultural contributors called the New Ideals in Education Conferences&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences]&lt;/ref&gt; (1914–37) stood for the value of 'liberating the child' and helped to define the 'good' primary school in England until the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Their conferences inspired the UNESCO organisation, the New Education Fellowship. 

A.S. Neill's 1915 book ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), a diary of a headteacher changing his school to one based on the liberation and happiness of the child, can be seen as a cultural product that celebrates the heroes of this movement.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Opposition ===

(1994). "Children's rights," in B. Mayall (ed.) ''Children's childhood: Observed and experienced.'' London: The Falmer Press.

==International human rights law==
{{further|International child abduction}}
{{main|Declaration of the Rights of the Child}}
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is seen as a basis for all international legal standards for children's rights today. There are several conventions and laws that address children's rights around the world. A number of current and historical documents affect those rights, including the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]],&lt;ref name="childrights1924" /&gt; drafted by [[Eglantyne Jebb]] in 1923, endorsed by the [[League of Nations]]  in 1924 and reaffirmed in 1934. A slightly expanded version was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1946, followed by a much expanded version adopted by the General Assembly in 1959. It later served as the basis for the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

===International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights===

The United Nations adopted the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) in 1966. The ICCPR is a multilateral international covenant that has been ratified or acceded to by nearly all nations on Earth. Nations which have become state-parties to the Covenant are required to honor and enforce the rights enunciated by the Covenant. The treaty came into effect on 23 March 1976. The rights codified by the ICCPR are universal, so they apply to everyone without exception and this includes children. Although children have all rights, some rights such as the right to marry and the right to vote come into effect only after the child reaches maturity.&lt;ref name="ICCPR" /&gt;

Some general rights applicable to children include:

* the right to life
* the right to security of person
* the right to freedom from torture
* the right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
* the right to be separated from adults when charged with a crime, the right to speedy adjudication, and the right to be accorded treatment appropriate to their age&lt;ref name="ICCPR" /&gt;

Article 24 codifies the right of the child to special protection due to his minority, the right to a name, and the right to a nationality.&lt;ref name="ICCPR" /&gt;

===Convention on the Rights of the Child===
{{main|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}

The [[United Nations]]' 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], or CRC, is the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights—civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Its implementation is monitored by the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]]. National governments that [[Ratification|ratify]] it commit themselves to protecting and ensuring children's rights, and agree to hold themselves accountable for this commitment before the [[international community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/crc/ Convention on the Rights of the Child], UNICEF. Retrieved 4/3/08.&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 196 ratifications; the [[United States]] is the only country not to have ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|last=UN|first=|date=2018|website=|language=EN|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRC is based on four core principles: the principle of non-discrimination; the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development; and considering the views of the child in decisions that affect them, according to their age and maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/crc/ Convention on the Rights of the Child]&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC, along with international criminal accountability mechanisms such as the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Rwanda Tribunal]]s, and the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], is said to have significantly increased the profile of children's rights worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, K, Popvoski, V, ''et al.''

===Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action===
The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] urges, at Section II para 47, all nations to undertake measures to the maximum extent of their available resources, with the support of international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action. And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from [[natural disaster]]s and [[armed conflict]]s and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further, para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female [[infanticide]], harmful [[child labour]], [[sale of children]] and organs, [[child prostitution]], [[child pornography]], and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]. Section II, para 46 &amp; 47&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced the adoptions of [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] and [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]].

===Enforcement===
A variety of enforcement organizations and mechanisms exist to ensure children's rights. They include the Child Rights Caucus for the [[United Nations General Assembly]] Special Session on Children. It was set up to promote full implementation and compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to ensure that child rights were given priority during the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children and its Preparatory process. The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] was created "with the hope that it could be more objective, credible and efficient in denouncing human rights violations worldwide than the highly politicized Commission on Human Rights." The NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child is a coalition of international [[non-governmental organisation]]s originally formed in 1983 to facilitate the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

==National law==

Many countries around the world have children's rights [[ombudsman|ombudspeople]] or children's commissioners whose official, governmental duty is to represent the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints reported by individual citizens regarding children's rights. Children's ombudspeople can also work for a corporation, a newspaper, an NGO, or even for the general public.

===United States law===
{{further|Timeline of children's rights in the United States|International child abduction in the United States|Child labor laws in the United States}}

The United States has signed but not ratified the CRC. As a result, children's rights have not been systematically implemented in the U.S.

Children are generally afforded the basic rights embodied by the Constitution, as enshrined by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of that amendment is to apply to children, born within a marriage or not, but excludes children not yet born.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;{{vcite web |author= | home= | title=Children's Rights | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/childrens_rights | date= | accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reinforced by the landmark [[US Supreme Court]] decision of ''[[In re Gault]]'' (1967). In this trial 15-year-old Gerald Gault of Arizona was taken into custody by local police after being accused of making an obscene telephone call. He was detained and committed to the Arizona State Industrial School until he reached the age of 21 for making an obscene phone call to an adult neighbor. In an 8–1 decision, the Court ruled that in hearings which could result in commitment to an institution, people under the age of 18 have the right to notice and counsel, to question witnesses, and to protection against self-incrimination. The Court found that the procedures used in Gault's hearing met none of these requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0387_0001_ZS.html ''In re Gault''], 387 U.S. 1 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in the case of ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'' (1969) that students in school have Constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0393_0503_ZS.html Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District] , 393 U.S. 503 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court]] has ruled in the case of ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' that persons may not be [[Capital punishment in the United States|executed]] for crimes committed when below the age of eighteen. It ruled that such executions are [[cruel and unusual punishment]], so they are a violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Roper v. Simmons |vol= 543 |reporter=U. S. |opinion=551 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2005 |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZS.html |accessdate=24 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other concerns in the United States regarding children's rights. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys is concerned with children's rights to a safe, supportive and stable family structure. Their position on children's rights in adoption cases states that, "children have a constitutionally based liberty interest in the protection of their established families, rights which are at least equal to, and we believe outweigh, the rights of others who would claim a 'possessory' interest in these children." Other issues raised in American children's rights advocacy include children's rights to inheritance in [[same-sex marriage]]s and [[History of youth rights in the United States|particular rights for youth]].

===German law===
A report filed by the President of the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe|INGO Conference of the Council of Europe]], Annelise Oeschger finds that children and their parents are subject to [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] and [[UNICEF]] [[human rights]] violations.  Of particular concern is the German (and Austrian) agency, Jugendamt ([[German language|German]]: Youth office) that often unfairly allows for unchecked government control of the parent-child relationship, which have resulted in harm including [[torture]], degrading, [[cruel]] treatment and has led to children's death.  The problem is complicated by the nearly "unlimited power" of the Jugendamt officers, with no processes to review or resolve inappropriate or harmful treatment.  By German law, Jugendamt officers are protected against prosecution.  Jugendamt (JA) officers span of control is seen in cases that go to family court where experts testimony may be overturned by lesser educated or experienced JA officers; In more than 90% of the cases the JA officer's recommendation is accepted by family court. Officers have also disregarded family court decisions, such as when to return children to their parents, without repercussions. Germany has not recognized related child-welfare decisions made by the European Parliamentary Court that have sought to protect or resolve children and parental rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/DE/LCR_GER_UPR_S4_2009_LeagueforChildrensRights.pdf League for Children's Rights] Individual UPR Submission: Germany.

'''CimTrak''' is computer [[software]] for [[file integrity monitoring]] and [[regulatory compliance]] auditing. It  assists in ensuring the [[availability]] and [[integrity]] of critical IT assets by detecting the root-cause and responding immediately to any unexpected changes to the host [[operating system]], applications, and network devices located on the IT infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dayaciptamandiri.com/web/index.php/solutions/cimtrak/|title=Gain Control of IT Security, Compliance, and Continuity With CimTrak|publisher=PT Daya Cipta Mandiri Solusi |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; CimTrak works [[cross-platform]] and is supported on multiple Windows, Linux, Unix, and Macintosh operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyexecutivesclub.com/Articles/security/cimtraksum.php|title=CimTrak Benefits Summary: A Practical Look at a CimTrak Deployment|publisher=Executive Technology Club |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is licensed as [[commercial software]].

==Product architecture==
CimTrak has multiple core components:&lt;ref name="Cimcor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimcor.com/downloads/CimTrak_For_Servers_Installation_Guide.pdf|title=CimTrak Integrity &amp; Compliance Suite 2.0.6.3 Installation Guidance|publisher=Cimcor, Inc. |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimcor.com/cimtrak/products/howitworks|title=How Cimtrak Monitors Your IT Environment for Changes|publisher=Cimcor, Inc. |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''CimTrak Master Repository'' is a Microsoft Windows-based data repository and database that stores files and configurations and performs comparisons to determine file/configuration additions, deletions, and changes. The Master Repository contains information relating to Authoritative Copies, Baseline Monitor Data, Configuration Database, and Logging/Reporting Database.
* ''CimTrak Management Console'' is a centralized Microsoft Windows-based [[thin client]], [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) that allows for configuration of the CimTrak application. The Management Console allows for authorized CimTrak administrators to perform the configuration of Object Group Watch Policies, CimTrak Configuration Parameters, CimTrak Permissions, and viewing and querying CimTrak Event Logs and integrated reporting.
* ''CimTrak Agents'' are available for the [[operating system]]s [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Unix]], and [[OS X]].&lt;ref name="Cimcor"/&gt;  The agents monitor files or configurations for additions, deletions, and modifications.  Additionally, the agents have the ability to monitor system resources such as utilization of CPUs, networks, memory, and disks.  Variants exist to facilitate varying [[file integrity monitoring]] and network monitoring tasks.
** ''CimTrak File System Agents''
*** ''CimTrak for Servers''
*** ''CimTrak for Workstations/Desktops''
*** ''CimTrak for Point of Sales (POS)''
** ''CimTrak Network Device Agent''
*** ''CimTrak for Network Devices''
* ''CimTrak Tools'' are tools designed to enhance CimTrak abilities via command line administration, remote access to monitored data, component communication diagnostics, and component communication proxy.
** ''CimTrak Tools''
*** ''CimTrak [[Command-line interface|Command Line]] Utility''
*** ''CimTrak [[FTP]] Server Utility''
*** ''CimTrak [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] Utility''
*** ''CimTrak [[Proxy server|Proxy]] Utility''
* ''CimTrak [[ODBC]] Driver'' provides a method to interact with the Master Repository's internal, secured database.  The repository has a wealth of data that can be used for reporting and analysis.  The CimTrak ODBC Driver allows a CimTrak administrator, auditor, or user to perform SQL queries of information stored in the logging and configuration database.

==Product functionality==
CimTrak has many functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimcor.com/downloads/CimTrak_For_Servers_User_Guide.pdf|title=CimTrak Integrity &amp; Compliance Suite 2.0.6.3 Users Guidance|publisher=Cimcor, Inc. |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can detect additions, deletions and modifications to files and configurations on computer operating systems and components installed on the operating system. On initial configuration, it takes a ''snapshot'' of the files and configurations on the operating system, and uses this data to create a cryptographic hash of the files and configurations, and stores them securely in the CimTrak Master Repository as the known, good baseline.

The CimTrak Agents are installed on operating systems containing data that is configured for monitoring or, in the case of the Network Device Agent, installed on systems that have a [[Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]] network connection to supported network devices.  The agent detects when changes are made to monitored files and configurations by communicating with the Kernel and comparing changes to the known cryptographic hash associated with affected files or configurations.  If the calculated cryptographic hash is different then the known baseline, CimTrak will initiate the user-configured corrective action defined in the CimTrak Object Group Policy and will send internal and external event notifications using one or many of the following methods:
* ''Internal Event Log and Change Logs''
* ''[[NitroSecurity]] NitroView Plugin Protocol''
* ''[[Syslog]]''
* ''[[Simple Network Management Protocol]]'' (SNMPv1)
* ''[[SMTP]]'' (email)
* ''[[WebTrends]] Logging Format''
* ''Custom configured alerting methods''

===Change detection===
CimTrak provides insight into the IT infrastructure by detecting changes that could compromise servers, networks, or sensitive customer data such as payment card information ([[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI)).  It can provide instant change remediation options without requiring the integration of external applications.  When a change is detected, CimTrak captures the change at the exact moment it occurs and provides a detailed audit trail of the incident, including:
*  ''Event Date and Time''
* ''Source IP Address''
* ''Operating System User''
* ''Process Used''
* ''Physical content modified''

===Automated remediation===
CimTrak will report the automated response taken and, if configured, initiate remediation. Automated responses are termed ''Corrective Actions'', and include:
* ''Restore from Repository'' - Monitored files and operating system configurations are automatically restored to a prior baseline without needing user intervention.  The Restore from Repository mode restores operating system/configuration changes using stored authoritative files.
* ''Update Baseline'' - An incremental backup or snapshot is taken of monitored files and operating system configurations.  Authorized administrators can compare between captured baselines and, in many cases, manually roll-back to prior baselines using stored authoritative files.
* ''Log Only'' - CimTrak audits monitored files and operating system configurations without the ability to restore back to a prior generation.
* ''Prompt for Approval'' - Changes are allowed for files and operating system configurations.  CimTrak Administrators have the ability to disallow changes which result in remediation to a prior baseline from stored authoritative files.
Corrective actions can be defined based on each type of change action (file/configuration addition, file/configuration change, file/configuration deletion).  In addition to the automated remediation functionality, CimTrak can automatically launch different custom scripts based on the detected change type.

===Change monitoring===
CimTrak File System Agents and Network Device Agents can perform [[change management]] functions by monitoring file and configurations based on the configured Object Group Watch Policies, which abilities vary by operating system.

====File System Agent - Microsoft Windows abilities====
* Drivers (poll-based auditing)
* Installed Software (poll-based auditing)
* Network Shares (poll-based auditing and remediation)
* Registry (real-time auditing and remediation)
* Local Security Policy (poll-based auditing)
* Services (poll-based auditing)

====File System Agent - Linux-Unix-Macintosh abilities====
* System Users (poll-based auditing)
* System Groups (poll-based auditing)
* File Integrity Monitoring (real-time/poll-based auditing and remediation)
* Network File System Integrity Monitoring (poll-based auditing and remediation)

====Network Device Agent - supported network devices====

====Additional monitoring abilities - Windows-Linux====
CimTrak Plug-ins enhance the abilities of CimTrak by adding additional monitoring functions, and will attach toFile System Agents, Network Device Agents, or both.

Plug-ins include:
* ''CimTrak for Databases'' ensures that critical database configurations, schema, user roles and permissions, and access settings do not deviate from their known, trusted state.
* ''CimTrak Network Flex Module'' analyzes script output and determines when a variance to the known expected occurs.
* ''CimTrak Server Flex Module'' analyzes script output and determines when a variance to the known expected occurs.
* ''CimTrak PCI Configuration Monitor'' provides a stream-lined auditing utility capable of indicating overall compliance status, non-compliant configurations, and compliant configurations of Microsoft Windows-based servers, workstations and POS Systems.
* ''CimTrak VMware ESXi'' Configuration Monitor monitors critical core VMware ESXi configurations such a user/host access permissions, active directory realms, network settings, integrated 3rd party tools, and advanced user configurations.
* ''CimTrak for Active Directory/LDAP'' monitors directory services for deviations to objects, attributes, and schema.

== Application security ==
CimTrak is constructed to follow software and communication security standards, and has government and IT security product certifications.    Information stored within CimTrak is secure from external modification or access.  [[Data at rest]] and [[data in transit]] are encrypted using the Cimcor Cryptographic Module, which has several certifications, including:

* Validated for FIPS 140-2 Level 1''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401val2010.htm#1281 |title=Validated FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Modules |publisher=NIST |accessdate= 2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''and FIPS 140-2 Level 2''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401val2010.htm#1315 |title=Validated FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Modules |publisher=NIST |accessdate= 2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) Publication 140-2, [http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/140-2.htm FIPS PUB 140-2], is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[government of the United States|government]] [[computer security]] [[standardization|standard]] used to accredit [[cryptography|cryptographic]] modules. Level 1 indicates that the cryptographic module supports the lowest level of acceptable security.  Security Level 1 allows the cryptographic module to be executed using an unevaluated operating system.  Security Level 2 enhances the physical security mechanisms of Security Level 1 by adding the requirement for tamper-evidence and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf |title=Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules |publisher=NIST |accessdate= 2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation ([[Common Criteria]] or CC) is an [[international standard]] ([[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) 15408) for [[computer security]] certification. Common Criteria allows specifying and verifying vendor claims relating to security functionality and assurance requirements.  Verification of claims is performed using approved testing laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niap-ccevs.org/cc-scheme/cc_docs/CCPART1V3.1R3.pdf |title=Common Criteria for Information Security Evaluation - Part 1: Introduction and general model |publisher=Common Criteria |accessdate= 2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Evaluation Assurance Level]] of EAL4 permits the developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering based on good commercial development practices which, though rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line. EAL4 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate to high level of independently assured security in conventional commodity TOEs and are prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs.  Augmented with ALC_FLR.2 establishes and verifies the claim that the developer has established flaw remediation procedures that describe the tracking of security flaws, the identification of corrective actions, and the distribution of corrective action information to TOE users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/supplements/alc_flrv11.pdf |title=Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation CEM-2001/0015R Part 2: Evaluation Methodology |publisher=Common Criteria |accessdate= 2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collective ownership''' is the ownership of [[means of production]] by all members of a group for the benefit of all its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/collective-ownership |title=collective ownership |author=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart|first= Paul and Robert|title= The Global Economy and its Economic Systems|publisher= South-Western College Pub|date=February 28, 2013|isbn= 978-1285055350|pages = 30|quote=There are three broad forms of property ownership – private, public, and collective (cooperative). Under private ownership, the three ownership rights ultimately belong to individuals, subject to limitations of disposition, use, and earnings. Under public ownership, these rights belong to the state. With collective ownership, property rights belong to the members of the collective.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breadth or narrowness of the group can range from a whole society to a set of coworkers in a particular [[Business|enterprise]] (such as one [[collective farming|collective farm]]). In the latter (narrower) sense the term is distinguished from [[common ownership]] and the [[commons]], which implies open-access, the holding of assets in common, and the negation of ownership as such. 

Collective ownership of the means of production is the defining characteristic of [[socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|pages = 53|quote=Socialism is an economic system characterized by state or collective ownership of the means of production, land, and capital.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "collective ownership" can refer to [[Social ownership|society-wide ownership]] or to [[cooperative]] ownership by an organization's members. It more commonly refers to group ownership (such as a producer cooperative) as contrasted with public ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart|first= Paul and Robert|title= The Global Economy and its Economic Systems|publisher= South-Western College Pub|date=February 28, 2013|isbn= 978-1285055350|pages = 30|quote=According to these definitions, socialism can be a theoretical or political idea that advocates a particular way of organizing economic and political life. It can be an actual economic system in which the state owns and controls resources, or it can be a system of collective or group ownership of property.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coloured Persons Communal Reserves Act''' of 1961 was an Apartheid South Africa piece of legislation, which was enacted to apply the Mission Stations and Communal Reserves Act 1909, of the Cape of Good Hope, to coloured persons settlement areas within the meaning of the Coloured Persons Settlement Areas (Cape) Act, 1930, to repeal the latter Act and to provide for matters incidental thereto.

This Act further strengthened racial segration legislation of South Africa during the [[Apartheid]] regime.

==Key Effect of Legislation==
The Coloured Persons Communal Rerserves Act had the effect of lowering wages by denying Africans rights within urban areas and by keeping their families and dependants on subsistence plots in the reserves.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Repeal==
The act was repealed by the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991]] on 30 June 1991.

'''''Continuum''''' was a [[magazine]] published by an activist group of the same name who denied the existence of HIV/AIDS.

Favoring [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] content, the magazine addressed issues related to [[HIV/AIDS]], [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialism]], [[alternative medicine]], and themes of interest to the [[LGBT]] community. It ran from December 1992 until February 2001, ceasing publication because all of the contributors had died of [[AIDS-defining clinical condition]]s.

==History==
''Continuum'' was created in December 1992 by Jody Wells (March 12, 1947&amp;nbsp;– August 26, 1995) in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It ceased publication in 2001, after all the editors died from [[AIDS-defining clinical condition]]s,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/2165/how-to-spot-an-aids-denialist|title = How to spot an AIDS denialist|accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving debts of over £14,000.&lt;ref name="lastissueeditorial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/continuum/latest/editoria.htm|title = Continuum vol6 No3 |date=Summer–Autumn 2001|accessdate = 16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine last appeared in print in 1998 and then surfaced again in February 2001 on the Internet.&lt;ref name="lastissueeditorial"/&gt; It was initially published bimonthly, then began to be published seasonally.

According to the magazine:
{{quote|''Continuum'' began as a newsletter encouraging those affected to empower themselves to make care and treatment choices. As we look further, anomalies in the orthodox view{{efn|The magazine used words like [[orthodoxy]], orthodox view and [[hypothesis]], to refer to the established fact by the international scientific community that the HIV is the cause of AIDS, the HIV/AIDS exists, and that HIV can be spread via [[sexually transmitted infection|sexual]], [[Vertically transmitted infection|vertical]] and [[HIV|parenteral]] means.}} continue to appear.&lt;ref name="Continuumv3n6"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March–April 1996|journal=Continuum Magazine|volume=3|issue=6|url=http://www.immunity.org.uk/media/Continuum%20PDFs/v3n6.pdf|title = Continuum v3.6|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Continuum'' promoted the idea that AIDS was a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] and was not related to HIV. Wells believed that the fear of AIDS was based on [[homophobia]], not science.&lt;ref name=13AIDSdenialists&gt;{{cite web|url = http://voices.yahoo.com/13-aids-denialists-died-aids-6813978.html|title = 13 AIDS denialists who have died of AIDS|date=September 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306111823/http://voices.yahoo.com/13-aids-denialists-died-aids-6813978.html?cat=5|archivedate=2014-03-06|accessdate=2015-02-04|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

''Continuum'' claimed to be a scientific journal for those who had alternative theories about HIV/AIDS, even though it had no peer review and promoted and advertised [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] such as [[urinotherapy]]. [[AIDS denialism|AIDS denialists]] often cite the articles published in this journal as a source of scientific information.
{{quote|Continuum is a unique forum for those in the scientific community challenging the orthodoxy and those whose lives have in some way been touched by the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Continuumv3n6"/&gt;}}

In the January/February 1996 edition, the magazine began offering £1,000 to the first person who could find a scientific study that showed the isolation of HIV,&lt;ref name="Continuumv3n5"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January–February 1996|journal=Continuum Magazine|volume=3|issue=5|url=http://www.immunity.org.uk/media/Continuum%20PDFs/v3n5.pdf|title = Continuum v3.5|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it had been isolated in 1983 by [[Luc Montagnier]] and [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]]&lt;ref name="Science4599"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Barré-Sinoussi F, Chermann JC, Rey F, Nugeyre MT, Chamaret S, Gruest J, Dauguet C, Axler-Blin C, Vezinet-Brun F, Rouzioux C, Rozenbaum W, Montagnier L |title=Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)|journal = Science|volume = 220|issue = 4599|pages = 868–871|year=1983|pmid=6189183|doi=10.1126/science.6189183|bibcode=1983Sci...220..868B}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for which they obtained a [[Nobel Prize]]),&lt;ref name="BBC_Nobel"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7654214.stm|title = Nobel prize for viral discoveries|publisher = [[BBC News]]|date = 6 October 2008|accessdate = 15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then was confirmed by [[Robert Gallo]] in 1984,{{efn|The four papers are,

'''Criticism of the National Health Service (England)''' includes issues such as access, waiting lists, healthcare coverage, and various scandals. The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) is the [[public ownership|publicly funded]] [[health care system]] of [[England]], created under the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] by the [[post-war consensus|post-war]] Labour government of [[Clement Attlee]]. It has come under much criticism, especially during the early 2000s, due to outbreaks of [[antibiotic-resistant]] infections such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and [[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]], waiting lists, and medical scandals such as the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]]. However, the involvement of the NHS in scandals extends back many years, including over the provision of mental health care in the 1970s and 1980s (ultimately part of the reason for the [[Mental Health Act 1983]]), and overspends on hospital newbuilds, including [[Guy's Hospital]] Phase III in [[London]] in 1985, the cost of which shot up from [[GBP|£]]29 million to £152 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rivett  | first = Geoffrey  | title = From Cradle to Grave: 50 years of the NHS | publisher = Kings Fund | location=  | year= 1998 | isbn = 1-85717-148-9|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access controls and waiting lists==
In making health care a largely "invisible cost" to the patient, health care seems to be effectively free to its consumers - there is no specific NHS tax or levy. To reduce cost and ensure that everyone is treated equitably there are a variety of "gatekeepers." The GP functions as a primary gatekeeper - without referral from a GP, it is often impossible to gain higher courses of treatment, such as an appointment with a consultant. These are argued to be necessary - [[Welsh people|Welshman]] Bevan noted in a 1948 speech in the House of Commons, "we shall never have all we need... expectations will always exceed capacity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2007/09/24/csr-07-health-the-public-expects|title=TCSR 07 - Health: The Public Expects|date=24 September 2007|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=theinformationdaily.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822053640/http://www.theinformationdaily.com/2007/09/24/csr-07-health-the-public-expects|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the national health insurance systems in other countries (e.g. Germany) have dispensed with the need for referral; direct access to a specialist is possible there{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

There has been concern about opportunistic "[[health tourists]]" travelling to Britain (mostly London) and using the NHS while paying nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7671.php|title=Tougher rules to ensure that people do not abuse NHS services|date=26 April 2004|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; British citizens have been known to travel to other European countries to take advantage of lower costs, and because of a fear of hospital-acquired superbugs and long waiting lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7127602.stm|title=Health tourists could get refund|date=2007-12-07|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHS access is therefore controlled by medical priority rather than [[price mechanism]], leading to waiting lists for both consultations and surgery, up to months long, although the Labour government of 1997-onwards made it one of its key targets to reduce waiting lists. In 1997, the waiting time for a non-urgent operation could be two years, there were ambitions to reduce it to 18 weeks despite opposition from doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/20/nhealth20.xml |title=Doctors attack Blair's waiting list pledge |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |first=George |last=Jones |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225012331/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F02%2F20%2Fnhealth20.xml |archivedate=February 25, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is contested that this system is fairer - if a medical complaint is acute and life-threatening, a patient will reach the front of the queue quickly.

The NHS measures medical need in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs), a method of quantifying the benefit of medical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/healthmanagement/ViewResource.aspx?resID=123545#1|title=Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)|date=March 2006|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=[[National Library for Health]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that this method of allocating healthcare means some patients must lose out in order for others to gain, and that QALY is a crude method of making life and death decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band24/b24-7.html|title=So what is a QALY?|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Bandolier|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415132556/http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band24/b24-7.html|archivedate=2008-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospital acquired infections===
There have been several fatal outbreaks of antibiotic resistant bacteria ("superbugs") in NHS hospitals, such as Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) Vancomycin Resistant ''Enterococci'' (V.R.E.) and ''Clostridium difficile''. This has led to criticism of standards of hygiene across the NHS, with some patients buying private health insurance or travelling abroad to avoid the perceived threat of catching a "superbug" while in hospital. However, the department of health has pledged £60 million for a "deep clean" of all NHS England hospitals.

==Coverage==
The lack of availability of some treatments due to their perceived poor [[cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] sometimes leads to what some call a "postcode lottery".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/issueoftheday/health/cancer/nhs-postcode-lottery-$447113$447113.htm |title=NHS 'postcode lottery' |publisher=politics.co.uk |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907020101/http://www.politics.co.uk/issueoftheday/health/cancer/nhs-postcode-lottery-%24447113%24447113.htm |archivedate=2007-09-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4420584.stm|title=Why some drugs are not worth it|date=9 March 2005|accessdate=2007-12-04 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NICE]], the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, are the first gatekeeper, and examine the cost effectiveness of all drugs. Until they have issued guidance on the cost and effectiveness of new  or expensive medicines, treatments and procedures, NHS services are unlikely to offer to fund courses of treatment. The same of true of the [[Scottish Medicines Consortium]], NICE's counterpart in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6284532.stm|title=Cancer drug rejected for NHS use|date=9 July 2007|accessdate=2007-12-04|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been considerable controversy about the public health funding of expensive [[drugs]], notably [[Herceptin]], due to its high cost and perceived limited overall survival. The campaign waged by cancer victims to get the government to pay for their treatment has gone to the highest levels in the [[Court of Appeal|courts]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] to get it licensed.&lt;ref name="Herceptin"&gt;{{cite news | title = Q&amp;A: The Herceptin judgement | publisher = [[BBC News]] |date=2006-04-12 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm | accessdate = 2006-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=328396 | title=Update on Herceptin appraisal | publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence | accessdate=2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Health Select Committee]] criticised some [[drug companies]] for bringing in drugs that cost on and around the £30,000 limit that is considered the maximum worth of one QALY in the NHS.

==Private Finance Initiative==
[[File:University College Hospital - New Building - London - 020504.jpg|thumb|right|University College Hospital, London]]
{{see also|Private Finance Initiative|Public-Private Partnership}}
Before the idea of PFI came to prominence, all new hospital building was by convention funded from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], as it was believed it was best able to raise money and able to control [[government spending|public sector expenditure]]. In June 1994, the Capital Investment Manual (CIM) was published, setting out the terms of PFI contracts. The CIM made it clear that future capital projects (building of new facilities) had to look at whether PFI was preferable to using public sector funding. By the end of 1995, 60 relatively small projects had been planned for, at a total cost of around £2 billion. Under PFI, buildings were built and serviced by the private sector, and then leased back to the NHS. The Labour government elected under [[Tony Blair]] in 1997 embraced PFI projects, recognising that public spending needed to be curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rivett  | first = Geoffrey  | title = From Cradle to Grave: 50 years of the NHS | publisher = Kings Fund | location=  | year= 1998 | isbn = 1-85717-148-9 |page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals have been built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia, although the government also encouraged private sector treatment centres, so called [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre|"surgicentres"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=2002-12-03 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&amp;chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant criticism of this, with a study by a consultancy company which works for the Department of Health showing that for every £200 million spent on privately financed hospitals the NHS loses 1000 doctors and nurses. The first PFI hospitals contain some 28% fewer beds than the ones they replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[George Monbiot]] | title=Private Affluence, Public Rip-Off |date=2002-03-10 | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/03/10/private-affluence-public-rip-off/ | accessdate = 2006-09-07 | publisher = [[The Spectator]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, it has been noted that the return for construction companies on PFI contracts could be as high as 58%, and that in funding hospitals from the [[private sector|private]] rather than [[public sector]] cost the NHS almost half a billion pounds more every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=PublicFinance.co.uk | title=PFI hospitals ‘costing NHS extra £480m a year’|url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2007/pfi-hospitals-costing-nhs-extra-480m-a-year/| accessdate=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
Several high-profile medical scandals have occurred within the NHS over the years such as the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]] and the [[Bristol heart scandal]]. At [[Alder Hey]], there was the unauthorised removal, retention, and disposal of [[human tissue]], including [[children]]’s [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], between 1988 and 1995. The official report into the incident, the [[Redfern Report]], revealed that [[Dick van Velzen]], the Chair of Foetal and Infant [[Pathology]] at Alder Hey had  ordered the "unethical and illegal stripping of every organ from every child who had had a postmortem." In response, it has been argued that the scandal brought the issue of organ and tissue donation into the public domain, and highlighted the benefits to medical research that result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VRT-42M1F8F-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F06%2F2001&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=67b17cc793cad6b374cabdeccdf6189b| title=Checks and balances needed for organ retention|publisher=Science Direct|date=2001-03-19|accessdate=2006-12-04|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00078-1|volume=11|journal=Current Biology|pages=R151–R152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Paying twice"==
{{refimprove|date=April 2013}}
Those who can afford it sometimes opt for private healthcare, usually to get treated more quickly in private facilities (i.e. facilities not provided by, or using, NHS staff or services). When this occurs, these patients are opting to pay twice for their health care, once for the NHS through taxes, and again for the private care they are using. Critics argue that these people do use NHS services, such as their [[General Practitioner]], screening, and [[vaccination]] services, and that their opting out from time-to-time is effectively [[queue jumping]] because they are utilising a resource ahead of someone in greater need and that their double payment is the penalty for queue jumping. It is argued that it is a civic [[:wikt:responsibility|responsibility]] for every citizen capable of paying legally applicable levels of [[tax]], to do so, regardless of service use. Therefore, the [[public services]] can be [[subsidise]]d for those who wish to use them - economically, the more people who pay taxes, the less cost to each individual concerned.

=="Lack of independence of checking for safety and fitness for purpose"==
Unlike in Scotland and Wales which have devolved healthcare, NHS England is run on behalf of the taxpayer by the UK Parliament and the Department of Health, at the head of which is the Secretary of State for Health.

The group charged in England and Wales with checking if the care delivered by the NHS is genuinely safe and fit for purpose is the [[Care Quality Commission]], or CQC.  Although the CQC describes itself as the "independent regulator of all health and social care services in England"[http://www.cqc.org.uk/public/about-us], it is in fact "accountable to the public, Parliament and the Secretary of State for Health."[http://www.cqc.org.uk/public/about-us/governance/how-we-are-run] and much of its funding comes from the taxpayer.  At least one chairman [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1233532/NHS-feud-hothead-Labour-baroness-accused-sending-colleagues-abusive-emails.html], one chief executive [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/12/12/care-quality-commission-cqc-review-bower-sheldon_n_1142570.html] and a board member [http://www.govtoday.co.uk/community-care/12120-lansley-rejects-call-to-sack-whistleblowing-cqc-board-member] of the CQC have been singled out for attention by a UK Secretary of State for Health.

There is therefore the potential for a conflict of interest, as both the NHS and the CQC have the same leadership and both are highly susceptible to political interference.

{{Party politics}}

'''Party-State''', or '''Dang Guo''' ({{zh|t=黨國|p=Dǎngguó}}), is a version of the [[one-party state]] ideology that was formerly the official policy of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] under [[Kuomintang]].

Since 1924, after [[Sun Yat-sen]] decided to copy the [[Soviet Union]] political system, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] used the [[Kuomintang]] to control and operate the [[Republic of China]] government and the [[Nationalist Revolutionary Army]]. All of the major national policies of the [[Taiwan|ROC]] bureaucracy were formulated by the Kuomintang party, resulting in the party holding the supreme power of the whole nation. In his belief, the rules of the state should be returned to the people after the Kuomintang Army militarily ended the [[Warlord Era]].

==Origin==
''Dang Guo'' was short for ''Yi Dang Zhi Guo'' (以黨治國), which literally means using the political party to run the state. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the Founding Father of the Republic of China, made ''Dang Guo'' the official ROC national policy in 1920, having been influenced by [[Leninism|Leninist]] ideology which led to the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]]. According to Sun Yat-sen, Kuomintang should be paramount over the Republic of China in the course of revolution (war against [[Warlord Era|the warlords]]), and Kuomintang should issue orders to the ROC bureaucracy, all the [[NGO]] groups, and indeed to any individual.

In 1924 Sun Yat-sen said：

:當俄國革命時，用獨裁政治，諸事一切不顧，只求革命成功……，其能成功，即因其將黨放在國上。我以為……應重新組織，把黨放在國上 。

:''During the Russian revolution, political dictatorship was used, everything else can be discarded, the only aim was the success of the revolution... its success was due to the party ([[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]) being on top of the state. I suggest... we should reorganise, by putting the party (Kuomintang) on top of the state (ROC).''

==Kuomintang holding supreme power==
After Sun Yat-sen decided to follow and copy the [[Soviet Union]] political system, his successor [[Chiang Kai-shek]] used Kuomintang to control and to operate both the Republic of China government and the [[Nationalist Revolutionary Army]], which was sometimes called ''The Party's Army'' (黨軍), and equivalent to [[Mao Zedong]]'s famous quote ''Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun''. The ROC bureaucracy had then become the means and tools of Kuomintang, where all the major national policies were formulated, resulting in the party holding the supreme power of the whole nation.

The concept of ''Dang Guo'' was an outgrowth of Sun's concept of "political tutelage," during which the Kuomintang was to lead the state and instruct the people on how the democratic system was to work prior to the transition to full democracy.

Under ''Dang Guo'', ROC military personnel and civil servants alike were expected to owe their allegiance to Kuomintang first and the State second - a policy reflected by such phrases as "Service to the Party and the Nation" (功在黨國), and also on the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|national anthem]], which makes an explicit reference to "Our Party". Likewise, the emblem of Kuomintang was used as the [[Emblem of the Republic of China|emblem of the State]], and the flag of Kuomintang has been used as the [[naval jack]] to this day.

The Kuomintang unified China in 1927, and started to prepare the state for democracy, as according to Sun's teaching. The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] enacted in 1947 stipulates that different parties shall enjoy equal status, and the [[National Revolutionary Army]] was [[Civilian control of the military|returned to civilian control]] as the [[Army of the Republic of China]]. However, due to the outbreak of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC was under military rule of the KMT during the [[Period of mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion|period of mobilization]]. In the 1990s, when the martial law ended, all political parties became legal and the Republic of China was democratized. Since then, the President of the Republic of China has been democratically elected by the people of the [[Free Area]]. [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was elected president, making him the first non-KMT president under the Constitution.

==Chinese Communist Party and People's Republic of China==
Peking University professor Pan Wei ({{zh|c= 北京大学国际关系学院国际政治系教授，潘维}}) had stated that the political structure of [[People's Republic of China]] is supported by the Chinese Communist Party in six major ways:
#Communist Party and its core decision making departments, such as [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]], [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China]], [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China]], [[Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China]], [[Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee]]
#The all-powerful [[National People's Congress]] has always been under the control of the CCP.
#All the PRC governmental departments are under the control of CCP.
#[[People's Liberation Army]] is under control of the CCP.
#[[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] is under control of the CCP.
#All the semi-governmental departments, such as trade unions, women's associations, communist youth groups, are all under control of the CCP.

Professor Pan Wei went on to state that the China's supreme control power is rest on [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaelections.org/NewsInfo.asp?NewsID=111152 |script-title=zh:潘维：中国党政体制——现行政体的由来 |last=潘维 |publisher=China elections and governance |language=Chinese |accessdate=2 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015639/http://www.chinaelections.org/NewsInfo.asp?NewsID=111152 |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PLA of the Communist Party of China==

In 1938, Mao Zedong stated: "The fundamental principle is, the Communist Party is in command of the Army, not the other way around". {{fact|date=August 2018}}

On 1 April 2009 Gen. Li Jinai, the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s top political commissar who sits on the 11-member Chinese Communist Party Central Committee that exercises direct control over China, had stated that China's military "must continue taking orders exclusively from the Communist Party" in an essay published in the party's official theoretical journal, [[Qiushi]].

The essay further stated:''
{{cquote|"Unshakingly uphold the basic principle and system of the party's absolute leadership over the army...Resolutely oppose the wrong thinking of 'army-party separation, depoliticization, and army nationalization...At all times, make the party flag the army's flag and ... in all things listen to the commands of the [[Communist Party of China|Party]], [[Central Military Commission (Communist Party of China)|Central Military Commission]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] Hu,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2009/apr/01/bc-as-china-communist-party-military/|date=1 April 2009 |publisher=Victoria Advocate Publishing Co|accessdate=2009-09-09|title=China military still under Communist Party control}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Personal life ==

Born in Athens, he was educated at [[Williams College]], Massachusetts, and at [[Harvard Law School]], Harvard. He married Lucinda in 1961. They lived first in New York, and then in London with their four daughters, Lucinda, Cassandra, Atalanta and Tatiana.

He lived in Wilton Crescent, Belgravia, London SW1X. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2528479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==

Marchessini has published polemical works. ''Modern Myths: And The Realities Behind Them'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchessini|first=Demetri|title=Modern Myths|year=1997|publisher=Quiller Press|location=London|isbn=1899163301}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing against certain political correct opinions.

It is behaviour that flies against common sense, and also flies against the normal human desire to please."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Watt [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/17/ukip-donor-women-hostile-trousers "Ukip donor brands women 'hostile' for wearing trousers"], theguardian.com, 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book, ''Scams &amp; Hypocrisies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchessini|first=D P|title=Scams &amp; Hypocrisies|year=2010|publisher=Askelon Publishing|location=London|isbn=9780956462206}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at perceived popular myths. On his blog, Marchessini has written that unmarried mothers are "naughty girls" who deserve a "smack" and that date rape accusations can only be meaningless because without a "violent act it is difficult to know whether any rape took place".&lt;ref&gt;Rowena Mason, and Steven Swinford [https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=opera&amp;q=%22Demetri+Marchessini%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=suggest "Ukip donor says women in trousers are 'hostile' and unmarried mothers need a 'smack'"], telegraph.co.uk, 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2014, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published an advertisement by Marchessini, in effect a comment piece which took the form of an 'open letter to [[Libby Purves]]'. in which he criticised the 'pro-gay' opinions of ''[[The Times]]'' columnist and dismissed her opposition to the government policies of Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]] on this issue which she had expressed in an article on 20 January.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jan/28/dailytelegraph-thetimes "Daily Telegraph publishes advert attacking 'pro-gay' Times columnist Libby Purves"], (Greenslade blog), theguardian.com, 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, Purves was quoted in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'': "He is free to approve of the beatings and hangings of young men across the world in the name of what he considers religion. In the same spirit, I am free to say he is a loony."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/progay-libby-purves-gets-a-ticking-off-from-ukip-9090566.html "Pro-gay Libby Purves gets a ticking off from Ukip"], ''London Evening Standard'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Marchessini made donations totalling £10,000 money to the [[UK Independence Party]],&lt;ref name="BBC220513"/&gt; ultimately&lt;!-- See below, the £10,000 was inaccurate. --&gt; the sixth largest donor to the party that year.&lt;ref name="C4 News3004"/&gt; Following criticism of his views in 2013, he stated he will no longer give money to UKIP: "There's been such a fuss about what I've given it's a bore."&lt;ref name="BBC220513"/&gt; At the time of the Telegraph advertisement, a UKIP spokeswoman said that Marchessini had severed his connection with the party after the organisation had "publicly opposed the crazy female trouser-wearing comments."&lt;ref&gt;Rowena Mason and Esther Addley [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/28/ukip-donor-telegraph-advert-sodomy-crime-libby-purves "Ukip donor pays for Telegraph advert to claim 'sodomy has always been a crime'"], ''The Guardian'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Channel 4 News'' interview===
In the run-up to the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament election]], [[Michael Crick]] of [[Channel 4 News]] interviewed Marchessini, in what Crick believed was the businessman's first ever television interview.&lt;ref&gt;''Channel 4 News'', 30 April 2014. This is also stated in the accompanying article.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to earlier reports, UKIP had continued to solicit donations from him, and a further donation of £5,000 (in addition to the previously admitted £10,000) had been made on 24 December 2013.&lt;ref name="C4 News3004"/&gt;

In the interview, Marchessini also asserted that homosexuals are motivated by lust rather than love, said that rape was impossible within a marriage, and reasserted his opinions about women wearing trousers. According to him, only skirts excite men and he advocates a ban on the practice of women wearing trousers:&lt;ref name="C4 News3004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/04/30/ukip-donor-gay-people-are-incapable-of-love-and-wives-cannot-be-raped-by-their-husbands/|title=UKIP donor: Gay people are incapable of love and wives cannot be raped by their husbands|publisher=[[Pink News]]|author=Scott Roberts|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=30 December 2014}} Swear word censored in the source and bleeped out in the television report.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|because that is the only way the world is going to continue. Because if they don't men are going to stop fucking them. Do you understand, and may I tell you with great respect, that the incidents of love making in Western Europe have fallen drastically?}}

The '''Domain Awareness System''' is a surveillance system developed as part of [[Lower Manhattan Security Initiative]] in a partnership between the [[New York Police Department]]  and [[Microsoft]] to monitor [[New York City]]. This allows them  to track surveillance targets and gain detailed information about them. The system is connected to 6,000 video cameras around New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NYPD expands surveillance net to fight crime as well as terrorism|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/usa-ny-surveillance-idUSL2N0EV0D220130621|accessdate=October 31, 2015|work=Reuters|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system will be licensed out to other cities with New York City getting 30% of the profits.&lt;ref name=Fast1&gt;{{cite news |last=Ungerleider |first=Neal |title=NYPD, Microsoft Launch All-Seeing 'Domain Awareness System' With Real-Time CCTV, License Plate Monitoring [Updated] |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3000272/nypd-microsoft-launch-all-seeing-domain-awareness-system-real-time-cctv-license-plate-monito |accessdate=19 June 2013 |newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system's development costs are estimated at 40 million USD.&lt;ref name=ap1&gt;{{cite news |last=Long |first=Colleen |title=NYPD, Microsoft Create Crime-Fighting 'Domain Awareness' Tech System |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/nypd-microsoft-domain-awareness-crime-fighting-tech_n_2727506.html |accessdate=19 June 2013 |agency=Associated Press |date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology built specifically for the NYPD includes radiological and nuclear detectors on boats, radiation detectors on helicopters and trucks, and detectors on police officers' gun belts so sensitive that people who have had medical procedures may trigger them. And Lower Manhattan now includes thousands of surveillance cameras that can identify shapes and sizes of unidentified "suspicious" packages and can track people within seconds using descriptions such as "someone wearing a red shirt".

This system is highlighted in a May 2013 episode of [[PBS]]' ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' on tracking the [[Boston Marathon bombing|Boston Marathon bombers]] Tamerlan and [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]].&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manhunt—Boston Bombers|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/manhunt-boston-bombers.html|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=PBS|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9893">'''Green lending''' refers to a [[lending]] dependent on [[Environmentalism|environment]]al criteria for the planned use of funds.  It is part of the wider [[sustainable investing]] and aims to reduce the impact on the environment of new lending activities.

==History==
Starting in 2005 major US banks such as [[Wells Fargo]] (July 2005, $1bn over 5 years)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetsongreen.com/2006/08/green_lending_t.html Green Lending: Top 10 Reasons Why Banks Lend to Sustainable Buildings]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bank of America]] (March 2007, $20 bn)&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/03/bank_america_co.html Green Wombat: Bank of America Commits $20 Billion to Green Lending]&lt;/ref&gt; started dedicating financing toward [[sustainable entrepreneurship]].  This usually meant financing the building of environmentally sustainable or friendly buildings or enterprises.  The green lending initiative appear to have been taken by the lenders as opposed to borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/credag-greenloans/credit-agricole-closes-first-two-u-s-green-loans-idUSL1N1S21FO |title=Credit Agricole closes first two U.S. Green loans |date=April 26, 2018 |publisher=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Loan Market Association]] in the UK issued Green Loan Principles to ensure any green loan is used for eligible green projects. This includes stating that this must be clearly articulated in the finance documents along with the expected environmental benefits, which must be assessed, quantified, measured and reported by the borrower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.whitecase.com/publications/alert/green-loan-principles-guide-environmental-and-sustainability-finance |title=Green Loan Principles to Guide Environmental and Sustainability Finance |author=Tallat Hussain |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The list of projects that qualify as green is based on the list that the [[International Capital Market Association]] uses to define [[Green Bonds]].

==ESG Ratings and Green Loans==
In April 2017, [[ING Group]] issued the world’s first sustainability-linked loan to [[Philips]], coupling the interest rate of the EUR 1 billion loan to the company’s sustainability performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ING and Philips collaborate on sustainable loan |url=https://www.ing.com/Newsroom/All-news/ING-and-Philips-collaborate-on-sustainable-loan.htm |website=ING |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holder |first1=Michael |title=Philips agrees €1bn loan with interest rate linked to sustainability performance |url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3008731/philips-agrees-eur1bn-loan-with-interest-rate-linked-to-sustainability-performance |website=Business Green |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2018, [[Bloomberg News]] reported that [[ING Group]] had closed 15 similar deals where the bank would lower the cost of borrowing by between 5% and 10% based on the company’s ESG rating provided by [[Sustainalytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hirtenstein |first1=Anna |title=Going Greener Can Get You Cheaper Loans at This Dutch Bank |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/going-greener-can-get-you-cheaper-loans-at-this-dutch-bank |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown on Environmental Finance's list of sustainability loans, several other banks have teamed up with various ESG ratings agencies, copying and building on the ING-Sustainalytics model:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roumpis |first1=Nick |title=The green and sustainability loan market: ready for take-off |url=https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/the-green-and-sustainability-loan-market-ready-for-take-off.html |website=Environmental Finance |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, 5 banks, including [[BBVA]], structured a revolving credit facility (RCF) for the Italian power utility A2A in a finance deal valued at €400 million euros. The syndicated loan avails itself of a margin mechanism based on two parameters: the performance of two selected KPIs (waste processing capacity and the volume of renewable energy sold in the wholesale market, emphasizing the focus of the A2A Group on the circular economy and decarbonation). The solicited ESG Rating is provided annually by [[Standard Ethics Aei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbva.com/en/bbva-signs-new-sustainable-loan-italy-a2a/

The '''History of the Socialist Workers Party''' begins with the formation of the '''Socialist Review Group''' in 1950, followed by the creation of the '''International Socialists''' in 1962 and continues through to the present day with the formation of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] in 1977.

==Origins==
The SWP's origins lie in the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP), which [[Tony Cliff]] joined on his arrival from the territory of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] where he had been the central leader of that region's small section of the [[Fourth International]] (FI). Given his international reputation, Cliff was co-opted onto the leadership body of the RCP although his impact was small at the time given his limited command of English. Indeed, his idiosyncratic use of the English language was to be a subject of jest by both Cliff and his supporters in later years.

In the RCP, Cliff was a supporter of the majority tendency of that party around [[Jock Haston]] and [[Ted Grant]]. Therefore, he supported the perspectives of the RCP at the end of the Second World War which placed the small party in opposition to the new leadership of the Fourth International around [[Ernest Mandel]], then known as Germain, and [[Michel Raptis]], better known as Pablo, which was backed by the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|American Socialist Workers' Party]]. In this capacity he wrote ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1947/09/glitters.htm All That Glitters is not Gold]'' in which he discussed his view that, contrary to the opinion of the International Secretariat of the Fourth International, there was not going to be a major [[slump (economics)|slump]].

Cliff also backed Haston when he disputed the growing sympathies of the FI for [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], but by this time Haston was growing demoralised and would soon drop out of revolutionary politics entirely. Cliff however was beginning to develop the idea that the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was a bureaucratic [[state capitalist]] society, prompted in part by earlier arguments pointing in this direction from Haston. Much later Cliff in his autobiography would acknowledge the debt he felt to Haston. There is an irony in this as it has been suggested that Cliff had been briefed by the leadership of the FI, while passing through France, to oppose Haston on just this question, although no proof of this has been made public.

More importantly at the time, Haston's collapse and the hostility of the FI to the RCP meant that the party was forced to join the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Once inside the Labour Party, its members were instructed to work under the direction of [[Gerry Healy]] in his [[entrist]] group [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]]. This led to many former members of the RCP leaving politics in reaction to Healy's brutal regime and in turn Healy embarked on a campaign of expulsions against anyone who opposed his authority. One consequence of this was that a number of comrades who supported Cliff's state capitalist position began to act as a faction. Cliff himself was unable to participate in this work having been deported to [[Dublin]] from which he was not to return permanently until 1952.

With the [[Korean War]], passions in The Club became more aroused and after a vote on [[Birmingham Trades Council]] in which Cliff's supporters, including Percy Downey, voted for a neutral, [[third camp]]ist, position they were expelled ''en masse'' from The Club. Cliff himself, being a member of the almost non-existent Irish section of the FI, could not be expelled. The final result of these events was the foundation of the [[Socialist Review Group]] organised around the magazine of the same name.

===Socialist Review Group (1950-1962)===
The Socialist Review Group (SRG) was founded at the end of September 1950 at a conference in Camden Town in London. 33 members were claimed of whom 21 were present on the day. Apart from Tony Cliff, among the more notable members can be listed Bill Ainsworth, Geoff Carlsson, [[Raymond Challinor]], Percy Downey, [[Duncan Hallas]], Peter Morgan, [[Anil Moonesinghe]], Jean Tait and Ken Tarbuck. It was, in essence, a fragment of the RCP of which party all its members had been adherents. It was in the milieu of former members of the RCP that the new SRG saw its audience too.

The new group adopted the magazine ''[[Socialist Review]]'' as its central organ and it was to run from 1950 to 1962. Asserting their political continuity with Trotskyism they argued that they stood on the ideas of [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Bolshevik]] [[Leninism]] except insofar as they differed as to their analysis of the states dominated by [[Stalinist]] parties. To this end they adopted three documents summarising their viewpoint; ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1948/stalruss/index.htm The Nature of Stalin's Russia]'' (the first edition of Cliff's ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1955/statecap/index.htm State Capitalism in Russia]''), ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1950/07/index.htm The Class Nature of the People's Democracies]'' and ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1948/xx/burcoll.htm Marxism and the Theory of Bureaucratic Collectivism]''. In closing their first conference the group sent greetings to [[Natalia Sedova|Natalya Sedova Trotsky]], the widow of Leon Trotsky, who like them held state capitalist convictions.

In regard to its international connections the new group contacted various dissident currents coming out of the Fourth International (which split in 1953) among whom can be enumerated [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] in the USA, [[Cornelius Castoriadis|Chaulieu]] in France, Mangano in Italy and Jungclas in Germany. The named individuals and their tendencies came from both the right and left of the Fourth International and unsurprisingly nothing came of these contacts. Of more importance was a loose liaison with the [[International Socialist League (UK)|International Socialist League]] in the USA and the journal of that group, ''New International'', was distributed by the SRG until it ceased publication in 1958. Moreover, ''Socialist Review'' would reprint material from its pages, for example from Chinese and Ukrainian revolutionaries, and Cliff would contribute to ''New International'' in his turn.

Early editions of ''Socialist Review'' closely mirror the concerns of the SRG in its first years as they sought to recruit from former RCPers and in the Labour Party. A great deal of the material in the magazine concerns Stalinism and world politics in general terms. One particular example would be the attempt to provide the Socialist fellowship, a grouping of left wing Labour Party members strongly influenced by Gerry Healy's Club, with an alternative statement of policy. This may be taken as a first general statement of programme by the SRG given its all encompassing nature and, apart from its position on Stalinism, is informed by a conception of transitional politics that is characteristic of Trotskyism. Meanwhile, entrist work in the Birmingham Labour Party led to the expulsion of SRG members from the Labour Party.

The SRG also had its internal controversies of which the first was the expulsion of [[Ellis Hillman]], later a London councillor, who argued that the Stalinist parties were embryonic state capitalist societies. In this he was echoing the positions of the Johnson-Forrest tendency, [[C. L. R. James]] and Raya Dunayevskaya, and directly challenging Cliff's analysis of state capitalism. He also argued, in a spectacularly eclectic fashion, for what he called the [[organic unity]] of the SRG and Ted Grant's group of fellow ex-RCPers. He was replied to with regard to the Stalinist parties by [[Duncan Hallas]] whose article was later reprinted in the collection ''The Origins of the International Socialists''. In the event he was expelled and the group's politics as a Trotskyist tendency differing only in its analysis of Stalinism was confirmed.

Although it began by asserting its fidelity to Trotskyism the SRG would move way from the 'orthodox' Trotskyism which they took from their origins in the RCP. Prior to this development, but setting the scene for it, the group experienced something of a change over of leading figures from 1952 to 1954. Most importantly of all Tony Cliff was permitted to return to London from his exile in Dublin and for the first itime was able to function as an active leader of the group rather than through others or during visits to his family. Cliff's centrality to the group cannot be overemphasized in these years as his wife, Chanie Rosenberg, was also an active member and in September 1952 [[Michael Kidron]], Cliff's brother-in-law, travelled to Britain from Israel. Kidron would later recruit [[Seymour Papert]], later to become an important pioneer in the field of computers, who would also play a considerable role in the SRG. Others joining at this time were [[Stan Newens]], later a Labour MP, and [[Bernard Dix]], later prominent in the [[National Union of Public Employees]] (NUPE). Significantly, as the group was renewed by such new recruits it lost some of its earlier character as figures like Bill Ainsworth, Ken Tarbuck, later to pass through a number of left groups, and Duncan Hallas left, while Anil Moonesinghe and his wife [[Jeanne Hoban]] left for Ceylon where the former would eventually become a Minister. Duncan Hallas alone would return 14 years later and again play a leading role in what was by then the International Socialists.

==International Socialists (1962-1977)==
In 1962 the Socialist Review Group became the '''International Socialists''' (IS) taking the name of their new journal ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]''. The journal had briefly appeared in 1958 as a cyclostyled magazine and a second issue, publishing Cliff's essay on [[Rosa Luxemburg]] had appeared in 1959, but began regular publication in 1960. The group also began publishing a paper called ''Industrial Worker'' in 1961 which was renamed ''Labour Worker'' in 1962. This was replaced by ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', launched in 1968, with [[Roger Protz]] being the first editor.

However, for much of the 1960s the most important group publication was ''Young Guard''. Working within the Young Socialists the IS had issued a youth magazine called ''Rebel'' from 1960 onwards as the YS was, along with similarly youth oriented [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], the greatest source of recruits to IS. Within the highly factionalised atmosphere of the YS, however, ''Rebel'' soon disappeared as the IS forged an alliance with the supporters of [[Ted Grant]] around the ''Rally'' paper. The two tendencies jointly launched ''Young Guard'' as their challenge to both Transport House and the Keep Left grouping of Gerry Healy's supporters. The editorial content and most contributors to ''Young Guard'' were firmly in support of IS, with Grant's supporters playing a minor role. After Healy's followers in the Socialist Labour League left what was renamed the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]], IS was briefly able to take the leadership of that organisation. But by this point much of the life had gone out of the youth movement and ''Young Guard'' ceased publication in 1965, being superseded by a new run of ''Rebel'' which lasted in its turn until 1967. By this time though, IS as a whole was drifting away from entrist work within the Labour Party as the industrial struggle developed.

In 1968, the IS put out an appeal for revolutionary unity, aiming the appeal at the industrial militants aligned with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]], although it was also directed at the newly formed [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG) and the libertarian Solidarity group. In the event only the small [[Workers' Fight]] group responded favourably and as soon as they became members of the IS they constituted themselves as the [[Trotskyist Tendency]] (TT) faction. The TT was expelled from IS after it attempted to galvanise opposition to the group's leadership on political issues including Ireland and the European Union and on the question of internal democracy. At the conference at which what the leadership called "defusion" took place, 40% of the delegates voted against. Now substantially larger than when it had entered IS, the TT reconstituted itself as Workers' Fight, and still exists today in the form of the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]].

Despite such internal controversies the IS grew in the early 1970s gaining a foothold in industry and forming several rank and file groups in the unions. However internal debate did not cease with the departure of the TT and in 1973 there were several expulsions of smaller groups, including those of the Right Opposition, part of which became the [[Revolutionary Communist Group (UK)|Revolutionary Communist Group]].

In 1974 the Left Faction, one of whose leaders was [[Dave Stocking]], was also expelled and formed [[Workers Power (UK)|Workers Power]]. It had argued that the IS should write a transitional programme which would form the basis for demands made by the group and allow the membership to keep the leadership to account, preventing 'turns' by voting on exact positions in this document. They also argued that the SWP had become opportunist on the Irish Question after it had stopped giving the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) unconditional but critical support because the IRA's strategy had changed and had turned public opinion solidly against it - the Left Faction argued unconditional but critical support was still needed.

During the 1960s the rise of unofficial strike action led the International Socialists to place emphasis on the building of a [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] movement within the [[trade union]]s in order to combat the [[bureaucratic]] leaders of those organisations. This led to the development of a series of rank and file papers including ''The Collier'' (Mining), ''Redder Tape ''(Civil Service), ''Rank and File Teacher'', etc. These were briefly brought together in a National Rank and File Organising Committee in 1974, the peak of IS influence in the workers' movement.

Another aspect of this work was that a number of historians in the IS devoted themselves to rediscovering the past of rank and file movements in the labour movement. A series of articles by [[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]] on this topic was published in the group's journal ''International Socialism''. Other related work appeared in book or pamphlet form including books on the Communist Party related Minority Movement of the 1920s and the industrial politics of the CPGB in that period. Work was also done on the pre-World War I period with [[Raymond Challinor]]'s book on the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]] entitled ''The Origins of British Bolshevism''.

In the mid-1970s Cliff argued that the older workers' leaders, including [[shop steward]]s, were corrupted by [[reformism]] and therefore IS had to turn to untried young workers - the more cynically minded claimed Cliff wanted the party to turn to them as being more gullible to Cliff's more idiosyncratic flights of fancy. This was part of the reason for the attempt made at this time to popularise ''Socialist Worker''. This turn was unanimously rejected months later, but by then Jim Higgins was removed as National Secretary and Roger Protz from his position as editor of ''Socialist Worker'' for opposing these changes. Prompted by [[Duncan Hallas]], they formed an ''International Socialist Opposition''. Ultimately, a large section of the leadership, in particular Jim Higgins, Roger Protz and John Palmer, were expelled or left in solidarity with those expelled in 1975 and formed the [[Workers League (UK)|Workers League]]. It has been estimated that no more than 150 members of IS - some having been expelled - joined the Workers' League but that several hundred more left as a result of the factional struggle.

The factional dispute consumed a great deal of the energies of IS through the course of 1976 but, nonetheless, a great deal of work was still accomplished especially with the launch by the Rank and File Co-ordinating Committee of the Right to Work Campaign which sought to address the then growing problem of mass unemployment. This attempt to bring the problem of mass unemployment culminated in a 'Jarrow syle' Right to Work March from Liverpool through England to London, where it was broken up by violent attacks from the infamous, and later disbanded, Special Patrol Group. Another notable change was the move of IS towards electoral participation for the first time under its own banner - in earlier days some members had come near to being adopted as Prospective Parliamentary Candidates by the Labour Party and at least two members had served terms as councillors - although whilst initial results were encouraging the tactic was later abandoned due to poor results. The intention had been for the IS, renamed in 1977 the Socialist Workers' Party, to stand a slate of at least 50 candidates in the then upcoming [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|General Election]]. This ambitious goal was now abandoned.

==Socialist Workers Party (1977 onwards) ==

At the beginning of 1977 the Socialist Workers' Party was launched as the IS renamed itself in expectation of a wave of working class struggles against the Labour Government of the day. Immediately this move was rejected by [[Peter Sedgwick]], a long time and much respected member who resigned in protest. Expecting an increase in struggle but with industrial unrest stalled the new SWP used its leadership of the National Rank and File Organising Committee to launch the [[Right to Work Campaign]] in protest at the rising level of unemployment. The RTWC was to lead large scale marches, first to the Trades Union Congress annual conference urging it to campaign on the issue, later in protest to the Conservative Party conference, from 1976 to 1981. In the localities however the RTWC had no ongoing existence other than as a front organisation for local SWP branches. In the meantime the parent National Rank and File Organising Committee disappeared.

During these years at times heated debates took place in branch meetings and in the pages of the, then regular, Internal Bulletin concerning a number of questions. For example, during this period a debate emerged as to the group's understanding of the question of women's oppression in capitalist society and whether or not feminism was to be seen in a positive light. This debate centred on the role to be played by the group's publication ''Woman's Voice''. Eventually the conclusion was reached that feminism, as an ideology, could not liberate women from their situation as a social group oppressed by and in class society. By the time this position had been reached, however, opponents of the majority view had left the group and the magazine was discontinued as its sought-for audience had disappeared.

Running alongside the debate on the future of ''Woman's Voice'' there was a discussion concerning SWP work among, and the attitude of the group toward, Blacks and Asians. From the early 1960s the IS had made clear its opposition to any immigration controls, work in which [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]] had played a prominent role. Another attempt to reach Asian workers had been initiated by Nigel Harris but had faded quite rapidly. There was then a considerable debate within the SWP around the role of the newly launched ''Flame - Black Workers' Paper For Self Defence'' when it appeared in the late 1970s. Edited by Anthony Bogues  the paper appeared for a few years before it, in its turn, faded away, having failed to win mass backing and lacking the support of the SWP, which had been withdrawn when the internal debate within SWP ranks came to the conclusion that any paper aimed at Black people should be subject to direct SWP control. This clashed with the views of individuals such as Anthony Bogues, who returned to Jamaica to become a lecturer, who envisaged Flame as an autonomous grouping only loosely linked to the SWP.

Similarly a debate took place in these years concerning the question of the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales. In this instance the result was that the leadership would eventually change the entirely negative opposition of the group to devolution. At one point in this debate a Republican faction was formed with the support of a considerable part of the membership but with the change of line most supporters of the faction were easily placated. A few however, including Steve Freeman and Allan Armstrong, were to generalise their criticisms of the SWP and drifted out of it in 1980/81. Around the same time Steve Jeffries, an industrial organiser for the group and long time leading member, also left in disillusionment. In part his resignation was connected to the final disbandment of the remaining rank and file groups.

In many respects the period 1976 to 1981 can best be seen as a transitional period from the IS to the SWP. Not only was the rank and file strategy abandoned in practice, if not in theory, but there was in this period a massive change in leading figures within the group. By the end of this transition not only had figures associated with the ISO left but so to had a layer of intellectuals such as Steven Marks, Richard Kuper, Martin Shaw and Peter Sedgwick; industrial organisers such as Steve Jeffreys, Arthur Affleck and Bill Message had also left; in addition to which almost the entire toe-hold in blue collar industry won so laboriously had left or been expelled. And all this before the large scale restructuring of British capitalism.

===The Anti Nazi League===
In the 1970s the IS took part in a number of initiatives against the small fascist groups of the time but by 1974 these groups had coalesced into the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) and were gaining substantial votes in electoral contests. To a lesser degree the [[British Movement]] was also providing cause for alarm. However it was not until the NF attempted to march through [[Lewisham]] in 1977 to the massive response of the local community leading to physical confrontations that the IS, by now transformed into the SWP took the initiative nationally. The result was the launch of the [[Anti Nazi League]] (ANL) which was conceived of as a United Front body which would involve forces, primarily within the workers' movement, politically to the right of the SWP.

To a considerable degree the ANL did win support from forces beyond the ranks of the SWP including from [[Ernie Roberts]] MP, a long-standing pillar of the Labour Left, from [[Peter Hain]], then best known as an Anti-Apartheid campaigner, from [[Neil Kinnock]] MP and from numerous groups and organisations within the workers' movement. Perhaps the most significant body to endorse the ANL was the then substantial Indian Workers Association. In the next few years the ANL would call countless demonstrations against the NF and BM. The policy of the ANL was physical confrontation of far right groups in an effort to "No Platform" them&amp;mdash;that is, to deny them any public platform.

This policy however brought the disapproval of the media and the ANL suffered a blow in March 1979 amid claims of financial 'irregularities' (i.e., funds being diverted to the SWP) which claims were denied by the National Treasurer of the ANL, Labour Party member Ernie Roberts. However some celebrity members of the ANL - [[Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Brian Clough]] being the first - renounced their support at this time.

Despite the success of the '[[Rock Against Racism]]' concerts (an ANL affiliated campaign), some of the punk rock bands that had been outspoken opponents of the NF from the start&amp;mdash;such as the [[Sex Pistols]]/PiL &amp;mdash;refused outright to have anything to do with an organisation they perceived as little more than an SWP front. ([[The Clash]] did headline the 1978 Carnival however). Tony Cliff told a ''Guardian'' reporter during the March 1979 crisis, "The leadership of the ANL is the SWP and we don't give a damn".

In 1981 the ANL was formally wound up as it was felt to be no longer needed and was then dissolved. Some individuals who had been involved in the ANL disagreed with this, and also wanted to show solidarity with the more militant side of the republican movement in Northern Ireland grouping around Provisional [[Sinn Féin]]. Expelled, they were to form [[Red Action]].

==The 1980s==

By 1981 after a series of internal discussions the SWP was united around an understanding that the period was one that was best characterised as being a downturn in class combativity and that this meant that the SWP should concentrate its work on basic propaganda tasks and educational development of its membership. This understanding was balanced in the early  part of the decade by adding a caveat that while the period was generally one of downturn there was also a political upturn around the Labour Left and the resurgent [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].

This understanding could also lead to the group isolating itself when struggles did break as with the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] in the middle of the decade. At that time Miners Support Groups developed in all of Britain's major cities but the SWP chose in the first months of the strike not to join them, on the basis that they were inadequate to deliver the solidarity actions, such as mass picketing and solidarity strike action, which the SWP argued were the tactics needed for the Miners Strike to be concluded victoriously. Later this stance was reversed. Although the SWP continued to argue that the Miners' Strike could only be won if other sections of workers were able to provide solidarity actions, as was the case in a number of major disputes in the 1970s, its members continued to be active around the dispute which was considered doomed to failure without solidarity actions. The hit squads which appeared late in the strike were seen as symptomatic of the desperation and isolation of the more committed younger miners and were firmly disapproved of.

In the aftermath the leadership of the SWP initiated moves towards the [[Militant tendency]] to form a common organisation motivated by the Labour Party's expulsion of that groups supporters. However, there was no response to the SWP's overtures and the Militant tendency, later Militant Labour, was the object of several Open Letters in ''Socialist Worker'' during the 1990s but to no avail.

==21st century==

Since then, the SWP has affiliated with groups in various countries which comprise the [[International Socialist Tendency]], and has been involved in a wide range of organisations, including the re-launch of the [[Anti Nazi League]] (which has evolved into [[Unite Against Fascism]]), and [[Globalise Resistance]]. They were instrumental in setting up the [[Stop the War Coalition]] an [[anti-war]] alliance formed first to oppose the [[invasion of Afghanistan]] and then the [[invasion of Iraq]]. They considered this anti-war movement to the major radicalising force in early 21st Century British politics and believe that it is a continuation of the [[anti-capitalist]] movement.

In 2001, the international tendency expelled the US section, the International Socialist Organization, despite no serious political differences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoshop.org/library/ISO-and-SWP-Split&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the SWP joined in the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] but later argued that it never managed to engage in the radicalism of the anti-war movement and presided over its winding up in 2004. They transferred their energies to a new project [[RESPECT Unity Coalition]] believing its emergence from the anti-war movement gave it the opportunity to be a much larger movement and cease [[sectarian]]ism.

In [[Scotland]] SWP members joined the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] as an officially recognised platform in 2001 known as the ''Socialist Worker Platform''. However membership of the SSP does not seem to have increased the influence of the SWP and it has been claimed that the group has declined in numbers since joining. This claim being made by a former member of the SWP, [[Gregor Gall]], in an article published in an attempt to change the course of the group written in 2004. Gall's figures were highly suspect and his motion did not even attract a single vote from the Scottish Platform of the SWP, Gall has since left the SWP and is now seen as a supporter of the leadership of the SSP.  In 2006, SWP members in Scotland left the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and joined the new organisation, [[Solidarity (Scotland)]].

Another major change for the SWP was the selling of its print shop in 2004 as the enterprise was no longer able to win an adequate degree of commercial work to supplement the group's own printing requirements; it had printed ''[[Private Eye]]'', the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', and other publications. Built in the early 1970s the print shop had originally been established in 1968 when ''Socialist Worker'' first appeared. SWP publications are now printed by commercial printers with the result that their appearance has undergone a great improvement. However it should not be ignored that the print shop had helped to subsidise the SWP's own publications and it has been suggested that the sale of the print shop was the result of a crisis in the group's finances.

In the late 1990s, the membership was claimed to be around 5,000 with 4,000 paying Dues monthly. The 2004 Party Conference reported a membership figure of 7,585 members, although other rival socialist groups estimate it to now be closer to 3,000.  There is debate within the party as to the reason for failure to grow out of the radicalism of the [[anti-war]] movement, some claiming it is the lack of left/right perspectives, some the low industrial struggle, others claim the unconditional but critical support for "insurgents" isolates them.

There was a disagreement within the leadership of the SWP concerning the future of the party's involvement in broader fronts such as the Stop the War Coalition. As a result, its leading body, the Central Committee, proposed a slate that removed [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] from the body over the objections of Rees and [[Lindsey German]] in 2009. This slate was approved by the party conference.

===Internal crisis in 2013-14 over allegations of rape===

A Disputes Committee document was discussed at the party conference in January 2013 about allegations of sexual assault and rape made by a much younger female member against 'Comrade Delta', a senior party official who by then was no longer in his former post. Allegations about Delta's behaviour had been an issue for several years within the group,&lt;ref name="Kellogg"&gt;Paul Kellogg [http://links.org.au/node/3183 "Britain: Reflections on the crisis in the Socialist Workers Party",] ''LINKS - Internatiobnal Journal of Socialist Renewal'' (blog of Australian publication), 13 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the first complaint against him being made in 2010. 'Delta' has never been questioned by the police about the allegations made against him. According to Alex Callinicos in June 2014, around 700 members of the SWP have resigned from the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Italian irredentism''' ({{lang-it|irredentismo italiano}}) was a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Political movement|movement]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in [[Italy]] with [[irredentism|irredentist]] goals which promoted the [[Italian unification|unification]] of geographic areas in which indigenous [[Italians|ethnic Italians]] and Italian-speaking persons formed a majority, or substantial minority, of the population.

Originally, the movement promoted the annexation to Italy of territories inhabited by an Italian indigenous population, but retained by the [[Austrian Empire]] after [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866.

During the period of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' in 1860 to 1861, Prime Minister of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]], [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]] who was leading the ''Risorgimento'' effort, faced the view of [[Emperor of the French|French Emperor]] [[Napoleon III]] who indicated that France would support militarily the Italian unification provided that France was given Nice and Savoy that were held by Piedmont-Sardinia, as France did not want a powerful state having control of the passages of the Alps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Adda Bruemmer Bozeman.

P. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]], but also multilingual and multiethnic areas  within the northern Italian region encompassed by the Alps, with [[Germans|German]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Slovenes|Slovene]], [[Croats|Croatian]], [[Ladin people|Ladin]] and [[Istro-Romanians|Istro-Romanian]] population such as [[South Tyrol]], a part of [[Istria]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] and part of [[Dalmatia]]. The claims were extended later to the city of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], [[Corsica]], the island of [[Malta]], the [[County of Nice]] and [[Italian Switzerland]].

To avoid confusion and in line with [[WP:NCGN|convention]], this article uses modern English place names throughout. However, most places have alternative names in Italian. See [[Italian exonyms (Dalmatia)|List of Italian place names in Dalmatia]].

== Characteristics ==
Italian irredentism was not a formal organization as it was an opinion movement, advocated by several different groups, claiming that Italy had to reach its "natural borders" or unify territories inhabited by Italians. Similar nationalistic ideas were common in [[Europe]] in the late 19th century. The term "irredentism" was successfully coined from the Italian word in many countries in the world (see [[List of irredentist claims or disputes]]). This idea of ''Italia irredenta'' is not to be confused with the Risorgimento, the historical events that led to irredentism, nor with nationalism or [[Italian imperialism under Fascism|Imperial Italy]], the political philosophy that took the idea further under [[Italian Fascism|fascism]].

The beginning of irredentism in Italy was originated as a consequence of the [[France|French]] expansion in Italy that started with the annexation of [[Corsica]] in 1768 and was followed by [[Napoleon]]'s inclusion ''–'' inside the territories of France's [[First French Empire]] ''–'' of the regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]] and [[Tuscany]]. Indeed, the Corsican revolutionary [[Pasquale Paoli]] was called "the precursor of Italian irredentism" by [[Niccolo Tommaseo|Niccolò Tommaseo]] because he was the first to promote the Italian language and socio-culture (the main characteristics of Italian irredentism) in his island; Paoli wanted the [[Italian language]] to be the official language of the newly founded Corsican Republic. Even his [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 was written in Italian and the short-lived university he founded in the city of [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in 1765 used Italian as the official language.

During the 19th century, the Italian irredentism fully developed the characteristic of defending the Italian language from other people's languages like, for example, [[German language|German]] in Switzerland and in the Austro-Hungarian Empire or French in [[Nice]].

The liberation of ''Italia irredenta'' was perhaps the strongest motive for Italy's entry into [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919 satisfied many irredentist claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ir/irredent.html irredentism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510032637/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ir/irredent.html |date=2008-05-10 }} - The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Italian irredentism has even the characteristic of being originally moderate, requesting only the return to Italy of the areas with Italian majority of population,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/12/23/96282678.pdf NYTimes on Italian irredentism in Istria]&lt;/ref&gt; but after World War I it became aggressive – under fascist influence – and claimed to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] even areas where Italians were minority or had been present only in the past. In the first case there were the Risorgimento claims on [[Trento]], while in the second there were the fascist claims on the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Savoy]] and [[Malta]].

== Origins ==
After the [[Italian unification]] and [[Third Italian War of Independence]] in 1866, there were areas with Italian-speaking communities within the borders of several countries around the newly created Kingdom of Italy. The irredentists sought to annex all those areas to the newly unified Italy. The areas targeted were [[Corsica]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Gorizia]], the [[Ionian islands]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Istria]], [[Malta]], [[County of Nice]], [[Ticino]], small parts of [[Grisons]] and of [[Valais]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[Trentino]], [[Trieste]] and [[Fiume]].

Different movements or groups born in this period: in 1877 the Italian politician Matteo Renato Imbriani invented the new term ''terre irredente'' ("unredeemed lands"); in the same year the movement ''Associazione in pro dell'Italia Irredenta'' ("Association for the Unredeemed Italy") was founded; in the 1885 was founded the ''Pro Patria'' movement ("For Fatherland") and in 1891 the ''Lega Nazionale Italiana'' ("Italian National League") was founded in Trento and Trieste (in the Austrian Empire).

Initially, the movement can be described as part of the more general [[nation-building]] process in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries when the multi-national [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires were being replaced by nation-states. The Italian nation-building process can be compared to similar movements in Germany (''[[Großdeutschland]]''), [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and in pre-1914 [[Poland]]. Simultaneously, in many parts of 19th century Europe [[liberalism]] and [[nationalism]] were ideologies which were coming to the forefront of political culture. In Eastern Europe, where the [[Habsburg Empire]] had long asserted control over a variety of ethnic and cultural groups, nationalism appeared in a standard format.  The beginning of the 19th century "was the period when the smaller, mostly indigenous nationalities of the empire – [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Romanians]] – remembered their historical traditions, revived their native tongues as literary languages, reappropriated their traditions and folklore, in short reasserted their existence as nations".&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, Jonathan. The European Revolutions, 1848-1851. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a single united Italy was related to the aspirations of the "majority populations".

== 19th century ==
[[File:Italy unification 1815 1870.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Italian unification]] process (''Risorgimento'')]]
A precursor of the "irredentists" was the unification leader [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who in 1859 as deputy for his native [[County of Nice|Nice]] in the Piedmontese parliament at [[Turin]] attacked [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Cavour]] for ceding Nice to [[Napoleon III]] in order to get French help and approval for Italian Unification.{{original research inline|date=January 2016}} Irredentism grew in importance in Italy in the next years.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On 21 July 1878, a noisy public meeting was held at [[Rome]] with Menotti Garibaldi, the son of Giuseppe Garibaldi, as chairman of the forum and a clamour was raised for the formation of volunteer battalions to conquer the Trentino. [[Benedetto Cairoli]], then [[Prime Minister of Italy]], treated the agitation with tolerance.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Irredentists |volume=14 |page=840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was mainly superficial, as most Italians did not wish a dangerous policy against Austria and even less against France for the sake of Nice and Corsica,{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} or against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for Malta.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

One consequence of irredentist ideas outside of Italy was an assassination plot organized against the [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Francis Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]] in Trieste in 1882, which was detected and foiled.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Guglielmo Oberdan]], a Triestine and thus Austrian citizen, was executed. When the irredentist movement became troublesome to Italy through the activity of Republicans and Socialists, it was subject to effective police control by [[Agostino Depretis]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Irredentism faced a setback when the [[Treaty of Bardo|French occupation of Tunisia]] in 1881 started a crisis in French&amp;ndash;Italian relations. The government entered into relations with Austria and [[German Empire|Germany]], which took shape with the formation of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in 1882.

The irredentists' dream of absorbing the targeted areas into Italy made no further progress in the 19th century, as the borders of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] remained unchanged and the Rome government began to set up colonies in [[Eritrea]] and [[Somalia]] in Africa.

== World War I ==

Italy signed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|London Pact]] and entered World War I with the intention of gaining those territories perceived by irredentists as being Italian under foreign rule. According to the pact, Italy was to leave the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and join the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Furthermore, Italy was to [[declaration of war|declare war]] on Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] within a month. The declaration of war was duly published on 23 May 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A03E6DB1338E633A25757C2A9639C946496D6CF 11 NATIONS NOW INVOLVED IN WAR; Washington Expects Rumania, Bulgaria, and Greece Soon to Join the Allies.

In April 1918, in what he described as an open letter "to the American Nation" [[Paolo Thaon di Revel]], Commander in Chief of the [[Regia Marina|Italian navy]], appealed to the people of the United States to support Italian territorial claims over Trento, Trieste, Istria, Dalmatia and the [[Adriatic]], writing that "we are fighting to expel an intruder from our home".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/04/14/112639691.pdf Italy's Navy Chief Explains Italian Claims;] Trent,...(14 April 1918) - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The outcome of the First World War and the consequent settlement of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] met some Italian claims, including many (but not all) of the aims of the ''Italia irredenta'' party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/03/28/104231888.pdf ITALY'S PRICE FOR NEUTRALITY] (28 March 1915) - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Italy gained Trieste, [[Gorizia]], Istria and the city of [[Zadar|Zara]]. In Dalmatia, despite the Treaty of London, only territories with Italian majority as [[Zadar]] (Zara) with some Dalmatian islands, such as [[Cres]] (Cherso), [[Lošinj]] (Lussino) and [[Lastovo]] (Lagosta) were annexed by Italy because [[Woodrow Wilson]], supporting Yugoslav claims and not recognizing the treaty, rejected Italian requests on other Dalmatian territories.

The city of Rijeka (Fiume) in the [[Kvarner Gulf|Kvarner]] was the subject of claim and counter-claim because it had an Italian majority, but Fiume had not been promised to Italy in the London Pact, though it was to become Italian by 1924 (see [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924]]).

The stand taken by the irredentist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], which briefly led him to become an enemy of the Italian state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldatwar.net/nations/other/fiume/ Stato Libero Di Fiume] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222134740/http://worldatwar.net/nations/other/fiume/ |date=2007-12-22 }} - (English: "Free State Of Fiume")&lt;/ref&gt; was meant to provoke a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] revival through [[corporatism]] (first instituted during his rule over Fiume), in front of what was widely perceived as [[political corruption|state corruption]] engineered by governments such as [[Giovanni Giolitti]]'s.

D'Annunzio briefly annexed to this "Regency of Carnaro" even the Dalmatian islands of [[Krk]] (Veglia) and [[Rab]] (Arbe), where there was a numerous Italian community.

Fascist Italy strove to be seen as the natural result of war heroism against a "[[Mutilated victory|betrayed Italy]]" that had not been awarded all it "deserved", as well as appropriating the image of [[Arditi]] soldiers. In this vein, irredentist claims were expanded and often used in Fascist Italy's desire to control the Mediterranean basin. To the east of Italy, the Fascists claimed that [[Dalmatia]] was a land of Italian culture whose Italians, including those of Italianized [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] descent, had been driven out of Dalmatia and into exile in Italy, and supported the return of Italians of Dalmatian heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jozo Tomasevich. War and Revolution in Yugoslavia 1941–1945: Occupation and Collaboration. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2001. P. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini identified Dalmatia as having strong Italian cultural roots for centuries via the Roman Empire and the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Larry Wolff. Venice And the Slavs: The Discovery of Dalmatia in the Age of Enlightenment. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, P. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascists especially focused their claims based on the Venetian cultural heritage of Dalmatia, claiming that Venetian rule had been beneficial for all Dalmatians and had been accepted by the Dalmatian population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Fascists were outraged after World War I, when the agreement between Italy and the Entente Allies in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] of 1915 to have Dalmatia join Italy was revoked in 1919.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

To the west of Italy, the Fascists claimed that the territories of [[Corsica]], [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] held by France were Italian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''Fascist Ideology: Expansionism in Italy and Germany 1922-1945''. London, England; UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2000.

P. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime produced literature on Corsica was that presented evidence of the ''italianità'' of the island.&lt;ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. P. 88"&gt;Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. P. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime produced literature on Nice that justified that Nice was an Italian land based on historic, ethnic and linguistic grounds.&lt;ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. P. 88"/&gt; The Fascists quoted Medieval Italian scholar [[Petrarch]] who said: "The border of Italy is the Var; consequently Nice is a part of Italy".&lt;ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. P. 88"/&gt; The Fascists quoted Italian national hero [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], a native of Nizza (Nice) himself, who said: "Corsica and Nice must not belong to France; there will come the day when an Italy mindful of its true worth will reclaim its provinces now so shamefully languishing under foreign domination".&lt;ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. P. 88"/&gt; Mussolini initially pursued promoting annexation of Corsica through political and diplomatic means, believing that Corsica could be annexed to Italy through Italy first encouraging the existing autonomist tendencies in Corsica and then independence of Corsica from France, that would be followed by annexation of Corsica into Italy.&lt;ref&gt;John Gooch. ''Mussolini and his Generals: The Armed Forces and Fascist Foreign Policy, 1922-1940''. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Pp. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Mussolini temporarily occupied Corfu, using irredentist claims based on minorities of Italians in the Ionian islands of Greece. Similar tactics may have been used towards the islands around the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] ''–'' through the Pro-Italian Maltese, [[Corfiot Italians]] and [[Corsican Italians]] ''–'' in order to control the Mediterranean sea (his ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'', from the Latin "Our Sea").

During [[World War II]], large parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy into the [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] from 1941 to 1943. Corsica and Nice were also administratively annexed by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in November 1942. Malta was heavily bombed, but was not occupied due to [[Erwin Rommel]]'s request of diverting to North Africa the forces that had been prepared for the invasion of the island.

== Dalmatia ==
The Italian linguist [[Matteo Bartoli]] calculated that [[Italian language|Italian]] was the primary spoken language by almost 30% of the Dalmatian population at the beginning of the Napoleonic wars.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Matteo. Le parlate italiane della Venezia Giulia e della Dalmazia. p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Bartoli's evaluation was followed by other claims: [[Auguste de Marmont]], the French Governor General of the Napoleonic [[Illyrian Provinces]] commissioned a census in 1814–1815 which found that [[Dalmatian Italians]] comprised 25% of the total population of Dalmatia. Accordingly, three years later an Austrian census found around 70,000 Italians in a total of 301,000 people living in Austrian Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/topic/Italian_irredentism_in_Dalmatia Italian irredentism in Dalmatia]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of Croatian nationalism, critics such as Croatian historian Duško Večerina asserted that these evaluations were not conducted by modern scientific standards and that they took spoken language as the criterion, rather than blood, origin and ethnicity. They pointed out that—according to a report by Imperial court councillor Joseph Fölch in 1827—the Italian language was spoken by noblemen and some citizens of middle and lower classes exclusively in the coastal cities of [[Zadar]], [[Šibenik]] and [[Split (city)|Split]]. Since only around 20,000 people populated these towns and not all were Italian speakers, their real number was rather smaller, probably around 7% of the total population, as is asserted by the Department of Historical Studies of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (HAZU).&lt;ref&gt;O broju Talijana/Talijanaša u Dalmaciji XIX. Stoljeća”, Zavod za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru, 2002, UDK 949.75:329.7”19”Dalmacija 2002, p. 344&lt;br&gt;(“Concerning the number of Italians/pro-Italians in Dalmatia in the 19th century”) See http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=18696&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only Italian irredentists (like [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]) but also Italian prominent scholars (like Angelo Vivante) alleged that Joseph Fölch did not include the Dalmatian islands of [[Cres]] (Cherso), [[Lošinj]] (Lussino), [[Krk]] (Veglia), [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa), Hvar (Lesina), Korcula (Curzola) and many others islands with significant Italian communities and so in their opinion Folch did only a partial and mistaken estimate of the real number of the Dalmatian Italians. They reasserted that the only official evidence about the Dalmatian population comes from the 1857 Austro-Hungarian census, which showed that in this year there were 369,310 indigenous Croatians and 45,000 Italians in Dalmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.cl/books?id=r60EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=%C3%96sterreichisches+K%C3%BCstenland&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=de#PPA38,M1 Statistisches Handbüchlein für die Oesterreichische Monarchie] Page 38 - Von Direction der Administrativen Statistik, Österreich - Veröffentlicht 1861&lt;/ref&gt; making [[Dalmatian Italians]] 17% of the total population of Dalmatia in the mid-19th century.

Dalmatia was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the London Pact that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From  5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Vis]], [[Lastovo]], [[Šibenik]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo. ''History of Dalmatia''. Giardini, 1993. Pp. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized  Fiume as well.&lt;ref name="Paul O 2005. Pp. 17"&gt;Paul O'Brien. ''Mussolini in the First World War: the Journalist, the Soldier, the Fascist''. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2005. Pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Admiral [[Enrico Millo]] declared himself Italy's Governor of Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="Paul O 2005. Pp. 17"/&gt; Famous [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] Gabriele d'Annunzio supported the seizure of Dalmatia and proceeded to Zadar in an Italian warship in December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rossi. ''The Rise of Italian Fascism: 1918-1922''. New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last city with a significant Italian presence in Dalmatia was the city of Zadar. In the Habsburg empire census of 1910, the city of Zadar had an Italian population of 9,318 (or 69.3% out of the total of 13,438 inhabitants). Zadar's population grew to 24,100 inhabitants, of which 20,300 were Italians, when in 1942 it was the capital of the [[Governorate of Dalmatia]] (the "Governorate" fulfilled the aspirations of Italian irredentism in the Adriatic).

In 1943, [[Josip Broz Tito]] informed the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] that Zadar was a chief logistic centre for German forces in Yugoslavia. By overstating its importance, he persuaded them of its military significance. Italy surrendered in September 1943 and over the following year, specifically between 2 November 1943 and 31 October 1944, Allied Forces [[Bombing of Zadar in World War II|bombarded the town fifty-four times]].

Nearly 2,000 people were buried beneath rubble: 10–12,000 people escaped and took refuge in Trieste and slightly over 1,000 reached Apulia.

Tito's partisans entered in Zadar on 31 October 1944 and 138 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Lovrovici, don Giovanni Eleuterio. ''Zara dai bombardamenti all'esodo (1943-1947)'' Tipografia Santa Lucia - Marino. Roma, 1974. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Peace Treaty of 1947, Italians still living in Zadar followed the [[Istrian exodus|Italian exodus from Dalmatia]] and only about 100 Dalmatian Italians now remain in the city.

== Post-World War II ==
After World War II, Italian Irredentism diminished along with the defeated Fascists and the Monarchy of the [[House of Savoy]]. After the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] (1947) and the [[Treaty of Osimo]] (1975), all territorial claims were abandoned by the Italian State (see [[Foreign relations of Italy]]). Today, Italy, [[France]], [[Malta]], [[Greece]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] are all members of the [[European Union]], while [[Montenegro]] and [[Albania]] are candidates for accession.

They underlined that [[Alleanza Nazionale]] (a former Italian conservative party) derived directly from the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), a neo-fascist party. In 1994, Mirko Tremaglia, a member of the MSI and later of Alleanza Nazionale, described Rijeka, Istria and Dalmatia as "historically Italian" and referred to them as "occupied territories", saying that Italy should "tear up" the 1975 [[Treaty of Osimo]] with the former Yugoslavia and block Slovenia and Croatia's [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession to European Union membership]] until the rights of their Italian minorities were respected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DA1E31F936A15757C0A962958260 Italian Coalition Trips on Old Yugoslavia Issue] By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Published: Monday, April 25, 1994 - New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

[...] and Islam gave the right of equality between all of those who are under its rule, indeed, the ''jizya'' that is demanded from the ''dhimmī'' corresponds to the financial obligations that are compulsory on the Muslim, so he is obliged [to purify] his wealth [through] ''[[zakat]]'', and he is required to pay ''[[Sadaqah|sadaqat]]'' and ''nudhur'', and he is duty-bound to give ''[[Fidyah and Kaffara|kaffarat]]'', as well as other things. And if all that is taken from the Muslim was calculated, it would become clear that it isn't less than what is taken by way of ''jizya'', if it isn't more. And as we have mentioned earlier, the state spends on the poor amongst the ''dhimmī'' community, and it is narrated that ʿUmar - May God Almighty be pleased with him - found an elderly Jew begging, so he asked him: 'Who are you, old man (''shaykh'')?' He said, 'I am a man from the ''dhimma'' community.' So ʿUmar said to him: 'We have not done justice to you in taking from you when you were young and forsaking you in your old age', so ʿUmar gave him a regular pension from the  public treasury (''Bayt al-Māl''), and he then said to his servant: "Search for him and those like him, and give them out from the public treasury.""&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the jizya tax has been understood in Islam as a fee for protection provided by the Muslim ruler to non-Muslims, for the exemption from military service for non-Muslims, for the permission to practice a non-Muslim faith with some communal autonomy in a Muslim state, and as material proof of the non-Muslims' submission to the Muslim state and its laws.&lt;ref name="anveremon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI3"&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=Walker Arnold | authorlink=Thomas Walker Arnold | publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson|Constable &amp; Robinson Ltd]] | date=1913 | title=Preaching of Islam: A History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith | url=https://archive.org/details/preachingofislam00arno | pages=60–1 | quote=This tax was not imposed on the Christians, as some would have us think, as a penalty for their refusal to accept the Muslim faith, but was paid by them in common with the other &lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;immīs or non-Muslim subjects of the state whose religion precluded them from serving in the army, in return for the protection secured for them by the arms of the Musalmans.}} ([https://archive.org/stream/preachingofislam00arno#page/60/mode/2up online])&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Esposito|1998|p=34|ps=.

Ye'or quotes two sixteenth-century narratives of how the Christians must lower themselves literally and ritually and then receive a blow in the payment of the jizya.&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that if it were meant to be a punishment for the dhimmis' unbelief then monks and the clergy wouldn't have been exempted.&lt;ref name="Imara"/&gt;

The term appears in the Quran referring to a tax or tribute from ''[[ahl al-kitab|People of the Book]]'' specifically [[Jews]] and [[Christian]]s.
Followers of other religions like [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and [[Hindu]]s too were later integrated into the category of ''dhimmis'' and required to pay jizya.

==Etymology and meaning==
Commentators disagree on the definition and derivation of the word ''jizya'':
* [[M. H. Shakir|Shakir]]'s [[English language|English]] [[translation]]s of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] render ''jizya'' as "[[tax]]", while [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthall]] and [[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]] translate it as "[[tribute]]". [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] prefers to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the term as ''jizyah''. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] considered the root meaning of ''jizya'' to be "compensation",{{sfn|Shah|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf Ali (1991 Reprint), Notes 1281 and 1282 to verse 9:29, p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Muhammad Asad]] considered it to be "satisfaction".{{sfn|Shah|2008|p=19}}
* [[Al-Raghib al-Isfahani]] (d. 1108), a classical Muslim [[Lexicography|lexicographer]], points out that derivates of the word ''jizya'' appear in some Qurʾānic verses such as, ''Such is the reward (jazāʾ) of those who purify themselves'' (Q 20:76), ''While those who believed and did good deeds will have the best of rewards'' (Q 18:88), ''And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation - his reward is [due] from God'' (Q 42:40), ''And will reward them for what they patiently endured [with] a garden [in Paradise] and silk [garments]'' (Q 76:12), ''and be repaid only according to your deeds'' (Q 37:39).&lt;ref name = al-Isfahani2&gt;{{cite book|first1=al-Rāghib|last1=al-ʾIsfahānī|authorlink=Al-Raghib al-Isfahani|language=ar|title=Mufradāt ʾal-Faẓ al-Qurʾān|script-title=''مفردات ألفاظ القرآن''|page=195|date=2009|url=https://archive.org/details/FP106319|publisher=Dār al-Qalam|location=[[Damascus]]|editor=Ṣafwān ʿAdnān Dāwūdī}} 4th edition.

([https://archive.org/stream/FP106319/106319#page/n194/mode/1up online])&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muhammad Abdel-Haleem]] states that the term [[poll tax]] does not translate the [[Arabic]] word ''jizya'', being also inaccurate in light of the exemptions granted to children, women, etc., unlike a poll tax, which by definition is levied on every individual (poll = head) regardless of gender, age, or ability to pay. He further adds that the root verb of ''jizya'' is j-z-y, which means 'to reward somebody for something', 'to pay what is due in return for something' and adds that it is in return for the protection of the Muslim state with all the accruing benefits and exemption from military service, and such taxes on Muslims as ''zakat''.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=75–6}}
* The historian [[al-Tabari]] and the [[Muhaddith|hadith scholar]] [[al-Bayhaqi]] relate that some members of the Christian community asked [[Umar|ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab]] if they could refer to the ''jizya'' as ''[[sadaqah]]'', literally "charity", which he agreed to.{{sfn|Ghazi|Kalin|Kamali|2013| pp=82–3}}&lt;ref name="Buti1"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Muhammad Sa'id Ramadan al-Buti|first1=Muhammad Saʿid|last1=Ramadan al-Buti |title=Al-Jihād fī'l-Islām|url=https://archive.org/stream/elbouti/jihad#page/n0/mode/2up|script-title=''الجهاد في الإسلام''|publisher=Dār al-Fikr|language=ar|place=[[Damascus]]|date=2005|pages=135–136}} Quote: «فقد صح أن نصارى تغلب تضايقوا من كلمة (الجزية) و (الجزاء) و عرضوا على أمير المؤمنين عمر بن الخطاب، أن تؤخد منهم الجزية بإسم الصدقة، و إن إقتضى ذلك مضاعفة القدر عليهم، و قالوا له: خد منا ما شئت، و لا تسمها جزاء .. فشاور عمر الصحابة في ذلك، فأشار عليه علي رضي الله عنه أن يقبلها منهم مضاعفة بإسم الصدقة. رواه الطبري في تاريخه.» Translation: "It is true that the Christians of Taghlab didn't feel at ease with the words (''Jizya'') and (Compensation) and they proposed to the leader of the believers ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, that ''jizya'' be taken from them in the name of charity, even if that meant that they would have to pay twice as much, and they said to him: 'Take from us whatever you want, but don't call it a compensation' ..

[...] And you may ask: Is it necessary when the name of this tax is transformed from ''jizya'' to ''zakāt'' or ''ṣadaqah'' that the requested amount be doubled? The answer is that this falls under the laws of the ruler (''ʾaḥkām al-ʾimāmah''), so the command to change the name, and to define the respective amount is exclusive to what the ruler sees most fit according to each time."

* [[Michael G.

==Rationale==
{{see also|Dhimmi}}
Most Muslim jurists and [[Ulama|scholars]] regard the jizya as a special payment collected from certain non-Muslims in return for the responsibility of protection fulfilled by Muslims against any type of aggression,{{sfn|Abou Al-Fadl|2002|p=21|ps=. "When the Qur'an was revealed, it was common inside and outside of Arabia to levy poll taxes against alien groups. Building upon the historical practice, classical Muslim jurists argued that the poll tax is money collected by the Islamic polity from non-Muslims in return for the protection of the Muslim state. If the Muslim state was incapable of extending such protection to non-Muslims, it was not supposed to levy a poll tax."}}&lt;ref name="Hilmi1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI3"/&gt;{{sfn|Esposito|1998|p=34|ps=.

Local communities were free to continue to follow their own way of life in internal, domestic affairs. In many ways, local populations found Muslim rule more flexible and tolerant than that of Byzantium and Persia. Religious communities were free to practice their faith to worship and be governed by their religious leaders and laws in such areas as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In exchange, they were required to pay tribute, a poll tax (''jizya'') that entitled them to Muslim protection from outside aggression and exempted them from military service.

([https://web.archive.org/web/20090604103025/http://www.islamonline.net/Arabic/contemporary/2005/07/article01a.shtml archive])&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[war]], jizya is seen as an option to end [[Hostility|hostilities]]. According to [[Abul Kalam Azad|Abu Kalam Azad]], one of the main objectives of jizya was to facilitate a [[peace]]ful solution to [[hostility]], since non-Muslims who engaged in fighting against Muslims were thereby given the option of making [[peace]] by agreeing to pay jizya. In this sense, jizya is seen as a means by which to legalize the cessation of war and military conflict with non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Mun'im Sirry (2014), ''Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions'', p. 178. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0199359363}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[Mahmud Shaltut]] states that "jizya was never intended as payment in return for one's life or retaining one's religion, it was intended as a symbol to signify yielding, an end of hostility and a participation in shouldering the burdens of the state."{{sfn|Shaltut |2013|pp=14–5}}

The second rationale offered by Islamic scholars for the imposition of Jizya tax on non-Muslims is that it was a substitute to the requirement of [[zakat]] tax from Muslims.&lt;ref name=ae36&gt;{{cite book | last=Emon | first=Anver | title=Religious pluralism and Islamic law : | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford, United Kingdom | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-19-966163-3 | pages=36–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, jizya created a place for the inclusion of a non-Muslim ''dhimmi'' in a land owned and ruled by a Muslim, where routine payment of jizya was a tool of social stratification and treasury's revenue.&lt;ref name=anveremon&gt;Anver M. Emon, Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199661633}}, pp. 99–109.&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=March 2016}}

Finally, jizya served as a reminder of subordination of a non-Muslim under Muslims, and created a financial and political incentive for ''dhimmis'' to convert to Islam.&lt;ref name=anveremon/&gt;{{qn|date=April 2016}} The Muslim jurist and theologian [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] suggested in his interpretation of Q.9:29 that jizya is an [[incentive]] to convert. Taking it is not intended to preserve the existence of disbelief (''kufr'') in the world. Rather, he argues, jizya allows the non-Muslim to live amongst Muslims and take part in Islamic civilization in the hope that the non-Muslim will convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Dammen McAuliffe]], "Fakhr al-Din al-Razi on Ayat al-Jizya and Ayat al-Sayf," in Conversion and Continuity: Indigenous Christian Communities in Islamic Lands, Eight to Eighteenth Centuries, eds.

==In the Qur'an==
Jizya is sanctioned by the Qur'an based on the following verse:{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}}

{{quote|Fight those who believe not in God and in the Last Day, and who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, and who follow not the Religion of Truth among those who were given the Book, till they pay the jizyah with a willing hand, being humbled.

1. ''Fight those who believe not in God and the Last Day (qātilū-lladhīna lā yuʾminūna bi-llāhi wa-lā bi-l-yawmi-l-ākhir)''

[[Muhammad Sa'id Ramadan al-Buti]] says commenting on this verse, 'the verse commands ''qitāl'' (قتال) and not ''qatl'' (قتل), and it is known that there is a big distinction between these two words ... For you say '''qataltu'' (قتلت) so-and-so' if you initiated the fighting, while you say '''qātaltu'' (قاتلت) him' if you resisted his effort to fight you by a reciprocal fight, or if you forestalled him in that so that he would not get at you unawares.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Muhammad Sa'id Ramadan al-Buti|first1=Muhammad Saʿid|last1=Ramadan al-Buti|url=https://archive.org/stream/elbouti/jihad#page/n0/mode/2up|title=Al-Jihād fī'l-Islām|script-title=''الجهاد في الإسلام''|publisher=Dār al-Fikr|language=ar|place=[[Damascus]]|date=2005|pages=101–102}} Quote: «الآية أمرت بالقتال لا بالقتل، وقد علمت الفرق الكبير بين الكلمتين ... فأنت تقول: قتلت فلاناً، إن بدأته بالقتل، وتقول: قاتلته، إذا قاومت سعيه إلى قتلك بقتل مثله، أو سابقته إلى ذلك كي لا ينال منك غرة.» Translation: "The verse commands ''qitāl'' (قتال) and not ''qatl'' (قتل), and it is known that there is a big distinction between these two words ...

2. ''Do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden (wa-lā yuḥarrimūna mā ḥarrama-llāhu wa-rasūluh)''

The closest and most viable cause must relate to ''jizya'', that is, unlawfully consuming what belongs to the Muslim state, which, [[Al-Baydawi|al-Bayḍāwī]] explains, 'it has been decided that they should give',{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Baydawi|Al-Bayḍawī]], Tafsīr (2 vols. Beirut: Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1988), vol. 1, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; since their own scriptures and prophets forbid breaking agreements and not paying what is due to others. His Messenger in this verse has been interpreted by exegetes as referring to the Prophet [[Muhammad|Muḥammad]] or the [[People of the Book]]'s own earlier messengers, [[Moses]] or [[Jesus]]. According to Abdel-Haleem, the latter must be the correct interpretation as it is already assumed that the People of the Book did not believe in [[Muhammad|Muḥammad]] or forbid what he forbade, so that they are condemned for not obeying their own prophet, who told them to honour their agreements.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}}

3. ''Who do not embrace the true faith // Who do not behave according to the rule of justice'' (''wa-lā yadīnūna dīna'l-ḥaqq'')

A number of translators have rendered the text as "those who do not embrace the true faith/follow the religion of truth" or some variation thereof.{{sfn|Dawood|1990|p=136}}{{sfn|Jones|2007}}{{sfn|Nasr et al|2015}}{{sfn|Arberry|1955}}{{sfn|Pickthall|1930}}{{sfn|Yusuf Ali|1938}}{{sfn|Shakir|2000}}{{sfn|Muhammad Sarwar|1982}} [[Muhammad Abdel-Haleem]] argues against this translation, preferring instead to render ''dīna'l-ḥaqq'' as "rule of justice". The main meaning of the Arabic ''dāna'' is 'he obeyed', and one of the many meanings of ''dīn'' is 'behaviour' (''al-sīra wa'l-ʿāda'').{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}} The famous Arabic [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] [[Fairuzabadi|Fayrūzabādī]] (d. 817/1415), gives more than twelve meanings for the word ''dīn'', placing the meaning 'worship of God, religion' lower in the list.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}}&lt;ref&gt;Fayrūzabādī, ''al-Qamūs al-muḥīṭ'', reprint (4 vols. Beirut: Dār al-Jīl, 1952), vol. 4, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al-Muʿjam al-wasīṭ'' gives the following definition: '"''dāna''" is to be in the habit of doing something good or bad; "''dāna bi''- something" is to take it as a religion and worship God through it'. Thus, when the verb ''dāna'' is used in the sense of 'to believe' or 'to practise a religion', it takes the preposition ''bi''- after it (e.g. ''dāna bi'l-Islām'') and this is the only usage in which the word means religion.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}}&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Muʿjam al-wasīṭ'' (Cairo: Majmaʿ al-Lugha al-ʿArabiyya, 1972); al-Rāzī, ''al-Tafsīr al-kabīr'', vol. 8, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The jizya verse does not say ''lā yadīnūna &lt;u&gt;bi-&lt;/u&gt;dīni'l-ḥaqq'', but rather ''lā yadīnūna dīna'l-ḥaqq''.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}} Abdel-Haleem thus concludes that the meaning that fits the jizya verse is thus 'those who do not follow the way of justice (''al-ḥaqq'')', i.e. by breaking their agreement and refusing to pay what is due.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=72–4}}

4. ''Until they pay jizya with their own hands (ḥattā yu'ṭū-l-jizyata 'an yadin).''

Here ''ʿan yad'' (from/for/at hand), is interpreted by some to mean that they should pay directly, without intermediary and without delay. Others say that it refers to its reception by Muslims and means "generously" as in "with an open hand," since the taking of the jizya is a form of munificence that averted a state of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] (2015), ''The Study Quran: A New Translation and Commentary'', {{ISBN|0061125865}}. Quote: "Here with a willing hand renders ʿan yad (lit. "from/for/at hand"), which some interpret to mean that they should pay directly, without intermediary and without delay (R). Others say that it refers to its reception by Muslims and means "generously" as in "with an open hand," since the taking of the jizyah is a form of munificence that averted a state of conflict (Q, R, Z)."&lt;/ref&gt; al-Ṭabarī gives only one explanation: that 'it means "from their hands to the hands of the receiver" just as we say "I spoke to him mouth to mouth", we also say, "I gave it to him hand to hand"'.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=75–6, 77}} [[M.J. Kister]] understands '''an yad'' to be a reference to the "ability and sufficient means" of the ''dhimmi''.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Kister "'An yadin (Qur'an IX/29): An Attempt at Interpretation," Arabica 11 (1964):272-278.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Rashid Rida]] takes the word ''Yad'' in a metaphorical sense and relates the phrase to the financial ability of the person liable to pay jizya.{{sfn|Shah|2008|p=19}}

5. While they are subdued  ''(wa-hum ṣāghirūn).''

[[Mark R. Cohen]] writes that 'while they are subdued' was interpreted by many to mean "humiliated state of the non-Muslims".{{sfn|Cohen|2008|p=56}} According to Ziauddin Ahmed, in the view of the majority of ''Fuqahā'' (Islamic jurists), the jizya was levied on non-Muslims in order to humiliate them for their unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmed |first=Ziauddin |date=1975 |title=The concept of Jizya in early Islam |journal=Islamic Studies |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Abdel-Haleem writes that this notion of humiliation runs contrary to verses such as, ''Do not dispute with the People of the Book except in the best manner'' (Q 29:46), and the Prophetic ''ḥadīth'',&lt;ref&gt;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/34/29&lt;/ref&gt; 'May God have mercy on the man who is liberal and easy-going (''samḥ'') when he buys, when he sells, and when he demands what is due to him'.{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|pp=75–6, 77}} [[Al-Shafi'i]], the founder of the Shafi'i school of law, wrote that a number of scholars explained this last expression to mean that "Islamic rulings are enforced on them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Shafi'i]], ''Kitabul Umm'', 4/219. Quote: «.وَسَمِعْت عَدَدًا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ الصَّغَارُ أَنْ يَجْرِيَ عَلَيْهِمْ حُكْمُ الْإِسْلَامِ» Translation: "And I heard a number of the people of knowledge state that ''al-sighar'' means that Islamic rulings are enforced on them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = al-Zuḥaylī | first = Wahbah | authorlink = Wahbah al-Zuhayli | url = https://archive.org/stream/GS51434/51434#page/n0/mode/2up | title = ʾĀthar al-ḥarb fī l-fiqh al-Islāmī : dirāsah muqārinah | script-title='' آثار الحرب في الفقه الإسلامي : دراسة مقارنة''| publisher = Dār al-Fikr |language=ar| location = [[Damascus]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-57547-453-0 | page = 705 }} Quote: «لا أن يضربوا و لا يؤذوا قال الشافعي: [...] و الصغار : أن يجري عليهم الحكم» Translation: "al-Shafi'i said: [...] And ''aṣ-Ṣaghār'' means that rulings are enforced on them, it does not mean that they should be beaten or be harmed."

===Liability and exemptions===

Rules for liability and exemptions of jizya formulated by jurists in the early [[Abbasid]] period appear to have remained generally valid thereafter.{{sfn|Cahen|loc= p. 561|ps=. "A certain number of rules formulated during the 'Abbasid period appear to be generally valid from that time onwards. Jizya is only levied on those who are male, adult, free, capable and able-bodied, so that children, old men, women, invalids, slaves, beggars, the sick and the mentally deranged are excluded. Foreigners are exempt from it on condition that they do not settle permanently in the country. Inhabitants of frontier districts who at certain times could be enrolled in military expeditions even if not Muslim (Mardaites, Amenians, etc.), were released from jizya for the year in question."}}{{sfn|Lambton|2013|p=205|ps=.

In this regard, Abu Ubayd ibn Sallam comments that the Prophet imposed 1 dinar (then worth 10 or 12 dirhams) upon each adult in Yemen. This was less than what Umar imposed upon the people of Syria and Iraq, the higher rate being due to the Yemenis greater affluence and ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spread of Islam Throughout the World'', edited by Idris El Hareir, Ravane Mbaye, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of jizya that were fixed and implemented by the second caliph of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], namely [[Umar|'Umar bin al-Khattab]], during the period of his Khilafah, were small amounts: four dirhams from the rich, two dirhams from the middle class and only one dirham from the active poor who earned by working on wages, or by making or vending things.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;[[Mufti Muhammad Shafi]]'', [[Maariful Quran|Ma'ārifu'l-Qur'ān]]'' '''4''', p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century scholar [[Al-Nawawi|Al-Nawawī]] writes, "The minimum amount of the jizya is one dinar per person per annum; but it is commendable to raise the amount, if it be possible to two dinars, for those possessed of moderate means, and to four for rich persons."&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Nawawi|Al-Nawawī]] (Translated by E.C. Howard) (2005). Minhaj et talibin: a manual of Muhammadan law. Adam Publishers. pp. 339-340. {{ISBN|978-81-7435-249-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu 'Ubayd insists that the ''dhimmis'' must not be burdened beyond their capacity, nor must they be caused to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet Davutoğlu (1994), ''Alternative paradigms: the impact of Islamic and Western Weltanschauungs on political theory'', p. 160. University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Qudamah]] narrates three views in what concerns the rates of jizya. First, that it is a fixed amount that can't be changed, a view that is reportedly shared by [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[al-Shafi'i]]. Secondly, that it is up to the [[Imam]] (Muslim ruler) to make [[Ijtihad|ijtihād]] (independent reasoning) so as to decide whether to add or decrease. He gives the example of '[[Umar]] making particular amounts for each class (the rich, the middle class and the active poor). Finally, the third opinion considered the strict minimum to be one dinar, but gave no upper bound concerning the maximum amount.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Qudamah]], ''Al-Mughni'', 13/209-10. Quote: «وفي مقدار الجزية ثلاث روايات: 1 - أنها مقدرة بمقدار لا يزيد عليه ولا ينقص منه، وهذا قول أبي حنيفة والشافعي؛ [...] 2 - أنها غير مقدرة بل يرجع فيها إلى اجتهاد الإمام في الزيادة والنقصان، قال الأشرم: قيل لأبي عبد الله: فيزداد اليوم فيه وينقص؟ يعني من الجزية، قال: نعم، يزاد فيه وينقص على قدر طاقتهم، على ما يرى الإمام، [...] وعمر جعل الجزية على ثلاث طبقات: - على الغني ثمانية وأربعين درهمًا. - وعلى المتوسط أربعة وعشرين درهما. - وعلى الفقير اثني عشر درهما. [...] وهذا يدل على أنها إلى رأي الإمام. [...] قال البخاري في صحيحه (4/ 117)، قال ابن عيينة: عن ابن أبي نجيح، قلت لمجاهد: ما شأن أهل الشام عليهم أربعة دنانير، وأهل اليمن عليهم دينار؟ قال: جعل ذلك من أجل اليسار، ولأنها عوض فلم تتقدر كالأجرة. 3 - أن أقلها مقدر بدينار، وأكثرها غير مقدر، وهو اختيار أبي بكر، فتجوز الزيادة ولا يجوز النقصان؛» Translation:(incomplete) "Concerning the rate of jizya, [we can discern between] three opinions: 1. That it is a fixed amount that can't be augmented, nor abated, and this is the opinion [as narrated from] Abu Hanifa and al-Shafi'i; [...] 2. That it isn't fixed, but it is up to the Imam (Muslim ruler) to make ijtihad (independent reasoning) in [determining whether to make] additions or subtractions, al-Ashram said: It was said to Abi 'Abd Allah: So we add or reduce it? Meaning from jizya. He said: "Yes, it is added or subtracted according to their (dhimmis) capability, [and] according to what the Imam sees [most fitting] [...] And 'Umar made the jizya into three different layers: 48 dirhams from the rich, 24 dirhams from the middle class and 12 dirhams from the [working] poor. [...] And this indicates that it goes to the opinion of the Imam. [...] al-Bukhari said in his Sahih (4:117): Ibn 'Uyaynah said: From Ibn Abi Najih: I said to Mujahid: What is the matter with the people of al-Sham who are required to pay 4 dinars, whereas the people of Yemen [only] pay one dinar? He said: It was made so for easing things (depending on the capacity of each), and since it is in exchange for something so its [amount] wasn't fixed like employment. [...] 3. That its minimum is rated at one dinar, but its maximum isn't fixed, and this is the choice of Abu Bakr, so it is permitted to add, and it wouldn't be lawful to reduce."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Khaldun]] states that jizya has fixed limits that cannot be exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], translation: Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1969), ''The Muqaddimah : an introduction to history ; in three volumes'' '''1''', p. 230. [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the classical manual of [[Shafi'i]] [[fiqh]] ''[[Reliance of the Traveller]]'' it is stated that, "[t]he minimum non-Muslim poll tax is one dinar (n: 4.235 grams of gold) per person (A: per year). The maximum is whatever both sides agree upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nuh Ha Mim |last=Keller (ed., trans.)|authorlink=Nuh Ha Mim Keller|title=[[Reliance of the Traveller|Reliance of the Traveller: Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law]]|publisher=Amana Publications|page=608|year=1994|ISBN= 978-0-915957-72-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann Lambton]] states that the jizya was to be paid "in humiliating conditions".{{sfn|Lambton|2013|pp=204–205}} Ennaji and other scholars state that some jurists required the jizya to be paid by each in person, by presenting himself, arriving on foot not horseback, by hand, in order to confirm that he lowers himself to being a subjected one, and willingly pays.&lt;ref name="mennp60"&gt;{{cite book|last = Ennaji|first = Mohammed|year = 2013|title = Slavery, the state, and Islam|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|pages = 60–4|isbn = 978-0521119627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Aghnides | first=Nicolas | title=Islamic theories of finance : with an introduction to Islamic law and a bibliography | publisher=Gorgias Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-59333-311-9 | pages=398–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tsadik | first=Daniel | title=Between foreigners and Shi'is : nineteenth-century Iran and its Jewish minority | publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | location=Stanford, USA | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-8047-5458-3 | pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mark R.

The Maliki scholar [[Al-Qurtubi]] states, "their punishment in case of non-payment [of jizya] while they were able [to do so] is permitted; however, if their inability to pay it was clear then it isn't lawful to punish them, since, if one isn't able to pay the jizya, then he is exempted".&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Qurtubi]], Ahkam al-Qur'an, vol. 8, p. 49. Quote: «وأما عقوبتهم إذا امتنعوا عن أدائها مع التمكين فجائز، فأما مع تبين عجزهم فلا تحل عقوبتهم، لأن من عجز عن الجزية سقطت عنه» Translation: "Their punishment in case of non-payment [of jizya] while they were able [to do so] is permitted; however, if their inability to pay it was clear, then it isn't lawful to punish them, since, if one isn't able to pay the jizya, then he is exempted."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Abu Yusuf]], jurist of the fifth [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], those who didn't pay jizya should be imprisoned and not be let out of custody until payment; however, the collectors of the jizya were instructed to show leniency and avoid corporal punishment in case of non-payment.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|pp=159–160}} If someone had agreed to pay jizya, leaving Muslim territory for enemy land was, in theory, punishable by enslavement if they were ever captured. This punishment did not apply if the person had suffered injustices from Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Fisher (2001), ''Slavery in the History of Muslim Black Africa.'' NYU Press. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of jizya tax===

Jizya was considered as one of the basic tax revenue for the early Islamic state along with [[zakat]], kharaj, and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Çizakça|date=2011|first1=Murat|title=Islamic Capitalism and Finance: Origins, Evolution and the Future|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was collected by the [[Bayt al-Mal]] (public treasury).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Holger|title=Social Welfare in Muslim Societies in Africa|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holger Weiss states that four-fifths of the ''fay'' revenue, that is jizya and kharaj, goes to the public treasury according to the Shafi'i madhhab, whereas the Hanafi and Maliki madhhabs state that the entire ''fay'' goes to the public treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Weiss, ''Social Welfare in Muslim Societies in Africa'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, jizya funds were distributed as salaries for officials, pensions to the army and charity.{{sfn|Cahen|p=562}} Cahen states, "But under this pretext it was often paid into the Prince's ''khass'', "private" treasury."{{sfn|Cahen|p=562}} In later times, jizya revenues were commonly allocated to Islamic scholars so that they would not have to accept money from sultans whose wealth came to be regarded as tainted.{{sfn|Lambton|2013|pp=204–205}}

Sources disagree about expenditure of jizya funds on non-Muslims. [[Ann Lambton]] states that non-Muslims had no share in the benefits from the public treasury derived from jizya.{{sfn|Lambton|2013|pp=204–205}} In contrast, according to several Muslim scholars, Islamic tradition records a number of episodes in which the second caliph Umar stipulated that needy and infirm dhimmis be supported from the [[Bayt al-Mal]], which some authors hold to be representative of Islam.{{sfn|Dagli|2013| pp=82–3}}{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|p=80}}&lt;ref name="Tahir-ul-Qadri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ihsan2"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Al-Hindī|last1=Iḥsān|language=ar|title=Aḥkām al-Ḥarb wa al-Salām fī Dawlat al-Islām|script-title=''أحكام الحرب والسلام في دولة الإسلام''|location=[[Damascus]]|publisher=Dār al-Numayr|date=1993|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=islamicfinance&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kamaruddin Sharif|author2=Wang Yong Bao|editor1-last=Iqbal|editor1-first=Zamir|editor2-last=Mirakhor|editor2-first=Abbas|title=Economic Development and Islamic Finance|pages=239|isbn=978-0-8213-9953-8|quote=As these examples show, the responsibility for social safety and security that the Islamic state has undertaken has not been restricted to its citizens, but has also included all residents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Umar bin 'Abd al-'Aziz Qurchi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FGlGCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT269&amp;dq=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85&amp;pg=PT277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Samahat al-Islam''. pp. 278-9.] Maktabat al-'Adib.&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of jizya benefitting non-residents and temporary residents of an Islamic state, is found in the treaty Khalid bin al-Walid concluded with the people of Al-Hirah of Iraq, wherein any aged person who was weak, had lost his or her ability to work, fallen ill, or who had been rich but became poor, would be exempt from jiyza and his or livelihood and the livelihood of his or her dependents, who were not living permanently in the Islamic state, would be met by [[Bayt al-Mal]].&lt;ref name=islamicfinance2&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kamaruddin Sharif|author2=Wang Yong Bao|editor1-last=Iqbal|editor1-first=Zamir|editor2-last=Mirakhor|editor2-first=Abbas|title=Economic Development and Islamic Finance|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shibli2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nuʻmānī | first = Shiblī |  authorlink=Shibli Nomani| title = Umar: Makers of Islamic Civilization | publisher = [[I.B.

==History==

===Origins===

The history of the origins of the jizya is very complex for the following reasons:{{sfn|Cahen|p=559}}
* Abbasid-era authors who systematized earlier historical writings, where the term "jizya" was used with different meanings, interpreted it according to the usage common in their own time;
* the system established by the Arab conquest was not uniform, but rather resulted from a variety of agreements or decisions; 
* the earlier systems of taxation on which it was based are still imperfectly understood.{{sfn|Cahen|p=559}}

[[William Montgomery Watt]] traces its origin to a pre-Islamic practice among the Arabian nomads wherein a powerful tribe would agree to protect its weaker neighbors in exchange for a tribute, which would be refunded if the protection proved ineffectual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt]] (1980), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews and Christians in some southern and eastern areas of the Arabian peninsula began to pay tribute, called ''jizya'', to the Islamic state during Muhammad's lifetime.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|pp=17–18}} It was not originally the poll tax it was to become later, but rather an annual percentage of produce and a fixed quantity of goods.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|pp=17–18}}

During the [[Battle of Tabouk|Tabuk campaign]] of 630 Muhammad sent letters to four towns in the northern [[Hejaz]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] urging them to relinquish maintenance of a military force and rely on Muslims to ensure their security in return for payment of taxes.&lt;ref name="Gil"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gil|first=Moshe|authorlink=Moshe Gil|title=A History of Palestine: 634–1099|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1997|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe Gil]] argues that these texts represent the paradigm of letters of security that would be issued by Muslim leaders during the subsequent [[Early Muslim conquests|early conquests]], including the use of the word jizya, which would later take on the meaning of poll tax.&lt;ref name="Gil"/&gt;

Jizya received divine sanction in 630 when the term was mentioned in a Quranic verse (9:29).{{sfn|Stillman|1979|pp=17–18}} Max Bravmann argues that the Quranic usage of the word jizya develops a pre-Islamic common-law principle which states that reward must necessarily follow a discretional good deed into a principle mandating that the life of all prisoners of war belonging to a certain category must be spared provided they grant the "reward" (jizya) to be expected for an act of pardon.{{sfn|Bravmann|2009|p=204|ps=. "Whereas in the (non-Islamic) examples mentioned by us above the good deed consists in the pardon granted by an individual according to his discretion to an individual who has been vanquished and taken captive by him, in the Qur'an verse discussed by us the good deed, and hence also the "reward" (jizya = jaza' = tawab) necessarily following it according to ancient Arab common law have become a practice normally occurring and that must be performed: the life of all prisoners of war belonging to a certain privileged category of non-believers must, as a rule, be spared. All must be subject to pardon - provided they grant the "reward" (jizya) to be expected for an act of pardon (sparing of life)."}}

In 632 jizya in the form of a poll tax was first mentioned in a document reportedly sent by Muhammad to Yemen.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|pp=17–18}} [[William Montgomery Watt|W. Montgomery Watt]] has argued that this document was tampered with by early Muslim historians to reflect a later practice, while [[Norman Stillman]] holds it to be authentic.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|pp=17–18}}

===Emergence of classical taxation system===

Taxes levied on local populations in the wake of [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] could be of three types, based on whether they were levied on individuals, on the land, or as collective tribute.{{sfn|Cahen|p=559}} During the first century of Islamic expansion, the words ''jizya'' and ''kharaj'' were used in all these three senses, with context distinguishing between individual and land taxes ("kharaj on the head", "jizya on land", and vice versa).{{sfn|Cahen|p=559}}&lt;ref name="anver"&gt;Anver M. Emon, ''Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law'', p. 98, note 3. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0199661633}}. Quote: "Some studies question the nearly synonymous use of the terms kharaj and jizya in the historical sources. The general view suggests that while the terms kharaj and jizya seem to have been used interchangeably in early historical sources, what they referred to in any given case depended on the linguistic context. If one finds references to "a kharaj on their heads," the reference was to a poll tax, despite the use of the term kharaj, which later became the term of art for land tax. Likewise, if one fins the phrase "jizya on their land," this referred to a land tax, despite the use of jizya which later come to refer to the poll tax. Early history therefore shows that although each term did not have a determinate technical meaning at first, the concepts of poll tax and land tax existed early in Islamic history." Denner, Conversion and the Poll Tax, 3–10; Ajiaz Hassan Qureshi, "The Terms Kharaj and Jizya and Their Implication," Journal of the Punjab University Historical Society 12 (1961): 27–38; Hossein Modarressi Rabatab'i, Kharaj in Islamic Law (London: Anchor Press Ltd, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Dennett, "since we are talking in terms of history, not in terms of philology, the problem is not what the taxes were called, but what we know they were."{{sfn|Dennett|1950|p=11}} Regional variations in taxation at first reflected the diversity of previous systems.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} The [[Sasanian Empire]] had a general tax on land and a poll tax having several rates based on wealth, with an exemption for aristocracy.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} In [[Iraq]], which was conquered mainly by force, Arabs controlled taxation through local administrators, keeping the graded poll tax, and likely increasing its rates to 1, 2 and 4 dinars.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} The aristocracy exemption was assumed by the new Arab-Muslim elite and shared by local aristocracy by means of conversion.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}}{{sfn|Hoyland|2014|p=99}} The nature of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] taxation remains partly unclear, but it appears to have involved taxes computed in proportion to agricultural production or number of working inhabitants in population centers.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} In [[Syria]] and upper [[Mesopotamia]], which largely surrendered under treaties, taxes were calculated in proportion to the number of inhabitants at a fixed rate (generally 1 [[dinar]] per head).{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} They were levied as collective tribute in population centers which preserved their autonomy and as a personal tax on large abandoned estates, often paid by [[peasants]] in produce.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} In post-conquest [[Egypt]], most communities were taxed using a system which combined a land tax with a poll tax of 2 dinars per head.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} Collection of both was delegated to the community on the condition that the burden be divided among its members in the most equitable manner.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} In most of [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]] local rulers paid a fixed tribute and maintained their autonomy in tax collection, using the [[Sasanian]] dual tax system in regions like [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}}

Difficulties in tax collection soon appeared.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} Egyptian Copts, who had been skilled in tax evasion since Roman times, were able to avoid paying the taxes by entering [[Monastery|monasteries]], which were initially exempt from taxation, or simply by leaving the district where they were registered.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} This prompted imposition of taxes on monks and introduction of movement controls.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}} In [[Iraq]], many peasants who had fallen behind with their tax payments, converted to Islam and abandoned their land for Arab garrison cities in hope of escaping taxation.{{sfn|Cahen|p=560}}{{sfn|Hoyland|2014|p=199}} Faced with a decline in agriculture and a treasury shortfall, the governor of [[Iraq]] [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]] forced peasant converts to return to their lands and subjected them to the taxes again, effectively forbidding peasants to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}} In Khorasan, a similar phenomenon forced the native aristocracy to compensate for the shortfall in tax collection out of their own pockets, and they responded by persecuting peasant converts and imposing heavier taxes on poor Muslims.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}}

The situation where conversion to Islam was penalized in an Islamic state could not last, and the devout [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]] has been credited with changing the taxation system.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}} Modern historians doubt this account, although details of the transition to the system of taxation elaborated by Abbasid-era jurists are still unclear.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}} [[Umar II]] ordered governors to cease collection of taxes from Muslim converts,{{sfn|Dennett|1950|p=103|ps=. "ʿUmar II, however ordered all converts to be exempt from the poll tax. They paid their land tax as always."}} but his successors obstructed this policy. Some governors sought to stem the tide of conversions by introducing additional requirements such as undergoing circumcision and the ability to recite passages from the Quran.{{sfn|Hoyland|2014|p=199}} According to [[Robert G. Hoyland|Hoyland]], taxation-related grievances of non-Arab Muslims contributed to the opposition movements which resulted in the Abbasid revolution.{{sfn|Hoyland|2014|pp=201–202}} In contrast, Dennett states that it is incorrect to postulate an economic interpretation of the [[Abbasid Revolution|Abbasid revolution]]. The notion of an Iranian population staggering under a burden of taxation and ready to revolt at the first opportunity, as imagined by [[Gerlof van Vloten]], "will not bear the light of careful investigation", he continues.{{sfn|Dennett|1950|p=113}}

Under the new system that was eventually established, kharaj came to be regarded as a tax levied on the land, regardless of the taxpayer's religion.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}} The poll-tax was no longer levied on Muslims, but treasury did not necessarily suffer and converts did not gain as a result, since they had to pay [[zakat]], which was instituted as a compulsory tax on Muslims around 730.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}}{{sfn|Hoyland|2014|p=200}} The terminology became specialized during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]], so that ''kharaj'' no longer meant anything more than land tax, while the term "jizya" was restricted to the poll-tax on dhimmis.{{sfn|Cahen|p=561}}

===India===
In [[India]], Islamic rulers imposed ''jizya'' on non-Muslims starting with the 11th century.&lt;ref name=jacksonpages284286&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter|title=The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History|date=2003|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521543293|pages=284–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxation practice included ''jizya'' and ''kharaj'' taxes. These terms were sometimes used interchangeably to mean poll tax and collective tribute, or just called ''kharaj-o-jizya''.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Habib, Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500, Vol VIII, part 1, pp. 78–80. {{ISBN|978-81-317-2791-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jizya expanded with [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Alā' al-Dīn Khaljī, a Sultan of the [[Khalji dynasty]] who ruled over most of North, West and parts of Eastern India, from 1296 to 1316 AD, legalized the enslavement of the jizya and kharaj defaulters. His officials seized and sold these slaves in growing Sultanate cities where there was a great demand of slave labour.&lt;ref&gt;Fouzia Ahmed (2009), The Delhi Sultanate: A Slave Society or A Society with Slaves?, Pakistan Journal of History and Culture, 30(1): 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim court historian [[Ziauddin Barani]] recorded that [[Qadi|Kazi]] Mughisuddin of Bayanah advised Alā' al-Dīn that Islam requires imposition of jizya on Hindus, to show contempt and to humiliate the Hindus, and imposing jizya is a religious duty of the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliot|first=H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir|author2=John Dowson|title=The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.)|page=184|chapter=15.

The Kazi replied, "They are called payers of tribute, and when the revenue officer demands silver from them, they should tender gold. If the officer throws dirt into their mouths, they must without reluctance open their mouths to receive it. The due subordination of the ''zimmi'' is exhibited in this humble payment and by this throwing of dirt in their mouths. The glorification of Islam is a duty. God holds them in contempt, for he says, "keep them under in subjection". To keep the Hindus in abasement is especially a religious duty, because they are the most inveterate enemies of the Prophet, and because the Prophet has commanded us to slay them, plunder them, enslave them and spoil their wealth and property. No doctor but the great doctor ([[Hanafi]]), to whose school we belong, has assented to the imposition of the '''jizya''' (poll tax) on Hindus. Doctors of [[Fiqh|other schools]] allow no other alternative but Death or Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 14th century reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, expensive invasions across India and his order to attack China by sending a portion of his army over the Himalayas, emptied the precious metal in Sultanate's treasury.&lt;ref name=vincentpages236242/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hunter (1903), {{Google books|5IQqAAAAYAAJ|A Brief History of the Indian Peoples|page=124}}, 23rd Edition, pp. 124–8&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered minting of coins from base metals with face value of precious metals. This economic experiment failed because Hindus in his Sultanate minted counterfeit coins from base metal in their homes, which they then used for paying jizya.&lt;ref name=vincentpages236242&gt;Vincent A Smith, {{Google books|p2gxAQAAMAAJ|The Oxford History of India: From the Earliest Times to the End of 1911}}, Chapter 2, pp 236–42, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/396460/Muhammad-ibn-Tughluq Muḥammad ibn Tughluq] Encyclopedia Britannica (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 14th century, mentions the memoir of [[Tughlaq dynasty]]'s Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq, his predecessor taxed all Hindus but had exempted all Hindu [[Brahmin]]s from jizya; Firoz Shah extended it over all Hindus.&lt;ref name=vincentpages249251/&gt;&lt;ref name=firoz374383&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n389/mode/2up Futuhat-i Firoz Shahi] Autobiography of Firoz Shah Tughlaq, Translated y Elliot and Dawson, Volume 3 - The History of India, Cornell University, pp 374–83&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced that any Hindus who converted to Islam would become exempt from taxes and jizya as well as receive gifts from him.&lt;ref name=vincentpages249251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Annemarie Schimmel]]|title=Islam in the Indian Subcontinent|date=1997|publisher=Brill Academic|isbn=978-9004061170|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On those who chose to remain Hindus, he raised jizya tax rate.&lt;ref name=vincentpages249251&gt;Vincent A Smith, {{Google books|p2gxAQAAMAAJ|The Oxford History of India: From the Earliest Times to the End of 1911}}, Chapter 2, pp. 249–51, [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was finally abolished in 1579. However, [[Aurangzeb]], the sixth emperor, re-introduced and levied ''jizya'' on non-Muslims in 1679. His goal was to promote Islam and weaken the Hindu religion. Aurangzeb ordered that the collected jizya be used for charitable causes to support the increasing number of impoverished and unemployed Muslim clerics in his empire. Hindus were outraged and numerous small-scale revolts resulted. The jizya rate was more than twice the zakat tax rate paid by Muslims, which led to mass civil protests of 1679 in India.&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra, "Jizyah and the State in India during the 17th Century."

Jizya collected from Christian and Jewish communities was among the main sources of tax income of the Ottoman treasury.&lt;ref name=opp287/&gt; In some regions, such as Lebanon and Egypt, jizya was payable collectively by the Christian or the Jewish community, and was referred to as ''maqtu'' - in these cases the individual rate of jizya tax would vary, as the community would pitch in for those who could not afford to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Winter (2012), The Shiites of Lebanon under Ottoman Rule, 1516–1788, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|978-1107411432}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd Edition.

===Abolition===
In [[Iran|Persia]], ''jizya'' was paid by [[Zoroastrian]] minority until 1884, when it was removed by pressure on the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] government from the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund.&lt;ref&gt;"The Zoroastrians who remained in Persia (modern Iran) after the Arab–Muslim conquest (7th century AD) had a long history as outcasts. Although they purchased some toleration by paying the jizya (poll tax), not abolished until 1882, they were treated as an inferior race, had to wear distinctive garb, and were not allowed to ride horses or bear arms."

Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The ''jizya'' was eliminated in [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] in the 19th century, but continued to be collected in Morocco until the first decade of the 20th century (these three dates coincide with the [[France|French]] colonization of these countries).&lt;ref&gt;"Though in Tunisia and Algeria the ''jizya/kharaj'' practice was eliminated during the 19th century, [[Moroccan Jew]]ry still paid these taxes as late as the first decade of the twentieth century." Michael M. Laskier, ''North African Jewry in the Twentieth Century: Jews of Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria'', NYU Press, 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire abolished the "jizya" in 1856. It was replaced with a new tax, which non-Muslims paid in lieu of military service. It was called ''baddal-askari'' (lit. "military substitution"), a tax exempting Jews and Christians from military service. The [[Kurdish Jews|Jews of Kurdistan]], according to the scholar Mordechai Zaken, preferred to pay the "baddal" tax in order to redeem themselves from military service. Only those incapable of paying the tax were drafted into the army. Zaken says that paying the tax was possible to an extent also during the war and some Jews paid 50 gold liras every year during [[World War I]]. According to Zaken, "in spite of the forceful conscription campaigns, some of the Jews were able to buy their exemption from conscription duty." Zaken states that the payment of the ''baddal askari'' during the war was a form of bribe that bought them at most a one-year deferment."&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Zaken, ''Jewish Subjects and their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival'', Brill, 2007, pp. 280–284–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent times===
The jizya is no longer imposed by Muslim states.&lt;ref name=iwt738/&gt;{{sfn|Cahen|p=562}} Nevertheless, there have been reports of non-Muslims in areas controlled by the Pakistani Taliban and ISIS being forced to pay the jizya.&lt;ref name=ipt-p283/&gt;&lt;ref name="raqqa"/&gt;

In 2009, it was claimed that a group of militants that referred to themselves as the [[Taliban]] imposed the ''jizya'' on Pakistan's minority [[Sikhs in Pakistan|Sikh community]] after occupying some of their homes and kidnapping a Sikh leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090417/world.htm#6 |title=Sikhs pay Rs 20 million as 'tax' to Taliban |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) announced that it intended to extract jizya from Christians in the city of [[Raqqa]], Syria, which it controlled. Christians who refused to pay the tax would have to either convert to Islam or die. Wealthy Christians would have to pay the equivalent of USD $664 twice a year; poorer ones would be charged one-fourth that amount.&lt;ref name="raqqa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/28/al-qaeda-in-syria-extorts-christians/|title=Al-Qaeda Rebels in Syria Tell Christians to Pay Up or Die|publisher=Time.com|author= Aryn Baker|date=Feb 28, 2014|quote="In a statement posted to Jihadi websites and signed by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-designated emir of the future Islamic caliphate of Raqqa, as well as the founder of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria [ISIS] rebel brigade, Christians are urged to pay a tax in order to continue living under ISIS's protection."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the [[Institute for the Study of War]] reported that [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] claims to have collected the ''fay'', i.e. jizya and kharaj.&lt;ref name="ISWJune30"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caris|first1=Charlie|title=The Islamic State Announces Caliphate|url=http://iswiraq.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/the-islamic-state-announces-caliphate.html|publisher=Institute for the Study of War|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late Islamic scholar [[Abul A'la Maududi]], of [[Pakistan]], said that Jizya should be re-imposed on non-Muslims in a Muslim nation.&lt;ref name="esposito-shahin-149" /&gt; [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] of [[Egypt]] also held that position in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref name="rsp101102"&gt;{{cite book | last=Scott | first=Rachel | title=The challenge of political Islam non-Muslims and the Egyptian state | publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | location=Stanford, Calif | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-8047-6906-8 | page=101 | quote=In the mid-1980's Yusuf al-Qaradawi argued that non-Muslims should not serve in the army and should pay the jizya on the basis that the Islamic state is best protected by those who believe in it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however he later reconsidered his legal opinion on this point, stating: "[n]owadays, after [[Conscription|military conscription]] has become compulsory for all [[Citizenship|citizens]] — Muslims and non-Muslims — there is no longer room for any payment, whether by name of jizya or any other."&lt;ref name="Qaradawi"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/qaradawi.net/026%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%20%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9%20%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%84%20%D9%88%20%D8%B1%D8%AF%20%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AA#page/n0/mode/2up|first1=Yūsuf|last1=al-Qaraḍāwī|authorlink=Yusuf al-Qaradawi|date=2007|title=al-Dīn wa-al-siyāsah : taʼṣīl wa-radd shubuhāt|script-title=''الدين والسياسة : تأصيل ورد شبهات''|page=157|location=[[Dublin]]|publisher=European Council for Fatwa and Research}} Quote: «و اليوم بعد أن أصبح التجنيد الإجباري مفروضا على كل المواطنين − مسلمين و غير مسلمين − لم يعد هناك مجال لدفع أي مال، لا باسم جزية، و لا غيرها.» Translation: "Nowadays, after military conscription has become compulsory for all citizens — Muslims and non-Muslims — there is no longer room for any payment, whether by name of ''jizya'', or any other."

==Assessment and historical context==
{{see also|Taxation of the Jews in Europe}}

Some authors have characterized the complex of land and poll taxes in the pre-Abbasid era and implementation of the jizya poll tax in early modern [[South Asia]] as discriminatory and/or oppressive,{{sfn|Hoyland|2014|p=198|ps=. "The most contentious aspect of this discriminatory policy was taxation. Initially, as one would expect, the Arabs, as conquerors and soldiers/rulers, did not pay any taxes. The (adult male) conquered people, on the other hand, all paid tax, irrespective of their religion or ethnicity, unless they were granted an exemption in return for providing military service or spying or the like."}}{{sfn|Stillman|1979|p=28}}&lt;ref name=jamalmalik&gt;{{cite book | last=Malik | first=Jamal | title=Islam in South Asia a short history | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden, Netherlands | year=2008 | isbn=978-90-04-16859-6 | page=69|quote=It is to be noted that this tax was collected in lieu of military service, but the problem gets compounded when we learn that so many Hindus fought in Muslim armies.

(1969), Jizyah and the State in India during the 17th Century, Journal de l'histoire economique et sociale de l'Orient, p. 339. Quote: "Politically, the greatest objection to ''jizyah'' was that it harassed and alienated some of the most influential sections of the Hindus, namely the urban masses [...] These people were subjected to great harassment and oppression by the collectors of ''jizyah'', and in retaliation resorted on a number of occasions to ''hartal'' and public demonstrations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Markovits | first=Claude | title=A history of modern India, 1480-1950 | publisher=Anthem | location=London | year=2004 | isbn=978-1-84331-152-2 | page=30 | quote=the ''jizya'' [was] the symbol par excellence of the superiority of Muslims over non-Muslims: it is highly doubtful that it was in reality levied as a tax distinct from the land tax; the terms ''jizya'' and ''kharaj'' are interchangeable in the texts dating from this time. The extremely theoretical nature of this discrimination must be kept in mind when there is reference to its abolition or its restoration under the Moguls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of Islamic scholars, amongst whom are [[Al-Nawawi]] and [[Ibn Qudamah]], have criticized humiliating aspects of its collection as contrary to Islamic principles.{{sfn|Dagli|2013| pp=82–3}}&lt;ref name="Nawawi2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takim, L.

They add that the change from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and Persian rule to Arab rule lowered taxes and allowed dhimmis to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Victoria|first1=William L.

[[Ira Lapidus]] writes that the Arab-Muslim conquests followed a general pattern of nomadic conquests of settled regions, whereby conquering peoples became the new military elite and reached a compromise with the old elites by allowing them to retain local political, religious, and financial authority.&lt;ref name="Lapidus"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lapidus | first = Ira M. | authorlink=Ira M.

[[Norman Stillman]] writes that although the tax burden of the Jews under early Islamic rule was comparable to that under previous rulers, Christians of the Byzantine Empire (though not Christians of the Persian empire, whose status was similar to that of the Jews) and Zoroastrians of Iran shouldered a considerably heavier burden in the immediate aftermath of the Arab conquests.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|p=28}} He writes that escape from oppressive taxation and social inferiority was a "great inducement" to conversion and flight from villages to Arab garrison towns, and many converts to Islam "were sorely disappointed when they discovered that they were not to be permitted to go from being tribute bearers to pension receivers by the ruling Arab military elite," before their numbers forced an overhaul of the economic system in the 8th century.{{sfn|Stillman|1979|p=28}}

The influence of jizya on conversion has been a subject of scholarly debate.&lt;ref name="Tramontana"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tramontana | first=Felicita | title=The Poll Tax and the Decline of the Christian Presence in the Palestinian Countryside in the 17th Century | journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=56 | issue=4-5 | year=2013 | pages=631–652 | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685209-12341337 | doi=10.1163/15685209-12341337 | ref=harv | accessdate=2016-02-03|quote=The (cor)relation between the payment of the poll-tax and conversion to Islam, has long been the subject of scholarly debate. At the beginning of the twentieth century scholars suggested that after the Muslim conquest the local populations converted ''en masse'' to evade the payment of the poll tax. This assumption has been challenged by subsequent research.  Indeed  Dennett's  study  clearly  showed  that  the payment  of  the  poll  tax  was  not  a  sufficient  reason  to  convert  after  the Muslim  conquest and  that other  factors—such  as the wish to retain  social status—had  greater  influence. According  to  Inalcik the  wish  to  evade payment of the jizya  was an important incentive for conversion to Islam in the Balkans, but Anton  Minkov has recently argued that taxation was only one of a number of motivations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Wellhausen held that the poll tax amounted to so little that exemption from it did not constitute sufficient economic motive for conversion.{{sfn|Dennett|1950|p=10|ps=. "Wellhausen makes the assumption that the poll tax amounted to so little that exemption from it did not constitute sufficient economic motive for conversion."}} Similarly, [[Thomas Walker Arnold|Thomas Arnold]] states that jizya was "too moderate" to constitute a burden, "seeing that it released them from the compulsory military service that was incumbent on their Muslim fellow subjects." He further adds that converts escaping taxation would have to pay the legal alms, zakat, that is annually levied on most kinds of movable and immovable property.&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI7"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=... but this jizyah was too moderate to constitute a burden, seeing that it released them from the compulsory military service that was incumbent on their Muslim fellow-subjects. Conversion to Islam was certainly attended by a certain pecuniary advantage, but his former religion could have had but little hold on a convert who abandoned it merely to gain exemption from the jizyah; and now, instead of jizyah, the convert had to pay the legal alms, zakāt, annually levied on most kinds of movable and immovable property.
}} ([https://archive.org/stream/preachingofislam00arno#page/58/mode/2up online])&lt;/ref&gt; Other early 20th century scholars suggested that non-Muslims converted to Islam ''en masse'' in order to escape the poll tax, but this theory has been challenged by more recent research.&lt;ref name="Tramontana"/&gt; Daniel Dennett has shown that other factors, such as desire to retain social status, had greater influence on this choice in the early Islamic period.&lt;ref name="Tramontana"/&gt;  According to [[Halil İnalcık]], the wish to avoid paying the jizya was an important incentive for conversion to Islam in the Balkans, though Anton Minkov has argued that it was only one among several motivating factors.&lt;ref name="Tramontana"/&gt;

[[Mark R. Cohen]] writes that despite the humiliating connotations and the financial burden, the jizya paid by Jews under Islamic rule provided a "surer guarantee of protection from non-Jewish hostility" than that possessed by Jews in the Latin West, where Jews "paid numerous and often unreasonably high and arbitrary taxes" in return for official protection, and where treatment of Jews was governed by charters which new rulers could alter at will upon accession or refuse to renew altogether.{{sfn|Cohen|2008|pp=72-73}} The [[Pact of Umar]], which stipulated that Muslims must "do battle to guard" the dhimmis and "put no burden on them greater than they can bear", was not always upheld, but it remained "a steadfast cornerstone of Islamic policy" into early modern times.{{sfn|Cohen|2008|pp=72-73}}

Yaser Ellethy states that the "insignificant amount" of the jizya, as well as  its progressive structure and exemptions leave no doubt that it was not imposed to persecute people or force them to convert.{{sfn|Ellethy|2014|p=181|ps=. "[...] the insignificant amount of this yearly tax, the fact that it was progressive, that elders, poor people, handicapped, women, children, monks and hermits were exempted, leave no doubt about exploitation or persecution of those who did not accept Islam. Comparing its amount to the obligatory zaka which an ex-dhimmi should give to the Muslim state in case he converts to Islam dismisses the claim that its aim was forced conversions to Islam."}} Niaz A. Shah states that ''jizya'' is "partly symbolic and partly commutation for military service. As the amount is insignificant and exemptions are many, the symbolic nature predominates."{{sfn|Shah|2008|pp=19–20}} The French polymath [[Gustave Le Bon]] wrote "that despite the fact that the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim was free to enjoy equally well with every Muslim all the privileges afforded to the citizens of the state."&lt;ref&gt;Mun'im Sirry (2014), ''Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions'', p. 179. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0199359363}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Abdel-Haleem]] states, "[t]he jizya is a very clear example of the acceptance of a multiplicity of cultures within the Islamic system, which allowed people of different faiths to live according to their own faiths, all contributing to the well-being of the state, Muslims through ''[[Zakat|zakāt]]'', and the ''ahl al-dhimma'' through ''jizya''."{{sfn|Abdel-Haleem|2012|p=86}}

On March 24, 2008, [[Wayne County, Michigan]] Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced a 12-count criminal indictment against [[Detroit]] Mayor [[Kwame Kilpatrick]] and his former Chief of Staff and paramour [[Christine Beatty]].  Kilpatrick was charged with eight felonies and Beatty with seven. Charges for both included [[perjury]], [[misconduct]] in office and [[obstruction of justice]].  Worthy also suggested that others in the Kilpatrick administration could also be charged.&lt;ref name="Indictment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080324/NEWS01/303250001 |title=Kilpatrick, Beatty face felony charges.  The 12-count criminal information charges perjury, conspiracy, misconduct in office and obstruction of justice. |accessdate=2008-03-24 |last=ASHENFELTER|first=DAVID  |author2=JOE SWICKARD  |date=2008-03-24 |work=detnews.com |publisher=Detroit Free Press |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2008, Beatty admitted lying under oath and was sentenced to 120 days in jail. She began serving the sentence on January 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/article/20081201/NEWS01/312020002/1001/news&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text-messaging scandal==
{{main|Kilpatrick and Beatty text-messaging scandal}}
The charges stem from a [[political scandal|political]]-[[sex scandal]] emerging from a sexual relationship between [[List of Mayors of Detroit, Michigan|Detroit Mayor]] Kilpatrick and his [[Chief of staff (politics)|chief of staff]] Christine Beatty.  The revelation of this [[extra-marital affair]] was confirmed in [[Text messaging|text messages]] exchanged between Kilpatrick and Beatty.  The text messages appear to contradict testimony that Kilpatrick and Beatty gave at a trial in 2007 in regards to whether they had an affair and had fired an officer for investigating the mayor's behavior.  The City of Detroit settled the lawsuit for $8.4 million based on the recommendation of Kilpatrick and the City of Detroit law department.&lt;ref name=Indictment/&gt;

The news led to Beatty resigning in February 2008 and political leaders and citizens calling for Kilpatrick to resign.&lt;ref name=Indictment/&gt;

==Legal defense fund==
To help offset the cost of Kilpatrick's criminal defense team, a fund was set up to raise money.  According to Kilpatrick legal team spokesman Christopher Garrett, the fund's membership committee included former mayor of San Francisco, [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]]; Detroit native and television personality Judge [[Greg Mathis]]; [[Malik Zulu Shabazz]], the leader of the [[New Black Panthers]] in Detroit; and S. Martin Taylor, a former DTE executive and a [[University of Michigan]] regent.&lt;ref name="Legalfund1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080327/METRO/803270391 |title=Mayor Kilpatrick to get legal defense funding |accessdate=2008-03-27 |last=Snell  |first=Robert |author2=Christine MacDonald |author3=Darren A. Nichols |date=2008-03-27 |work=detnews.com |publisher=The Detroit News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within 24 hours Greg Mathis had contacted the media to state that the reports of his support for Kilpatrick were not true.   Mathis stated: "I was contacted Wednesday afternoon [March 26, 2008] by Mayor Kilpatrick. He asked if I could serve on his legal defense committee. I informed him I support due process, but I could not support him.  This [false statement of Mathis' support] is the same type of deceit that has plunged our city into a deep crisis... Not only do I not support him, but I recommend he resign so the city can heal and move forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080327/NEWS01/80327037 |title=Mathis calls for mayor's resignation, refutes reports of support |accessdate=2008-03-27 |last=ELRICK |first=M.L. |date=2008-03-27 |work=freep.com |publisher=Detroit Free Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403141510/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080327%2FNEWS01%2F80327037 |archivedate=2008-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Mark Cooper''' is a senior research fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at the [[Vermont Law School]], and a frequent [[nuclear power]] industry commentator. Cooper holds a PhD from [[Yale University]] and is a former Yale University and [[Fulbright Fellow]]. He has provided expert testimony in over 250 cases for public interest clients before state and federal agencies, courts, and legislators in many jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada. Cooper has published many books and articles on energy, telecommunications and high technology industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermontlaw.edu/Academics/Environmental_Law_Center/Institutes_and_Initiatives/Institute_for_Energy_and_the_Environment/Overview/Institute_Staff.htm|title=Institute for Energy and the Environment|author=|date=|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111193350/http://www.vermontlaw.edu/Academics/Environmental_Law_Center/Institutes_and_Initiatives/Institute_for_Energy_and_the_Environment/Overview/Institute_Staff.htm|archivedate=2012-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cooper's 2011 report, ''Nuclear Safety and Nuclear Economics,'' says that past [[nuclear disaster]]s, such as the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]], have tended to "greatly raise regulatory barriers and have also severely multiplied the cost of reactor construction". After Three Mile Island, the report said, the cost of nuclear power plant construction doubled in most cases and trebled or quadrupled in some rare circumstances. He says that presently we are witnessing not a [[nuclear renaissance]] but a collapse in expectations for new nuclear reactor construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2011/12/a-new-study-released-today-said-that-theregulatory-fallout-from-the-fukushima-power-plantdisaster-in-japan-last-marchwill-pro.html |title=Report: U.S. nuclear renaissance unlikely after Fukushima |author= |date=December 28, 2011 |work=LA Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Fiji}}
The '''New Nationalist Party''' was a [[Fiji]]an [[List of political parties in Fiji|political party]] with a strongly [[nationalism|nationalist]] platform, arguing for the paramountcy of [[Fijians|indigenous Fijian]] interests and of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith, professed by the great majority of indigenous Fijians but relatively few [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], who comprise some [[Demographics of Fiji|38 percent]] of the country's population. The party, a splinter from the [[Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party]], was registered on 1 June 2001 and claimed to be the heir to the legacy of the late [[Sakeasi Butadroka]] and the [[Fiji Nationalist Party]].

In a surprise announcement on 20 January 2006, the party announced that it was dropping its demand for the repatriation of Indo-Fijians to [[India]]. Citizens of Indian descent would now be welcome to join the party, said party President [[Saula Telawa]], and to contest the [[Fijian general election, 2006|forthcoming election]] under its banner - provided that they were Christians. Aspiring candidates would need to submit references from a [[Ratu|Fijian chief]] and their local [[pastor]], to prove that they had been [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christians]] for a minimum period of three years, Telawa told the [[Fiji Sun]].

In January 2013 the military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties, requiring all parties to have at least 5,000 members. All existing parties had to re-register under the new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/8184406/Fiji-regime-cracks-down-on-political-parties |title=Fiji regime cracks down on political parties |publisher=Stuff |author=Michael Field |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was not one of the two to re-register,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/just-two-fiji-parties-apply-for-election-registration/1089060 |title=Just two Fiji parties apply for election registration |publisher=Radio Australia |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result was wound up and its assets forfeited to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=225235 |title=Forfeiture |publisher=Fiji Times |author=Tevita Vuibau |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Noemvriana''''' ({{lang-el|Νοεμβριανά}}, "November Events") of  {{OldStyleDate|December|1916|November}}, or the '''Greek Vespers''', was a political dispute which led to an armed confrontation in [[Athens]] between the [[monarchy|royal]]ist government of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and the forces of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] over the issue of Greece's neutrality during [[World War I]].

Friction existed between the two sides from the beginning of World War I. The unconditional surrender of the border fortress of [[Fort Rupel|Rupel]] in May 1916 to the [[Central Powers]]' forces, mainly composed of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] troops, was the first event that led to the Noemvriana. The Allies feared the possibility of a secret pact between the Greek royalist government and the Central Powers. Such an alliance would endanger the Allied army in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] bivouacking around [[Thessalonica]] since the end of 1915.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p361"/&gt; Intensive diplomatic negotiations between King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] and Allied diplomats took place throughout the summer. The king wanted Greece to maintain her neutrality, a position that would favor the Central Powers plans in the Balkans while the Allies wanted demobilization of the Greek army and the surrender of war [[materiel]] equivalent to what was lost at Fort Rupel as a guarantee of Greece's neutrality.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p368"/&gt; By the end of the summer of 1916, the failure of negotiations, along with the Bulgarian army's advance in eastern Macedonia and the Greek government's orders for the Greek army not to offer resistance, led to a military coup by [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] military officers in [[Thessaloniki]] with the support of the Allies. The former Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who from the very beginning supported the Allies, established a provisional government in northern Greece. He began forming an army to liberate areas lost to Bulgaria, but this effectively split Greece into two entities.&lt;ref name="Clogg2002p87"/&gt;

The inclusion of the Greek army along with Allied forces, as well as the division of Greece, sparked several anti-Allied demonstrations in Athens. In late October, a secret agreement was reached between the king and the Allied diplomats. The pressure from the military advisers forced the king to abandon this agreement. In an attempt to enforce their demands, the Allies landed a small contingent in Athens on {{OldStyleDate|1 December|1916|18 November}}. However, it met organized resistance and an armed confrontation took place until a compromise was reached at the end of the day. The day after the Allied contingent evacuated from Athens, a royalist mob began rioting throughout the city, targeting supporters of Venizelos. The rioting continued for three days, and the incident became known as the Noemvriana in Greece, which in the [[Old Style]] calendar occurred during the month of November. The incident drove a deep wedge between the Venizelists and the royalists, bringing closer what would become known as the [[National Schism]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, pp. 424-436&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Noemvriana, the Allies, determined to remove Constantine I, established a naval blockade to isolate areas which supported the king. After the resignation of the king on 15 June 1917, Greece unified under a new king, [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]], Constantine I's son, and the leadership of Eleftherios Venizelos. It [[Greece in World War I|joined World War I on the side of the Allies]]. By 1918, the mobilized Greek army provided the numerical superiority the Allies needed on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]]. The Allied army shortly thereafter defeated the Central Powers forces in the [[Balkans]], followed by the liberation of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and the conclusion of World War I.

==Background==
{{details|National Schism}}
[[File:Greek GHQ at Hadji-Beylik.jpg|250px|thumb|Constantine confers with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and members of the Greek General Staff prior to the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Conference of Bucharest]] that ended the [[Balkan Wars]].]]

Greece emerged victorious after the 1912-1913 [[Balkan Wars]], with her territory almost doubled.{{cref|i}} The unstable international political climate of the early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the [[Ottoman Empire]] which claimed them as their own. In the north, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], defeated in the [[Second Balkan War]], was engineering [[revanchist]] strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in [[Sarajevo]] precipitated [[Austria-Hungary]]'s declaration of war against Serbia. This caused [[German Empire|Germany]] and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the [[Triple Entente]]) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.&lt;ref name="NF3"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Theodorakis |first=Emanouil |author2=Manousakis George  |title=First World War 1914–1918 |publisher=National Foundation Research |year=2008 |url=http://www.venizelos-foundation.gr/endocs/bio14-18.jsp |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518233519/http://www.venizelos-foundation.gr/endocs/bio14-18.jsp |archivedate = 18 May 2007|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece, like Bulgaria, initially maintained neutrality during the conflict. The Greek leadership was divided between the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who supported [[British Empire|Great Britain]] on the side of the Allies and King Constantine who was educated in Germany and married to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm II|Kaiser]]'s [[Sophia of Prussia|sister]]. The king admired [[Prussia]]n militarism and was anticipating a quick German victory. The king wanted Greece to remain neutral in the conflict, a strategy favorable to Germany and the Central Powers.{{cref|ii}}&lt;ref name="NF3"/&gt;

In early 1915, Britain offered Greece "territorial concessions in [[Asia Minor]]" if it would participate in the upcoming [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. Venizelos supported this idea, while the king and his military advisers opposed it. Dismayed at the king's opposition, the prime minister resigned on 21 February 1915. A few months later, Venizelos' [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] won the [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|May elections]], and formed a new government. When Bulgaria mobilized against Serbia in September 1915, Venizelos ordered a Greek counter-mobilization and asked the Anglo-French army to defend [[Thessaloniki]] and aid Serbia. The Allies, led by General [[Maurice Sarrail]], began landing on 22 September 1915 and entrenched around the city. The Greek parliament gave Venizelos a vote of confidence to help Serbia, yet the king unconstitutionally dismissed the prime minister along with the parliament. This unlawful order escalated the animosity between the king and Venizelos as well as their loyal followers.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, 1921, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitromilides, 2006, pp. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals boycotted the [[Greek legislative election, December 1915|December elections]].

==Causes==

===Surrender of Fort Rupel===
[[File:Constantineiofgreece.jpg|right|thumb|200px|King Constantine I dressed as a German Field Marshal. His German sympathies caused him to favor a course of neutrality in the First World War.]]
On 9 May 1916, the Chief of the General Staff of the Central Powers, [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] informed Athens of the imminent advance of German-Bulgarian forces. In reply, Athens minimized the importance of General Sarrail's movements and requested Falkenhayn to change his strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 May, Falkenhayn guaranteed that the territorial integrity of Greece and the rights of its citizens would be respected. On 26 May, despite an official protest by the Greek government, 25,000 Bulgarian soldiers led by German cavalry invaded Greece. The Greek forces at [[Fort Rupel]] surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, pp. 356-7&lt;/ref&gt; The German Supreme Command was concerned about Allied General Sarrail's movements and Falkenhayn was ordered to occupy strategic positions inside Greek territory, specifically Fort Rupel.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assurances of Falkenhayn, Bulgarian soldiers immediately began to forcibly centralize the Greek population into large cities, namely [[Serres]], [[Drama, Greece|Drama]] and [[Kavala]]. German attempts to restrain Bulgarian territorial ambitions were partially successful, yet on 4 September, Kavala was occupied by the Bulgarian army.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions of Venizelos and the Allies===
The surrender of Fort Rupel caused the Allies to believe that the German-Bulgarian advance was a result of a secret agreement between Athens and the Central Powers, as they were assured that no Bulgarian force would invade Greek territory. The Allies saw this as a violation of Greek neutrality and a disturbance in the balance of power in the Balkans. The Allied press, especially in [[French Third Republic|France]], demanded swift military action against Greece to protect the Allied forces in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="Leon1974p361"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; For Venizelos and his supporters, the surrender of Fort Rupel signaled the loss of Greek Macedonia. On 29 May, Venizelos proposed to [[Francis Elliot|Sir Francis Elliot]] (senior British diplomat in Athens) and Jean Guillemin (senior French diplomat in Athens) that he and General [[Panagiotis Danglis]] should establish a provisional government in Thessaloniki to mobilize the Greek army to repel the Bulgarians. Venizelos pledged that the army would not move against the king and the royal family. According to Elliot's report, Venizelos hoped that the ''"success of his action and pressure of the public opinion might at the last moment convert His Majesty"''. The proposal had French support. However it met with strong opposition from [[British Empire|Britain]], forcing Venizelos to abandon the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June the Allies held a conference in London to examine the reasons behind the quick surrender of Fort Rupel and favored a complete demobilization of the Greek army and navy.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p368"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; King Constantine anticipated the results of the conference and ordered a partial demobilization on 8 June. The tension between the royal government and the Allies continued since 'anti-Allied activities' in Athens were ignored by the Greek Government. On 12–13 June, a mob destroyed Venizelist newspapers: ''Nea Ellas'', ''Patris'', ''[[Ethnos (newspaper)|Ethnos]]'', and ''[[Estia]]''. The mob proceeded to the British Embassy as police idly stood by without interfering.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This incident gave France the political ammunition to persuade Britain that more extreme measures were needed. On 17 June, the London conference decided ''"that it was absolutely necessary to do something to bring the king of Greece and his Government to their senses"''.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military coup of Thessaloniki===
{{details|Movement of National Defence}}
[[File:Triandria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The "Triumvirate of National Defence": (L-R) Admiral Kountouriotis, Venizelos, and General Danglis]]

On 27 August 1916, during a demonstration in Athens, Venizelos explained his disagreements with the king's policies. Venizelos said that the king became a victim of his advisers, whose aims were to destroy the goals of the [[Goudi Revolt|Goudi revolution]]. Additionally, Venizelos appealed to the king to pursue a policy of benevolence and true neutrality. Venizelos ended his speech by stating that "if this proposal does not lead to success then there are other means to protect the country from complete catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The king refused to accept any compromise including meeting with a committee sent by Venizelos.

Two days later, army officers loyal to Venizelos organized a military coup in Thessaloniki and proclaimed the "[[Movement of National Defence|Provisional Government of National Defence]]". Despite the support of the army, the provisional government was not officially recognized by Venizelos nor the Allied powers. Venizelos criticized this course of action, noting that without the support of the Allied army, the movement would fail immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 388-9&lt;/ref&gt; This further polarized the population between the [[Monarchism|royalists]] (also known as ''anti-Venizelists''), and [[Venizelist]]s. The newly founded separate "provisional state" included Northern Greece, [[Crete]] and the [[Aegean Islands]].&lt;ref name="Clogg2002p87"&gt;Clogg, 2002, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The "New Lands", won during the Balkan Wars, broadly supported Venizelos, while the "Old Greece" was mostly pro-royalist. Venizelos, Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]] and General [[Panagiotis Danglis]] formed a triumvirate provisional government and on 9 October moved to Thessaloniki to assume command of the National Defense. They directed Greek participation in the Allied war effort in direct conflict with the royal wishes in Athens.&lt;ref name="Kitromilides2008p124"&gt;Kitromilides, 2008, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; According to a British diplomat:

{{quote|Not only has Mr Venizelos' action put fresh spirit in its promoters here [Thessaloniki], but it has encouraged recruits to come forward from Macedonia where, as I have reported, very little enthusiasm had hitherto been manifested... The Committee of National Defence must now have at its disposal nearly twenty thousand men.&lt;ref name="Kitromilides2008p124"/&gt;}}

From the very beginnings, Venizelos continued his appeals to the king to join forces to jointly liberate Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Leon417"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos wrote:

{{quote| ...I think that the political orientation of the movement is very clear. We want to build an army in order to recover... the territories occupied by our hatred enemy and fulfill our treaty obligations to Serbia, and thus removing the stigma from the face our nation. After this, and naturally when the war is over, we shall request the convocation of a [national] assembly, not to change the structure of the state, or the dynasty, or restrict the prerogatives of the Crown as stipulated in the constitution, but in order to explain, elucidate, and safeguard these prerogatives as much as possible so that no king in the future will tell the representatives of the popular sovereignty that in the great national questions he was right to disregard the popular will and to impose his own views because he considers himself responsible before God.&lt;ref name="Leon417"/&gt; }}

Venizelos' moderation did not convince many citizens, even among his own followers. It was only after the end of 1916 and the "Noemvriana" that he pushed for a radical solution to end the stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constantine–Bénazet agreement==
[[File:Paul Bénazet 1913.jpg|thumb|right|200px| French politician [[Paul Bénazet]].]]

After the creation of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p422"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from [[Thessaly]]. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p422"/&gt;

On 3 November, Vice-admiral [[Louis Dartige du Fournet|du Fournet]], commander-in-chief of the allied Mediterrean fleet, used the sinking of two Greek merchant ships by a German submarine, as well as the secret agreement, to demand the surrender of the docked Greek war ships and took command of the [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] naval arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek government yielded, and on 7 November,&lt;ref name="Leon, 1974, p. 428"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; the partial disarmament of Greek warships began. The Allies towed away 30 lighter craft.&lt;ref&gt;Markezinis, 1968, p. 4/175&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later the French took over the Salamis naval base completely, and began using Greek ships operated by French crews.&lt;ref&gt;Fotakis, 2005, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burg, 1998, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, 2008, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constantine–Bénazet agreement was short-lived due to Venizelos' military plans as well as pressure exerted by the military in Athens, led by the king, regarding the forced Greek disarmament.&lt;ref name="Leon, 1974, p. 424"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos' action at Katerini met with some disapproval among the Allied circles and among his own associates in Athens. Answering these criticisms Venizelos wrote to A. Diamandidis:

{{quote| I am certainly very sorry that our advance to Katerini has caused displeasure among the foreigners [the Allies] and criticism among our friends there. But our friends should allow me to say that they are suffering of incurable conservatism, which, had it influenced us, would have rapidly succeeded to stifle our movement due to lack of life. For the foreigners, whose friendly feelings I do not doubt, it is natural to think only of their own difficulties and to ignore ours.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Venizelist advance was not an attempt to undermine the king's pact with Bénazet, since it had been planned long before that. The failure of the secret agreement was caused by subversive activities within segments of the royalist government in Athens to paralyze and disrupt the Thessaloniki provisional government.&lt;ref name="Leon, 1974, p. 424"/&gt;

==Last diplomatic efforts before the events==
The seizure of Greek ships by the Allies, the Katerini incident and the Franco-British violations{{cref|iii}} of Greece's territorial integrity offended the national honor of a segment of "Old Greece" and increased the king's popularity.&lt;ref name="Kitromilides2008p124"/&gt; The king refused to honor his secret agreement with Bénazet and soldiers who requested to fight against the Bulgarian occupation were charged with ''"desertion to the rebels"''.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; A growing movement amongst the low rank officers within the army, led by [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and [[Sofoklis Dousmanis]], were determined to oppose disarmament and any assistance to the Allies.&lt;ref name="Leon, 1974, p. 428"/&gt;

[[File:Louis Dartige du Fournet 1915.jpg|thumb|right|200px| French vice-admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet.]]
Diplomacy failed despite continuing pressure applied by the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender of at least ten Greek mountain artillery batteries.&lt;ref name=Leon1974p434&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Du Fournet was instructed not to use force to take possession of the batteries.&lt;ref name=Leon1974p434/&gt; The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece.&lt;ref name=Leon1974p434/&gt; The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.&lt;ref name=Leon1974p435&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the gravity of the situation, both the royalist government and the Allies made no serious effort to reach a diplomatic solution. On 29 November, the royalist government rejected the proposal of the Allies and armed resistance was organized. By 30 November military units and royalist militia (the ''epistratoi'', "reservists") from surrounding areas had been recalled and gathered in and around Athens (in total over 20,000 men&lt;ref&gt;Chester, 1921, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, 1920, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ion, 1918, pp. 796-812&lt;/ref&gt;) and occupied strategic positions, with orders not to fire unless fired upon.&lt;ref name=Leon1974p435 /&gt; The Allied commanders failed in their assessment of the situation, disregarding Greek national pride and determination, causing them to conclude that the Greeks were bluffing. The Allies thought that in the face of a superior force, Greeks would ''"bring the cannons on a plater"'' (surrender); a viewpoint that Du Fournet also shared.&lt;ref name=Leon1974p435 /&gt;

===The battle of Athens: 1916===
[[File:162 9 le Mirabeau bombarde Ahènes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[French battleship Mirabeau]] bombarding Athens during the November events.]]
[[File:French troops in Athens, 1916.png|thumb|right|200px|French troops in Athens, with the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in the background, during the ''Noemvriana''.]]
[[File:French artillery in Athens, 1917.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|French troops with machine guns in Athens.]]
On early morning of {{OldStyleDate|1 December|1916|18 November}} the Allies landed a 3,000&lt;ref name="Abbot, 1922, p. 159"&gt;Abbot, 1922, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;-strong [[Marines (military)|marine]] force in [[Piraeus]], and headed towards Athens.&lt;ref name="KitromilidesNoemvriana"&gt;Kitromilides, 2006, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Markezinis"&gt;Markezinis, 1968, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; When the Allied troops reached their designated positions, they found them already occupied by Greek troops. For more than two hours both sides stood facing each other. Some time in the morning, an unknown origin rifle shot was fired and the battle of Athens began.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p436"/&gt; Each side blamed the other for firing first. Once the battle spread throughout the city, the king requested a ceasefire proposing a solution and reach a compromise. Du Fournet, with a small contingent of troops was unprepared to encounter organized Greek resistance, and was already short of supplies, so readily accepted the king's compromise. However, before an agreement was finalized, the battle resumed. The Greek battery from Arditos Hill fired a number of rounds at the entrance of [[Zappeion]] where the French admiral had established his headquarters. The Allied squadron from [[Phaliron]] responded by bombarding sections of the city, mostly around the [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Stadium]] and near the Palace.&lt;ref name="Abbot, 1922, p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon1974p436"/&gt;  Discussions soon were resumed and a final compromise was reached. The king compromised to surrender just six artillery batteries camouflaged in the mountains instead of the ten that the Allied Admiral demanded.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p436"&gt;Leon, 1974, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abbot, 1922, p. 160"&gt;Abbot, 1922, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; By late afternoon the battle was finished. The Allies had suffered 194 casualties, dead and wounded, and the Greeks lost 82, not counting civilians.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p436"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clogg2002p89"&gt;Clogg, 2002, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; By early morning of 2 December, all Allied forces had been evacuated.&lt;ref name="Leon1974p436"/&gt;

The role of the Venizelists during the battle has been intensely contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units.&lt;ref name="Abbot, 1922, p. 159"/&gt; Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report that he had been involved in a civil war.&lt;ref name="Abbot"/&gt; The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens.&lt;ref name= "Abbot"&gt;Abbot, 1922, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: [[Pavlos Karolidis]], a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.&lt;ref name="Karol"&gt;Karolidis, 1925, VI, 248&amp;ndash;249&lt;/ref&gt;

===The following days===
The authorities, with the pretext of the events, claimed that the Venelizelists had staged an insurrection with the support of Allied troops and proceeded with the help of the Reservists to extensive arrests and reprisals against the city's Venizelists. The entire operation was led by two generals of the army; troops of the military district of Athens took orders from General K. Kallaris and the soldiers of the active defense were commanded by General A. Papoulas (later commander-in-chief of the Asia Minor expedition).&lt;ref&gt;Koliopoulos, 2009, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The terror and destruction that followed soon went out of hand, making even the respectable conservative newspaper Politiki Epitheorisis ({{lang-el|Πολιτική Επιθεώρηση}}, Political Review) that at the beginning urged Greek ''"justice"'' to ''"smite mercifully the atrocious conspiracy"'' and to purge all followers of the ''"archconspirator of Salonika [Venizelos]"'', in the end to urge ''"prudence"''.&lt;ref name="Leonp436"&gt;Leon, 1974, pp. 436-7&lt;/ref&gt; During the following three days houses and shops of Venizelists were ransacked and 35 people were murdered.&lt;ref name="KathimeriniNoemvriana"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_363302_18/11/2006_205791 | title=Tα ξεχασμένα Νοεμβριανά | work=[[Kathimerini]] | date=18 November 2006 | accessdate=18 August 2009 | language=Greek | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720234329/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_363302_18/11/2006_205791 | archivedate=20 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chester says that most of those who were murdered were refugees from Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, 1921, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Many hundreds were imprisoned and kept in solitary confinement. Karolidis characterizes the imprisonment of certain prominent Venizelists, such as [[Emmanuel Benakis]] (mayor of Athens), as a disgrace.&lt;ref name="Karol" /&gt; Some authors argue that Benakis was not only arrested and imprisoned but also disrespected and ill-treated.&lt;ref name="Leonp436"/&gt; Seligman describes that they were only released 45 days later after a strong demand contained within the Entente ultimatum, which was accepted on 16 January.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, 1920, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Opposing reports also exist, e.g. Abbot asserts that during the evacuation of the Allied forces, many "criminals" and "collaborators" on the payrolls of different Allied spy agencies slipped out of Athens at night after allegedly "terrorizing the city for nearly a year".&lt;ref name="Abbot, 1922, p. 160"/&gt; Due to his failure Vice-admiral Dartige du Fournet was relieved of his command.&lt;ref&gt;Markezinis, 1968, p. 4/179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In Greece, this incident became known as Noemvriana (November events), using the Old Style calendar, and marked the culmination of the National Schism.

===Political situation in Greece and Europe===

[[File:Venizelos WWI 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Venizelos reviews a section of the Greek army on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] in 1918. He is accompanied by Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]] (left) and General [[Maurice Sarrail]] (right).]]

On {{OldStyleDate|2 December|1916|19 November}}, Britain and France officially recognized Venizelos government as the only lawful government of Greece, effectively splitting the country.&lt;ref&gt;Burg, 1998, pp. 145-6&lt;/ref&gt; On {{OldStyleDate|7 December|1916|24 November}}, Venizelos' government officially declared war on the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikotes, 1998 p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burg, 1998, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainwhile in Athens Constantine praised his generals. There were also in circulation various pro-royalist and religious brochures calling Venizelos "traitor" and "Senegalese goat". A royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was issued and the [[Archbishop of Athens]], pressured by the royal house,&lt;ref&gt;Kitromilides, 2006, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; [[anathema]]tised the prime minister&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, 2004, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; (a special ceremony with the crowd throwing stones to an effigy of Venizelos).

In France, the premiership of [[Aristide Briand]], a leading proponent of engaging with Constantine to bring about a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, 1998, pp. 110-113&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] and foreign minister [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] resigned and were replaced by [[Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Balfour]]. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known [[Philhellenism|Hellenophile]], an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the [[Eastern Question]].&lt;ref name="Clogg2002p89"&gt;Clogg, 2002, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the [[Romanov]]s in Russia (who refused the French proposals for Constantine's removal from the throne), caused France and Great Britain to take more drastic measures against King Constantine. In June they decided to invoke their obligation as ''"protecting powers"'' and demanded the king's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, 1920, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Jonnart]] said to Constantine: "The Germans burned by native town, [[Arras]]. I will not hesitate to burn Athens". Constantine accepted and on 15 June 1917 went into exile. His son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]], who was considered to have Allies sympathies, became the new King of Greece instead of Constantine's elder son and crown prince, [[George II of Greece|George]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester, 1921, pp. 295–304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TA1"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764941-2,00.html Land of Invasion], [[Time (magazine)|TIME]], 4 Nov 1940&lt;/ref&gt; The king's exile was followed by the deportation of many prominent royalist officers and politicians considered pro-Germans, such as [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and [[Dimitrios Gounaris]], to France and Italy.

The course of events paved the way for Venizelos to return to Athens on 29 May 1917. Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies. The entire Greek army was mobilized (though tensions remained inside the army between supporters of the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|Constantine]] and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the [[Central Powers]] on the Macedonian front.

===The Macedonian front===

{{details|Macedonian front (World War I)}}

By the fall of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest component of the Allied army on the Macedonian front.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, 1921, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance between the two sides on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]]. After the first serious battle (see [[Battle of Skra-di-Legen|battle of Skra]]) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the [[Armistice with Bulgaria (World War I)|armistice]] with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian forces]]. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece a seat at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] under Venizelos.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, 1921, pp. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
{{Cnote|i|Greece had doubled its territory by gaining most of Macedonia, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Crete]] and the rest of the [[Aegean islands]].}}
{{Cnote|ii|Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were on the same side with Germany and with the occupation of Serbia it made Greece the only other country in the Balkans. If Greece remained neutral, Germany and Austria would have a secure connection with [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] and the lands of the Middle East.}}
{{Cnote|iii|The most pronounced violation was when the Allies occupied the island of [[Corfu]] and used it as a base to gather the remains of the Serbian army. The Allies informed Athens of their intention a few hours before the first ships reached the island.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, 1974, pp. 315-6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">'''Operation Colombo''' was an operation undertaken by the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] (the [[Chile]]an [[secret police]]) in 1975 to make political dissidents [[Forced disappearance|disappear]]. At least 119 people are alleged to have been abducted and later killed.  The magazines published a list of 119 dead political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/05/26/chile.operation.colombo/index.html] CNN World article, August, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these fake magazines, titled ''LEA'', was published by Codex Editorial, a dependent of the Argentine Ministry of Welfare, directed by [[José López Rega]], counselor of [[Isabel Perón]] and founder of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]] death squad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/chile/libros/119/cap7.html La Gran Mentira - El caso de las "Listas de los 119" (capitulo 7)], published by [[Equipo Nizkor]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Augusto Pinochet ==
Chile's former military ruler, [[Augusto Pinochet]], was placed under [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|house arrest]] in connection with the kidnapping of at least three dissidents by his security services.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} 

Judge [[Juan Guzmán Tapia]] asked the Chilean justice to lift Pinochet's [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] after having accumulated proof that he had ordered the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] to undertake this operation.

In September 2005, the Chilean Supreme Court decided to lift Pinochet's immunity on this case, charging judge [[Victor Montiglio]] of the investigations. In November 2005, prosecutors said that specialists appointed by the court in the Operation Colombo case had concluded that while he suffered from mild dementia, he was fit enough to stand trial. On this occasion, Pinochet met DINA head [[Manuel Contreras]], who held him as responsible of the DINA and, therefore, of operation Colombo, for which both men may be jailed.{{Confusing|in doubt|date=February 2009}} [[Raúl Iturriaga]], the vice-director of the DINA, has also been indicted in this case.

In December 2005 it was found that Pinochet was found fit to stand trial. However Pinochet died December 10, 2006, without being judged.

The '''Oregon and California Railroad Revested Lands''' (commonly known as '''O&amp;C Lands'''), are approximately {{convert|2600000|acres|ha}} of land located in eighteen counties of western Oregon. Originally granted to the [[Oregon &amp; California Railroad]] to build a railroad between [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[San Francisco, California]], the land was reconveyed to the United States government by act of Congress in 1916 and is currently managed by the United States [[Bureau of Land Management]].

Since 1916, the 18 counties where the O&amp;C lands are located have received payments from the United States government at 50% share of timber revenue on those lands. Later as compensation for the loss of timber and tax revenue decreased the government added federal revenues. The governments of several of the counties have come to depend upon the O&amp;C land revenue as an important source of income for schools and county services.

The most recent source of income from the lands, an extension of the [[Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000]], was last renewed in 2013 but at vastly reduced spending levels, leaving some counties scrambling to find new sources of funding. In late 2013, the [[United States House of Representatives]] was considering a bill that would resume the funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to the counties.&lt;ref name=mapes&gt;{{cite news

==Origin==
As part of the U.S. government's desire to foster settlement and economic development in the western states, in July 1866, Congress passed the Oregon and California Railroad Act. This act made {{convert|3700000|acres}} of land available for any company that built a railroad from [[Portland, Oregon]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The land was to be distributed by the state of [[Oregon]] in {{convert|12800|acres|adj=on}} [[land grant]]s for each mile of track completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|39|242|14|239|1866|07|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ochistory&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two companies, both of which named themselves the [[Oregon Central Railroad]], began a competition to build the railroad, one on the west side of the [[Willamette River]] and one on the east side. The two lines would eventually merge and reorganize as the [[Oregon and California Railroad]].&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt; In 1869, Congress changed how the grants were to be distributed, requiring the railroads to sell land along the line to settlers in {{convert|160|acres|adj=on}} parcels at $2.50 per acre.&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt; The land was distributed in a [[Checkerboarding (land)|checkerboard pattern]], with [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]] laid out for {{convert|20|mi|km}} on either side of the rail corridor with the government retaining the alternate sections for future growth.&lt;ref name=oregonwild&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Logging, 1910 from Centennial History of Oregon.png|thumb|left|Logging in Oregon, 1910]]
By 1872, the railroad had extended from Portland to [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]].&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt; Along the way, it created growth in [[Willamette Valley]] towns such as [[Canby, Oregon|Canby]], [[Aurora, Oregon|Aurora]], and [[Harrisburg, Oregon|Harrisburg]], which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to the part of the river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel.&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt; As the railroad made its way into the [[Umpqua River|Umpqua Valley]], new townsites such as [[Drain, Oregon|Drain]], [[Oakland, Oregon|Oakland]], and [[Yoncalla, Oregon|Yoncalla]] were laid out.&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt;

==Land fraud==
{{main article|Oregon land fraud scandal}}
Perhaps the most significant aspect of the railroad was that it provided access to Oregon's vast forests for large-scale logging operations.&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt;  But despite the large number of grants, it was difficult to sell to actual settlers because much of the land was not only heavily forested (chiefly in [[Douglas-fir]] and [[Tsuga heterophylla|Western Hemlock]]), but rugged and remote; moreover, the railroads soon realized that the land was much more valuable if sold in larger plots to developers and timber companies.&lt;ref name=tallmadge&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some individuals posed as settlers to purchase the land at the $2.50 per acre rate and then promptly deeded them back to the railroad, which amassed the smaller plots into larger ones and resold them at a higher price to timber interests.&lt;ref name=tallmadge/&gt;

A scheme to circumvent the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named [[Stephen A. Douglas Puter]] to round up people from Portland saloons, and then take them to the land office where they would register for an O&amp;C parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite book

==Revestiture of lands==
[[File:BLM Oregon forestry.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bureau of Land Management]] now manages timber on more than 2 million acres of land in Oregon that formerly belonged to the O&amp;C Railroad]]As the land fraud trials reached their conclusion, attention also turned to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (which had acquired the O&amp;C in 1887). Not only had the company violated the terms of the grant agreement, but in 1903, declared it was terminating land sales—in violation of the grant agreement—either as a hedge against future increases in land values or to retain the timber profits for itself.&lt;ref name=tallmadge/&gt;&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;&lt;ref name=ohs&gt;{{cite web| title =Oregon and California Railroad| work =Oregon History Project| url =http://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/oregon-and-california-railroad/| accessdate =June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of lawsuits between the State of Oregon, the United States government, and the railroads ensued. Another lawsuit was brought by Portland attorney and future U.S. Representative [[Walter Lafferty]] on behalf of 18 western Oregon counties, which sued to claim revenue from timber sales on the O&amp;C lands.&lt;ref name=lafferty&gt;{{cite news|title=Land Battle Climax of Lafferty Career|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=1964-01-16|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cases worked their way up to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which ruled in 1915 in ''[[Oregon &amp; California R. Co. v. United States]]'' that despite the violation of grant terms, the railroad had been built and the railroad company should be compensated. In 1916, Congress passed the [[Chamberlain–Ferris Act]], which revested the remaining 2,800,000 acres of land to the United States government, and compensated the railroad at $2.50 per acre from an account, the Oregon and California land grant fund, funded by timber sales from the land. Oregon counties affected by the revestiture of land were also to be compensated from the fund.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source

The Chamberlain–Ferris Act did not ease the financial trouble faced by many of the O&amp;C counties; very little timber revenue was actually generated from the land, and many counties now had large percentages of their land owned by the federal government, denying them a source of property tax revenue.&lt;ref name=tallmadge/&gt;&lt;ref name=aocc&gt;{{cite web

==The O&amp;C Act==
[[File:Oandc-rac.jpg|thumb|right|Sign indicating O&amp;C lands near [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]]]]In 1937, Congress again sought to ensure federal funding for the 18 O&amp;C counties. The '''Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937''' ({{usc|43|1181f}}), commonly referred as the '''O&amp;C Act''', directed the [[United States Department of the Interior]] to harvest timber from the O&amp;C lands (as well as the [[Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands]]) on a [[sustained yield]] basis.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;&lt;ref name=aocc/&gt; The legislation returned 50 percent of timber sales receipts to the counties, and 25 percent to the U.S. Treasury to reimburse the federal government for payments made to the counties prior to establishment of the Act.&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt; The law specifically provided that the lands be managed, including reforestation and protection of watershed, to ensure a permanent source of timber, and therefore, revenue to the counties.&lt;ref name=blm&gt;{{cite web

|title=O&amp;C Lands Act of 1937
|publisher=Bureau of Land Management
|accessdate=March 6, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the O&amp;C Act, the Department of the Interior under its [[General Land Office]] and later succeeded by the [[Bureau of Land Management]], managed more than 44 billion board feet of standing inventory in 1937 into more than 60 billion board feet by the mid-1990s, and harvested more than 44 billion board feet over that time period.&lt;ref name=aocc/&gt; In 1951, the U.S. Treasury had been fully reimbursed, and the 25 percent of the revenue that had previously gone to the Treasury now reverted to the counties; in 1953, the counties opted to divert that money to maintenance of the land and roads, reforestation, as well as recreational facilities and other improvements.&lt;ref name=ochistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=tallmadge/&gt;&lt;ref name=aocc2&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1970 [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] report contained an estimate that from its implementation through 1969, the counties had received a total of $300 million as a result of the Act.&lt;ref name=gao&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the report also estimated that most counties received more from the government payments than they would have if the land had been held privately.&lt;ref name=gao/&gt;

The O&amp;C Act achieved what the previous legislation had failed to do: provide a stable revenue to the counties. This revenue became a vital part of the budgets of the O&amp;C counties, paying for county-provided services such as law enforcement and corrections and health and social services.&lt;ref name=aocc2/&gt; With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments. For example, the property tax in [[Curry County, Oregon|Curry County]] is 60 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, far below the state average of $2.81 per $1000.&lt;ref name=scramble&gt;{{cite news

==Decline in timber revenue and revised Congressional action==
In 1989, annual timber harvest revenue on federal forest land nationwide peaked at $1.5 billion.&lt;ref name=usfs&gt;{{cite web

|date=October 2008

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that year, the impact of overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O&amp;C lands.&lt;ref name=tallmadge/&gt; In 1994, the federal [[Northwest Forest Plan]] was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting [[old-growth forest]] habitat for endangered species such as the [[Northern spotted owl]], the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell to a third of the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.&lt;ref name=tallmadge/&gt;&lt;ref name=usfs/&gt;

To offset the effects of the loss of timber revenue, in 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] proposed a 10-year program of payments, set at 85 percent of the average O&amp;C Act payments from 1986 to 1990, and declining 3 percent annually.&lt;ref name=gorte&gt;{{cite web

With the payments set to expire in 2003, work began in 1999 to seek an extension to the payments. The O&amp;C counties joined with other rural counties (including 15 of Oregon's other 18 counties) that also faced falling timber revenues to lobby Congress for another solution.&lt;ref name=aocc/&gt; In 2000, Congress passed the [[Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000|Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act]] ({{USPL|106|393}}), which authorizes western counties, including the O&amp;C counties, to receive federal payments to compensate for loss of timber revenue until 2006. Payments to O&amp;C counties, which included O&amp;C revenue as well as revenue on [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] land, averaged about $250 million per year from 2000 to 2006.&lt;ref name=gorte/&gt;&lt;ref name=forestpayment&gt;{{cite news

The '''Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003''' ({{USStatute|108|105|117|1201|2003|11|05}}, {{USC|18|1531}},&lt;ref name="act"&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/partial_birth_abortion_Ban_act_final_language.htm Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed by Both House and Senate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081129195414/http://www.nrlc.org//abortion/pba/partial_birth_abortion_Ban_act_final_language.htm |date=2008-11-29 }} ''(HTML)''; * [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h760rh.txt.pdf same], from the [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]] ''(PDF)''&lt;/ref&gt; '''PBA Ban''') is a [[Law of the United States|United States law]] prohibiting a form of [[late termination of pregnancy]] called "[[Intact dilation and extraction#Partial-birth abortion|partial-birth abortion]]," referred to in medical literature by as [[intact dilation and extraction]].&lt;ref name="gonzales"&gt;''Gonzales v. Carhart'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=05-380 550 U.S. 124 (2007)]. Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-04-19. ("The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D&amp;E variation. It has been referred to as 'intact D&amp;E,' 'dilation and extraction' (D&amp;X), and 'intact D&amp;X' ....For discussion purposes this D&amp;E variation will be referred to as intact D&amp;E....A straightforward reading of the Act's text demonstrates its purpose and the scope of its provisions: It regulates and proscribes, with exceptions or qualifications to be discussed, performing the intact D&amp;E procedure.")&lt;/ref&gt; Under this law, any physician "who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both." The law was enacted in 2003, and in 2007 its constitutionality was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.

==Provisions==
This statute prohibits a method of [[abortion in the United States|abortion]]; the statute calls the prohibited method "partial birth abortion." The procedure described in the statute is usually used in the second trimester,&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=914 ''Stenberg v. Carhart''], 530 U.S. 914 (2000), in which the Court stated: "In sum, using this law some present prosecutors and future Attorneys General may choose to pursue physicians who use D&amp;E procedures, the most commonly used method for performing '''''previability second trimester abortions'''''."&lt;/ref&gt; from 15 to 26 weeks of which occur before [[Fetus#Viability|viability]]. The law itself contains no reference to gestational age or viability. The present statute is directed only at a method of [[abortion]], rather than at preventing any woman from obtaining an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=914 ''Stenberg v. Carhart''], 530 U.S. 914 (2000), in which Justice Ginsburg stated in concurrence: "As the Court observes, this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute includes two findings of Congress:{{quote|(1) A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion... is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.

(2) Rather than being an abortion procedure that is embraced by the medical community, particularly among physicians who routinely perform other abortion procedures, partial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is not only unnecessary to preserve the health of the mother, but in fact poses serious risks to the long-term health of women and in some circumstances, their lives. As a result, at least 27 States banned the procedure as did the United States Congress which voted to ban the procedure during the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses.}}

The statute also provides that:

{{quote|A defendant accused of an offense under this section may seek a hearing before the State Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother whose life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.}}

[[Hadley Arkes]] commented, in an editorial in the ''[[National Review]]'', "[t]hat provision went even further than the law was obliged to go, for as the American Medical Association testified during the hearings, a partial-birth abortion bore no relevance to any measure needed to advance the health of any woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hadley Arkes]], [http://www.nationalreview.com/arkes/arkes200410131241.asp Talking Partial-Birth Abortion], National Review (October 13, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the Supreme Court case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' (1973), some pro-life supporters have asserted that the word "health" would render any legal restriction meaningless, because of the broad and vague interpretation of "health".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clsnet.org/clrfPages/amicus/2006/AmicusPBAbortionCase.pdf Amicus Brief of Christian Legal Society] in [[Gonzales v. Carhart|Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood]] (2006-08-03).&lt;/ref&gt; This was of particular concern when it came to anticipated arguments that such a definition would encompass "mental health", which some thought would inevitably be expanded by court decisions to include the prevention of depression or other non-physical conditions. [[Pro-choice]] groups object to this statute primarily because there is no exemption if the health of a woman is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pba7.htm D&amp;X / PBA PROCEDURES: Reactions to the 2003 federal law.]" ''ReligiousTolerance.org'' Retrieved April 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partial-birth abortion defined by law ==

The phrase partial-birth abortion was first coined by Douglas Johnson of the [[National Right to Life Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5168163 'Partial-Birth Abortion:' Separating Fact from Spin]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been used in numerous state and federal bills and laws, although the legal definition of the term is not always the same. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act defines "partial-birth abortion" as follows:

{{quote|An [[abortion]] in which the person performing the abortion, deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the [[navel]] is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an [[overt act]] that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus. (18 U.S. Code 1531)}}

In the 2000 Supreme Court case of ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', a Nebraska law banning partial-birth abortion was ruled unconstitutional, in part because the language defining "partial-birth abortion" was deemed vague.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051128182129/http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/abortionbans/12669res20040326.html Abortion Bans: Myths and Facts]. American Civil Liberties Union. Accessed April 14, 2006. &lt;br /&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-us-cite?530+914 Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Supreme Court in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' found that the 2003 act "departs in material ways" from the Nebraska law and that it pertains only to a specific abortion procedure, [[intact dilation and extraction]].&lt;ref name="gonzales" /&gt; Some commentators have noted that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act's language was carefully crafted to take into account previous rulings.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20031108-111532-9290r.htm Defending the Innocent]" ''Washington Times'' 2003. Retrieved May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in most cases the procedure legally defined as "partial birth abortion" would be medically defined as "intact dilation and extraction", these overlapping terms do not always coincide. For example, the IDX procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g. due to a [[miscarriage]] or [[feticide]]) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction.&lt;ref name="extract"&gt;''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=05-380 550 U.S. ____ (2007)]. Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-04-30. ("If the intact D&amp;E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.")&lt;/ref&gt; Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of "partial-birth abortion," which specifies that partial live delivery must precede "the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1531- U.S. Code, Title 18, Part I, Chapter 74, Section 1531], "Partial-birth abortions prohibited."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a doctor may extract a fetus past the navel and then "disarticulate [i.e. decapitate] at the neck", which could fall within the terms of the statute even though it would not result in an intact body and therefore would not be an intact dilation and extraction.&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;Gorney, Cynthia.

==Legislative and judicial history==
[[File:Signing the Partial-Birth Abortion ban.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[George W. Bush]] signing the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, surrounded by members of Congress]]
The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led Congress first passed similar laws banning [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995|partial-birth abortion in December 1995]], and again October 1997, but they were vetoed by President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5168163 'Partial-Birth Abortion:' Separating Fact from Spin: NPR&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], the final legislation was supported in 2003 by 218 Republicans and 63 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. It was opposed by 4 Republicans, 137 Democrats, and 1 independent. Twelve members were absent, 7 Republicans and 5 Democrats.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll530.xml House Roll Call No. 530], (2003-10-02).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States Senate|Senate]] the bill was supported by 47 Republicans and 17 Democrats. It was opposed by 3 Republicans, 30 Democrats, and 1 independent.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00402 Senate Roll Call No. 402] (2003-10-21).&lt;/ref&gt; Two Senators were absent, [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] (R-TX), a supporter of the bill, and [[John Edwards]] (D-NC), an opponent of the bill.

The only substantive difference between the House and Senate versions was the [[Tom Harkin|Harkin]] Amendment expressing support for ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00048 Senate Roll Call on Harkin Amendment].&lt;/ref&gt; A House–Senate conference committee deleted the Harkin Amendment, which therefore is absent from the final legislation.&lt;ref name="act" /&gt; On November 5, 2003, after being passed by both the House and the Senate, the bill was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] to become law.

The constitutionality of the law was challenged immediately after the signing. Three different [[United States district court|U.S. district courts]] declared the law unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/abortion/ppash60104ord.pdf ''[[Planned Parenthood]] v.

The federal government appealed the district court rulings, which were then affirmed by three courts of appeals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/8th/043379p.pdf ''Gonzales v.

On April 18, 2007 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in a 5–4 decision, ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', held that the statute does not violate the Constitution. Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote for the majority which included Justices [[Samuel Alito]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Antonin Scalia]], and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]]. Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote the dissent which was joined by [[Stephen Breyer]], [[David Souter]], and [[John Paul Stevens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/ap_on_go_su_co/scotus_abortion_9 Yahoo! News], 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's majority opinion argued that the case differed from ''Stenberg v. Carhart'', a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion as unconstitutional, in that the Partial Birth Abortion Act defined the banned procedure more clearly. In dissent, Ginsburg argued that the decision departed from established abortion jurisprudence, and that lack of a health exception "jeopardizes women’s health and places doctors in an untenable position." The replacement of O'Connor by Alito was identified as a key difference between the 5–4 decision against the Nebraska law in ''Stenberg'' and the 5-4 support for the abortion ban in ''Gonzales''.&lt;ref name="nyt-greenhouse"&gt;{{cite news | title = Justices Back Ban on Method of Abortion | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | work = [[New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html | date = April 19, 2007 | accessdate = August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
{{see also|Abortion in the United States#Public opinion|l1=U.S. polls on abortion}}

A [[Rasmussen Reports]] poll four days after the court's decision found that 40% of respondents "knew the ruling allowed states to place some restrictions on specific abortion procedures." Of those who knew of the decision, 56% agreed with the decision and 32% were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2007/April%20Dailies/partialBirthAbortion.htm Most Who Know of Decision Agree With Supreme Court on Partial Birth Abortion] ''Rasmussen Reports''. April 22, 2007. Retrieved on April 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An ABC poll from 2003 found that 62% of respondents thought partial-birth abortion should be illegal; a similar number of respondents wanted an exception "if it would prevent a serious threat to the woman's health." Additional polls from 2003 found between 47–70% in favor of banning partial-birth abortions and between 25–40% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm Abortion and Birth Control]. ''PollingReports.com'' Retrieved April 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical response==
In response to this statute, many abortion providers have adopted the practice of [[Feticide#Use during legal abortion|inducing fetal demise]] before beginning late-term abortions. Typically, a solution of potassium chloride or digoxin is injected directly into the fetal heart using ultrasound to guide the needle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.societyfp.org/_documents/resources/InductionofFetalDemise.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Warren M.|title=Did I violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2003/10/did_i_violate_the_partialbirth_abortion_ban.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=slate.com|date=22 Oct 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often done by providers who do not perform intact dilation and extraction procedures (as well as by those who do) because they feel the broad wording of the ban compels them "to do all they can to protect themselves and their staff from the possibility of being accused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |title=Shots assist in aborting fetuses |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2007-08-10 |url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/women/articles/2007/08/10/shots_assist_in_aborting_fetuses/?page=1 |accessdate=2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Putaani Party''''' ([[Kannada]]: ಪುಟಾಣಿ ಪಾರ್ಟಿ, [[English language|English]]: The Kid Gang) is a 2009 [[Kannada language]] [[feature film]]. Produced by [[Children's Film Society, India]], the film was shot in a village called Honnapura situated near the town of [[Dharwad]] in [[South India]]. The film uses local actors, most of them first timers who are new to the medium of films. The film has a particular dialect of [[Kannada]] that is spoken by a few in that part of [[India]].

This film has been scripted and directed by [[Ramchandra PN]], a graduate of the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], [[Pune]]. His earlier film ''[[Suddha (film)|Suddha]]'' had won the best Indian film at the Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian Films, [[New Delhi]], 2007. ''Putaani Party'' is his second feature film and his first in [[Kannada]] language.

==Plot==
[[File:Mcrowd.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Children in action]]
A [[Gram Panchayat]] (village governing body) in rural [[India]] facilitates the functioning of the Makkala Samiti (Children’s Committee) – a children’s body elected by the children themselves.

The committee acts as a pressure group in trying to get the [[local governance]] react to various social issues that it raises. Guided by a sympathetic school teacher, the children’s honesty and persistency ruffles many feathers among the adults, some of whom have been using the ‘Makkala Samiti’ for their own needs.

What follows is a subtle cat and mouse game, by the end of which the children hope to get their voice heard.

The film subtly speaks about the [[Children's rights]] to [[self governance]] and the pathetic attitude we adults have towards this issue.

==Awards==

==Controversies==
''Putaani Party'' was dragged into a controversy that was not of its own making, when one jury member of the National Film Awards revealed some bit of the jury deliberations to the press in Kerala. He claimed that [[Kesu (film)|Kesu]] the joint winner of the award was based on one of his earlier films, but claimed responsibility for Kesu jointly getting the award. Also, the jury member revealed that because no single film deserved the National Award for Best Children's Film, it was given to two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/story.php?id=98054 |title=Source |publisher=Mathrubhumi.com |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been applied to cases of religious-based segregation occurring as a social phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/3120328|title=Religious Segregation in the Schools of Northern Ireland|last=Knox|first=H.

Grumet]]'': "...[D]rawing school district lines along the religious lines of the village impermissibly involved the state in accomplishing the religious segregation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar term '''religious apartheid''' has also been used for situations where people are separated based on religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/septemberweb-only/26.0b.html|title=Pakistan's Christians Demand End to 'Religious Apartheid' at Polls|work=Christianity Today|last=Akkaro|first=Anta|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including sociological phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Religion In Schools|url=http://www.teachers.tv/video/24057|series=The Big Debate|airdate=2008-01-29|minutes=0:09:29 and 0:11:52|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921052334/http://www.teachers.tv/video/24057|archivedate=2008-09-21|df=}}, in which Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain says (at 0:09:29): "If you have separate Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu schools, essentially you’re segregating children, you’re separating children" and (at 0:11:52): "It’s a religious apartheid society we’re creating."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Northern Ireland ==
In [[Northern Ireland]] religious segregation has been a voluntary phenomenon which increased in many areas, particularly in the capital city of Belfast and Derry. This trend inceased since the [[Troubles]], a protracted series of conflicts and tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants from the 1960s to the late 1990s. Segregation does not occur everywhere. State schools are non-denominational, but many Roman Catholics send their children to Roman Catholic Maintained Schools.

In government housing, most people will choose to be housed within their own communities. This segregation is most common with lower income people in larger towns and cities, and where there has been heightened levels of violence.

In 2012 ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' reported: {{quote|The number of "[[peace walls]]," physical barriers separating Catholic and Protestant communities, has increased sharply since the first ceasefires in 1994. Most people in the region cannot envisage the barriers being removed, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Ulster. In housing and education, Northern Ireland remains one of the most segregated tracts of land anywhere on the planet -- less than one in 10 children attends a school that is integrated between Catholics and Protestant. This figure has remained stubbornly low despite the cessation of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/20/return_of_the_troubles|title=Return of the Troubles|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016|via=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Iran==
[[Shi'a Islam]] has been the [[state religion]] of [[Iran]] since the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. While [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] are officially recognized and legally protected religious minorities, they are not allowed to evangelize or allow Muslim Iranians to convert to their faiths. The U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has claimed that religious minorities have been subject to harassment and [[religious persecution]].&lt;ref name=2006Report&gt;

Pakistan is officially an Islamic country and defines who and who is not a Muslim. Under these conditions, [[Ahmadi Muslims]] are declared non-Muslim by law of the land and cannot practice their faith freely. They are not permitted to call their mosques as mosques, or meet with people with the Islamic [[As-salamu alaykum|greeting of Peace]]. Ahmadi Muslims are excluded from government and any other high-profile positions within Pakistan.

==Nepal==
On the banks of the [[Bagmati River]] in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal is a [[Pashupatinath Temple]] dedicated to [[Pashupati|Pashupatinath]]. This temple complex which is on the [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]'s list since 1979 was erected anew in the 15th century by King kirat Yalamber.

Entry into the inner courtyard is strictly monitored by the temple security, which is selective of who is allowed inside. Practicing Hindus and Buddhists of Indian and Tibetan descendant are only allowed into temple courtyard. Practicing Hindus of western descent are not allowed into the temple complex along with other non Hindu visitors. Others can look at the main temple from adjacent side of the river.

==India==
The debate over the ban on non-Hindus entering Hindu temples began around 30 years ago when singer Yesudas, who planned to take part in a music programme, was stopped at the Guruvayur temple gate. He finally had to sing bhajans outside the temple wall. Though several temples in Kerala have signs saying that non-Hindus are denied entry, few of them enforce it as strictly as the Guruvayur temple, which insists on following its distinct traditions.'Only Orthodox Hindus are allowed’, reads a signboard hanging from the Lion's Gate of the Sri Jagannath Temple in Puri. The issue has triggered many a controversy in the past and continues to arouse strong feelings even today.

The temple is an important pilgrimage destination for many Hindu traditions and part of the Char Dham pilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime.

In the past a number of dignitaries, including former prime minister Indira Gandhi, had not been allowed to enter the 12th century shrine because she had married a Parsi, Feroze Gandhi. In 2005, the Queen of Thailand Mahachakri Siridharan was not allowed inside the temple as she was a follower of Buddhism.

In 2006, the shrine did not allow a citizen of Switzerland named Elizabeth Jigler, who had donated 17.8 million Indian Rupees to the temple because she was a Christian.
Kashi Vishvanath In Varanasi
Located in Varanasi, the temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The most famous of the many temples in Varanasi is the one dedicated to Vishveswara -- Shiva as lord of the universe. 
Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple, although this is not always enforced. On the northern side of Vishwanath Temple is the Gyan Kupor well. Non-Hindus are strictly not allowed to enter here.

{{main|2012 Rakhine State riots}}

The 2012 Rakhine State riots are a series of ongoing conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine in northern [[Rakhine State]], [[Myanmar]]. The riots came after weeks of sectarian disputes and have been condemned by most people on both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/08/us-myanmar-violence-idUSBRE85714E20120608 | title=Four killed as Rohingya Muslims riot in Myanmar: government | agency=Reuters | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Burmese Muslims by ethnic Rakhine after the rape and murder of a Rakhine woman as the main cause.&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Lauras|first=Didier|title=Myanmar stung by global censure over unrest|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/271174/myanmar-stung-by-global-censure-over-unrest|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse in the Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole villages have been "decimated".&lt;ref name=PhilInquirer /&gt;  Over three hundred houses and a number of public buildings have been razed. According to Tun Khin, the President of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), as of 28 June 650 Rohingyas have been killed, 1,200 are missing, and more than 80,000 have been displaced.&lt;ref name="dvb_hindstorm"/&gt; According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed.

In July 2012, the Myanmar Government did not include the Rohingya minority group–-classified as [[Statelessness|stateless]] Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and therefore the government says that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article3703383.ece|title= Rohingyas are not citizens: Myanmar minister| date= 1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], the Muslim [[Rohingya people]] have continued to suffer from [[human rights]] violations under the Burmese [[Military dictatorship|junta]] since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring [[Bangladesh]] as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18921960] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221095159/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19 |date=2015-02-21 }} [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8605669.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, the UNHCR ([[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]) had been assisting with the repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps have threatened this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite earlier efforts by the UN, the vast majority of Rohingya refugees have remained in Bangladesh, unable to return because of the regime in Myanmar. Now they face problems in Bangladesh where they do not receive support from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7019882.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Burmese exiles in desperate conditions|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, many Rohingya refugees were helped by [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] [[sailor]]s in the [[Strait of Malacca]], after 21 days at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.kompas.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years thousands of Rohingya also have fled to Thailand. There are roughly 111,000 refugees housed in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. There have been charges that groups of them have been shipped and towed out to open sea from Thailand, and left there. In February 2009, there was evidence of the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea. A group of refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities also in February 2009 told harrowing stories of being captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at open sea. By the end of February, there were reports that of a group of five boats were towed out to open sea, of which four boats sank in a storm, and one washed up on the shore. February 12, 2009 Thailand's prime minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] said there were "some instances" in which Rohingya people were pushed out to sea.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are attempts, I think, to let these people drift to other shores. [...] when these practices do occur, it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied. [...] It's not clear whose work it is [...] but if I have the evidence who exactly did this I will bring them to account."

The '''Scottish Housing Regulator''' (SHR) is an independent [[Non-Ministerial Department of the Scottish Government|Non-Ministerial Department]], directly accountable to the [[Scottish Parliament]]. The body was established on 1 April 2011 under the [[Housing (Scotland) Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishhousingregulator.gov.uk/about-shr |title=About SHR |publisher=Scottish Housing Regulator |accessdate=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SHR is the successor to the previous Scottish Housing Regulator agency, which exercised [[Scottish Ministers]]' powers under the [[Housing (Scotland) Act 2001]].

The statutory objective of SHR is to:
*&lt;blockquote&gt;"safeguard and promote the interests of current and future tenants of social landlords, people who are or may become homeless, and people who use housing services provided by [[Registered Social Landlord]]s (RSLs) and local authorities"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

SHR regulates social landlords to protect the interests of people who receive services from them. SHR does this by assessing and reporting on; how social landlords are performing their housing services, RSLs’ financial well-being and RSLs' standards of governance and where necessary SHR will intervene to secure improvements.

SHR also keeps a Register of all the RSLs in Scotland. The register holds information about each landlord including their contact details and their regulation plans.

In June 2015 SHR won two awards for its IT systems in recognition of its efforts to make information available to tenants to allow them to hold their landlords to account.[https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/aberdeenshire-scoops-top-ict-awards]

The '''Security Battalions''' ({{lang-el|Τάγματα Ασφαλείας|Tagmata Asfaleias}}, derisively known as ''Germanotsoliades'' (Γερμανοτσολιάδες) or ''Tagmatasfalites'' (Ταγματασφαλίτες) were Greek [[collaborationist]] military groups, formed during the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II]] in order to support the German occupation troops.

== History ==

[[File:Meligalas cemetery 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Local cemetery in [[Meligalas]] for members of the Security Battalions executed by [[Greek People's Liberation Army]].]]

The Battalions were founded in 1943 by the [[quisling]] [[Hellenic State (1941–44)|government]] of [[Ioannis Rallis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Greek Resistance 1941-45 : Organization, Achievements and Contributions to Allied War Efforts Against the Axis Powers | first1=Peter D. | last1=Chimbos | work= International Journal of Comparative Sociology | publisher=Brill | year=1999 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/ijcs/1999/00000040/f0040001/art00014 | quote=Rallis and the Nazis organized the Greek Security Battalions (Tagmata Asfalias) to counter the EAM/ELAS forces (Hondros, 1983:81 ) which were becoming the most powerful and effective resistance organizations. |volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were supported by the [[Far-right politics|extreme right]] and Nazi sympathisers, but also by some centrist politicians who were concerned about the dominance of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] (the military arm of the communist-dominated National Liberation Front [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]]) as the main body of the Greek resistance{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Among the members of the Security Battalions one could find ex-army officers, forcefully conscripted soldiers, conservatives, landowners, extreme-right radicals and social outcasts, as well as opportunists who believed the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] would win the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Greek Resistance 1941-45 : Organization, Achievements and Contributions to Allied War Efforts Against the Axis Powers | first1=Peter D. | last1=Chimbos | work= International Journal of Comparative Sociology | publisher=Brill | year=1999 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/ijcs/1999/00000040/f0040001/art00014 | quote=Who were those Greeks who joined the Security Battalions and took an oath to obey the orders of Hitler? They were ex-officers and enlisted men of the Greek army, as well as civilians, with right wing leanings who were sympathetic to the Nazis. |volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the Battalions consisted of men of the Royal Guard ([[Evzones]], so the name ''tsoliádes'').

The main role of the Security Battalions was to fight against ELAS. Their aggregate force was at most 22,000 men, divided into 9 '[[Evzones|evzonic]]' and 22 'voluntary' battalions, under the command of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Walter Schimana]]. Although the plan was to expand them all over the occupied Greek territories, their main theater of action was in eastern [[Central Greece]] and [[Peloponnese]]. At that time, ELAS had already gained control over 1/3 of continental Greece. They remained faithful to the Germans even when the occupation was crumbling. Their last mission was to engage in combat against ELAS and keep them away from the main routes, in order to secure the safe exit of the German troops from Greece.

What the Greek people hated about the Battalions, even more than their collaborationist nature, was the total lack of control over their members.  For example after a battle in the hamlet of Attali in Evvia the collaborationists pillaged the houses of the village, taking away 1,000 oka of oil, five sewing machines, 200 ok of cheese and 30 complete trousseaus.  60 mules were needed to carry away the loot.  By the end of the occupation their name was synonymous with arbitrary violence and frightful cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, Inside Hitler's Greece, quoted in Dionysis Charitopoulos, Άρης ο αρχηγός των ατάκτων (=Ares, Leader of the Irregulars) (Athens, Topos, 2009), p. 545 (back-translated by contributor).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, the Allied-oriented [[Greek government in exile|government in exile]] and the main resistance organizations in Greece decried the Security Battalions for [[treason]] multiple times. On the eve of the liberation, several battles took place between the Battalions and ELAS; the best known being the [[Battle of Meligalas]] in September 1944.

After the liberation, the groups were only temporarily disbanded, and were recruited into the [[Greek Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] to fight alongside the British and government forces against the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]]/[[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] in the battle of [[Dekemvriana]], in Athens. In total, very few of their members were tried and convicted of [[collaborationism]]. For instance, their creator and quisling Prime Minister of Greece, Rallis, was sentenced to life imprisonment for treason and died in prison in 1946, but he was acquitted for his involvement with the Security Battalions.

After the defeat of the [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] in Dekemvriana, the members continued to hunt down left, communist and anti-royalist civilians during the [[White Terror (Greece)|white terror]] period that ensued after the [[Varkiza Agreement]] that dismantled [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]]. Many ex-members continued carrying out atrocities against the [[Dimokratikos Stratos Elladas|DSE]] during the [[Greek Civil War]]. After the Civil War, and during the persecution of the communists during the 1950s and '60s in Greece, many of the brutal military personnel of the [[Makronisos|exile islands]] accused of tortures were ex-members of the security Battalions.  Finally, the leader of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek junta]] of the 1970s, [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] had also been accused of being a member of the Security Battalions, but without definite proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Λεωνίδας | last=Καλλιβρετάκης | journal=Αρχειοτάξιο | title=Γεώργιος Παπαδόπουλος, Τάγματα Ασφαλείας και "Χ": Μια απόπειρα συγκέντρωσης και επανεκτίμησης του παλαιότερου και νεότερου τεκμηριωτικού υλικού | date=2006 | publisher=Θεμέλιο | volume=8 | pages=109–147 | url=http://helios-eie.ekt.gr/EIE/handle/10442/8762 | access-date=27 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Security Battalions were recognized during the [[Greek military junta of 1967-74]] by law as "resistance fighters against the Axis", but this decision was cancelled after the fall of the regime.

==Oath==
According to uncertain references, recruits to the Security battalion were under the following oath:

{{quote|I swear by God this sacred oath, that I will obey absolutely the orders of the Supreme Commander of the German Army, Adolf Hitler. I will with loyal dedication perform my duties and obey without condition the orders of my superiors. I fully acknowledge that any objection to the obligations hereby accepted will lead to my punishment by the German Military Authorities.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}}}

However, it is reported{{By whom|date2016|date=December 2016}} that Rallis in the negotiations for the founding of such militia unit on the side of the Nazi occupation forces, refused to accept this oath as "Greek military forces can't put their legions to a foreign government"{{quotew|date=2016}}{{vague|2016|date=December 2016}} It is unknown whether Rallis' views were taken into account by German officials.

'''Shai Dromi''' ({{lang-he|שי דרומי}}), born 1959, is an [[Israel]]i farmer who, in an act of [[self-defense]], shot and killed a intruder and wounded another on 13 January 2007 at 3&amp;nbsp;am after discovering his dog had been poisoned, allegedly by four intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Fendel|first= Hillel|title=Saga Ends: Shai Dromi Acquitted of Manslaughter |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/132407 |date= 15 July 2009 |work= |publisher= Israel National News|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2009, he was acquitted of [[manslaughter]] but convicted on charges of illegal possession of weapons. The rifle he had used belonged to his father and not registered in Dromi's name.

Dromi's farm is near [[Meitar]] in southern [[Israel]], an area plagued by property theft. In the months leading up to the incident, several other dogs had been killed and a tractor and horse stolen.

Dromi testified at his trial: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I awoke at 3 AM to the barking of the guard dog that I acquired after my dogs were poisoned. Even though I was incredibly tired, I got out of bed and walked around the house. After I went back to bed, I again heard the dog barking irregularly. I went out with my weapon and didn’t see anything. I kept walking around [the perimeter of my] sheep pen, and noticed large metal wire-cutters. I panicked. I realized there were men around me."{{fact|date=December 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When police arrived, Dromi was administering [[first aid]] to the intruder, a [[Bedouin]], Khaled el-Atrash, who later died. Dromi was arrested and imprisoned for a month and later restrained from returning to his farm afterwards requiring volunteers to continue its maintenance.

A public uproar drew much attention to Dromi's plight and a law was proposed by [[Knesset|Member of Knesset]] [[Yisrael Katz (politician born 1955)|Yisrael Katz]] and later passed by a large majority in the Knesset. The law, commonly known as the 'Dromi Law', considers opposition to intruders as self-defence and modified the criminal law to allow repelling intruders from a house or agricultural facility if they had a criminal intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Stoil|first=Rebecca Anna|title=New law allows shooting at burglars |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=105405 |date= 24 June 2008 |work= |publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/Laws/Data/BillKnesset/208/208.pdf|title=A bid to classify defense against intruders as self-defence (Changes to the penal code 2008,section 99)|work=[[knesset]]|language=hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite| url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/Laws/Data/law/2161/2161.pdf|title=Changes to the penal code 2008,section 98|work=[[knesset]]|language=hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 99 defined any criminal intrusion into a house as life-threatening, and classified that one does not need to retreat but section 98 defined that the law does not apply if one caused the intruders to enter the house.

'''Social Encounter Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Encuentro Social}}, '''PES''') was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party established on the national level in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution INE/CG106/2014|url=http://www.ine.mx/archivos3/portal/historico/recursos/IFE-v2/DS/DS-CG/DS-SesionesCG/CG-acuerdos/2014/Julio/CGex201406-14_02/CGex201407-14_ap_2.pdf|website=INE|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dissolved in 2018. It is part of the coalition ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' with the [[National Regeneration Movement]] and Mexico's [[Labor Party (Mexico)|Labor Party]] for the [[Mexican general election, 2018|2018 Mexican election]].

==History==
The Social Encounter Party was founded in 2006 by Dr. [[Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes]], a pastor of a [[Neo-Pentecostal]] church that supported [[Felipe Calderón]] in the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Animal Político|first=Rubén|last=Águilar|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/blogueros-lo-que-quiso-decir/2014/09/09/partido-encuentro-social-pes/|date=2014-09-09|accessdate=2016-01-09|title=Partido Encuentro Social (PES)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had previously been a "national political grouping", which does not receive public funding.&lt;ref name="condado"&gt;{{cite news|first=Arturo|last=Condado|date=2014-07-10|accessdate=2016-01-09|work=CNN México|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2014/07/10/hay-3-nuevos-partidos-politicos-en-mexico-pero-quienes-son|title=Hay 3 nuevos partidos políticos en México, ¿pero quiénes son?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party made many of its early successes in the state of [[Baja California]]. In 2007, it supported the successful candidacy of [[José Guadalupe Osuna Millán]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]], but in 2013, it allied with the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] in Baja California instead, which led it to elect a state deputy to a district in [[Tecate]] and four council members in [[Tijuana]].&lt;ref name="condado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdp"&gt;{{cite news|work=SDP Noticias|date=2014-07-14|accessdate=2016-01-09|url=http://www.sdpnoticias.com/gay/2014/07/16/nuevo-partido-encuentro-social-luchara-contra-matrimonio-gay|title=Nuevo "Partido Encuentro Social" luchará contra matrimonio gay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it obtained federal registry. After doing so, eight of its nine political assemblies were nullified, as bribes were given to attendees.&lt;ref name="sdp"/&gt;

The party is primarily composed of evangelical Christians, though it has declared itself as "not religious" in character.&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;

===2015 Mexican legislative elections===
The [[Mexican legislative election, 2015|2015 legislative elections]] was the first election where PES participated at a federal level. It managed to obtain eight proportional representation seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]] as a result of obtaining 3.3 percent of the vote.

===2018 Mexican general elections===
{{See also|Juntos Haremos Historia|Opinion polling for the Mexican general election, 2018}}
The [[Mexican general election, 2018|2018 Mexican general election]] was the first general election where the PES participated with a candidate aspiring for the [[President of Mexico|presidency]], as the party formed a coalition with left-wing [[National Regeneration Movement]] (MORENA) and [[Labor Party (Mexico)|Labor Party]] (PT). The parties nominated [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] as their presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.proceso.com.mx/523315/con-referencias-biblicas-amlo-asume-candidatura-del-pes&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Coalition with MORENA'''

On 24 June 2017, the PT approved to stand for election in 2018 in an electoral alliance with MORENA; however the coalition was not officially registered before the [[National Electoral Institute]], the electoral authorities of the country. For MORENA, the alliance was facilitated as a result of [[Óscar González Yáñez]], the PT gubernatorial candidate in the State of Mexico, withdrawing from the race and endorsing MORENA candidate [[Delfina Gómez Álvarez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Digital |first=Milenio|title=PT acuerda ir con Morena por la Presidencia en el 2018|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/pt-morena-elecciones_2018-alianza-presidencia-andres_manuel_lopez_obrador_0_980902074.html|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=Milenio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aprueba PT coalición con Morena en elecciones de 2018|url=https://www.sdpnoticias.com/nacional/2017/06/25/aprueba-pt-coalicion-con-morena-en-elecciones-de-2018|date=25 June 2017|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=SDPnoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aristeguinoticias.com/2506/mexico/prd-avala-frente-amplio-en-2018-pt-se-va-con-morena-documento/|title=PRD avala “frente amplio” en 2018; PT se va con Morena (Documento)|accessdate=5 September 2017|website=aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, there was speculation about the possibility of a front grouping all the leftist parties: MORENA, PRD, PT and [[Citizens' Movement (Mexico)|Citizens' Movement]] (MC). However, Andrés Manuel López Obrador rejected any kind of agreement due to political differences, especially after the elections in the State of Mexico, when the candidates of the PRD and MC continued with their campaigns refusing to support the candidate of MORENA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.animalpolitico.com/2017/06/prd-amlo-alianza-2018/ |title= Prd amlo alianza 2018 |accessdate=5 September 2017 |website= www.animalpolitico.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of November 2017, the leaders of MORENA and the PES announced that they were in talks to form a possible alliance. In this sense, Hugo Eric Flores said, "We don't negotiate with the PRI, we have two options, go alone or with MORENA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =No negociaremos con el PRI; vamos solos o con Morena: PES |url =http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/12/07/1206250 |work =[[Excélsior]] |date =7 December 2017 |accessdate =9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confirmation'''

On December 13, the coalition between Morena, the PT and the PES was formalized under the name ''Juntos Haremos Historia'' (English: Together we will make history).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partido del Trabajo y Encuentro Social anuncian coalición con Morena|url=http://expansion.mx/politica/2017/12/13/partido-del-trabajo-y-encuentro-social-anuncian-coalicion-con-morena|accessdate=13 December 2017|work=Expansión}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the signing of the agreement, Andrés Manuel López Obrador was appointed as a pre-candidate for the three political formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nacion321.com/elecciones/morena-y-encuentro-social-oficializan-su-union-rumbo-a-2018 |title= Morena y Encuentro Social oficializan su unión rumbo a 2018 |accessdate= 13 December 2017 |author=Nación321 |date= 13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a partial coalition that will promote López Obrador as a presidential candidate and, with respect to the legislative elections: MORENA will have to choose candidates in 150 federal electoral districts and 32 districts to the Senate; 75 deputies and 16 senators for PT and 75 deputies and 16 senators for the PES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author =Redacción |title =Morena, PT y Encuentro Social firman coalición rumbo a elección de 2018 |url =http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/morena-pt-y-encuentro-social-firman-coalicion-electoral.html |work =El Financiero |date =13 December 2017 |accessdate =13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first =Misael |last =Zavala |title =Firman acuerdo Morena, PES y PT para ir en coalición |url =http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/firman-acuerdo-morena-pes-y-pt-para-ir-en-coalicion |work =[[El Universal (México)|El Universal]] |date =13 December 2017 |accessdate =13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance has received criticism as it is a coalition between two leftist parties (MORENA and the PT) with a formation related to the evangelical right (PES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first =Elías |last =Camhaji |title =López Obrador se alía con el conservador Encuentro Social para las elecciones de 2018 |url =https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/12/13/mexico/1513189205_438858.html |work =[[El País]] |date =13 December 2017 |accessdate =13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the national president of MORENA, [[Yeidckol Polevnsky]], mentioned that her party believes in inclusion, joint work to "rescue Mexico" and that they will continue to defend human rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title =En Morena creemos en la inclusión: Yeidckol ante las críticas por alianza con el PES  |url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q--bk5vFcQE |work = El Financiero Bloomberg |via=[[Youtube]] |date =13 December 2017 |accessdate =14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes, national president of the PES, mentioned that "the only possibility of real change in our country is the one headed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador" and that his party had decided to be "on the right side of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title =La única opción para cambiar el país es la que encabeza AMLO: Hugo Eric Flores |url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsTrelNcUQM |work = El Financiero Bloomberg|via=[[Youtube]] |date =13 December 2017 |accessdate =14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Results and dissolution'''

The results for the ''Juntos Haremos Historia'' coalition were strong; López Obrador was elected president in a landslide victory, as well as winning five of the nine state governorships (one of them for PES candidate [[Cuauhtémoc Blanco]] in [[Morelos]]), and the coalition resulted in the election of 55 federal deputies and 7 senators belonging to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2018/07/09/mexico/1531161540_362658.html?id_externo_rsoc=TW_AM_CM|work=El País|date=9 July 2018|first=Sonia|last=Corona|accessdate=9 July 2018|title=Los evangélicos se aferran a López Obrador}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party failed to attract three percent of the vote in the elections for president, federal deputies, and senators, which under Mexican law prompts the loss of its federal registry and the appointment of a liquidator by the [[National Electoral Institute|INE]] to dispose of the national party's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alejandro|last=Suárez|url=https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/mexico/politica/panal-y-pes-pierden-registro-ine-inicia-proceso-de-liquidacion-1825875.html|date=9 July 2018|title=Panal y PES pierden registro; INE inicia proceso de liquidación|work=El Sol de México|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PES and [[New Alliance Party (Mexico)|New Alliance Party]], the other party to lose its registry after the 2018 elections, challenged the results to no avail and on 3 September 2018, the party was dissolved as it had not reached the 3% of the national vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Partido Encuentro Social desaparece tras los resultados electorales|url=http://protestantedigital.com/internacional/45438/El_Partido_Encuentro_Social_desaparece_tras_los_resultados_electorales|work=Protestante Digital|date=4 September 2018|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INE aprueba pérdida de registro de Nueva Alianza y Encuentro Social|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/INE-aprueba-perdida-de-registro-de-Nueva-Alianza-y-Encuentro-Social-20180903-0027.html|work=El Economista|date=3 September 2018|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy positions==
The PES tends to include many strands of Christian humanist thinking and is generally socially conservative, though Flores has stated that it is a "family" party.&lt;ref name="condado"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://encuentro.social/cultura-politica-html/|title=Somos el partido de la familia|website=Encuentro Social|access-date=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baja California state party uses a stylized [[ichthys|ichthus]] in its logo, which is not used by the national organization.&lt;ref name="anp"/&gt;

The party characterizes itself as the "party of the family". It opposes [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|same-sex marriage]] and was responsible for reforms to the Baja California constitution in 2008 that established marriage as "between one man and one woman".&lt;ref name="sdp"/&gt; In 2015, the PES gubernatorial candidate in the state of [[San Luis Potosí]] compared homosexuality to drug trafficking and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Excélsior|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2015/03/31/1016283|date=2015-03-31|accessdate=2016-02-14|title=Gays y solteras embarazadas dañan la familia, dice candidato}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it opposes abortion and pornographic magazines.&lt;ref name="milenio"&gt;{{cite news|work=Milenio|first=Pedro|last=Domínguez|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/Hugo-Flores-Cervantes-Encuentro-Social_0_242975723.html|date=2014-02-10|accessdate=2016-02-10|title="No somos partido religioso, al contrario, somos liberales": dirigente de Encuentro Social}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposals made by the PES include shifting the collection of [[value-added tax]] to the states instead of the federal government and consolidating it with income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Vértigo Político|date=2014-11-18|accessdate=2016-01-09|url=http://www.vertigopolitico.com/articulo/27403/Partido-Encuentro-Social-busca-representacion-en-San-Lazaro|first=Arturo|last=Moncada|title=Partido Encuentro Social busca representación en San Lázaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stop Bullying: Speak Up''' is a campaign of [[Cartoon Network]] to raise awareness of [[bullying]] issues and promote positive relationships. Cartoon Network’s special programming on bullying issues during the month of October coincides with [[National Bullying Prevention Month]]. The campaign directs witnesses and victims of bullying to "speak up" and enlist the help of a teacher or other responsible adult. The campaign features documentaries, public service ads, and use of existing programs to carry the anti-bullying message on the network, and directs children, parents and educators to other resources about bullying issues, including an anti-bullying pledge.

==History==

Stop Bullying: Speak Up&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephanie|last=Chen |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/10/04/bullying.special.explainer/index.html |title=After student's death, a weeklong look into bullying |publisher=CNN.com |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2010 and has partnered with the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (Stop Bullying.gov), [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America]], [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN), as well as [[The Anti-Defamation League]] and [[The Southern Poverty Law Center]] through its project, Teaching Tolerance, and other corporate sponsors.

In 2010, the network partnered with [[CNN]] to hold a bullying prevention town hall.

In 2011, the campaign participated in the first Bullying Prevention Summit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?295021-1/bullying-prevention-summit|title=Bullying Prevention Summit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the White House, hosted by President [[Barack Obama]].

In 2012, the Cartoon Network television documentary, Speak Up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/19/obama-denounces-bullying-cartoon-network-documentary_n_1362921.html |title=Obama Denounces Bullying On Cartoon Network Documentary, 'Speak Up' (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffington Post |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; included an introduction by Obama and featured children and teenagers talking about their experiences of bullying.

In 2013, The Bully Effect,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bgca.org/newsevents/TheScoop/Pages/CartoonNetworkTheBullyEffect.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a documentary hosted by reporter [[Anderson Cooper]] of CNN in conjunction with Cartoon Network kicked off the campaign to boost bullying awareness.

In 2014, Stop Bullying: Speak Up reached the goal of 1 million people taking the pledge to Speak Up and stop bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cartoon-network-enlists-one-million-people-to-share-i-speak-up-online-videos-to-kick-off-its-fifth-annual-stop-bullying-speak-up-initiative-273971161.html|title=Cartoon Network Enlists One Million People to Share "I Speak Up" Online Videos to Kick off its Fifth Annual Stop Bullying: Speak Up Initiative|first=Cartoon|last=Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Signature CN programs such as ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' served as platforms for the anti-bullying message on the network. Families are encouraged to take the pledge. Cartoon Network participated as sponsor of the 2015 International Bullying Prevention Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibpaworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015-IBPA-conf-broch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in Denver, CO.

National Bullying Prevention Month was founded in the United States in 2006 by PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/ |title=PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center |publisher=Pacer.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (PACER is Parents Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights, based in Minneapolis and Los Angeles.)

==Development==

Stop Bullying: Speak Up was created in response to feedback from the network’s audience of children and youth ages 6–14, which showed that bullying was among the biggest problems faced by young people.  Additional research also was conducted among its viewers in 2010 by R. Bradley Snyder, author of The 5 Simple Truths About Raising Kids. Snyder is director of The Dion Initiative for Child Well-Being and Bullying Prevention, in Arizona, which evolved from the work of Stop Bulling Az., founded by Nicole Stanton, wife of Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton.

Other advisors to the Stop Bullying: Speak Up campaign include:

* Joel Haber, Ph.D. Author of ''The Bully Coach'' and nationally recognized speaker on bullying prevention.
* Ronald Slaby, Ph.D. Research Associate at Harvard Medical School and Senior Scientist at Education Development Center.
* Deborah Temkin, Ph.D. Bullying Prevention Manager for the Speak Truth to Power Program at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights.
* David Waren Director of the Anti-Defamation League Education Division, overseeing anti-bias initiatives, Holocaust education programs, programs related to anti-Semitism and campus advocacy.

The '''Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve''' (ISPR) is an emergency fuel store of total 5.33 MMT (million metric tons) or 36.92 [[Barrel (unit)|MMbbl]] of strategic [[crude oil]] enough to provide 10 days of consumption&lt;ref name="ndtv1"/&gt; which are maintained by the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited.&lt;ref name="bs1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/land-acquisition-woes-push-filling-of-strategic-reserves-to-march-115122200213_1.html|title=Filling of strategic oil reserves delayed|accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/nts43834.htm Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections - India to build up storage of crude oil] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418001150/http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/nts43834.htm |date=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic crude oil storages are at three underground locations in [[Mangalore]], [[Visakhapatnam]] and Padur (Udupi, Karnataka). All these are located on the east and west coasts of [[India]] which are readily accessible to the [[List of oil refineries in India|refineries]]. These [[strategic reserve|strategic storages]] are in addition to the existing storages of crude oil and petroleum products with the oil companies and serve in response to external supply disruptions.&lt;ref name="isprl1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isprlindia.com/aboutus.asp|title=Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited|accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==

In the 2017-18 budget speech by the Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, it was announced that two more such caverns will be set up [[Chandikhole]] in Jajpur district of Odisha and [[Bikaner]] in Rajasthan as part of the second phase. This will take the strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 million tons. .&lt;ref name="Economic Times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-to-build-2-crude-oil-storages-in-odisha-rajasthan/articleshow/56918925.cms|title=Government to build 2 crude oil storages in Odisha, Rajasthan|accessdate=2016-01-02|publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from this,India is planning to expand more strategic crude oil facilities in second phase at [[Rajkot]] in Gujarat and Padur in [[Udupi district]] of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="ndtv1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-store-our-oil-and-take-two-thirds-for-free-uaes-offer-to-india-1275964|title=Store Our Oil And Take Two-Thirds For Free: UAE's Offer to India|accessdate=2016-02-10|publisher=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temara interrogation center''', also known as '''Temara secret detention center''' ({{lang-ar|معتقل تمارة السري}}), is an [[Extrajudicial detention|extrajudicial]] detainment and secret prison facility of [[Morocco]] located within a forested area about 15 kilometres from [[Rabat]], Morocco. It is operated by the [[Direction générale de la surveillance du territoire|Directorate for the Surveillance of the Territory]] (Direction de la surveillance du territoire, DST), a Moroccan domestic intelligence agency implicated in past and ongoing human rights violations,&lt;ref name=amnesty1/&gt; which continues to arrest, detain and interrogate individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities outside of the Moroccan legal framework.

== History ==

The first known detainee was '''Mohammed Mossadegh Benkhadra''' ({{lang-ar|محمد مصدق بن خضراء}}), in 1985 and spent 8 years in [[Extrajudicial detention|extrajudicial]] detainment and without trial. And later when he was released 1993, he wrote the book "Tazmara 234",&lt;ref name=book/&gt; contraction from words [[Temara]] and [[Tazmamart]] another popular prison and as a sign of continued abuse from the [[Years of Lead (Morocco)]] to present days. More recently, [[Zakaria Moumni]] claimed to have been tortured there when he was arrested in 2010.

The [[Associated Press]]  reported in August 2010&lt;ref name=associated/&gt; that, according to several current and former American officials, the US government possesses video and audio recordings of [[Ramzi Binalshibh]], an accused plotter of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] being interrogated in a secret prison  . The US officials told the AP that the prison was run by Moroccans but largely financed by the [[CIA]], which in late 2002 handed Binalshibh over to Moroccan custody and kept him there for five months. The Moroccan government has never acknowledged the facility's existence, despite allegations by freed Guantanamo detainee [[Binyam Mohamed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,609464,00.html |date=23 February 2009 |title=Released Guantanamo Detainee: What Did Tony Blair Know? |accessdate=15 April 2012 |publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]'' |first=Britta |last=Sandberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temara interrogation centre and others that the CIA relied on Morocco as a secret proxy detention site during the period after September 11, 2001.

==Torture of Detainees==
Members of the DST are not considered to be part of the judicial police and as such should not arrest and hold suspects.&lt;ref name=amnesty2/&gt;
Frequently reported methods of torture include beatings, the suspension of the body in [[stress positions|contorted positions]], and the threat of [[rape]] or other [[sexual abuse]] of the detainees’ female relatives. Other reported methods include rape by the forced insertion of objects such as bottles into the [[human anus|anus]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[cigarette]] burns, and the [[electric shock torture|application of live electrodes to the body]]. Several [[non-government organizations]] such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] have denounced reports of torture at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=46151 |title=Moroccan MPs back probe into detention centre |publisher=Middle East Online |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">The '''Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners''', widely referred to as the '''CIA committee''', was a [[Committees of the European Parliament|Committee of the European Parliament]] that was set up in 2006 to investigate the alleged role of the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in the [[extraordinary rendition]] of terrorists. The chairman of the committee was [[Carlos Coelho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carlos COELHO|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/1892/CARLOS_COELHO_history.html|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final report ==
An interim report was released in 2006, which stated that "the CIA or other US services have been directly responsible for the illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of terrorist suspects on the territory of member states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU backs report on CIA kidnappings|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/748517/425822.xhtml|publisher=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairman of the committee, [[Carlos Coelho]], claimed that the CIA's [[extraordinary rendition]]s in Europe was carried out "with the knowledge and support of European national governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEPs say intelligence sources reveal 30 to 50 extraordinary renditions have taken place|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20060515IPR08166&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the final report of the committee was released, which revealed the existence of secret detention facilities in Europe. According to the report, over one thousand CIA-operated flights used European airspace from 2001 to 2005.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA activities in Europe: European Parliament adopts final report deploring passivity from some Member States|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&amp;type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20070209IPR02947|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also included the following details:

*  Officials of the Italian military security services ([[SISMI]]) played an "active role" in the abduction of [[Abu Omar case|Abu Omar]] in the Italian capital [[Milan]]. In addition, the director of the SISMI had "concealed the truth" when he denied the SISMI's involvement.&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;
* The [[Republic of Macedonia]] failed to thoroughly investigate the abduction of [[Khalid El-Masri]].&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;
* The Polish government failed to cooperate with the committee in its investigations.&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;
* The German Government refused to allow the United States to release rendition victim [[Murat Kurnaz]], who was interrogated twice by German officials, from the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;

== Reception ==

The committee's final report was approved by the European Parliament with 382 votes in favour, 256 against, and 74 abstentions.&lt;ref name="a1"/&gt;

'''Tokenism''' is the practice of making only a perfunctory or symbolic effort to be [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusive]] to members of [[minority group]]s, especially by recruiting a small number of people from underrepresented groups in order to give the appearance of [[Racial equality|racial]] or [[sexual equality]] within a workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/tokenism|title=tokenism: definition of tokenism in Oxford dictionary|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/202951?redirectedFrom=tokenism#eid|title=tokenism, n.|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tokenism|title=Tokenism|work=[[Reference.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort of including a token employee to a workforce is usually intended to create the impression of social inclusiveness and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (racial, religious, sexual, etc.) in order to deflect accusations of [[discrimination]].&lt;ref name="hogg&amp;vaughan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogg|first1=Michael A.|last2=Vaughan|first2=Graham M.|title=Social Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7MtEr4r2pRcC&amp;pg=PA368|year=2008|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Harlow|pages=368–369|isbn=978-0-13-206931-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One additionally relevant term for tokenism is "hyper-tokenism". Hyper-tokenism is where a person of color has increased screen time, is involved in the plot and in promotional images, but the white characters are still the most significant characters by the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nalip.org/5_ways_movies_fake_racial_diversity|title=5 Ways Movies Fake Racial Diversity|work=NALIP|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another relevant term is "ambiguously brown". Ambiguously brown characters are characters that are white-passing, but not fully white so that whatever they are cast in is not completely whitewashed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rampages.us/hypermasculinityinfilms/racial-tropes-and-tokenism/|title=Racial Tropes and Tokenism {{!}} Hypermasculinity and Racism in Film|website=rampages.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The social concept and the employment practice of ''tokenism'' became understood in the [[popular culture]] of the United States in the late 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In the face of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], tokenism emerged as a solution that though earnest in effort, only acknowledged an issue without actually solving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whowhatwhy.org/2014/05/12/the-plague-of-tokenism/|title=The Plague of Tokenism|last=Wallis|first=Victor|date=|website=|access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''[[Why We Can't Wait]]'' (1964), [[civil rights]] activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] discussed the subject of tokenism, and how it constitutes a minimal acceptance of [[black people]] to the [[mainstream]] of U.S. society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Martin Luther|year=1964|title=[[Why We Can't Wait]]|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0451527530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the gains of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963, [[human rights]] activist [[Malcolm X]] answered, “What gains? All you have gotten is tokenism — one or two [[Negro]]es in a job, or at a lunch counter, so the rest of you will be quiet.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/a-summing-up-louis-lomax-interviews-malcolm-x/|title=A Summing Up: Louis Lomax interviews Malcolm X|website=Teaching American History|first=Louis|last=Lomax|date=1963|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Bryan-Paul|last2=Sikkenga|first2=Jeffrey|page=689|year=2003|title=History of American Political Thought|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0739106242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[psychology]], the broader definition of  tokenism is a situation in which a member of a distinctive category is treated differently from other people. The characteristics that make the person of interest a token can be perceived as either a handicap or an advantage, as supported by Václav Linkov. In a positive light, these distinct people can be seen as experts in their racial/cultural category, valued skills, or a different perspective on a project. In contrast, tokenism is most often seen as a handicap due to the [[ostracism]] of a selected sample of a minority group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Linkov, Václav. "Tokenism In Psychology: Standing On The Shoulders Of Small Boys." ''Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science'' 48.2 (2014): 143-160. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 10 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Linkov also attributes drawbacks in psychology to Cultural and Numerical Tokenism, instances that have shifted where value of expertise is placed and its effect on proliferating information that is not representative of all the possible facts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Black characters being the first characters to die was first identified in Hollywood horror movies of the 1930s, notes writer Renee Cozier. More recently, not a single actor of color was nominated for the 2015 or 2016 Oscars. Around this time, minorities accounted for 12.9% of lead roles in 163 films surveyed in 2014, according to the 2016 Hollywood Diversity Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/hollywood-diversity-report:-mounting-evidence-that-more-diverse-casts-help-the-bottom-line|title=Hollywood Diversity Report: Mounting evidence that more diverse casts help the bottom line|last=Greene|first=Eric|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In television===
Tokenism, in a television setting, can be any act of putting a minority into the mix to create some sort of publicly viewed diversity. A racial divide in TV has been present since the first television show that hired minorities, ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' (1928-1960) in 1943.  Regardless of whether a token character may be stereotypical or not, tokenism can initiate a whole biased perceived sense of thought that may conflict with how people see a specific race, culture, gender, or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15506878jobem4404_11|title=A New Piece to the Puzzle: Examining Effects of Television Portrayals of African Americans|first=James A.|last=Rada|date=1 December 2000|publisher=|volume=44|issue=4|pages=704–715|accessdate=23 January 2017|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4404_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]], [[America Ferrera]] states, “Tokenism is about inserting diverse characters because you feel you have to; true diversity means writing characters that aren’t just defined by the color of their skin, and casting the right actor for the role." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/america-ferrera-breaks-down-the-difference-between-tokenism-and-true-diversity_us_573f1a92e4b045cc9a70b132|title=America Ferrera Breaks Down The Difference Between Tokenism And 'True Diversity'|first1=Carolina Moreno|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=20 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Tokenism in television has been spoken about under a different umbrella in recent decades. For example, tokenism was analyzed in an article that examined actions in the television show ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' (2012-). Though today there are many black main characters in many popular television shows, Stephanie L. Gomez's article speaks about [[Kerry Washington]] as [[Olivia Pope]]. Gomez compares the character of Olivia Pope to three [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] of Black women, The slave mistress, The help, and [[Stereotypes_of_African_Americans#Jezebel| The Jezebel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=Stephanie L.|last2=McFarlane|first2=Megan D.|date=2017-05-04|title="It’s (not) handled": race, gender, and refraction in Scandal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2016.1218352|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=17|issue=3|pages=362–376|doi=10.1080/14680777.2016.1218352|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 1990s, shows like ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' (1990-1996) and ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' (1992-1997), were strategies that were used to capitalize from an underrepresented group, namely the black community in television at the time. Networks allowed the shows to be black-produced and have all-black casts. This strategy was used because at the time the black viewership did not have many shows made specifically for them, and networks used this tactic to capitalize on them. Networks knew that many black people would purchase televisions and cable subscriptions if there were more people like them on the television, this is also conveyed tokenism.{{Citation needed|reason=Your The entire section lacks sources. Umvlear if these sitcoms were marketed towards black audiences. |date=January 2018}}

The CW show ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]'', though it has a lot of minorities cast, still displays ample tokenism with how these characters are used in the show. Lincoln plays the "scary black man" trope before he is more humanized by his white love interest and then ultimately killed off. Raven Reyes is hypersexualized or tortured during her screen time. Wells Jaha is killed off in season one. On top of this, the only LGBT representation the show includes is when character Clarke and Lexa become an item, but Lexa is soon killed off for shock value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://affinitymagazine.us/2017/02/10/when-representation-becomes-tokenism-why-we-need-diverse-creators/|title=When Representation Becomes Tokenism: Why We Need Diverse Creators|date=2017-02-10|work=Affinity Magazine|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another show with tokenism is the CW show ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''. In this teen drama, [[Kevin Keller (comics)|Kevin Keller]] is the only gay character in the ensemble cast. He has very little significance to the actual plot and has way less screen time than other characters. When he is on screen, he plays a stereotyped flamboyant gay teen.{{Citation needed|reason=The entire paragraph has no sources.|date=November 2018}}

In 2012, Acura put out a casting call for their commercial where they stated that the main actor must be a “nice looking, friendly, not too dark” African American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theroot.com/acura-casting-call-not-too-dark-blacks-1790891043|title=Acura Casting Call: 'Not Too Dark' Blacks|last=Staff|first=The Root|work=The Root|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/18/acura-nsx-super-bowl-commercial-seinfeld-light-skinned-black-casting/|title=Acura NSX Super Bowl Commercial -- Only Light-Skinned Blacks Need Apply|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the media ===
Just like television, Tokenism in the media has changed over time to coincide with real life events. During the years of 1946-87 the weekly magazine, The ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' was analyzed to determine how often and in what situations blacks were being portrayed in the magazine's cartoon section. Over the 42 years of research, there was only one  U.S. black main character in a cartoon where race was not the main theme, race was actually completely irrelevant. All cartoons from the earliest times depicted U.S. blacks in stereotypical roles. In the late 1960s and early 1970s cartoons were mostly racial themed, and depicted blacks in "token" roles where they are only there to create a sense of inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thibodeau|first=Ruth|date=1989-01-01|title=From Racism to Tokenism: The Changing Face of Blacks in New Yorker Cartoons|url=https://doi.org/10.1086/269168|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|language=en|volume=53|issue=4|doi=10.1086/269168|issn=0033-362X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the workplace ===
A [[Harvard Business School]] professor, [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]], asserted back in 1993 that a token employee is usually part of a "socially-skewed group" of employees who belong to a [[minority group]] that constitutes less than 15% of the total employee population of the workplace. {{sfn|Kanter|1993|}}

By definition, token employees in a workplace are known to be few; hence, their alleged high visibility among the staff subjects them to greater pressure to perform their work at higher production standards of quality and volume and to behave in the expected, stereotypical manner. {{sfn|Kanter|1993|}} Given the smallness of the group of token employees in a workplace, the individual identity of each token person is usually disrespected by the dominant group, who apply a stereotype role to them as a means of social control in the workplace. {{sfn|Kanter|1993|}}

Research comparing the effects of gender and race tokenism on individuals indicates that the practice of tokenism can accurately predict conditions in the workplace for members of racial minorities.&lt;ref name="jackson et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jackson |first1= Pamela Braboy |last2= Thoits |first2= Peggy A. |last3 = Taylor | first3 = Howard F. |year= 1995 |title= Composition of the Workplace and Psychological Well-Being: The Effects of Tokenism on America's Black Elite |journal= Social Forces |volume= 74 |issue= 2 |pages= 543–557 |publisher= |doi= 10.1093/sf/74.2.543 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, racial minorities also experience heightened performance pressures related to their race and gender; however, many reported that racial problems were more common than gender problems.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Turner |first1= Caroline Sotello Viernes |last2= |first2=|last3 = | first3 = |year= 2002 |title= Women of Color in Academe: Living with Multiple Marginality |journal= [[The Journal of Higher Education]] |volume= 73 |issue= 1 |pages= 74–93 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/1558448 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her work on tokenism and gender, professor Kanter said that the problems experienced by women in a typically male-dominated occupations were due solely to the skewed proportions of men and women in these occupations. {{sfn|Kanter |1993}}

===In politics===
In politics, allegations of tokenism may occur when a [[political party]] puts forward candidates from under-represented groups, such as women or racial minorities, in races that the party has little or no chance of winning, while making limited or no effort to ensure that such candidates have similar opportunity to win the nomination in races where the party is safe or favoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duffy |first=Andrew |title=More women, fewer chances |date=9 April 2011 |page=B3 |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20110409/298186695737023 |accessdate=16 July 2018}}{{Failed verification|date=July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "token" candidates are frequently submitted as [[paper candidate|paper candidates]], in which a person is placed on the ballot solely to make sure the political party has a candidate in the race even if that candidate has almost no chance of actually winning, while the more competitive nature of the candidate selection process in winnable seats continues to favour members of the majority group.&lt;ref name=paradox/&gt;

The end result of such an approach is that the party's slate of candidates maintains the appearance of [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], but members of the majority group remain overrepresented in the party's [[caucus]] after the election — and thus little to no substantive progress toward greater inclusion of underrepresented groups has actually occurred.&lt;ref name=paradox&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanthak|first=Kristin|last2=Krause|first2=George A.|year=2012|title=The Diversity Paradox: Political Parties, Legislatures, and the Organizational Foundations of Representation in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199891740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times dives into address tokenism in politics by mentioning Nikki Haley. Haley is first generation American, having Indian immigrants as parents. Despite the fact that she has little experience with foreign policy, President Trump chose her as the current United States Ambassador to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/magazine/i-know-how-it-feels-to-be-someones-token-im-sure-ben-carson-does-too.html|title=I Know How It Feels to Be Someone’s ‘Token.’ I’m Sure Ben Carson Does, Too.|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{See also|Magical Negro|Stereotype#Role in art and culture}}
In fiction, a token character exists only to achieve minimal compliance with the normality presumed for the society described in the story. Writers also use the token character to pay lip service to the rules and the standards that they do not abide, such as by obeying anti-[[racism]] policies, by including a token ethnic-minority character who has no true, narrative function in the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and is usually a [[stereotype]] character.

In fiction, token characters represent groups which vary from the norm (usually defined as a white, heterosexual male) and are otherwise excluded from the story. The token character can be based on [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] (i.e. [[Black people|black]], [[Hispanic]], [[Asian people|Asian]]), [[religion]] (i.e. [[Jew]]ish, [[Muslim]]), sexual orientation (i.e. [[homosexuality|homosexual]]), or gender (typically a [[female]] character in a predominantly male cast). Token characters are usually background characters, and, as such, are usually disposable, and are eliminated from the narrative early in the story, in order to enhance the drama, while conserving the main characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ethnic-minorities-accuse-tv-programmers-of-tokenism-869817.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Ethnic minorities accuse TV programmers of tokenism | first=Sadie | last=Gray | date=2008-07-17 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/12/radio.raceintheuk | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Minorities accuse TV and radio of tokenism | first=Helen | last=Carter | date=2002-11-13 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much contemporary cinema and television, the inclusion of token characters is usually and implausibly seen in historical settings where such a person's race would be immediately noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/08/wuthering-heights-film-tackles-racism-full-on?CMP=twt_fd |title=Response The new Wuthering Heights does not ignore racism; it tackles it full on &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, other characters tend to treat the token characters as though they are not concerned with their race or ethnicity. Notable exceptions to this practice include stories based in history and stories that address racism directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/11/wuthering-heights-black-actors |title=Why Wuthering Heights gives me hope|publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip |last=French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/13/wuthering-heights-andrea-arnold-review |title=Wuthering Heights – review &amp;#124; Film &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[South Park]]'' character [[Token Black]] is a reference to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/characters/token-black | title=South Park Studios | accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British films and TV programmes might include a token American character, sometimes in situations where the presence of an American would have been unlikely, in order to appeal to viewers in the U.S., e.g. the character "Agar" in ''[[The First Great Train Robbery]]'' (1979), and character of "Flt. Lt. Carrington" in the first series of ''[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]'' (1972), about British prisoners of war, during the Second World War (1939–45).

== Debate about inclusion of transgender people in the military ==
{{Globalize|section|date=November 2017}}

=== Arguments against inclusion ===

There are arguments against the inclusion of transgender people in military service. One argument is based on the view that being transgender is a [[mental illness]], and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt; This argument follows a high incidence of depression and suicide manifest in transgender individuals. This is especially pertinent in individuals who have had [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex-reassignment surgery]] and are unsatisfied with the results; in such cases severe depression is prevalent.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;Clements T.I., Wicks R.E.,"Transsexualism and Flight Safety" ''Aerospace Medicine Branch Education'' USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a229995.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hormone therapy]] can affect mood and a sense of well-being, a factor that counts against inclusion of transgender people and its effect on service capability.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt; Besides the well-being argument of hormone treatment, complications may arise due to hormone treatments. Possible complications arising from [[estrogen]] and [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] therapies include an increased risk of [[thromboembolic disease]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[breast cancer]], fertility problems, [[stroke]], abnormal liver function, [[renal disease]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;Major Bunn S.A., ''Straight talk: The implications of repealing "Don't ask, Don't tell" and the rationale for preserving aspects of the current policy'' 203 MIL. L Rev. 207, 236 (2010) [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Military_Law_Review/pdf-files/203-spring-2010.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these could cause significant issues to effective military service, especially when deployed in remote areas or in field training settings.

A further argument is that in order to have an effective, smooth-running military, there must be cohesion within the unit. It is argued that transgender individuals would have a negative impact on unit cohesion. "The bonds of trust among individual service members" are vital.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan D., Rosenmann A, ''Unit social cohesion in the Israeli military as a case study of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' 33 Pol. Psychol. 419, 422 (2012)l&lt;/ref&gt; There is a fear that if transgender personnel be allowed to serve openly, morale will be detrimentally affected. But this argument neglects to deal with the question of what kinds of structural accommodations might be needed to maintain morale and unit cohesion in such situations. Military service forces members into very intimate living quarters. Requiring members to live in situations that make them feel disconcerted and uncomfortable may result in their performance being undermined.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc.gov"/&gt; The logistics of accommodating a group of individuals with such varying degrees of gender representation would be staggering. The costs alone of allowing transgender people to serve counts heavily against inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Needs Citation&lt;/ref&gt; Not only logistically and structurally, but also in medical costs. It is estimated that a male-to-female transition can cost between US$7,000 and $24,000; female-to-male transition can exceed US$50,000.&lt;ref name="Sex Reassignment Surgery"&gt;''[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Sex-Reassignment-Surgery.html Sex Reassignment Surgery]'' Encyclopaedia of Surgery, Retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Which, depending on policy, the military may have to fund.

=== Arguments for inclusion ===

By excluding a demographic from equal service, militaries are overtly intensifying the stigma of that group's civic inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;Binkin M., Eitelberg M.j., ''Blacks and the military,'' (1982) Washington, DC, Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the notion that all citizens are obligated to serve their nations if the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;Herek G.M., "Sexual orientation and military service: A social science perspective," ''American Psychologist'' 48, no. 5 (1993) pp. 538-549&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing transgender military personnel to serve openly without fear of exclusion would be a huge step toward equality. It has been recognized by some academics that the inclusion of all LGBT personnel in the military is more than a mere human rights issue, it is argued that for militaries to survive in the twenty-first century diversity is critical.&lt;ref name="hcss"/&gt;

With advancements in the current understanding of human experience, sexual identity is now better understood. Where being transgender was once considered a [[paraphilic disorder]], the current [[DSM V|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] places being transgender in a separate chapter, terming the condition [[gender dysphoria]]. It is argued that militaries that exclude transgender people on grounds of mental illness, whose policies pathologize gender dysphoria, are at odds with the current medical understanding. This argument requires that transgender personnel be treated by the same level of medical care as all other personnel, in accordance with established medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gale S.P. (co-chair), Shannon M. (co-chair), "Report of the Planning Commission on Transgender Military Service" ''A nonpartisan national commission offering implementation guidance for the inclusion of openly-serving transgender personnel in the US military'' (Aug 2014) Palm Centre Blueprints for sound public policy&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts argue that there is absolutely no empirical evidence that supports the argument that transgender people are unfit for service. Often cited are factors such as a supposed predisposition of transgender individuals to problems such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; this is countered by the prevalence of these same issues in the LGB community, yet in many countries their service is not excluded.&lt;ref&gt;King M. et al., "A systematic review of mental disorder, suicide, and deliberate self harm in lesbian, gay and bisexual people," ''BMC Psychiatry'' 8 (2008) pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://lgbtpov.frontiersla.com/2012/10/24/carpenter-why-lgb-people-should-care-about-trans-bias-in-the-military/ ''Carpenter: Why LGB people should care about trans bias in the military'']'' Tom Carpenter &amp; Karen Ocamb, LGBt POV, (24 October 2012) Retrieved 28 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; By creating a more accepting environment, distress that transgender personnel feel might be mitigated if they may serve openly with full support.&lt;ref&gt;Ross A., "The Invisible Army: Why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members" 23 ''S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J.'' (2014) p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst militaries often cite the high medical cost of transgender people, they fail to reconcile this argument with current standards with other service members. For example, militaries often allow hormone treatments for an array of reasons and conditions, besides gender dysphoria; a common hormone treatment being contraceptive. Furthermore, the often cited risks of cross hormone treatment are rare,&lt;ref&gt;Asscheman H. et al., "A long-term follow up study of mortality in transsexual receiving treatment with cross-sex hormones," ''European Journal of Endocrinology'' 164, 4 (2011) pp. 635&lt;/ref&gt; and not likely to cause any significant issues to the military. Whilst the cost of gender reassignment surgery is high,&lt;ref name="Sex Reassignment Surgery"/&gt; it is suggested that fewer than 2% of transgender members per year will choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="Elders"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elders |first=M.

The 18 confirmed cases are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps one of the most supporting arguments is based on the experiences of the 18 countries that currently allow transgender service. Research on the impacts of allowing LGBT to serve openly in the [[Israel Defense Forces#LGBT people|Israeli Defense Forces]], [[Sexual orientation and the military of the United Kingdom|British Armed Forces]], and [[Sexual orientation and the Canadian military|Canadian Armed Forces]] found no necessary negative impacts on performance, unit cohesion or morality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin A., Levitt M., "Homosexuality and the Israel Defense Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?," 27 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 4 ( 2001) p. 544; Belkin and Evans, "The Effects of Including Gay and Lesbian Soldiers in the British Armed Forces," 4; Belkin A., McNichol J., "Homosexual Personnel Policy in the Canadian Forces: Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance?," 56 ''Canadian International Journal'' 1 (2000) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of unit cohesion can also be demonstrated by a social study conducted less than one year prior to the repeal of the ban preventing transgender personnel from serving openly in the United States military. Morten G. Ender, David E. Rohall, and Michael D. Matthews presented the American military academy, Reserve Officers Training Corps, and civilian undergraduates with a survey to assess the general attitude on the prospect of the transgender community serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. After statistical analysis, 50.8% of individuals disagreed with the ban. In regards to productivity, 72.6% of subjects say that transgender inclusion would have no impact on their ability to do their job. Finally, on the subject of visibility, 21.8% of those interviewed said they would want transgender individuals to tell them their gender preferences, 56.1% said no preference. Overall, based on this study one year prior to the ban, the majority of the people that participated in the survey showed overwhelming support towards the inclusion of the transgender community in the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ender|first1=Morton G.|last2=Matthews|first2=Michael D.|last3=Rohall|first3=David E.|title=Cadet and Civilian Undergraduate Attitudes toward Transgender People|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|date=2016|volume=42.2|pages=427–435}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2017, ruling that a renewed ban within the US military should not go into force, US District Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] stated that the evidence presented up to that time showed that ''"all of the reasons proffered ... for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself"''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-transgender-20171030-story.html|title=Federal court blocks Trump's ban on transgender people in the military|first=W.

As of 2014, France allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces.&lt;ref name=Elders /&gt; The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.&lt;ref name="18 countries" /&gt;

In France, the military is sometimes initially more accepting of transgender service members than civilian authorities are, at least in some localities and jurisdictions, but they are also influenced by rulings of civilian courts which have strict requirements about changing identity documents. One service member was whipsawed by initially positive reception in the military, later overruled after a civilian court decision.

In 2009, a transgender [[Adjutant#France|Adjutant]] in the [[French Air Force]] who had already served 18 years as a man, returned to her unit in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] as a woman after a sick leave. Her superiors took stock of the situation, and provided the necessary uniforms and military papers with her new name. Delphine Ravisé-Giard was reintegrated into the military smoothly and without incident. On the other hand, she had difficulties in civilian life, such as when presenting her driver's license, passport, or other papers. The military then issued a request to the Nancy {{ill|Tribunal de grande instance (France)|fr||lt=District Court}} to have her gender and name altered on her birth certificate, but their decision was negative based on the fact that she had not yet undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]] so her situation was reversible. A 1992 decision by the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]]'' (Court of Appeals) requires those wishing to change their legal documents to show proof of being diagnosed with "transsexual syndrome" which is listed as a long-term psychiatric disorder in France, and to have undergone surgical intervention, but the Adjutant declared that she had no "long-term psychiatric disorder", and any question about any surgical interventions she had or didn't have was her private affair. Her lawyer insinuated that the real reason for the denial had to do with her ability to still have a child, and that the court's objective was sterilization before they would accord a legal name and gender change. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] of the [[European Council]] said that a transgender person "seeking to have their gender identity legally recognized should not be forced to submit to sterilization or to any other medical treatment."&lt;ref name=Tissier-2009&gt;{{cite web |language=French |last1=Tissier |first1=Julia |date=13 August 2009 |title=Femme à l’armée, homme au civil |trans-title=In the Army, a Woman; to City Hall, a Man |url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2009/08/13/femme-a-l-armee-homme-au-civil_575661 |website=[[Libération]] |location=Paris |accessdate=3 November 2017 |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in December, following the District Court decision, [[Hervé Morin]], the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Minister of Defense]], ordered her to turn in her military papers, which she did. Meanwhile, she discovered that the name on her pay stub reverted to her old name, that the military supplement that women service members receive for feminine undergarments had been removed, and that the military was even going to dock her pay for the supplement she received while serving two years as a woman.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |language=French |last1=Mercier |first1=Philippe |date=11 February 2010 |title=Nancy: militaire transgenre au rapport |trans-title=Transgender Soldier On Report |url=http://www.estrepublicain.fr/actualite/2010/02/11/nancy-militaire-transgenre-au-rapport |website=[[L'Est Républicain]] |issn=1760-4958 |publisher=Societe Du Journal L'est Republicain |location=Nancy |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, identity documents may not be changed. All males must show up for the military conscription event on draft day, and [[kathoey]]s are not exempt from this requirement. It is possible for [[kathoey]]s to get an exemption certificate that will allow them to avoid service, but they must still attend, in order to present the document and be dismissed. As a result, on draft day, lines of people awaiting processing may include transgender women in makeup and feminine attire, waiting along with the male draftees. Contrary to the wide impression of acceptance of transgender women in Thailand, many complain about being treated as second-class citizens, and of the stress of being undressed or publicly humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transsexuals are forced to stand in line for army conscription in dresses and skirts as 100,000 21-year-old men are drafted into the Thai military |last1= |first1= |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4381806/Trans-women-forced-army-conscription-Thailand.html |date=5 April 2017 |website=Mail Online |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nightmare looms for transgender Thais at army draft |last1=Tanakasempipat |first1=Patpicha |last2=Kittisilpa |first2=Juarawee |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-armydraft/nightmare-looms-for-transgender-thais-at-army-draft-idUSKBN1780FS |date=5 April 2017 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher= |accessdate=3 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' military policy previously allowed for exclusion of transgender people from service on medical grounds. While gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members were allowed to serve openly since 2011, transgender service members risked discharge if they did not pass as their assigned sex. This required that service members conceal their gender identities throughout service.&lt;ref&gt;Ross A., "The invisible army: why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members," ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'' 23 (2014) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Donald Trump administration ====
On 26 July 2017, US President [[Donald Trump]] announced that transgender people would no longer be allowed to serve in the US military.&lt;ref name="bbc-26jul2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump: Transgender people 'can't serve' in US military|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40729996|accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=BBC|date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, General [[Joseph Dunford]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], stated that openly transgender people will continue to be allowed to serve until Trump provides direction to [[James Mattis]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].&lt;ref name="guardian-27jul2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense chiefs resist Donald Trump's ban on transgender troops|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/27/donald-trump-transgender-ban-troops-pentagon-us-military|accessdate=27 July 2017|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palm Center]] released, on 1 August 2017, a letter signed by 56 retired generals and admirals opposing the proposed ban on transgender military service members. The letter stated that if implemented, the ban "would cause significant disruptions, deprive the military of mission-critical talent and compromise the integrity of transgender troops who would be forced to live a lie, as well as non-transgender peers who would be forced to choose between reporting their comrades or disobeying policy".&lt;ref name="guardian-1aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Sam|title=Top military officials call on Trump to reverse transgender ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/01/donald-trump-transgender-ban-us-military|accessdate=24 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2017, five transgender United States military personnel sued Trump and top [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon officials]] over the proposed banning of transgender people from serving in the military.&lt;ref name=apvnp /&gt;&lt;ref name="aug9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawsuit Opposes Trump’s Ban on Transgender Military Service|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/lawsuit-opposes-trump-s-ban-transgender-military-service-n791241|website=NBC News|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=24 August 2017|location=New York|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit asks the court to prevent the ban from going into effect.&lt;ref name=apvnp&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Savage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/politics/5-transgender-service-members-sue-trump-over-military-ban.html|title=5 Transgender Service Members Sue Trump Over Military Ban - The New York Times|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=9 August 2017|access-date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aug9"/&gt; Two major LGBT-rights organizations filed a petition in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|United States District Court in Washington]] on behalf of the five transgender service members.&lt;ref name="aug9"/&gt;

Trump signed a presidential memorandum, dated 25 August 2017, directing the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an implementation plan by 21 February 2018, to reinstate the ban and halt the use of military funds for "sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel".&lt;ref name=Trump-170825&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/25/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-and-secretary-homeland |title=Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security |author=Trump, Donald J. |date=25 August 2017 |publisher=The White House |access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2017, US District Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] barred the administration from excluding transgender people from military service in ''[[Jane Doe v. Trump]]'', but did not address whether federal funds should be used to pay for [[sex reassignment surgery]] for service members.&lt;ref name="30 Oct"&gt;{{cite web|title=DC court bars Trump from reversing transgender troops policy|url=https://apnews.com/31fe75346ad147ba9db0396d62aa741d|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=30 October 2017|location=Washington|date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling also stated that that as far as could be seen, ''"all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself"''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt;

In November 2017, the [[Defense Health Agency]] for the first time approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty US military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who is a transwoman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on 14 November at a private hospital, since US military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise.&lt;ref name="FirstMilitarySRS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kube|first1=Courtney|title=Pentagon to pay for surgery for transgender soldier|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pentagon-oks-surgery-transgender-soldier-military-hospital-n820721|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=14 November 2017|location=Washington|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December, Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the government must accept transgender recruits into the military by 1 January 2018.&lt;ref name="Kheel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kheel|first1=Rebecca|title=Judge denies Trump request to delay transgender military enlistment|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/364283-judge-denies-trump-request-to-delay-transgender-military-enlistment|publisher=''The Hill''|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ruling, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] to issue a [[Stay of execution|stay]] on the district court's ruling.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crawford|first1=Jamie|last2=de Vogue|first2=Ariane|title=DOJ appeals ruling that transgender people are free to enlist in US military|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/politics/us-pentagon-transgender-enlist/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pentagon confirmed on 26 February 2018 that the first transgender recruit had signed a contract to join the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/375626-first-transgender-recruit-signs-contract-to-join-military|title=First transgender recruit signs contract to join military|last=Kheel|first=Rebecca|publisher=The Hill|date=26 February 2018|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- See talk before editing --&gt;

On March 23, 2018, President Trump banned transgender and transsexual people with current or previous gender dysphoria from serving in the U.S. military. However, the Pentagon said they would comply with the court decision until it is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/trumps-new-transgender-military-ban/556445/|title=The Murkiness of Trump's New Transgender Military Ban|first=David A.|last=Graham|date=|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/news/military/Trump-order-would-ban-most-transgender-troops-from-serving_166692622|title=Trump order would ban most transgender troops from serving|author=|date=24 March 2018|website=tbo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=Transgender+ban&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=588AAB3432742330259A588AAB3432742330259A&amp;FORM=VIRE|title=Transgender ban - Bing video|author=|date=|website=www.bing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] in ''[[Karnoski vs. Trump]]'' (Western District of Washington) on 13 April 2018, when the court ruled that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a [[protected class]] entitled to [[strict scrutiny]] of adverse laws (or at worst, a [[quasi-suspect class]]), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/judge-blocks-trump-transgender-military-ban/index.html|title=Judge blocks enforcement of transgender military ban|first=Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court|last=Reporter|date=|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2018/04/district-judge-holds-transgender-military-ban-subject-to-strict-scrutiny.html|title=Constitutional Law Prof Blog: District Judge Holds Transgender Military Ban Subject to Strict Scrutiny|author=|date=|website=lawprofessors.typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/karnoskivtrump.pdf|title=District Court, West District Washington, Karnoski v Trump, 13 April 2018|author=|date=|website=typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2017/12/another-district-judge-issues-preliminary-injunction-against-transgender-military-ban-.html|title=Constitutional Law Prof Blog: Another District Judge Issues Preliminary Injunction Against Transgender Military Ban|author=|date=|website=lawprofessors.typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

True Blue Crew are considered to be a [[far right]], [[nationalist]], [[neo-Nazi]] group. They have been described by academics as displaying "overt white racism, xenophobia and social conservatism aimed at bolstering male values and privilege. They understand themselves as Australian patriots preserving and protecting white, Anglo-Saxon heritage against particular groups including Muslims, Jews, immigrants and indigenous Australians."&lt;ref name="BessantFarthing2017"/&gt;

[[Image:Spare seife aber wie.jpg|thumb|A German poster telling the public how to save soap and oil during wartime]]

A '''war economy''' is the set of contingencies undertaken by a modern [[State (polity)|state]] to mobilize its [[economy]] for war production. [[Philippe Le Billon]] describes a war economy as a "system of producing, mobilizing and allocating resources to sustain the violence." Some measures taken include the increasing of [[Taylor rule|Taylor rates]] as well as the introduction of [[resource allocation]] programs. Needless to say, every country approaches the reconfiguration of its economy in a different way.

Many states increase the degree of [[planned economy|planning]] in their economies during wars; in many cases this extends to [[rationing]], and in some cases to [[conscription]] for [[civil defense]]s, such as the [[Women's Land Army]] and [[Bevin Boys]] in the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]].

[[List of Presidents of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] stated if the [[Axis powers]] won, then "we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a [[Militarism| militaristic]] power on the basis of war economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrarsenalofdemocracy.html |first=Franklin Delano |last=Roosevelt |title=The Great Arsenal of Democracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[total war]] situations, certain buildings and positions are often seen as important targets by [[combatant]]s. The [[Union blockade]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[List of American Civil War generals (Union)|General]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] during the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of enemy cities and factories during World War II]] are all examples of total war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert B.|last=Durham|title=Supplying the Enemy: The Modern Arms Industry &amp; the Military–Industrial Complex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-LSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-329-06755-4|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the side of [[aggregate demand]], this concept has been linked to the concept of "[[military Keynesianism]]", in which the government's [[military budget]] stabilizes [[business cycle]]s and fluctuations and/or is used to fight [[recession]]s.

On the [[supply (economics)|supply]] side, it has been observed that wars sometimes have the effect of accelerating [[technological progress|progress of technology]] to such an extent that an economy is greatly strengthened after the war, especially if it has avoided the war-related destruction. This was the case, for example, with the [[United States]] in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some economists (such as [[Seymour Melman]]) argue, however, that the wasteful nature of much of military spending eventually can hurt technological progress.

== United States ==

The United States alone has a very complex history with wartime economies. Many notable instances came during the twentieth century in which America’s main conflicts consisted of the World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam.

=== World War I ===
[[File:"Liberty Loan is the cash register of Patriotism. Has Uncle Sam Rung Up Your Bond Purchase Yet^ Banks will receive... - NARA - 512718.jpg|thumb|U.S. Food Administration, educational division poster]]

In mobilizing for World War I, the United States expanded its governmental powers by creating institutions such as the [[War Industries Board]] (WIB) to help with military production.&lt;ref name="Henretta REVISED"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henretta, Edwards, Self|first=James A., Rebecca, Robert O.|title=America's History|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|pages=672+}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the [[Federal Fuel Administration|Fuel Administration]], introduced daylight saving time in an effort to save coal and oil while the [[United States Food Administration|Food Administration]] encouraged higher grain production and “mobilized a spirit of self-sacrifice rather than mandatory rationing.”&lt;ref name="Henretta REVISED" /&gt; Propaganda also played a large part in garnering support for topics ranging from tax initiatives to food conservation. Speaking on Four Minute Men, volunteers who rallied the public through short speeches, [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[George Creel]] stated that the idea was extremely popular and the program saw thousands of volunteers throughout the states.&lt;ref name="Creel REVISED"&gt;{{cite book|last=Creel|first=George|title=How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information That Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe|year=1920|publisher=Harper and Bros.|location=New York|pages=84–88, 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

In the case of the Second World War, the U.S. government took similar measures in increasing its control over the economy. The Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] provided the spark needed to begin conversion to a wartime economy. With this attack, Washington felt that a greater bureaucracy was needed to help with mobilization.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{cite web|last=Tassava|first=Christopher|title=The American Economy During World War II|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/tassava.WWII|work=EH.net|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government raised taxes which paid for half of the war’s costs and borrowed money in the form of war bonds to cover the rest of the bill.&lt;ref name="Henretta REVISED" /&gt; “Commercial institutions like banks also bought billions of dollars of bonds and other treasury paper, holding more than $24 billion at the war’s end."&lt;ref name=EH /&gt; The creation of a handful of agencies helped funnel resources towards the war effort. One prominent agency was the [[War Production Board]] (WPB), which “awarded defense contracts, allocated scarce resources – such as rubber, copper, and oil – for military uses, and persuaded businesses to convert to military production."&lt;ref name="Henretta REVISED" /&gt; Two-thirds of the American economy had been integrated into the war effort by the end of 1943.&lt;ref name="Henretta REVISED" /&gt; Because of this massive cooperation between government and private entities, it could be argued that the economic measures enacted prior to and during the Second World War helped lead the Allies to victory.

== Germany ==

=== World War I ===

Germany has experienced economic devastation following both World Wars. While this was not a result of faulty economic planning, it is important to understand the ways that Germany approached reconstruction. In World War I, the German agricultural sector was hit hard by the demands of the war effort. Not only were many of the workers conscripted, but lots of the food itself was allocated for the troops leading to a shortage.&lt;ref name="Blum REVISED"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Matthias|title=Government Decisions Before and During the First World War and the Living Standards in Germany During a Drastic Natural Experiment|journal=Explorations in Economic History|date=December 2011|volume=48|issue=4|pages=556–567|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498311000325|accessdate=2012-03-27|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2011.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; “German authorities were not able to solve the food scarcity [problem], but implemented a food rationing system and several price ceilings to prevent speculation and profiteering. Unfortunately, these measures did not have the desired success."&lt;ref name="Blum REVISED" /&gt;

=== World War II ===
{{see also|Economy of Nazi Germany#Wartime policies: 1939–1945}}
Heading into the [[Second World War]], the Nazis introduced new policies that not only caused the unemployment rate to drop, it created a competent war machine in clear violation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The [[Third Reich]] implemented a draft and built factories to supply its quickly expanding military. Both of these actions created jobs for many Germans who had been struggling from the economic collapse following World War I.&lt;ref name="Trueman REVISED"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trueman|first=Chris|title=The Nazis and the German Economy|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/nazis_and_the_german_economy.htm|work=History Learning Site|publisher=HistoryLearningSite.co.uk|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is worth noting that while unemployment rates plummeted, “by 1939, government debt stood at over 40 billion Reichsmarks."&lt;ref name="Trueman REVISED" /&gt; After World War II, Germany was discovered to have exploited the economies of the countries it invaded. The most important among these, according to historians Boldorf and Scherner, was France and “her highly developed economy… [being] one of the biggest in Europe.”&lt;ref name="Boldorf and Scherner REVISED"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldorf|first1=Marcel|first2=Jonas |last2=Scherner|title=France's Occupation Costs and the War in the East: The Contribution to the German War Economy, 1940-4|journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |date=April 2012|volume=47|pages=291–316 |url=http://jch.sagepub.com/content/47/2/291.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2012-04-25|issue=2|doi=10.1177/0022009411431711}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further supported when they later reveal how the French economy provided for 11 percent of Germany’s national income (during the occupation) which covered five months of Germany’s total income for the war. Using extortion and forced labor, the Nazis siphoned off much of France's economic output. For example, during the early months of the Nazi occupation, the French puppet government was forced to pay a "quartering" fee of twenty million Reichmarks per day. Supposedly, the fee was payment for the Nazi occupation forces. In reality, the money was used to fuel the Nazi war economy.&lt;ref name="Boldorf and Scherner REVISED" /&gt; Germany employed numerous methods to support its war effort. However, due to the Nazi’s surrender to the Allies, it is hard to tell what their economic policies would have yielded in the long term.

The '''Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago''' (WASA) is the sole [[water]] and [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] provider in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It was formed in 1965 by an Act of [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]] to manage the [[Hollis Reservoir|Hollis]], [[Caroni–Arena Dam|Caroni–Arena]] and [[Navet Dam|Navet]] dams in Trinidad. In Tobago, WASA maintains the [[Hillsborough Reservoir]] along with other freshwater wells to provide municipal drinking water for the country. The purview of the authority extends to the country's [[sewage treatment plant]]s.

==History==

The Water and Sewerage Authority was formed by Act 16 of 1965 and enacted on September 1, 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wasa.gov.tt|title=WASA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This Act brought together several agencies that were formerly charged with the responsibility of providing water and sewerage facilities to the nation: 

* The Central Water Distribution Authority
* The Port of Spain City Council
* The San Fernando Borough Council
* The Arima Borough Council
* The County Councils
* The Water Division of the Ministry of Public Utilities
* The Sanitation Division of the Ministry of Public Utilities

==Infrastructure==

The authority is the largest public utility in the country. It serves over 92% of the population with pipeborne water through private house connections and standpipes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2017-12-13/wasa-5bn-debt|title=WASA $5bn in debt|website=The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since its establishment, water production has increased from 223,000 cubic metres to 650,000 cubic metres in 1990. 

With respect to wastewater, 30%&amp;ndash;40% of the population is served by a central sewerage collection and treatment system. Another 40% of the population are served by cesspit-tank soil-absorption field systems. Those remaining are served by pit latrines (outhouses).

==Sport==

The authority is represented by WASA FC, currently playing in the [[National Super League]], the second tier of the Trinidadian and Tobagonian football league structure.

'''Wazira''' ({{lang-ar|وزيرة}}) is a high-ranking female official title that means [[Minister (government)|Minister]] of a Muslim or Arab regime. During the Abbasid Caliphate, [[Vizier|Wazir]] ({{lang|ar| وزير}}) which represents the title of a male Minister was used for the first time. In the modern age, and due to equitable participation of women in politics and government, the Wazira title have become commonly used in many countries within the MENA region, Brunei and the Indian subcontinent.

Nowadays, a Wazira fully acts as a politician who holds significant public office in a national or regional government, making and implementing decisions on policies alongside and equally to other male ministers who carry a title of a Wazir.

Wazira is also a name of a village in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]]. It is located at 34°3'0N 73°7'0E with an altitude of 759 metres (2493 feet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PK/3/Wazira.html Location of Wazira- Falling Rain Genomics]&lt;/ref&gt;
