      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6247">'''Alexander Bogomolny''' (January 4, 1948{{spaced ndash}}July 7, 2018) was an [[Israeli American]] mathematician. He was known for creating and maintaining the mathematically themed educational website ''Cut-the-Knot'' for the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA) Online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maa.org/news/cut-the-knot-by-alex-bogomolny Cut The Knot!, by Alex Bogomolny] Mathematical Association of America&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote extensively about arithmetic, probability, algebra, geometry, trigononometry and mathematical games.  He was a pioneer in mathematical education on the internet, having started ''Cut-the-Knot'' in  October 1996.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[https://mathtango.blogspot.com/2014/03/alexander-bogomolny-cut-knot.html Interview with Alexander Bogomolny] MathTango, March 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic career==
Bogomolny got his master's degree in mathematics from [[Moscow State University]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=gene/&gt; From 1971 to 1974 he was a Junior research fellow at the [[Moscow Institute of Electronics and Mathematics]] in [[Moscow]]. He emigrated to Israel and became a senior programmer at Lake Kinneret Research Laboratory in [[Tiberias, Israel]] (1974{{spaced ndash}}1977) and a software consultant at [[Ben Gurion University]] in Negev, [[Be’er Sheva]], Israel (1976{{spaced ndash}}1977). From 1976 to 1983 he was a Senior Instructor and researcher at [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem, Israel|Jerusalem]].  He got his Ph.D. at Hebrew University in 1981.  His dissertation was ''A New Numerical Solution for the Stamp Problem'' and his thesis advisor was [[Gregory I. Eskin]].&lt;ref name=gene&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=81954}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 and 1982 he was also a Visiting Professor at [[Ohio State University]] where he taught undergraduate mathematics.&lt;ref name=resume&gt;[https://www.cut-the-knot.org/AcResume.shtml Alexander Bogomolny resume]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

From 1984 to 1989 he was a Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name=link/&gt; From July 1987 to November 1990 he was Vice President of Software Development at CompuDoc, Inc.&lt;ref name=link&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderbogomolnypublic Linked in: Alexander Bogomolny] software developer at CTK Software Development&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cut-the-knot==
Cut-the-knot (CTC) was a free, advertisement-funded [[educational website]] which  Bogomolny maintained from 1996 to 2017.  It was devoted to popular exposition of various topics in [[mathematics]]. The site was designed for teachers, children and parents, and anyone else curious about mathematics, with an eye to educating, encouraging interest, and provoking curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-07-09|url=https://aperiodical.com/2018/07/alexander-bogomolny-creator-of-cut-the-knot-has-died/|title=Alexander Bogomolny, creator of Cut the Knot, has died}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is a reference to the legend of [[Alexander the Great]]'s solution to the [[Gordian knot]].

CTC won more than 20 awards from scientific and educational publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-01-18|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/awards.shtml|title=Cut-the-Knot's list of awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a ''[[Scientific American]]'' Web Award in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-01-18|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00077DD8-59F2-1ECA-8E1C809EC588EF21|title=Scientific American 2003 Sci/Tech Web Awards: Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''{{'}}s Internet Guide Award,{{Ref|awards Awards}} and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''{{'}}s NetWatch award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=285|issue=5424|date=1999-07-02|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|title=Site Visit: Mathematical Wonders|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/285/5424/7.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was remarkably prolific and contained extensive analysis of many of the classic problems in recreational mathematics including the [[Apollonian gasket]], [[Napoleon's theorem]], [[logarithmic spiral]]s, [[The Prisoner of Benda]], the [[Pitot theorem]], and [[the monkey and the coconuts]] problem. Once, in a remarkable ''tour de force'', CTC published 122 proofs of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml Cut-the-Knot: Proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogomolny did indeed entertain but his deeper goal was to educate.  He wrote a manifesto for CTC in which he said that "Judging Mathematics by its pragmatic value is like judging symphony by the weight of its score."&lt;ref&gt;[https://naturalmath.com/mathfuture/eventslist/4371/cut-the-knot.html Alexander Bogomolny] Natural Math.com&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the site as "a resource that would help learn, if not math itself, then, at least, ways to appreciate its beauty." And he wonders why it is acceptable among otherwise well-educated people "to confess a dislike and misunderstanding of Mathematics as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-01-18|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/manifesto/index.shtml|title=Cut-the-Knot's manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical ideas are illustrated by [[applet]]s. CTK wiki (powered by [[PmWiki]]) extends the main site with additional mathematical content, especially that with more complicated formulae than available on the main site.

==Personal life==
Bogomolny had to leave academia because he had an uncorrectable hearing problem and was practically deaf in latter years.&lt;ref name=crikeu&gt;[https://www.gaussianos.com/ha-muerto-alexander-bogomolny-creador-de-cut-the-knot/ Obituary of Alexander Bogomolny] By Gary Ernest Davis in Crikey Math, July 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ammoniaphone.jpg|thumb|789x789px|The [http://musikverket.se/scenkonstmuseet/?lang=en Swedish] Museum of Performing Arts ammoniaphone M812]]
'''Ammoniaphone''' was a voice improvement device invented by Dr. [[Carter Moffat]]. It was introduced in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dr. Carter Moffat's Ammoniaphone|last=Carter|first=Moffat|publisher=Nabu Press|year=|isbn=978-1246294781|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background. ==
[[File:Ammoniaphone advert.jpg|alt=Newspaper advert for the ammoniaphone|thumb|Ammoniaphone advert.]]
Moffat thought that the explanation that so many good singers came from [[Italy]] must have something to do with the [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]]. When given the opportunity to travel to Italy (according to a newspaper clipping to solve a chemical problem of industrial importance – an assignment he completed so successfully that he was awarded a diploma of honor and a gold medal by the Italian government) he set about testing the air in Italy to reveal its secrets. He discovered that, along with traces of [[essential oil]]s from [[herb]]s, Italian air contained considerable amounts of "[[Hydrogen peroxide - urea|peroxide of hydrogen]]", and "free [[ammonia]]". He then created a device that could reproduce this mixture and administer it in appropriate doses.

Ammoniaphone M812 is on permanent display at the [[Swedish Museum of Performing Arts]] / [[Scenkonstmuseet]].

The '''AutoAnalyzer''' is an [[automated analyzer]] using a flow technique called continuous flow analysis (CFA), first made by the [[Technicon Corporation]].   The instrument was invented in 1957 by Leonard Skeggs, PhD and commercialized by Jack Whitehead's Technicon Corporation.  The first applications were for clinical analysis, but methods for industrial analysis soon followed. The design is based on separating a continuously flowing stream with air bubbles.

==Operating principle==
In continuous flow analysis (CFA) a continuous stream of material is divided by air bubbles into discrete segments in which chemical reactions occur. The continuous stream of liquid samples and reagents are combined and transported in tubing and mixing coils. The tubing passes the samples from one apparatus to the other with each apparatus performing different functions, such as distillation, dialysis, extraction, ion exchange, heating, incubation, and subsequent recording of a signal. An essential principle of the system is the introduction of air bubbles. The air bubbles segment each sample into discrete packets and act as a barrier between packets to prevent cross contamination as they travel down the length of the tubing. The air bubbles also assist mixing by creating turbulent flow (bolus flow), and provide operators with a quick and easy check of the flow characteristics of the liquid. Samples and standards are treated in an exactly identical manner as they travel the length of the tubing, eliminating the necessity of a steady state signal, however, since the presence of bubbles create an almost square wave profile, bringing the system to steady state does not significantly decrease throughput ( third generation CFA analyzers average 90 or more samples per hour) and is desirable in that steady state signals (chemical equilibrium) are more accurate and reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;Coakly, William A., ''Handbook of Automated Analysis'', Mercel Dekker, 1981 p 61&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuous flow analyzer (CFA) consists of different modules including a sampler, pump, mixing coils, optional sample treatments (dialysis, distillation, heating, etc.), a detector, and data generator. Most continuous flow analyzers depend on [[color reaction]]s using a flow through photometer, however, also methods have been developed that use ISE, flame photometry, ICAP, fluorometry, and so forth.

===Flow injection analyzer===
{{Main|Flow Injection Analyzer}}

Flow injection analysis (FIA), was introduced in 1975 by Ruzicka and Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flow injection analyses: I. New concept of fast continuous-flow analysis|journal=Anal. Chim. Acta |year=1975|first=Rulika|last=J.|author2=Hansen, E. H.|volume=78|issue=|pages=145–157|id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1016/S0003-2670(01)84761-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of FIA technology, termed flow injection (FI), was inspired by the AutoAnalyzer technique invented by Skeggs in early 1950s.&lt;ref name=CHFInstrument&gt;{{cite web|title=Technicon AutoAnalyzer Sampler Unit |url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/collections/collection-items/scientific-instruments/technicon-autoanalyzer-sampler-unit.aspx |website=Chemical Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105203237/http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/collections/collection-items/scientific-instruments/technicon-autoanalyzer-sampler-unit.aspx |archivedate=5 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rocco&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocco|first1=edited by Richard M.|title=Landmark papers in clinical chemistry.|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-444-51950-4|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JCud501pTYC&amp;pg=PA309|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Skeggs' AutoAnalyzer uses air segmentation to separate a flowing stream into numerous discrete segments to establish a long train of individual samples moving through a flow channel, FIA systems separate each sample from subsequent sample with a carrier reagent. While the AutoAnalyzer mixes sample homogeneously with reagents, in all FIA techniques sample and reagents are merged to form a concentration gradient that yields analysis results. 

FIA methods can be used for both fast reactions as well as slow reactions. For slow reactions, a heater is often utilized.   The reaction does not need to reach completion since all samples and standards are given the same period to react.  For typical assays commonly measured with FIA (e.g., nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, phosphate) it is not uncommon to have a throughput of 60-120 samples per hour. 

FIA methods are limited by the amount of time necessary to obtain a measurable signal since travel time through the tubing tends to broaden peaks to the point where samples can merge with each other. As a general rule, FIA methods should not be used if an adequate signal cannot be obtained within two minutes, and preferably less than one.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Reactions that need longer reaction times should be segmented. However,considering the  number of FIA publications and wide  variety of uses of FIA for serial assays, the "one minute" time limitation does not seem to be a serious limitation for most real life assays.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Yet, assays based on slow chemical reactions have to be carried either in stopped flow mode ( SIA) or by segmenting the flow. 
 
OI Analytical, in its gas diffusion amperometric total cyanide method, uses a segmented flow injection analysis technique that allows reaction times of up to 10 minutes by flow injection analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oico.com/default.aspx?id%3Dproduct%26productid%3D94 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030194710/http://www.oico.com/default.aspx?id=product&amp;productid=94 |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technicon experimented with FIA long before it was championed by Ruzicka and Hansen. Andres Ferrari reported that analysis was possible without bubbles if flow rates were increased and tubing diameters decreased.&lt;ref&gt;(Technicon Symposia, 1967, Vol I)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Skegg's first attempts at the auto analyzer did not segment. Technicon chose to not pursue FIA because it increased reagent consumption and the cost of analysis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The second generation of the FIA technique, called sequential injection analysis (SIA), was conceived in 1990 by Ruzicka and Marshal,  and has been further developed and miniaturized over the course of the following decade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} It uses flow programming instead of the continuous flow regime (as used by CFA and FIA), that allows the flow rate and flow direction to be tailored to the need of individual steps of analytical protocol. Reactants are mixed by flow reversals and a measurement is carried out while the reaction mixture is arrested within the detector by stopping the flow. Microminiaturized chromatography is carried out on microcolumns that are automatically renewed by microfluidic manipulations. The discrete pumping and metering of microliter sample and reagent volumes used in SI only generates waste per each sample injection. The enormous volume of FI and SI literature documents the versatility of FI and SI and their usefulness for routine assays (in soil, water, environmental, biochemical and biotechnological assays) has demonstrated their potential to be used as a versatile research tool.

===Dialyzer module===

In medical testing applications and industrial samples with high concentrations or interfering material, there is often a [[Dialysis (biochemistry)|dialyzer]] module in the instrument in which the analyte permeates through a dialysis membrane into a separate flow path going on to further analysis.  The purpose of a dialyzer is to separate the analyte from interfering substances such as [[protein]], whose large [[molecule]]s do not go through the dialysis membrane but go to a separate waste stream.  The reagents, sample and reagent volumes, flow rates, and other aspects of the instrument analysis depend on which analyte is being measured. The autoanalyzer is also a very small machine

===Recording of results===

Previously a [[chart recorder]] and more recently a [[data logger]] or [[personal computer]] records the detector output as a function of time so that each sample output appears as a peak whose height depends on the analyte level in the sample.

==Commercialization==
Technicon sold its business to Revlon in 1980 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wi.mit.edu/about/25th/jack/jack2.html Whitehead Institute - Making clinical progress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626003008/http://www.wi.mit.edu/about/25th/jack/jack2.html |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later sold the company to separate clinical (Bayer) and industrial (Bran+Luebbe - now SEAL Analytical) buyers in 1987. At the time, industrial applications accounted for about 20% of CFA machines sold.

In 1974 Ruzicka and Hansen carried out in [[Denmark]] and in [[Brasil]] initial experiments on a competitive technique, that they termed [[flow injection analysis]] (FIA). Since then the technique found worldwide use in research and routine applications, and was further modified through  miniaturization and by replacing continuous flow with computer controlled programmable flow.

During the 1960s industrial laboratories were hesitant to use the autoanalyzer. Acceptance by regulatory agencies eventually came about by demonstration that the techniques are no different from a recording spectrophotometer with reagents and samples added at the exact chemical ratios as traditionally accepted manual methods.&lt;ref&gt;Coakly, William A., ''Handbook of Automated Analysis'', Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known of Technicon's CFA instruments are the AutoAnalyzer II (introduced 1970), the Sequential Multiple Analyzer (SMA, 1969), and the Sequential Multiple Analyzer with Computer (SMAC, 1974). The Autoanalyzer II (AAII) is the instrument that most EPA methods were written on and reference.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The AAII is a second generation segmented flow analyzer that uses 2 millimeter ID glass tubing and pumps reagent at flow rates of 2 - 3 milliliters per minute. Typical sample throughput for the AAII is 30 - 60 samples per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Galen Wood, ''Analytical Instrumentation Handbook, Second Edition'' pp152&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation segmented flow analyzers were proposed in the literature,&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Patton, ''PhD. Dissertation, ''Michigan State University (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; but not developed commercially until Alpkem introduced the RFA 300 in 1984. The RFA 300 pumps at flow rates less than  1 milliliter per minute through 1 millimeter ID glass mixing coils. Throughput on the RFA can approach 360 samples per hour, but averages closer to 90 samples per hour on most environmental tests. In 1986, Technicon (Bran+Luebbe) introduced its own microflow TRAACS-800 system.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Galen Wood, ''Analytical Instrumentation Handbook, Second Edition'' pp153&lt;/ref&gt;

Bran+Luebbe continued to manufacture the AutoAnalyzer II and TRAACS, a micro-flow analyzer for environmental and other samples, introduced the AutoAnalyzer 3 in 1997 and the QuAAtro in 2004. The Bran+Luebbe CFA business was bought by SEAL Analytical in 2006 and they continue to manufacture, sell and support the AutoAnalyzer II/3 and QuAAtro CFA systems, as well as Discrete Analyzers.

And there are other manufacturers of CFA instruments.

Skalar Inc., subsidiary of Skalar Analytical, founded in 1965, which has its head office in Breda (NL), is since its founding an independent company, fully owned by its personnel. Development in robotic analyzers, TOC and TN equipment, and monitors has extended the product lines of its long life SAN++ Continuous Flow Analyzers. Software packages for data acquisition and analyzer control are also in house products, running with latest software demands and handles all analyzer hardware combinations.

Astoria-Pacific International, for example, was founded in 1990 by Raymond Pavitt, who previously owned Alpkem. Based in Clackamas, Oregon, U.S.A., Astoria-Pacific manufactures its own micro-flow systems. Its products include the Astoria Analyzer lines for Environmental and Industrial applications; the SPOTCHECK Analyzer for Neonatal screening; and FASPac (Flow Analysis Software Package) for data acquisition and computer interface.

FIAlab Instruments, Inc., in Seattle, Washington, also manufactures several analyzer systems.

Alpkem was purchased by Perstorp, and then later by OI Analytical in College Station Texas. OI Analytical manufactures the only segmented flow analyzer that uses polymeric tubing in place of glass mixing coils. OI is also the only major instrument manufacturer that provides segmented flow analysis (SFA) and flow injection analysis (FIA) options on the same platform.

==Clinical analysis==
AutoAnalyzers were used mainly for routine repetitive [[medical laboratory]] [[Chemical analysis|analyses]], but they had been replaced during the last years more and more by discrete working systems which allow lower reagent consumption. These instruments typically determine levels of [[human serum albumin|albumin]], [[alkaline phosphatase]], [[aspartate transaminase|aspartate transaminase (AST)]], [[blood urea nitrogen]],  [[bilirubin]], [[calcium]], [[cholesterol]], [[creatinine]], [[glucose]], [[phosphorus|inorganic phosphorus]], [[protein]]s, and [[uric acid]] in [[blood serum]] or other bodily samples.  AutoAnalyzers automate repetitive sample analysis steps which would otherwise be done manually by a [[technician]], for such medical tests as the ones mentioned previously.  This way, an AutoAnalyzer can analyze hundreds of samples every day with one operating technician.  Early AutoAnalyzer instruments each tested multiple samples sequentially for individual analytes.  Later model AutoAnalyzers such as the SMAC tested for multiple analytes simultaneously in the samples.

In 1959 a competitive system of analysis was introduced by [[Hans Baruch]] of Research Specialties Company.  That system became known as Discrete Sample Analysis and was represented by an instrument known as the "Robot Chemist."  Over the years the Discrete Sample Analysis method slowly replaced the Continuous Flow system in the clinical laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Louis. Four Centuries of Clinical Chemistry. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, 1999. {{ISBN|90-5699-645-2}}. Pp. 490-492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial analysis==
The first industrial applications - mainly for water, soil extracts and fertilizer - used the same hardware and techniques as clinical methods, but from the mid-1970s special techniques and modules were developed so that by 1990 it was possible to perform solvent extraction, distillation, on-line filtration and UV digestion in the continuously flowing stream.  In 2005 about two thirds of systems sold worldwide were for water analysis of all kinds,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} ranging from sub-ppb levels of nutrients in seawater to much higher levels in waste water; other common applications are for soil, plant, tobacco, food, fertilizer and wine analysis.

==Current Uses==

AutoAnalyzers are still used for a few clinical applications such as neonatal screening or Anti-D, but the majority of instruments are now used for industrial and environmental work. Standardized methods published by the [[ASTM]] (ASTM International), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) for  environmental analytes such as  [[nitrite]], [[nitrate]], [[ammonia]], [[cyanide]], and [[phenol]]. Autoanalyzers are also commonly used in soil testing laboratories, fertilizer analysis, process control, seawater analysis, air contaminants, and tobacco leaf analysis.

In addition to the standard petrol-engined production models, an electric Canta was designed for the German market but it has remained at the prototype stage. In the Netherlands, it is classified as a [[mobility aid]] because the width of the vehicle is only 1.10 metres, thus it may - unlike larger microcars - be used on [[cycle path]]s as well as sidewalks and footpaths; in addition a [[driver's license]] is not required.&lt;ref name="trouw2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/bijzondere-voertuigen/vraag-en-antwoord/wat-zijn-de-verkeersregels-voor-een-gehandicaptenvoertuig-met-een-motor.html |title=Wat zijn de verkeersregels voor een gehandicaptenvoertuig met een motor? &amp;#124; Vraag en antwoord |publisher=Rijksoverheid.nl |language=nl |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Canta is built with the adaptations required by the customer, such as locating controls and switches on the left or right side, or all on the steering wheel. Seats have a wide range of adjustment and can [[Swivel seat|swivel]] to ease entry and exit. Instead of having a driver's seat, the "Ride-in Canta" ({{lang|nl|Inrij Canta}}) model is designed so that a [[wheelchair]] user can enter by a ramp at the rear and drive while seated in their wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdamlogue.com/the-worlds-smallest-car.html |title=The world’s smallest car?

The numbered pins on the top and bottom of the channel must be connected.  The nets specified on the left and right of the channel must be brought to that end of the channel]]

A '''channel router''' is a specific variety of [[Routing (EDA)|router for integrated circuits]].  Normally using two layers of [[interconnection|interconnect]], it must connect the specified [[IC power-supply pin|pins]] on the top and bottom of the channel.  Specified [[Net (electronics)|nets]] must also be brought out to the left and right of the channel, but may be brought out in any order.  The height of the channel is not specified - the router computes what height is needed.

[[Image:ChannelRouteSolution.svg|350px|right|thumb|Figure 2: A solution to the channel routing problem shown above.  Solutions are not unique, and this is just one of the many possible.]]

The ''[[density]]'' of a channel, defined for every ''x'' within the channel, is the number of nets that appear on both the left and right of a vertical line at that ''x''.  The maximum density is a lower bound on the height of the channel.  A "cyclic constraint" occurs when two [[pin (electronics)|pins]] occur in the same column (but with different orders) in at least two columns.  In the example shown, nets 1 and 3 suffer from cyclic constraints.  This can only be solved by "doglegs" as shown on net 1 of the example.

Channel routers were one of the first forms of routers for [[integrated circuits]],&lt;ref&gt;Feller, A. 1976. {{doi-inline|10.1145/800146.804799|Automatic layout of low-cost quick-turnaround random-logic custom LSI devices}}.

However, modern [[Computer chip|chips]] have many more than 2 interconnect layers.  Although the effort was made to extend channel routers to more layers,&lt;ref&gt;Braun, D., Burns, J., Davadas, S., Ma, H. K., Mayaram, K., Romeo, F., and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A. 1986.

[[File:Chimney starter.JPG|thumb|200px|A chimney starter whose design shows metal [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]]]]
A '''chimney starter''', also called a '''charcoal chimney''', is a device that is used to ignite either lump [[charcoal]] or charcoal briquettes. It is usually a [[steel]] cylinder about 8" (20&amp;nbsp;cm) in [[diameter]] and about 12 to 18&amp;nbsp;inches (30 to 45&amp;nbsp;cm) tall. Chimney starters have a plate (or grate) with several holes that is placed horizontally inside the cylinder about 3" (8&amp;nbsp;cm) from the bottom. The chimney has large holes around its circumference below the grate. This allows air to flow up underneath the charcoal, which rests atop the grate. Chimneys also have handles that are usually [[Thermal insulation|insulated]]. The chimney starter works by placing [[newspaper]] underneath the grate and igniting it. This fire rises through the grate and ignites the charcoal. It is commonly used where [[charcoal lighter fluid]], a toxic [[petroleum]] derivative, is inappropriate or banned. It is also used when extra charcoals are required while the grill is being used, such as when slowly cooking something for a few hours.

[[Image:Charcoal lighter patent drawing.gif|left|thumb|[[Patent drawing]] of chimney starter from U.S. Patent 3,167,040]]
A type of chimney starter's basic device, named Automatic Dump Type Charcoal Lighter, was invented in the 1960s by Hugh King, Lavaughn Johnson, and Garner Byars of [[Corinth, Mississippi]] and marketed under the "Auto Fire" label.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent No. 3,167,040, ''Automatic Dump Type Charcoal Lighter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using a chimney starter ==
A chimney starter is used by placing charcoal (lump charcoal or briquettes) in the chimney stacked atop the grate, then paper (or other fuel) is placed below the grate to ignite the charcoal. Once all the charcoal is burning (glowing red on the bottom and ashed over on the top), the chimney is lifted by its handle and the burning charcoal dumped into the grill.

If a couple of pieces of burning charcoal are left in the chimney, and it is filled with unignited charcoal, it will quickly ignite the new batch, this time without the aid of fire lighters or paper, and without smoke.

A non-traditional use is to cook directly over or directly underneath the chimney starter, which provides a high-intensity heat-source for flash-[[searing]] fish or other foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/Season6/Tuna/TunaTranscript.htm Transcript of [[Good Eats]] episode]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://bbqforge.com/best-electric-smoker/| title= Electric Smoker Guide }} Wednesday, 22 August 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10404">Color television as introduced in North America in 1954 is best described as being 'colored' television. The system used the existing black and white signal but with the addition of a component intended only for television receivers designed to show color. By careful application this 'colored' signal was ignored by ordinary TV sets and had negligible effect on the appearance of the black and white image. This meant that color programs were viewable on the many existing black and white receivers which fulfilled a requirement for 'compatibility' desired by the television industry. Once the so called 'composite' video signal containing the color component had been generated it could be handled just as if it were a black and white signal, eliminating the need to replace much of the existing TV infrastructure. Colorplexer was the [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] name for the equipment that created this 'composite' color signal from three separate images each created in the primary colors, Red, Green and Blue supplied by a color video camera. This process was by the standards of the day quite complex and demanded accurate control of all the various parameters involved if an acceptable color image was to be achieved. The simplification afforded by this 'head end' approach became evident and contributed to the gradual acceptance of color programming over the following decades.

==National standard==
The '''National Television System Committee''', NTSC, standard was the analog television system that was used in most of the [[North America]] from 1941 until the mandatory cutover to [[ATSC]] in 2009. However, low-power TV stations were permitted to operate with NTSC, for now, but many have since converted to ATSC. This national standard was later adopted (or, in some cases, adapted) in other jurisdictions, such as Japan.

The ''Second NTSC Standard'' (525/30, 1941 and later) anticipated that the extant monochrome TV system would eventually incorporate a provision for monochrome-compatible color television. The ''[[NTSC|First NTSC Standard]]'' (441/30, pre-1941) had no such expectation, as even the extant motion picture 3-color system, "Three-Strip" Technicolor, was then only five years old. The ''Second NTSC Standard'', as revised for color, sometimes called ''EIA RS-170a'', was operational in North America and elsewhere from 1953 until this standard was replaced by ATSC in the early 21st century.

Central to this revised standard was a mandate for an information stream, at the transmitter, and broadcast to TV sets (receivers), which was independent of whether the signal was monochrome (already in existence since 1941) or color (adopted in 1953).

This significant mandate was satisfied by an encoding device which came to be known as a '''Colorplexer'''.

==Signal management==
Colorplexer (a portmanteau of "color" and "multiplexer") was the [[RCA]] trade name for its complex electronic device which encoded discrete red, green and blue 3-color images, as from a color camera, into a composite monochrome-compatible color information stream.

In RCA's recommendation for monochrome-compatible color TV, generally called "[[NTSC#Color encoding|NTSC]] color", each color TV source (as, from a [[Camera control unit|CCU]]) incorporated its own colorplexer, thereby providing the remaining equipment, all of which were presumed to have originated as a monochrome equipment system, with a signal which could be managed (generated, switched, transmitted, received, etcetera) as if the signal was not color at all, but was an ordinary composite monochrome signal.

This was a strategic decision on RCA's part, and this "one Colorplexer per color source" concept became part of RCA's color TV equipment marketing recommendations. While it made each color source significantly more complicated, hence more expensive, it also obviated the need for major changes to a TV station's signal management system, and the cost of signal management (particularly for networks involving widely separated sources and destinations, such as RCA's wholly owned NBC-TV network) was seen as considerably higher in cost than the color signal sources themselves, as otherwise it would have to be changed from a (composite) Y-only management system into a (component) R-, G- and B-management system (thereby effectively tripling the cost of color signal distribution).

Using today's three-phase electrical system in an analogy, overlaying an R-, G- and B-color TV signal management system upon an existing monochrome TV signal management system would be analogous to requiring public utility power systems to convert from three-phase to nine-phase electricity, an insurmountable cost penalty.

The ''Second NTSC Standard'' did not specifically mandate RCA's "one Colorplexer per color source" recommendation, as long as the signal actually transmitted to the signal's ''end user'' was monochrome-compatible, and this could have been satisfied by an R, G and B signal management system, and a single Colorplexer at the transmitter, and this would have been adequate for small-market TV stations, particularly those with video sources which were co-located at the station's transmitter site. However, the obvious high cost of R-, G- and B-signal management within a large-market TV station, with separate studio and transmitter sites (sources and destinations separated by perhaps one to tens of miles), or particularly within a TV network, with geographically widely separated sources and destinations (sources and destinations separated by perhaps hundreds to thousands of miles), resulted in adoption of RCA's "one Colorplexer per color source" recommendation almost universally, and ''particularly'' after [[Ampex#Quadruplex|Ampex]]'s introduction of color videotape in 1958 (which was ''never'' a component system at all, but was ''always'' inherently a composite system), and Ampex's (and, later, RCA's) color videotape systems became ''essential'' subsystems of multi-time-zone (national, or, indeed, international) network color TV distribution and transmission.

Initially, the instability of the early Colorplexers caused many operational problems as no two Colorplexers were adjusted alike, and these had to be constantly "[[Tweaking|tweak]]ed", as did the video sources themselves. Eventually, Colorplexer stability improved, as did the stability of the video sources, and NTSC color would go on to provide consistently good color, and it did so until 2009, nearly 56 years, a remarkable technological achievement, as, compared with "Three-Strip" Technicolor, perhaps the "exemplar" for color motion pictures, which lasted only 19 years (from 1936 to 1955).

==Encoder==
The R, G and B primary color signals are passed through a "matrix" to derive the [[Luma (video)|luminance]] signal, Y, which is the monochrome equivalent of the three primary colors.

With the addition of inputs from the synchronizing generator, which supplies the [[Blanking (video)|blanking]] and composite synch signals, and inputs from the color burst generator, which supplies the 3.579545&amp;nbsp;MHz color burst and the "burst gate" signals, the colorplexer, using an "encoder", synthesizes a compatible signal which includes luminance (described earlier) and [[chrominance]] (an amplitude-modulated suppressed-carrier signal with "I" and "Q" in quadrature, and which represents the differences between the color signals and the monochrome signal), the combination of which produces a monochrome-compatible color information stream.

The "burst gate" admits eight cycles of the 3.579545&amp;nbsp;MHz "color burst" and applies this to the "back porch" of each horizontal synch pulse (the vertical synch is unaffected). These eight cycles are just enough to supply a color TV receiver with a reference with which it can correct its own 3.579545&amp;nbsp;MHz local oscillator as to frequency and phase, phase being the most significant aspect of the process of recovering the "I" and "Q" signals.

The "matrix" adopted by RCA was Y = 0.30R + 0.59G + 0.11B; the three weighting factors were selected such that their sum was 1.0.

As with "prior art" two-color systems, such as pre-1932 Technicolor, the G signal predominates the R signal; and, as with "prior art" three-color systems, such as 1932 and later "Three-Strip" Technicolor, the G and R signals predominate the B signal.

RCA's color system was developed while "Three-Strip" Technicolor was the "gold standard", and Eastman Kodak's Eastmancolor would not completely displace "Three-Strip" Technicolor for another half-decade. Indeed, RCA's P22 [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[phosphor]] was intended to mimic Technicolor's dramatic color palette.

In most practical color systems, including RCA's, the G signal is taken to be the reference as it has the highest resolution. Indeed, in 1932 to 1944 "Three-Strip" Technicolor, the image was enhanced by printing a monochrome image which was taken from a 0.5G negative (called the "key" image, and hence that color system was really an RGBK system, not unlike graphic arts' YCMK system) on the film's "blank receiver" before the color dyes were applied, as an edge enhancement measure.

Edge enhancement is now a part of many electronically based color systems, but in "Three-Strip" Technicolor's day, it was accomplished photographically from the G image, the sharpest of the three.

==Monochrome compatibility==

Conventional monochrome TV sets will accept this signal as if there were no chrominance or burst signals at all. A monochrome image, Y, with minimal or no defects (such as moiré, etcetera) will be displayed.

The "I", "Q" and "color burst" signals will be ignored, leaving only the monochrome image.

==Color Compatibility==
Color TV sets will accept this signal and will, first, separate the monochrome image, Y, and will, second, decode the "I" and "Q" signals, using the extracted "color burst" 3.579545&amp;nbsp;MHz signal as a phase reference to decode these signals.

Applying the monochrome image and the decoded "I" and "Q" signals to the mathematical inverse of the "matrix" reverse synthesizes the R, G and B primary color signals, which were applied to a "[[shadow mask]]" or equivalent TV tube, and which displays a 3-color color image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''Cooper pair''' or '''BCS pair''' is a pair of electrons (or other [[fermion]]s) bound together at low temperatures in a certain manner first described in 1956 by American physicist [[Leon Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;

In conventional [[Superconductivity|superconductors]], this attraction is due to the [[electron]]–[[phonon]] interaction. The Cooper pair state is responsible for superconductivity, as described in the [[BCS theory]] developed by [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]], and [[John Schrieffer]] for which they shared the 1972 [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;

Although Cooper pairing is a quantum effect, the reason for the pairing can be seen from a simplified classical explanation.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative [[charge (physics)|charge]], but it also attracts the positive [[ion]]s that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to [[electron]]–[[phonon]] interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volt|eV]], and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons in Cooper pairs.

The electrons in a pair are not necessarily close together; because the interaction is long range, paired electrons may still be many hundreds of [[nanometre|nanometers]] apart. This distance is usually greater than the average interelectron distance so that many Cooper pairs can occupy the same space.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons have [[Spin-½|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], so they are [[fermion]]s, but the total spin of a Cooper pair is integer (0 or 1) so it is a [[composite boson]]. This means the [[wave function]]s are symmetric under particle interchange.  Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the same quantum state, which is responsible for the phenomena of superconductivity.

The BCS theory is also applicable to other fermion systems, such as [[helium-3]]. Indeed, Cooper pairing is responsible for the [[superfluidity]] of helium-3 at low temperatures. It has also been recently demonstrated that a Cooper pair can comprise two bosons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optical-lattice.com/index.php?lattice-site=cooper-pairs Cooper Pairs of Bosons]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the pairing is supported by [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] in an optical lattice.

== Relationship to superconductivity ==
The tendency for all the Cooper pairs in a body to "[[Bose–Einstein condensation|condense]]" into the same [[Ground state|ground quantum state]] is responsible for the peculiar properties of superconductivity.

Cooper originally considered only the case of an isolated pair's formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of allowed energy states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy. This ''gap to excitations'' leads to superconductivity, since small excitations such as scattering of electrons are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;

The gap appears due to many-body effects between electrons feeling the attraction.

R. A. Ogg, Jr., was first to suggest that electrons might act as pairs coupled by lattice vibrations in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg Jr, R.A., "Bose-Einstein Condensation of Trapped Electron Pairs. Phase
Separation and Superconductivity of Metal-Ammonia Solutions," ''Phys. Rev.'' 69, 243-244, (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Poole Jr, Charles P, "Encyclopedic dictionary of condensed matter physics", (Academic Press, 2004), p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; This was indicated by the [[isotope]] effect observed in superconductors. The isotope effect showed that materials with heavier ions (different [[isotope|nuclear isotopes]]) had lower superconducting transition temperatures. This can be explained by the theory of Cooper pairing: heavier ions are harder for the electrons to attract and move (how Cooper pairs are formed), which results in smaller binding energy for the pairs.

The theory of Cooper pairs is quite general and does not depend on the specific electron-phonon interaction.  Condensed matter theorists have proposed pairing mechanisms based on other attractive interactions such as electron–[[exciton]] interactions or electron–[[plasmon]] interactions. Currently, none of these other pairing interactions has been observed in any material.

It should be mentioned that Cooper pairing does not involve individual electrons pairing up to form "quasi-bosons". The paired states are energetically favored, and electrons go in and out of those states preferentially. This is a fine distinction that John Bardeen makes:

:''"The idea of paired electrons, though not fully accurate, captures the sense of it." &lt;ref&gt;J. Bardeen, "Electron-Phonon Interactions and Superconductivity", in Cooperative Phenomena, eds. H. Haken and M. Wagner (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1973), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The mathematical description of the second-order coherence involved here is given by Yang.&lt;ref&gt;C. N. Yang, "Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order." ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 34, 694 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data center security''' is the set of policies, precautions and practices adopted to avoid unauthorized access and manipulation of a [[data center|data center's]] resources. The data center houses the enterprise applications and data, hence why providing a proper security system is critical.  [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]] (DoS), theft of confidential information, data alteration, and [[data loss]] are some of the common security problems afflicting data center environments.&lt;ref name="DCF"&gt;Maurizio Portolani, Mauricio Arregoces(2004). [https://books.google.it/books/about/Data_Center_Fundamentals.html?id=DRIryrLoxKkC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Data Center Fundamentals'']. Publishers, Cisco Press, 800 East 96th Street Indianapolis, IN 46240 USA, Chap.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The need for a secure data center==

The number of reported security attacks, including those affecting Data Centers continues to grow year by year. Attacks and attack tools are becoming more and more sophisticated. On one hand, the expansion of the Internet and the growing complexity of protocols and applications used in Data Centers result in an increasing number of exploitable vulnerabilities. On the other hand, hackers use the openness of the Internet to communicate and develop automated tools that facilitate the identification and exploitation of those vulnerabilities. Attacks are usually also initiated by internal trusted personnel.&lt;ref&gt;2003 CSI/FBI report [http://www.firenetltd.it/materiale/FBI2003.pdf "Computer Crime and Security Survey."]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, studies show that internal attacks tend to be more damaging because of the variety and amount of information available inside organizations.

The cost of a breach of security can have some devastating consequence both on the company managing the data center and on the customers whose data were a breach. For example, the 2012 breach at Global Payments, a processing vendor for Visa, where 1.5 millions of credit card numbers were stolen, highlights the risks of storing and managing valuable and confidential data.&lt;ref name = "JDG"&gt;Jessica Silver-Greenberg  [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/business/after-data-breach-visa-removes-a-service-provider.html?/ ''After a Data Breach, Visa Removes a Service Provider'']&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Global Payments partnership with Visa was terminated and, it was estimated that they lost over $100 million. The consequences of permitting such data breaches can be damaging to an organization of any size. Besides a huge financial loss, the company is affected by data breaches may lose the confidence of their business partners and their customers who provided their data to the breached company.

According to the Cost of a Data Breach Survey,&lt;ref name = "fldcp"&gt;The Four Layers of Data Center Physical Security for a comprehensive and integrated Approach [https://www.anixter.com/content/dam/Anixter/White%20Papers/12F0010X00-Four-Layers-Data-Center-Security-WP-EN-US.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in which 49 U.S. companies in 14 different industry sectors participated, they noticed that:
* 39% of companies say negligence was the primary cause of data breaches
* Malicious or criminal attacks account for 37 percent of total breaches.
* The average cost of a breach is $5.5 million.

We realized that negligent and malicious are the main causes of data breach, which is why companies are supposed to take steps to minimize the risks of an attack. Companies belonging to a certain industry such as healthcare, technology, finances, are taking care of large amounts of extremely sensitive data, such as medical records, credit card numbers, social security numbers. Those type companies must be extremely vigilant in order to protect their clients’ data.&lt;ref name = "fldcp"/&gt;

As time passes, people always find inventive ways to bypass the security measures put in place by data centers. Every business related to data centers will have to overcome those challenges and prioritize data center security. The amount of data passed in those data center will only grow year after year via cloud-computing and phones, ergo those responsible to secure that valuable information much assess their risk which includes physical breaches.&lt;ref name = "fldcp"/&gt;

==Vulnerabilities and common attacks==
===Threats===

The following are some of the most common threats to Data Centers:

* DoS (Denial of Service)
* Breach of confidential information
* Data theft or alteration
* Unauthorized use of computing resources
* Identity theft

===Vulnerabilities===

Common vulnerabilities in data centers are related to the following areas:

* ''Implementation'': Software and protocols flaws, wrong software design or incomplete testing, etc.
* ''Configuration'': Use of defaults, elements not properly configured, etc.
* ''Design'': Ineffective or inadequate security design, lack of or inappropriate implementation of redundancy mechanisms, etc.

====Exploitation of out-of-date software====

Most attacks on data centers exploit well-known vulnerabilities that are usually discovered an announced months before the first attack takes place. The worms [[Code Red (computer worm)|CodeRed]],&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David; Colleen Shannon (c. 2001). [http://www.caida.org/research/security/code-red/coderedv2_analysis.xml "The Spread of the Code-Red Worm (CRv2)"]. CAIDA Analysis. Retrieved 2006-10-03.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nimda]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/nimda.shtml  "Net-Worm: W32/Nimda Description | F-Secure Labs"]. F-secure.com&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SQL Slammer]]&lt;ref&gt;Leyden, John (6 February 2003). [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/06/slammer_why_security_benefits/ "Slammer: Why security benefits from proof of concept code"].&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of exploiting known vulnerabilities that could have been avoided. This clearly indicates that a significant number of exploits on the Internet by using the latest releases of software.

====Exploitation of software defaults====
Many systems are shipped with default accounts and passwords, which are exploited for unauthorized access and theft of information, among other threats.

===Common attacks===

Common attacks include:

* ''Scanning or Probing'':
A probe is an attack which is deliberately crafted so that its target detects and reports it with a recognizable “fingerprint” in the report. The attacker then uses the collaborative infrastructure to learn the detector’s location and defensive capabilities from this report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/shmat_lsad07.pdf "Security Against Probe-Response Attacks in Collaborative Intrusion Detection"] Vitaly Shmatikov and Ming-Hsiu Wang
The University of Texas at Austin&lt;/ref&gt; this is more like a reconnaissance activity because it precedes an attack and it's goal is to gain access by discovering information about a system or network.

* ''DoS (Denial of service)'':
A denial-of-service attack occurs when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-015 "Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks"]. US-CERT. 6 February 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of attack can take different forms like for example generating large volume of data to deliberately consume limited resources as bandwidth, CPU cycles, and memory blocks.

*''Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)'':
This kind of attack is a particular case of DoS where a large number of systems are compromised and used as source or traffic on a synchronized attack. In this kind of attack, the hacker does not use only one IP address but thousand of them.&lt;ref&gt;Khalifeh,, Soltanian, Mohammad Reza. [https://www.worldcat.org/title/theoretical-and-experimental-methods-for-defending-against-ddos-attacks/oclc/930795667 Theoretical and experimental methods for defending against DDoS attacks]. Amiri, Iraj Sadegh, 1977-. Waltham, MA. {{ISBN|0128053992}}. OCLC 930795667.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ Image:Ddos-attack-ex.png | thumb|center | 400px]]

* ''Unauthorized Access'':

When someone other than an account owner uses privileges associated to a compromised account to access to restricted resources using a valid account or a backdoor.&lt;ref&gt;GIAC Certifications. [https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/3161/unauthorized-access-threats-risk-control/105264 ''Global Information Assurance Certification Paper''].&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Eavesdropping'':

Etymologically, ''Eavesdropping'' means Secretly listen to a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop "eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries"]. Oxford Dictionaries - English.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wetworking filed, it is an unauthorized interception of information (usernames, passwords) that travels on the network. The most common cases of eavesdropping in Data Centers include intercepting typical and critical user transactions such as logon sessions.

* ''Viruses and Worms'':

They are both malicious code that produces once executed undesired results on the infected system. The malicious code usually remains in the system until the damage is discovered. The difference between viruses and worms is that, worms are self-replicating malwares that propagate without human intervention&lt;ref&gt;Barwise, Mike. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/internet-worms "What is an internet worm?"]. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; while viruses are also self-replicating but they need some kind of human action to infect the system.&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, William (2012). ''Computer security : principles and practice''. Boston: Pearson. p. 182. {{ISBN|978-0-13-277506-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Internet Infrastructure Attacks'':
This kind of attack targets the critical components of the Internet infrastructure rather than individual systems or networks.

* ''Trust Exploitation'':
These attacks exploit the trust relationships that computer systems have to communicate.

* ''Session Hijacking'' also known as ''cookie hijacking'':
Consists of stealing a legitimate session established between a target and a trusted host. The attacker intercepts the session and makes the target believe it is communicating with the trusted host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6929258.stm "Warning of webmail wi-fi hijack"]. BBC News. August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Buffer Overflow Attacks'':
This kind of attack occurs when a program allocates memory buffer space beyond what it had reserved; it results in memory corruption affecting the data stored in the memory areas that were overflowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/general/ModernOverflowTargets.pdf|title="Modern Overflow Targets"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Layer 2 Attacks'':
This type of attack exploit the vulnerabilities of data link layer protocols and their implementations on layer 2 switching platforms.

==Network Security Infrastructure==

The network security infrastructure includes the security tools used in Data Center to enforce security policies. The tools include packet-filtering technologies such as ACLs, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) both network-based and host-based.

===ACLs (Access Control List)===

'''ACLs''' are filtering mechanisms explicitly defined based on packet header information to permit or deny traffic on specific interfaces. Generally, an ACL is set up as a list that is applied sequentially on the packets until a match is found. Once the match is found, the associated permit or deny operation is applied. ACLs are used in multiple locations within the Data Center such as the Internet Edge and the intranet server farm. The following describes standard and extended access lists:

Standard ACLs:  the simplest type of ACL filtering traffic solely based on source IP addresses. Standard ACLs are typically deployed to control access to network devices for network management or remote access. For example, you can configure a standard ACL in a router to specify which systems are allowed to Telnet to it. Standard ACLs aren't recommended option for traffic filtering due to their lack of granularity. Standard ACLSs are configured with a number between 1 and 99 in Cisco routers.

Extended ACLs: 
Extended ACL filtering decisions can be based on source and destination IP addresses, Lyaer 4 protocol, Layer 4 ports, ICMP message type and code, type of service, and precedence. In Cisco routers, you can define extended ACLs by name or by a number in the 100 to 199 range.&lt;ref name="DCF" /&gt;

===Firewalls===

A firewall is a sophisticated filtering device that separates LAN segments, giving each segment a different security level and establishing a security perimeter that controls the traffic flow between segments.Firewalls are most commonly deployed at the Internet Edge where they act as boundary to the internal networks.They are expected to have the following characteristics: [[ Image:Inner-Outer Two layer DMZ with three or more flanking firewalls.png | thumb|right | 400px]]Performance: the main goal of a firewall is to separate the secured and the unsecured areas of a network. Firewalls are then post in the primary traffic path potentially exposed to large volumes of data. Hence, performance becomes a natural design factor to ensure that the firewall meets the particular requirements.

Application support:  Another important aspect is the ability of a firewall to control and protect a particular application or protocol, such as Telnet, FTP, and HTTP. The firewall is expected to understand application-level packet exchanges to determine whether packets do follow the application behavior and, if they do not, do deny the traffic.

There are different types of firewalls based on their packet-processing capabilities and their awareness of application-level information:
# Packet-filtering firewalls
# Proxy firewalls 
# Stateful firewalls
# Hybrid firewalls&lt;ref name="DCF"/&gt;

===IDSs===

IDSs are real-time systems that can detect intruders and suspicious activities and report them to a monitoring system. They are configured to block or mitigate intrusions in progress and eventually immunize the systems from future attacks. They have two fundamental components:

* Sensors:  Appliances and software agents that analyze the traffic on the network or the resource usage on end systems to identify intrusions and suspicious activities.
* IDS management:  Single- or multi-device system used to configure and administer sensors and to additionally collect all the alarm information generated by the sensors. The sensors are equivalent to surveillance tools, and IDS management is the control center watching the information produced by the surveillance tools.&lt;ref name="DCF" /&gt;

==Layer 2 security==

Cisco Layer 2 switches provide tools to prevent the common Layer 2 attacks (Scanning or Probing, DoS, DDoS, etc.). The following are some security features covered by the '''Layer 2 Security''':

* Port Security
* ARP Inspection
* Private VLANs
* Private VLANs and Firewalls

==Data Center security measures==

The process of securing a Data Center requires both a comprehensive system-analysis approach and an ongoing process that improves the security levels as the Data Center evolves. The Data Center is constantly evolving as new applications or services become available. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated and more frequent. These trends require a steady evaluation of security readiness.

A key component of the security-readiness evaluation is the policies that govern the application of security in the network including the Data Center. The application includes both the design best practices and the implementation details.&lt;ref name="DCF"/&gt; As a result, security is often considered as a key component of the main infrastructure requirement. Since a key responsibility of the data centers is to make sure of the availability of the services, data center management systems often consider how its security affects traffic flows, failures, and scalability. Due to the fact that security measures may vary depending on the data center design, the use of unique features, compliance requirements or the company's business goals, there isn't a set of specific measures that cover all possible scenarios.&lt;ref name="CSRG"&gt;Cisco SAFE Reference Guide [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Security/SAFE_RG/SAFE_rg/chap4.pdf] chap.4&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist in general two types of data center security: the Physical Security and the Virtual Security.&lt;ref name="llds"&gt;Rich Banta [https://lifelinedatacenters.com/colocation/types-of-data-center-security/ ''Types of Data Center Security'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical Security===
The physical security of a data center is the set of protocol built-in within the data center facilities in order to prevent any physical damage to the machines storing the data. Those protocols should be able to handle everything ranging from natural disasters to corporate espionage to terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Sara D. Scalet [https://www.csoonline.com/article/2112402/physical-security/physical-security-19-ways-to-build-physical-security-into-a-data-center.html 19 ways to build physical security into your data center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of a physical attack on a data center could possibly cause data racks being damaged, destroyed or stolen, which means that the data it contains might have been lost or inaccessible. Planning in advanced and putting the right and modern security measures in place can drastically reduce the risks of a physical attack on a data center. For instance, to reduce the risks of leaks caused by workers, it is a good practice to make sure that the employees' backgrounds are well checked, and that nontechnical personnel is not allowed to work with data servers and repositories unless they receive adequate training. Additionally, the security team in place should effectively know what to do using a disaster or a treat to the security of the data center.

To prevent physical attacks, data centers use techniques such as:

*Anti-tailgating/Anti-pass-back turnstile gate. Only permits one person to pass through after authentication.
*Single entry point into co-location facility.
*[[Three-factor authentication]]
*Further access restriction to private cages
*[[SSAE 16]] compliant facilities.
*On-site security
*CCTV security network
*locations and access points with 90-day video retention.&lt;ref name="secDC"&gt;[https://www.accesscorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AccessFileBRIDGE_SecurityDataCenterOverview.pdf Security and Data Center Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Checking the provenance and design of hardware in use
*Reducing insider risk by monitoring activities and keeping their credentials safe&lt;ref&gt;[https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design/#introduction Google Infrastructure Security Design Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minimization of traffic through dedicated data halls, suites, and cages.
* Monitoring of Temperature and humidity 
* Fire prevention with zoned dry-pipe sprinkler
* 24×7 on-site security guards, NOC Services and technical team
* 24x7 on-site NOC services
* Natural disaster risk-free locations&lt;ref&gt;iliad Data Center['http://www.iliad-datacenter.com/pdf/iliad-dc-security.pdf' 'Data Center Security'] chap.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Security===
Virtual security is security measures put in place by the data centers to prevent remote unauthorized access that will affect the integrity, availability or confidentiality of data stored on servers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design/#introduction Securing Microsoft's Cloud Infrastructure] 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual or network security is a hard task to handle as there exist many ways it could be attacked. The worst part of it is that it is evolving years after years. For instance, an attacker could decide to use a malware (or similar exploits) in order to bypass the various firewalls to access the data. Old systems may as well put security at risk as they do not contain modern methods of data security.&lt;ref name="llds"/&gt;

Virtual attacks can be prevented with techniques such as

* Heavy data encryption during transfer or not: 256-bit SSL encryption for web applications.1024-bit RSA public keys for data transfers. AES 256-bit encryption for files and databases.
* Logs auditing activities of all users.
* Secured usernames and passwords:  Encrypted via 256-bit SSL, requirements for complex passwords, set up of scheduled expirations, prevention of password reuse.
* Access based on the level of clearance.
* AD/LDAP integration.
* Control based on IP addresses.
* Encryption of session ID cookies in order to identify each unique user.
* Two-factor authentication availability.
* Third party penetration testing performed annually&lt;ref name="secDC"/&gt;
* Malware prevention through firewalls and automated scanner&lt;ref&gt;[https://ito.hkbu.edu.hk/pub/is_newsletter/professional/Issue_08_DCM/JUCC%20Newsletter-IT-8%20DCM.pdf Data Centre Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delay line memory''' is a form of [[computer memory]], now obsolete, that was used on some of the earliest [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer]]s.  Like many modern forms of electronic computer memory, delay line memory was a [[memory refresh|refreshable memory]], but as opposed to modern [[random-access memory]], delay line memory was [[Sequential access|sequential-access]].

[[Analog delay line]] technology had been used since the 1920s to delay the propagation of analog signals. When a delay line is used as a memory device, an [[amplifier]] and a [[pulse shaping|pulse shaper]] are connected between the output of the delay line and the input. These devices recirculate the signals from the output back into the input, creating a loop that maintains the signal as long as power is applied. The shaper ensures the pulses remain well-formed, removing any degradation due to losses in the medium.

The memory capacity is determined by dividing the time taken to transmit one bit into the time it takes for data to circulate through the delay line.  Early delay-line memory systems had capacities of a few thousand [[bit]]s, with recirculation times measured in [[second|microseconds]].  To read or write a particular bit stored in such a memory, it is necessary to wait for that bit to circulate through the delay line into the electronics. The delay to read or write any particular bit is no longer than the recirculation time.

Use of a delay line for a computer memory was invented by [[J. Presper Eckert]] in the mid-1940s for use in computers such as the [[EDVAC]] and the [[UNIVAC I]].  Eckert and [[John Mauchly]] applied for a patent for a delay line memory system on October 31, 1947; the patent was issued in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2629827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This patent focused on mercury delay lines, but it also discussed delay lines made of [[Ladder topology|strings of inductors and capacitors]], magnetostrictive delay lines, and delay lines built using [[Drum memory|rotating disks]] to transfer data to a read head at one point on the circumference from a write head elsewhere around the circumference.

==Genesis in radar==
The basic concept of the delay line originated with World War II [[radar]] research, as a system to reduce [[Clutter (radar)|clutter]] from reflections from the ground and other "fixed" objects.

A radar system consists principally of an antenna, a transmitter, a receiver, and a [[Radar display|display]]. The antenna is connected to the transmitter, which sends out a brief pulse of radio energy before being disconnected again. The antenna is then connected to the receiver, which amplifies any reflected signals, and sends them to the display. Objects farther from the radar return echos later than those closer to the radar, which the display indicates visually.

Non-moving objects at a fixed distance from the antenna always return a signal after the same delay. This would appear as a fixed spot on the display, making detection of other targets in the area more difficult. Early radars simply aimed their beams away from the ground to avoid the majority of this "clutter". This was not an ideal situation; it required careful aiming which was difficult for smaller mobile radars, and didn't remove other sources of clutter-like reflections from features like prominent hills, and in the worst case would allow low-flying enemy aircraft to literally fly "under the radar".

To filter out static objects, two pulses were compared and those with the same delay times were removed. To do this the signal sent from the receiver to the display was split in two, with one path leading directly to the display and the second leading to a delay unit. The delay was carefully tuned to be some multiple of the time between pulses (the [[pulse repetition frequency]]). This resulted in the delayed signal from an earlier pulse exiting the delay unit the same time that the signal from a newer pulse was received from the antenna. One of the signals was then inverted, typically the one from the delay, and the two signals were then combined and sent to the display. Any signal that was at the same location was nullified (via [[Interference (wave propagation)|destructive interference]]) by the inverted signal from a previous pulse, leaving only the moving objects on the display.

Several different types of delay systems were invented for this purpose, with one common principle being that the information was stored [[acoustics|acoustically]] in a medium. [[MIT]] experimented with a number of systems including glass, quartz, steel and lead. The Japanese deployed a system consisting of a quartz element with a powdered glass coating that reduced [[surface wave]]s that interfered with proper reception. The [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] used steel rods wrapped into a helix, but this was useful only for low frequencies under 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. [[Raytheon]] used a magnesium alloy originally developed for making bells.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Eckert, Jr., A Survey of Digital Computer Memory Systems, Proceedings of the IRE, October 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical de-cluttering system based on the concept was developed by [[J. Presper Eckert]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]]. His solution used a column of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] with [[piezoelectricity|piezo crystal]] [[transducer]]s (a combination of speaker and microphone) at either end. Signals from the radar amplifier were sent to the piezo at one end of the tube, which would cause the transducer to pulse and generate a small wave in the mercury. The wave would quickly travel to the far end of the tube, where it would be read back out by the other piezo, inverted, and sent to the display. Careful mechanical arrangement was needed to ensure that the delay time matched the inter-pulse timing of the radar being used.

All of these systems were suitable for conversion into a computer memory. The key was to recycle the signals within the memory system so they would not disappear after traveling through the delay. This was relatively easy to arrange with simple electronics.

===Mercury delay lines===
After the war, Eckert turned his attention to computer development, which was a topic of some interest at the time. One problem with practical development was the lack of a suitable memory device, and Eckert's work on the radar delays gave him a major advantage over other researchers in this regard.

For a computer application the timing was still critical, but for a different reason. Conventional computers have a natural "cycle time" needed to complete an operation, the start and end of which typically consist of reading or writing memory. Thus the delay lines had to be timed such that the pulses would arrive at the receiver just as the computer was ready to read it. Typically many pulses would be "in flight" through the delay, and the computer would count the pulses by comparing to a master clock to find the particular bit it was looking for.

[[File:SEACComputer 010.jpg|thumb|Diagram of Mercury delay line as used in [[SEAC (computer)|SEAC computer]]]]
[[mercury (element)|Mercury]] was used because its [[acoustic impedance]] is close to that of the piezoelectric quartz crystals; this minimized the energy loss and the echoes when the signal was transmitted from crystal to medium and back again.  The high [[speed of sound]] in mercury (1450&amp;nbsp;m/s) meant that the time needed to wait for a pulse to arrive at the receiving end was less than it would have been with a slower medium, such as air (343.2&amp;nbsp;m/s), but it also meant that the total number of pulses that could be stored in any reasonably sized column of mercury was limited. Other technical drawbacks of mercury included its weight, its cost, and its toxicity. Moreover, to get the acoustic impedances to match as closely as possible, the mercury had to be kept at a constant temperature. The system heated the mercury to a uniform above-room temperature setting of 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F), which made servicing the tubes hot and uncomfortable work. ([[Alan Turing]] proposed the use of [[gin]] as an ultrasonic delay medium, claiming that it had the necessary acoustic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkes|first1=Maurice V.|title=Computers Then and Now|journal=Journal of the ACM|date=January 1968|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–7|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321440|ref=wilkes|doi=10.1145/321439.321440}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A considerable amount of engineering was needed to maintain a "clean" signal inside the tube. Large transducers were used to generate a very tight "beam" of sound that would not touch the walls of the tube, and care had to be taken to eliminate reflections off the far end of the tubes. The tightness of the beam then required considerable tuning to make sure the two piezos were pointed directly at each other. Since the speed of sound changes with temperature the tubes were heated in large ovens to keep them at a precise temperature. Other systems{{specify}} instead adjusted the computer clock rate according to the ambient temperature to achieve the same effect.

[[EDSAC]], the second full scale [[stored-program]] [[digital computer]], began operation with 256 35-bit [[Word (data type)|word]]s of memory, stored in 16 delay lines holding 576 bits each (Words in the delay line were 36 bits, but one was unusable in programs because of timing constraints). The memory was later expanded to 512 words by adding a second set of 16 delay lines. In the [[UNIVAC I]] the capacity of an individual delay line was smaller, each column stored 120 [[bit]]s (although the term "bit" was not in popular use at the time), requiring seven large memory units with 18 columns each to make up a 1000-word store. Combined with their support circuitry and [[amplifier]]s, the memory subsystem formed its own walk-in [[Room (architecture)|room]]. The average access time was about 222 [[microsecond]]s, which was considerably faster than the mechanical systems used on earlier computers.

[[CSIRAC]], completed in November 1949, also used delay line memory.

===Magnetostrictive delay lines===
[[File:Torsion wire delay line.jpg|thumb|Torsion wire delay line]]

A later version of the delay line used [[metal wire]]s as the storage medium. Transducers were built by applying the [[magnetostriction|magnetostrictive effect]]; small pieces of a magnetostrictive material, typically [[nickel]], were attached to either side of the end of the wire, inside an electromagnet. When bits from the computer entered the magnets the nickel would contract or expand (based on the polarity) and twist the end of the wire. The resulting torsional wave would then move down the wire just as the sound wave did down the mercury column. In most cases the entire wire was made of the same material.

Unlike the compressive wave, however, the [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] waves are considerably more resistant to problems caused by mechanical imperfections, so much so that the wires could be wound into a loose coil and pinned to a board. Due to their ability to be coiled, the wire-based systems could be built as "long" as needed, and tended to hold considerably more data per unit; [[kilobit|1k]] units were typical on a board only 1 foot square. Of course this also meant that the time needed to find a particular bit was somewhat longer as it traveled through the wire, and access times on the order of 500 microseconds were typical.

[[File:Highgate Wood 100 micro second delay line store.JPG|thumb|100 microsecond delay line store]]

Delay line memory was far less expensive and far more reliable per bit than [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s made from [[vacuum tube|tubes]], and yet far faster than a [[latching relay]]. It was used right into the late 1960s, notably on commercial machines like the [[LEO I]], [[Highgate Wood Telephone Exchange]], various [[Ferranti]] machines, and the [[IBM 2260|IBM 2848 Display Control]]. Delay line memory was also used for video memory in early terminals, where one delay line would typically store 4 lines of characters. (4 lines x 40 characters per line x 6 bits per character= 960 bits in one delay line) They were also used very successfully in several models of early desktop [[electronic calculator]], including the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130 (1964) and EC-132, the [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] desktop [[programmable calculator]] introduced in 1965, and the Litton [[Monroe Epic]] 2000 and 3000 [[programmable calculators]] of 1967.

===Piezoelectric delay lines===
[[File:ultrasonicdelayline.jpg|thumb|An ultrasonic delay line from a color TV; it delays the color signal by 64&amp;nbsp;µs&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer: VEB ELFEMA Mittweida ([[East Germany|GDR]]) in 1980]]
A similar solution to the magnetostrictive system was to use delay lines made entirely of a piezo material, typically quartz. Current fed into one end of the crystal would generate a compressive wave that would flow to the other end, where it could be read. In effect, piezoelectric delays simply replaced the mercury and transducers of a conventional mercury delay line with a single unit combining both. However these solutions were fairly rare; growing crystals of the required quality in large sizes was not easy, which limited them to small sizes and thus small amounts of data storage.

A better and more widespread use of piezoelectric delays was in European television sets. The European [[PAL]] standard for color broadcasts compares the signal from two successive lines of the image in order to avoid color shifting due to small phase shifts. By comparing two lines, one of which is inverted, the shifting is averaged and the resulting signal more closely matches the original signal, even in the presence of interference. In order to compare the two lines, a piezoelectric delay unit which delays the signal by a time that is equal to the duration of each line, 64&amp;nbsp;µs, is inserted in one of the two signal paths that are compared.&lt;ref&gt;See:

== Electric delay lines ==
[[File:electricdelayline.jpg|thumb|Electric delay line (450&amp;nbsp;ns), consisting of enamelled copper wire, wound around a metal tube]]

Electric delay lines are used for shorter delay times (ns to several µs). They consist of a long electric line or are made of discrete inductors and capacitors, which are arranged in a chain. To shorten the total length of the line it can be wound around a metal tube, getting some more capacitance against ground and also more inductance due to the wire windings, which are lying close together.

Other examples are:
*short coaxial or [[microstrip line]]s for phase matching in high frequency circuits or [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s
*hollow resonator lines in [[magnetron]]s and [[klystron]]s as helices in [[travelling wave tube]]s to match the velocity of the electrons to the velocity of the [[electromagnetic waves]]
*[[undulator]]s in [[free electron laser]]s

Another way to create a delay time is to implement a delay line in an [[integrated circuit]] storage device. This can be done digitally or with a discrete analogue method. The analogue one uses [[bucket-brigade device]]s or [[charge coupled device]]s (CCD), which transport a stored electric charge stepwise from one end to the other. Both digital and analog methods are bandwidth limited at the upper end to the half of the clock frequency, which determines the steps of transportation.

In modern computers operating at gigahertz speeds, millimeter differences in the length of conductors in a parallel data bus can cause data-bit skew, which can lead to data corruption or reduced processing performance. This is remedied by making all conductor paths of similar length, delaying the arrival time for what would otherwise be shorter travel distances by using zig-zagging traces.

Incidentally a method to increase delay time slightly is to wrap tape (ideally Kapton) around the windings and then put foil over that, with it connected to ground via resistor to further increase the transmission line effect. This approach also reduces interference to nearby circuits.

===Optical persistence delay lines===

An invention around 2015 mentioned on various forums and later built using more recent components is to use the optical persistence in ZnS:Cu that is quenched by infrared light to store data. This approach uses a large area glowing sign panel mounted on a flat spinning glass or metal sheet, and write/read sensors using green/blue LEDs and infrared diodes for the erase cycle.
This approach also allows a comparatively long delay time if cascaded to multiple R/W layers and if signal integrity is verified and replicated can be very reliable considering that it has only one moving part ie the spinning disk albeit with some variation in the time domain due to speedup effects similar to that seen with optical disk drives.
Also useful is to position read/write diodes on the back of a sheet of Veroboard to take advantage of small areas with glass beads as lenses and instrumentation amplifiers using quad op-amps for incidental noise rejection.
This could have been built as early as 1959 but maybe overlooked due to lack of reliable diodes in the target wavelength.
It is possible that it might have been experimented with in the former Soviet Union but this is as yet unconfirmed.

'''Dip pen nanolithography''' ('''DPN''') is a [[scanning probe lithography]] technique where an [[atomic force microscope|atomic force microscope (AFM)]] tip is used to create patterns directly on a range of substances with a variety of inks.&lt;ref name="GingerZhang2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ginger|first1=David S.|last2=Zhang|first2=Hua|last3=Mirkin|first3=Chad A.|title=The Evolution of Dip-Pen Nanolithography|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=43|issue=1|year=2004|pages=30–45|issn=1433-7851|doi=10.1002/anie.200300608}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of this technique is exemplified by the use of alkane thiolates to imprint onto a gold surface.&lt;ref name="Piner1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piner|first1=R. D.|title="Dip-Pen" Nanolithography|journal=Science|volume=283|issue=5402|year=1999|pages=661–663|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.283.5402.661|pmid=9924019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique allows surface patterning on scales of under 100&amp;nbsp;[[Nano-|nano]]meters.  DPN is the [[nanotechnology]] analog of the [[dip pen]] (also called the [[quill pen]]), where the tip of an atomic force microscope [[cantilever]] acts as a "pen," which is coated with a chemical compound or mixture acting as an "ink," and put in contact with a substrate, the "paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DPN - Northwestern - Intro|url=http://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/mirkin-group/dip-pen-nanolithography/|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612032559/http://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/mirkin-group/dip-pen-nanolithography/|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DPN enables direct deposition of nanoscale materials onto a substrate in a flexible manner.  Recent advances have demonstrated massively parallel patterning using two-dimensional arrays of 55,000 tips.  Applications of this technology currently range through [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and the [[life sciences]], and include such work as ultra high density biological nanoarrays, and additive [[photomask]] repair.&lt;ref&gt;Solvent-mediated repair and patterning of surfaces by AFM:  Elhadj, Chernov, De Yoreo, Nanotechnology, 19, (2008) 105304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The uncontrollable transfer of a molecular 'ink' from a coated AFM tip to a substrate was first reported by Jaschke and Butt in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaschke | first1 = M. | last2 = Butt | first2 = H.-J. | year = 1995 | title = Deposition of Organic Material by the Tip of a Scanning Force Microscope | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1061–1064 | doi=10.1021/la00004a004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they erroneously concluded that alkanethiols could not be transferred to gold substrates to form stable nanostructures. A research group at [[Northwestern University]] led by [[Chad Mirkin]] independently studied the process and determined that under the appropriate conditions, molecules could be transferred to a wide variety of surfaces to create stable chemically-adsorbed monolayers in a high resolution lithographic process they termed "DPN".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Piner | first1 = R.

It is important to note that "liquid inks" are governed by a very different deposition mechanism when compared to "molecular inks".

==Deposition materials==

=== Molecular inks ===
Molecular inks are typically composed of small molecules that are coated onto a DPN tip and are delivered to the surface through a water meniscus.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  In order to coat the tips, one can either vapor coat the tip or dip the tips into a dilute solution containing the molecular ink.  If one dip-coats the tips, the solvent must be removed prior to deposition.  The deposition rate of a molecular ink is dependent on the diffusion rate of the molecule, which is different for each molecule.  The size of the feature is controlled by the tip/surface dwell-time (ranging from milliseconds to seconds) and the size of the water meniscus, which is determined by the humidity conditions (assuming the tip's radius of curvature is much smaller than the meniscus).  
*Water meniscus mediated (exceptions do exist)
*Nanoscale feature resolution (50&amp;nbsp;nm to 2000&amp;nbsp;nm)
*No multiplexed depositions
*Each molecular ink is limited to its corresponding substrate

==== Examples ====
*Alkane thiols written to gold
*Silanes (solid phase) written to glass or silicon

===Liquid inks===
[[File:DPN liquid deposition.png|thumb|right|Liquid ink deposition mechanism]]
Liquid inks can be any material that is liquid at deposition conditions.  The liquid deposition properties are determined by the interactions between the liquid and the tip, the liquid and the surface, and the viscosity of the liquid itself.  These interactions limit the minimum feature size of the liquid ink to about 1 micrometre, depending on the contact angle of the liquid.  Higher viscosities offer greater control over feature size and are desirable.  Unlike molecular inks, it is possible to perform multiplexed depositions using a carrier liquid.  For example, using a viscous buffer, it is possible to directly deposit multiple proteins simultaneously.
*1-10 micrometre feature resolution
*Multiplexed depositions
*Less restrictive ink/surface requirements
*Direct deposition of high viscosity materials

== Applications ==
In order to define a good DPN application, it is important to understand what DPN can do that other techniques can't.  Direct-write techniques, like contact printing, can pattern multiple biological materials but it cannot create features with subcellular resolution.  Many high-resolution lithography methods can pattern at sub-micrometre resolution, but these require high-cost equipment that were not designed for biomolecule deposition and cell culture.  Microcontact printing can print biomolecules at ambient conditions, but it cannot pattern multiple materials with nanoscale registry.

===Industrial applications===
The following are some examples of how DPN is being applied to potential products.

== DPN properties ==

===Direct write===

DPN is a direct write technique so it can be used for top-down and bottom-up lithography applications.  In top-down work, the tips are used to deliver an etch resist to a surface, which is followed by a [[Etching (microfabrication)|standard etching process]].&lt;ref&gt;High-throughput DPN-based fabrication of Si nanostructures:  Zhang, Amro, Disawal, Elghanian, Shile, Fragala Small, 2007, 3, No. 1, 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;  In bottom-up applications, the material of interest is delivered directly to the surface via the tips.

===Unique advantages===
* Directed Placement - Directly print various materials onto existing nano and microstructures with nanoscale registry
* Direct Write - Maskless creation of arbitrary patterns with feature resolutions from as small as 50&amp;nbsp;nm and as large as 10 micrometres&lt;ref&gt;[[Maskless lithography]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biocompatible - Subcellular to nanoscale resolution at ambient deposition conditions
* Scalable - Force independent, allowing for parallel depositions&lt;ref&gt;Nature Chemistry Vol 1, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal dip pen lithography==
A heated probe tip version of Dip Pen Lithography has also been demonstrated, thermal Dip Pen Lithography (tDPL), to deposit [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref name=Woo&gt;Woo, Dai, King &amp; Sheehan "Maskless Nanoscale Writing of Nanoparticle-Polymer Composites and Nanoparticle Assemblies using Thermal Nanoprobes" NanoLetters (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Semiconductor, magnetic, metallic, or optically active nanoparticles can be written to a substrate via this method. The particles are suspended in a PMMA or equivalent polymer matrix, and heated by the probe tip until they begin to flow. The probe tip acts as a nano-pen, and can pattern nanoparticles into a programmed structure. Depending on the size of the nanoparticles, resolutions of 78-400&amp;nbsp;nm were attained. An O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma etch can be used to remove the PMMA matrix, and in the case of Iron Oxide nanoparticles, further reduce the resolution of lines to 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt; Advantages unique to tDPL are that it is a maskless additive process that can achieve very narrow resolutions, it can also easily write many types of nanoparticles without requiring special solution preparation techniques. However there are limitations to this method. The nanoparticles must be smaller than the [[radius of gyration]] of the polymer, in the case of PMMA this is about 6&amp;nbsp;nm. Additionally, as nanoparticles increase in size viscosity increases, slowing the process. For a pure polymer deposition speeds of 200&amp;nbsp;μm/s are achievable. Adding nanoparticles reduces speeds to 2&amp;nbsp;μm/s, but is still faster than regular Dip Pen Lithography.&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt;

==Beam pen lithography==
A two dimensional array of ([[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]]) deformable transparent pyramid shaped tips are coated with an opaque layer of metal. The metal is then removed from the very tip of the pyramid, leaving an aperture for light to pass through. The array is then scanned across a surface and light is directed to the base of each pyramid via a micromirror array, which funnels the light toward the tip. Depending on the distance between the tips and the surface, light interacts with the surface in a near-field or far-field fashion, allowing sub-diffraction scale features (100 nm features with 400 nm light) or larger features to be fabricated.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2010.161|title=Beam pen lithography|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.161|bibcode=2010NatNa...5..637H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Common misconceptions==

===Direct comparisons to other techniques===
[[File:Sarfus.SoftLitho.Streptavidin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Streptavidin]] (4 nm thickness) deposited using microcontact printing]]
The criticism most often directed at DPN is the patterning speed.  The reason for this has more to do with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses.  For example, the [[soft lithography]] method, [[microcontact printing]] (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to microcontact printing.  The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application.  μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as [[photolithography]] can pattern over a large area in a single exposure.  Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique.  DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate.  No one would try to apply microcontact printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern.  Even if they did, microcontact printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry.&lt;ref&gt;Mei, Y., Cannizzaro, C., Park, H., Xu, Q., Bogatyrev, S., Yi, K., Goldman, N., Langer, R. and Anderson, D., Cell-compatible, multicomponent protein arrays with subcellular feature resolution, Small, 4:  1600-1604, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and e-beam lithography.  No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be "too slow".  Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, e-beam lithography '''is''' slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world.  The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by microcontact printing.

===Connection to atomic force microscopy===
DPN evolved directly from AFM so it is not a surprise that people often assume that any commercial AFM can perform DPN experiments.  In fact, DPN does not require an AFM, and an AFM does not necessarily have real DPN capabilities.  There is an excellent analogy with [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) and electron beam (E-beam) lithography.  E-beam evolved directly from SEM technology and both use a focused electron beam, but no one would ever suggest that one could perform modern [[E-beam lithography]] experiments on a SEM that lacks the proper lithography hardware and software requirements.

It is also important to consider one of the unique characteristics of DPN, namely its force independence. With virtually all ink/substrate combinations, the same feature size will be patterned no matter how hard the tip is pressing down against the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions exist when printing to soft materials – {{cite journal|last1=Maedler|first1=C.|last2=Chada|first2=S.|last3=Cui|first3=X.|last4=Taylor|first4=M.|last5=Yan|first5=M.|last6=La Rosa|first6=A.|title=Creation of nanopatterns by local protonation of P4VP via dip pen nanolithography|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=104|issue=1|year=2008|pages=014311|issn=0021-8979|doi=10.1063/1.2953090|bibcode = 2008JAP...104a4311M |url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=phy_fac}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as robust SiN tips are used, there is no need for complicated feedback electronics, no need for lasers, no need for quad photo-diodes, and no need for an AFM.

[[Image:Dotmatrixani.gif|thumb|Example of an animated dot matrix display, with a proportional font. Note unlit dots.]]
A '''dot-matrix display''' is a [[display device]] used to display information on machines, clocks, railway departure indicators and many other devices requiring a simple display device of limited resolution.

The display consists of a [[dot matrix]] of lights or mechanical indicators arranged in a rectangular configuration (other shapes are also possible, although not common) such that by switching on or off selected lights, text or graphics can be displayed. A dot matrix controller converts instructions from a processor into signals which turns on or off lights in the matrix so that the required display is produced.

==Pixel resolutions==
[[File:Matrixanzeige220.jpg|thumb|"A Matrix Display in the size 20×2" – This is a classic 5×7 dot matrix LCD used in some early [[cellphone]]s and vending machines]]
Common sizes of dot matrix displays:
*128×16 (Two lined)
*128×32 (Four lined)
*128×64 (Eight lined)

Other sizes include:
*92×31 (Four or three lined)

==Character resolutions==
*A common size for a character is 5×7 pixels, either separated with blank lines with no dots (in most text-only displays), or with lines of blank pixels (making the real size 6×8). This is seen on most [[graphic calculator]]s, such as [[Casio]] calculators or [[TI-82]] and superior.
*A smaller size is 3×5 (or 4×6 when separated with blank pixels). This is seen on the [[TI-80]] calculator as a "pure", fixed-size 3×5 font, or on most 7×5 calculators as a proportional (1×5 to 5×5) font. The disadvantage of the 7×5 matrix and smaller is that lower case characters with [[descenders]] are not practical. A matrix of 11×9 is often used to give far superior resolution.
*Dot matrix displays of sufficient resolution can be programmed to emulate the customary [[seven-segment display|seven-segment]] numeral patterns.
*A larger size is 5×9 pixels, which is used on many Natural Display calculators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">The '''Duraspark II''' is a Ford electronic [[ignition system]].

[[Ford Motor Company]] began using electronic ignitions in 1973 with the Duraspark electronic ignition system and introduced the Duraspark II system in 1976.  The biggest change, apart from the control box redesign, was the large distributor cap to handle the increased spark energy.

==Description==
Ford used several models over the years. They were coded by the color of the plastic wire strain relief, or "grommet" as it is most often called, in order to make them easy to identify. In addition to the color-coding, the modules may have a keyway molded into the electrical connectors to prevent accidental use in the wrong vehicle.

The system consists of a magnetic reluctor and pickup in the distributor, with a separate fender mounted ignition module to trigger the coil. Typically, Duraspark II distributors have both mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms.

Certain 1981–83 models used the EEC-III system, which uses a Dura-Spark III module (brown grommet where wires emerge) and a Dura-Spark II ignition coil. A resistance wire is used in the primary circuit. The distributors in EEC-III (and later) systems eliminate conventional mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms. All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent distributor cap electrodes to prevent cross-fire, another reason for its large-diameter distributor cap. This system is very similar to the systems used at MSD; MSD used the Duraspark during R&amp;D.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==In the aftermarket==
The Duraspark II ignition system is a common upgrade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordmuscle.com/archives/2006/12/DuraSpark/|title=Duraspark Upgrade|author=|date=|work=FordMuscle.com|access-date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for older Ford cars equipped with a points-type ignition. In most cases, the distributor will interchange with the older-style points distributor. The system is similar to some aftermarket systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msdignition.com/Products/Ignitions/Daily_Driver/6201_-_Digital_6A_Ignition_Control.aspx|title=MSD 6201 Digital 6A Ignition Control - MSD Performance Products|author=|date=|work=MSDIgnition.com|access-date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the control module may be easily swapped. Duraspark swaps are easy and can be run by a Duraspark box or and aftermarket box. MSD makes a harness that adapts the Duraspark mag pick up right to an aftermarket box such as the 6AL2. Re-curving a Duraspark is a way to build additional power and economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Examples of these are available on eBay and Summit Racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/301653360126?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649|title=FE RECURVED Duraspark distributor 390 427 428 332 406 352 410 360 Dura Spark V8|author=|date=|work=ebay.com|access-date=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by AMC==
The Duraspark module was used by [[American Motors|AMC]] starting in 1978 and continued to be used with AMC's [[AMC Computerized Engine Control|computerized engine control]]. The Motorcraft Duraspark system replaced the older [[Prestolite Electric|Prestolite]] system in 1978.

AMC used the "blue grommet" module from 1978 and it continued on the carbureted AMC engines through the [[Chrysler]] buyout until 1991 for [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and 1990 for [[AMC straight-6 engine|inline 6 engines]]. In 1982 AMC briefly used the "yellow double grommet" module with three connectors in some passenger cars and [[Jeep]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A '''Faraday cage''' or '''Faraday shield''' is an enclosure used to block [[electromagnetic field]]s. A Faraday shield may be formed by a continuous covering of [[electrical conductor|conductive material]] or in the case of a Faraday cage, by a mesh of such materials. Faraday cages are named after the English scientist [[Michael Faraday]], who invented them in 1836.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Faraday |work=Encarta |url=http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577227/faraday_michael.html |accessdate=20 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc3quLs?url=http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577227/faraday_michael.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Faraday cage - FISL 14 - 2013-07-03.ogv|thumb|Video of a Faraday cage shielding a man from electricity]]
A Faraday cage operates because an external electrical field causes the [[electric charge]]s within the cage's conducting material to be distributed such that they cancel the field's effect in the cage's interior. This phenomenon is used to protect sensitive [[electronic equipment]] from external [[radio frequency interference]] (RFI).  Faraday cages are also used to enclose devices that produce RFI, such as [[radio transmitter]]s, to prevent their radio waves from interfering with other nearby equipment.  They are also used to protect people and equipment against actual electric currents such as [[lightning]] strikes and [[electrostatic discharge]]s, since the enclosing cage conducts current around the outside of the enclosed space and none passes through the interior.

Faraday cages cannot block stable or slowly varying magnetic fields, such as the [[Earth's magnetic field]] (a [[compass]] will still work inside). To a large degree, though, they shield the interior from external [[electromagnetic radiation]] if the conductor is thick enough and any holes are significantly smaller than the [[wavelength]] of the radiation. For example, certain [[computer forensics|computer forensic]] test procedures of electronic systems that require an environment free of [[electromagnetic interference]] can be carried out within a screened room. These rooms are spaces that are completely enclosed by one or more layers of a fine metal mesh or perforated sheet metal. The metal layers are grounded to dissipate any electric currents generated from external or internal electromagnetic fields, and thus they block a large amount of the electromagnetic interference. See also [[electromagnetic shielding]]. They provide less attenuation from outgoing transmissions versus incoming: they can shield [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] waves from natural phenomena very effectively, but a tracking device, especially in upper frequencies, may be able to penetrate from within the cage (e.g., some cell phones operate at various radio frequencies so while one cell phone may not work, another one will).

A common misconception is that a Faraday cage provides full blockage or attenuation; this is not true. The reception or transmission of [[radio waves]], a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], to or from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] within a Faraday cage is heavily attenuated or blocked by the cage; however, a Faraday cage has varied attenuation depending on wave form, frequency or distance from receiver/transmitter, and receiver/transmitter power. Near-field high-powered frequency transmissions like HF RFID are more likely to penetrate. Solid cages generally attenuate fields over a broader range of frequencies than mesh cages.

== History ==
In 1836, Michael Faraday observed that the excess charge on a charged conductor resided only on its exterior and had no influence on anything enclosed within it. To demonstrate this fact, he built a room coated with metal foil and allowed high-voltage discharges from an electrostatic generator to strike the outside of the room. He used an [[electroscope]] to show that there was no electric charge present on the inside of the room's walls.

Although this cage effect has been attributed to [[Faraday's ice pail experiment|Michael Faraday's famous ice pail experiments]] performed in 1843, it was [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1755 who observed the effect by lowering an uncharged cork ball suspended on a silk thread through an opening in an electrically charged metal can. In his words, "the cork was not attracted to the inside of the can as it would have been to the outside, and though it touched the bottom, yet when drawn out it was not found to be electrified (charged) by that touch, as it would have been by touching the outside. The fact is singular." Franklin had discovered the behavior of what we now refer to as a Faraday cage or shield (based on Faraday's later experiments which duplicated Franklin's cork and can).&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Krauss, ''Electromagnetics'', 4Ed, McGraw-Hill, 1992, {{ISBN|0-07-035621-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
[[Image:Faraday cage.gif|right|thumb|300px|Animation showing how a Faraday cage ''(box)'' works. When an external electrical field ''(arrows)'' is applied, the [[electron]]s ''(little balls)'' in the metal move to the left side of the cage, giving it a negative charge, while the remaining unbalanced charge of the nuclei give the right side a positive charge.  These induced charges create an opposing electric field that cancels the external electric field throughout the box.]]

===Continuous===
A continuous Faraday shield is a hollow conductor. Externally or internally applied electromagnetic fields produce forces on the [[charge carrier]]s (usually electrons) within the conductor; the charges are redistributed accordingly due to [[electrostatic induction]]. The redistributed charges greatly reduce the voltage within the surface, to an extent depending on the capacitance, however, full cancellation does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/chapman_hewett_trefethen.pdf Mathematics of the
Faraday Cage- S. Jonathan Chapman David P. Hewett Lloyd N. Trefethen&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interior charges====

If a charge is placed inside an ungrounded Faraday cage, the internal face of the cage becomes charged (in the same manner described for an external charge) to prevent the existence of a field inside the body of the cage, however, this charging of the inner face re-distributes the charges in the body of the cage. This charges the outer face of the cage with a charge equal in sign and magnitude to the one placed inside the cage. Since the internal charge and the inner face cancel each other out, the spread of charges on the outer face is not affected by the position of the internal charge inside the cage. So for all intents and purposes, the cage generates the same [[direct current|DC]] electric field that it would generate if it were simply affected by the charge placed inside. The same is not true for electromagnetic waves.

If the cage is [[ground (electricity)|grounded]], the excess charges will go to the ground instead of the outer face, so the inner face and the inner charge will cancel each other out and the rest of the cage will retain a neutral charge.

Effectiveness of shielding of a static electric field is largely independent of the geometry of the conductive material, however, static magnetic fields can penetrate the shield completely.

In the case of a varying electromagnetic fields, the faster the variations are (i.e., the higher the frequencies), the better the material resists magnetic field penetration. In this case the shielding also depends on the [[electrical conductivity]], the magnetic properties of the conductive materials used in the cages, as well as their thicknesses.

A good idea of the effectiveness of a Faraday shield can be obtained from considerations of [[skin depth]]. With skin depth, the current flowing is mostly in the surface, and decays exponentially with depth through the material. Because a Faraday shield has finite thickness, this determines how well the shield works; a thicker shield can attenuate electromagnetic fields better, and to a lower frequency.

===Faraday cage===
Faraday cages are Faraday shields which have holes in them and are therefore more complex to analyze. Whereas continuous shields essentially attenuate all wavelengths shorter than the skin depth, the holes in a cage may permit shorter wavelengths to pass through or set up "[[evanescent field]]s" (oscillating fields that do not propagate as EM waves) just beneath the surface. The shorter the wavelength, the better it passes through a mesh of given size. Thus to work well at short wavelengths (i.e., high frequencies), the holes in the cage must be smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave. Faraday cages may therefore be thought of as [[high pass filter]]s.

== Examples ==
* Faraday cages are routinely used in [[analytical chemistry]] to reduce noise while making sensitive measurements. 
* Faraday cages, more specifically dual paired seam Faraday bags, are often used in digital forensics to prevent remote wiping and alteration of criminal digital evidence.
* The U.S. and NATO [[Tempest_(codename)|Tempest]] standards, and similar standards in other countries, include Faraday cages as part of a broader effort to provide [[emission security]] for computers.
* Automobile and airplane passenger compartments are essentially Faraday cages, protecting passengers from electric charges, such as lightning
* A [[booster bag]] (shopping bag lined with [[aluminium foil]]) acts as a Faraday cage. It is often used by shoplifters to steal [[radio-frequency identification|RFID]]-tagged items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Hamill | first=Sean | title=As Economy Dips, Arrests for Shoplifting Soar| date=22 December 2008 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/us/23shoplift.html | accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Similar containers are used to resist [[RFID skimming]].
* [[Elevator]]s and other rooms with metallic conducting frames and walls simulate a Faraday cage effect, leading to a loss of signal and "dead zones" for users of [[cellular phone]]s, [[radio]]s, and other electronic devices that require external electromagnetic signals. During training, firefighters, and other first responders are cautioned that their two-way radios will probably not work inside elevators and to make allowances for that.  Small, physical Faraday cages are used by electronics engineers during equipment testing to simulate such an environment to make sure that the device gracefully handles these conditions.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Properly designed conductive clothing can also form a protective Faraday cage. Some electrical [[lineman (technician)|linemen]] wear Faraday suits, which allow them to work on live, high-voltage power lines without risk of electrocution. The suit prevents electric current from flowing through the body, and has no theoretical voltage limit. Linemen have successfully worked even the highest voltage ([[Ekibastuz–Kokshetau high-voltage line|Kazakhstan's Ekibastuz–Kokshetau line]] 1150 kV) lines safely.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
** Austin Richards, a physicist in California, created a metal Faraday suit in 1997 that protects him from tesla coil discharges. In 1998, he named the character in the suit Doctor MegaVolt and has performed all over the world and at [[Burning Man]] nine different years.
* The scan room of a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machine is designed as a Faraday cage. This prevents external RF (radio frequency) signals from being added to data collected from the patient, which would affect the resulting image.  Radiographers are trained to identify the characteristic artifacts created on images should the Faraday cage be damaged during a [[thunderstorm]].
* A [[microwave oven]] utilizes a Faraday cage, which can be partly seen covering the transparent window, to contain the electromagnetic energy within the oven and to shield the exterior from radiation.
&lt;!--seems to be more complicated than that.

The '''Focke-Wulf Fw 47 ''Höhengeier''''' (German: "Vulture"), known internally to [[Focke-Wulf]] as the '''A 47''', was a meteorological aircraft developed in [[Germany]] in 1931. It was a [[Parasol wing|parasol-wing]] [[monoplane]] of largely conventional design, unusual only in the expansiveness of its wing area. Tested first by the ''Reichsverband der Deutschen Luftfahrtindustrie'', and then the weather station at Hamburg, the type was ordered into production to equip ten major weather stations around Germany.

A '''Global Offset Table''', or '''GOT''', is a table of addresses stored in the data section.
It is used by executed programs to find during runtime addresses of global variables, unknown in compile time.
The global offset table is updated in process bootstrap by the dynamic linker.
Offsets to global variables from dynamic libraries are not known during compile time, this is why they are read from the GOT table during runtime.

The [[procedure linkage table]] contains trampoline code for calling shared functions.

It has been used in many U.S. space projects since 1973 and its most significant use was in the [[Space Shuttle program]] (approximately 85% of the Shuttle software is coded in HAL/S).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19810022530|title=Current Status of the HAL/S Compiler|last=Lytle|first=P.J.|date=1981|website=Archive.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed by [[Intermetrics]] in 1972 for [[NASA]] and delivered in 1973. HAL/S is written in [[XPL]], a dialect of [[PL/I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.toronto.edu/XPL/hal.html|title=The Development of Hal/S|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although HAL/S is designed primarily for programming on-board computers, it is general enough to meet nearly all the needs in the production, verification, and support of aerospace and other real-time applications. According to documentation from 2005, it is been maintained by the HAL/S project of United Space Alliance.&lt;ref name="hal-s-specification-nov2005"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://klabs.org/richcontent/software_content/hal_s/hal-s_language_specification.pdf|title = HAL/S Language Specification|date = November 2005|access-date = 2016-11-16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090226213557/http://klabs.org/richcontent/software_content/hal_s/hal-s_language_specification.pdf|archivedate = 2009-02-26|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and principles==
The three key principles in designing the language were reliability, efficiency, and [[Software portability|machine-independence]]. The language is designed to allow aerospace-related tasks (such as [[vector (geometry)|vector]]/[[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] arithmetic) to be accomplished in a way that is easily understandable by people who have spaceflight knowledge, but may not necessarily have proficiency with computer programming.

HAL/S was designed not to include some constructs that were thought to be the cause of [[computer bug|error]]s. For instance, there is no support for dynamic memory allocation. The language provides special support for [[real-time computing|real-time]] execution environments. 

Some features, such as "[[GOTO]]" were provided chiefly to ease mechanical translations from other languages.&lt;ref name="hal-s-specification-nov2005"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://klabs.org/richcontent/software_content/hal_s/hal-s_language_specification.pdf|title = HAL/S Language Specification|date = November 2005|access-date = 2016-11-16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090226213557/http://klabs.org/richcontent/software_content/hal_s/hal-s_language_specification.pdf|archivedate = 2009-02-26|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (page 82) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790006637.pdf|title = Programming in HAL/S|date = 1979|access-date = 2016-02-14|website = |publisher = Source: NASA Technical Reports Server|last = Ryer|first = Michael J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Preface page of the HAL/S Language Specification,&lt;ref name="hal-s-specification-nov2005"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it says,
:fundamental contributions to the concept and implementation of MAC were made by Dr. [[J. Halcombe Laning]] of the [[Draper Laboratory]].
"HAL" was suggested as the name of the new language by Ed Copps, a founding director of [[Intermetrics]], to honor Hal Laning, a colleague at [[MIT]].

A proposal for a NASA standard ground-based version of HAL named HAL/G for "ground" was proposed, but the coming emergence of the soon to be named [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] programming language contributed to Intermetrics' lack of interest in continuing this work. Instead, Intermetrics would place emphasis on what would be the "Red" finalist which would not be selected.

Host compiler systems have been implemented on an IBM 360/370, Data General Eclipse, and the Modcomp IV/Classic computers. Target computer systems have included [[IBM 360|IBM 360/370]], [[IBM System/4 Pi|IBM AP-101]] (space shuttle avionics computer), Sperry 1819A/1819B, [[Data General Nova]] and Eclipse, CII Mitra 125, Modcomp II and IV, NASA Std. Spacecraft Computer-l and Computer-2, ITEK ATAC 16M ([[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo Project]]), and since 1978 the [[RCA 1802|RCA CDP1802 COSMAC]] microprocessor (Galileo Project and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19810022530|title=Current Status of the HAL/S Compiler|last=Lytle|first=P.J.|date=1981|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
HAL/S is a mostly [[free-form language]]: statements may begin anywhere on a line and may spill over the next lines, and multiple statements may be fitted onto the same line if required. However, non-space characters in the first column of a program line may have special significance. For instance, the letter 'C' in the first column indicates that the whole line is a [[Comment (computer programming)|comment]] and should be ignored by the compiler.

One particularly interesting feature of HAL/S is that it supports, in addition to a normal single line text format, an optional three-line input format in which three source code lines are used for each statement. In this format, the first and third lines are usable for superscripts (exponents) and subscripts (indices). The multi-line format was designed to permit writing of HAL/S code that is similar to [[mathematical notation]]. 

As an example, the statement &lt;math&gt;x = a^2 + b_i^2&lt;/math&gt; could be written in single-line format as:
 X = A ** 2 + B$(I) ** 2 
[[Exponentiation]] is denoted by two [[asterisk]]s, as in PL/I and [[Fortran]]. The subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by a [[dollar sign]],with the subscript expression enclosed in [[parenthesis|parentheses]]. The same code fragment could be written in multiple-line format as:
 E       2     2
 M  X = A  + B
 S            I 
In the example, the base line of the statement is indicated by an 'M' in the first column, the exponent line is indicated by an 'E', and the subscript line is indicated by an 'S'.

==Data types==
HAL/S has native support for [[integer]]s, [[floating point]] [[Variable (computing)|scalars]], [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[boolean data type|boolean]]s and [[string (computer science)|string]]s of 8-bit characters, limited to a maximum length of 255. Structured types may be composed using a &lt;code&gt;DECLARE STRUCT&lt;/code&gt; statement.

==20th Century==
In 1957, the first [[digital computer]] arrived in [[Chile]] after the [[Compañía de las Cervecerías Unidas|CCU]] purchased a [[Univac]] to be delivered to [[Valparaiso]]. The machine was one of the first documented cases in the history of computer science in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openlibra.com/es/book/bits-de-ciencia-15|title=Bits de Ciencia 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970's, [[Project Cybersyn]] was created as an ambitious project to implement [[Socialism|cybernetic socialism]] under the short-lived administration of [[Salvador Allende]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2018/08/project-cybersyn-afterlife-chile-s-socialist-internet|title=Project Cybersyn: the afterlife of Chile's socialist internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st Century==
The [[Free Software Foundation Latin America]] exists to promote the use of [[free software]] in [[Latin America]]. In 2009, [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] founder [[Richard Stallman]] visited [[Buenos Aires]] during the concurrent [[Wikimania 2009]] conference in order to promote [[free software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/stallman-takes-his-free-software-crusade-to-argentina/|title=Stallman Takes His Free-Software Crusade to Argentina|date=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman regularly gives speeches in Spanish and has visited Latin America multiples times since 2009.

'''Itslearning''' is a [[Personal computer|digital]] [[learning management system]] developed by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] company itslearning AS and designed for both lower and higher degrees of education: from kindergartens and primary schools to colleges.&lt;ref name="bt1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Østerbø|first1=Kjell|title=Itslearning blir størst i Europa|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Itslearning-blir-storst-i-Europa-286410b.html|accessdate=16 October 2016|work=Bergens Tidende|publisher=bt.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Itslearning is among the top 15 LMS for higher education worldwide, with about 1% of the market in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-09-07|title=Blackboard, Moodle still LMS leaders |publisher= Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/data/2017/07/12/blackboard-moodle-still-lms-leaders|website=www.insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The system was created by a group of students at [[Bergen University College]] in 1998 as a [[Master's degree|master's project]] on the topic of "virtual classrooms".&lt;ref name="itsaboutus"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://itslearning.com/about-us/our-story/|website=itslearning.com|publisher=itslearning|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E24 1"/&gt; A group of teachers asked whether the system could be created, and after receiving a sum of start-up money from the College itslearning was created following year in 1999, and Bergen University College became the first user of the system.&lt;ref name="itsaboutus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E24 1"/&gt; The company was first established as "it:solutions".&lt;ref name="itsaboutus"/&gt;

In 2004, Arne Bergby became CEO of itslearning.&lt;ref name="itsaboutus"/&gt; As of 2015 Bergby owns 9.16% of the holding company in ownership of itslearning.&lt;ref name="E24 1"/&gt; A U.S. office was opened in 2009 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="itsaboutus"/&gt; In 2013, itslearning acquired [[SkoleIntra]], and in 2015 [[Fronter]].&lt;ref name="itsaboutus"/&gt; In 2014, 40% of the company was sold to the Swedish private equity fund [[EQT]]. The company at the time was valued at 600 million NOK ($73 million).&lt;ref name="E24 1"/&gt;

Itslearning experimented and abandoned some markets such as Spain and Italy, where it was difficult to generate revenue.&lt;ref name="E24 1"/&gt;

As of 2016, the company headquarters are in [[Bergen]], Norway, with offices in [[Atlanta]], [[Berlin]], [[Boston]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Enschede]], [[Helsinki]], [[Milton Keynes]], [[Malmö]], [[Mulhouse]], and [[Paris]].

==Content==
The system is an arena for communication and cooperation, as well as a tool for administration, evaluation and following up on students/pupils. Itslearning is specially adapted for schools, and enables publishing of subject schedules, and individual or group messages (as to a class). In project assignments, students can create groups where files may be uploaded, or ideas discussed. It's also possibly to create and publish tests and competitions in the system. Assignments may be published with or without a deadline, and hand-ins may be uploaded digitally, with options for grading the hand-in digitally and displaying the assessment to the student. There is also access to [[ePortfolio]], which allows each member to create a presentation of themselves. Such homepage contains a blog, and possibilities to upload pictures, etc.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Users==

Itslearning claims to have over four million active users worldwide, mainly in the United States, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Germany and Brazil.&lt;ref name="E24 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lilleby|first1=Jan|title=Nedturen har vært å prøve oss i markeder vi ikke har lyktes i|url=http://e24.no/digital/eksportprisen-2016/itslearning-vil-erobre-usa-nedturen-har-vaert-aa-proeve-oss-i-markeder-vi-ikke-har-lyktes-i/23580771|accessdate=15 October 2016|agency=E24|publisher=E24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over 900.000 users exist in Norway alone,&lt;ref name="Digi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jørgenrud|first1=Marius|title=Da Itslearning krasjet måtte de fly inn nye komponenter. Opptil 2 millioner brukere rammet|url=http://www.digi.no/artikler/da-itslearning-krasjet-matte-de-fly-inn-nye-komponenter-opptil-2-millioner-brukere-rammet/359256|website=Digi.no|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the few countries where [[Moodle]] is not first by market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe Report: Moodle Market Share Leader Almost Everywhere|url=https://www.moodlenews.com/2016/europe-report-moodle-market-share-leader-almost-everywhere/|newspaper=Moodle News|date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, the system is used extensively by several schools and educational institutions: itslearning is used by universities such as [[Norwegian School of Economics]], [[BI Norwegian Business School]], [[Norwegian School of Information Technology]] and [[University of Stavanger]]. Additionally, it is used by primary, middle and high schools. The [[County municipality (Norway)|county municipalities]] of [[Akershus]], [[Buskerud]], [[Hordaland]], [[Hedmark]], [[Nordland]], [[Nord-Trøndelag]], [[Rogaland]], [[Sør-Trøndelag]], [[Vest-Agder]] and [[Vestfold]] all use itslearning in high schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Several US school districts use itslearning as its school platform, including Germantown Academy, [[Dallas]], [[League City, Texas|Clear Creek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/02/15/texas-district-adopts-itslearning-lms.aspx?m=2|title=Texas District Adopts itslearning LMS -- THE Journal|access-date=2016-05-14|publisher=thejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oslo]] and [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/utbildningsforvaltningen/pressreleases/elevens-laerande-viktigt-naer-stockholms-stad-vaeljer-ny-leverantoer-963656|title=Elevens lärande viktigt när Stockholms stad väljer ny leverantör|access-date=2016-05-14|publisher=Mynewsdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The few publicly available evaluation of itslearning indicate that its users are satisfied with the system: a survey carried out in 2003 showed that a high percentage of users at Bergen University College were pleased with the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050224023929/http://www.hib.no/om/organisering/styret/motebok/2003/Inn_8_03/sak86_03vedl2.pdf Rapport: Evaluering av It's learning]&lt;/ref&gt; A second survey carried out in conjunction with a master's degree showed that 67% of students at different faculties at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] and [[Sør-Trøndelag University College]] are satisfied or very satisfied with itslearning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daim.idi.ntnu.no/masteroppgave?id=5468 Masteroppgave: User Acceptance of Information Technology -  An Empirical Study of It's Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Fitbit products ==

=== Clip-on trackers ===

==== Fitbit Zip ====
[[ Image:White Fitbit Zip.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | A white Fitbit Zip, showing the distance in miles covered by the wearer. ]]
{{Clear}}
Announced on September 17, 2012, the Fitbit Zip is about the size of [[Quarter (United States coin)|a United States quarter]] and tracks steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned. It is able to sync its data wirelessly to supported mobile devices.&lt;ref name="fitbit.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbit.com/devices|title=Fitbit Supported Devices|work=fitbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wristband trackers ===

==== Fitbit Flex 2 ====
Released in 2017. It is waterproof and can track swimming. The tracker can be worn in a wristband or pendant, or carried in a pocket. The LED lights function similar to the original Flex, with the number of illuminated dots indicating progress toward the set goal. It features "reminder to move" alerts and vibrations when a call or text is received.

==== Fitbit Alta ====
The Fitbit Alta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgetswizard.com/fitbit-has-announced-a-customizable-fitness-band-the-alta/|title=Fitbit has announced a customizable fitness band – the Alta|date=February 4, 2016|work=gadgetswizard}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in February 2016. The wristband offers a full [[OLED]] screen that can be tapped for reminders, a clock and smartphone notifications. While not a touch screen, it is interacted with by tapping the band, similar to previous models. The Alta is also able to recognize the type of activity in progress: running, football or walking. 

==== Fitbit Alta HR ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Alta_HR_landscape.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Alta HR fitness tracker wristband showing heart rate monitor display. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Alta HR was released in March 2017. It has an added heart rate monitor. It includes the new Sleep Stages feature, which intends to show the stages of sleep, rather than just time asleep as in previous versions. 

====Fitbit Ace ====
Released in 2018, the Fitbit Ace is a variant of the Alta for children 8+ years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/ace|title=Fitbit Ace™ Kids Wristband|website=www.fitbit.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/03/13/fitbit-ace-tracker/|title=Ace is Fitbit’s new kid-focused fitness tracker|last=Bonifacic|first=Igor|date=13 March 2018|work=MobileSyrup|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fitbit Charge 3 ====
[[ Image:Charge 3.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Charge 3 displaying Time, Heart Rate, and Steps. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Charge 3 was released in October 2018. It has a heart rate sensor as well as an [[Pulse oximetry|oxygen saturation]] (SPO2) sensor. Sleep tracking has been improved from the Charge 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/fitbit-charge-3-review|title=Hands on: Fitbit Charge 3 review|work=TechRadar|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2018, a special edition of the Fitbit Charge 3 was released featuring "Fitbit Pay" as a special feature.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.fitbit.com/charge-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smartwatches ===
==== Fitbit Ionic ====
[[ Image:FitbitIonicMomentDisplay.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Ionic in Slate Blue &amp; Burnt Orange. ]]
[[ Image:FitBitIonicWorkOutMode092917.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | The Fitbit Ionic in workout mode on Fitbit OS 1.0. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Ionic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3219717/software-health/meet-fitbit-ionic-a-little-smartwatch-a-lot-of-fitness-tracker.html|title=Meet Fitbit Ionic: A little smartwatch, a lot of fitness tracker|last1=Simon|first1=Michael|website=Macworld.com|publisher=macworld.com|accessdate=28 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in late September 2017. Designed to compete with the [[Apple Watch Series 3]], it is the successor to both the Blaze and the Surge. Like the Surge, the Ionic uses built-in GPS, using [[GLONASS]] to tap into global satellites and provide better accuracy when recording exercises, with the antenna being integrated into the watch case for a stronger connection. The Ionic also features SmartTrack, which auto-recognizes user activity and records it in the Fitbit app. The Ionic has interchangeable bands, including classic Fitbit bands, leather bands, and perforated bands for a more sport-like appearance, and the release mechanism has been modified to make swapping out bands easier. It is also water-resistant, making it safe to wear when swimming. Many of the Blaze's clock faces return, as do several new clock faces. New to the Ionic is the ability to load apps onto the watch itself such as [[AccuWeather]] and [[Starbucks]], as well as an NFC chip that allows the Ionic to be used for credit card purchases at places that allow contactless payment. As a result, the tactile buttons on the Ionic have some new functions. When not in workout mode, the right side buttons now function as shortcuts for the leftmost two apps loaded onto the watch, while a long press on the left side button brings up Fitbit Pay as well as music and quick settings. The Ionic is shipped in three color combinations of the wristband and watch case: Charcoal &amp; Smoke Gray, Slate Blue &amp; Burnt Orange, and Blue Gray &amp; Silver Gray.

In 2018, the Ionic was updated to Fitbit OS 2.0 alongside the release of the Versa. The most notable change from OS 1.0 is the addition of a new app called Fitbit Today, a much more intuitive and informative dashboard displaying the user's health and fitness data. It is accessible by swiping up from the clock face, while the notification tray is now accessed by swiping down from the clock face. In addition, a long press on the back button now opens up the music controls, payments, and the shortcuts screen, instead of just Fitbit Pay. In July 2018, Fitbit announced the 15+ Best Fitbit OS Apps for Travel, that can be downloaded in Ionic and some are also available in Versa.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.fitbit.com/best-apps-for-travel/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fitbit Versa ====
Released in April 2018, it has a square design with round edges, similar to the Apple Watch and Pebble watches. It retains most of the Ionic's features and interface. It is capable of tracking women's menstrual cycles. It does not have built-in GPS like the Ionic, instead using connected GPS like the Blaze. 

There are two variants of the Versa; the standard edition and the Special Edition. The standard Versa comes in three colors: Black, Rose Gold, and Silver. The Special Edition comes in two colors: Rose Gold with a Lavender band, and Graphite with a Charcoal band. They also include woven wristbands.

=== Smart scales ===

==== Fitbit Aria 2 ====
[[ Image:Fitbit Aria 2.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Aria 2 in black. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Aria 2 was announced in August 2017 concurrently with the Ionic. The Aria 2 has been re-engineered for greater accuracy and easier Bluetooth setup. The Aria 2 also has personalized face icons and greetings, compatibility with more Wi-Fi networks, and has an increased weight tolerance of up to 400 pounds.

=== Fitbit wireless headphones ===

==== Fitbit Flyer ====
Sweatproof wireless earphones by Fitbit. Has noise isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/flyer|title=Fitbit Flyer™ Wireless Fitness Headphones|website=www.fitbit.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discontinued Fitbit products ==

=== Clip-on trackers ===

==== Fitbit Tracker ====
The Fitbit Tracker was a small black and teal device that could be clipped discreetly onto clothing and worn 24/7. It uses a three-dimensional [[accelerometer]] to sense user movement. The Tracker measures steps taken and combines it with user data to calculate distance walked, calories burned, floors climbed and activity duration and intensity. It uses an [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED display]] to display this and other information such as the battery level. It also measures sleep quality by tracking periods of restlessness, how long it takes the wearer to fall asleep and how long they are actually asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/11/fitbit-tracker-pedometer-lifestyle-heatlh-lifetracking.html|title=Getting Fitbit|last=Ewalt|first=David M.|date=June 11, 2010|publisher=Forbes|access-date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wireless]] base station is included to receive data from the Tracker and to charge its battery. When connected to a computer, the base station will upload data to the Fitbit website, where a number of features are available: seeing an overview of physical activity, setting and tracking goals, keeping food and activity logs and interacting with friends. Use of the website is free.

The Fitbit Classic tracked only steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, activity intensity and sleep.

At the [[TechCrunch50]] during the "Mobile" session on September 9, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/21361/page1/|title=Self Surveillance|last=Greene|first=Kate|date=September 10, 2008|work=Technology Review|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit received positive reactions during its panel from experts like [[Rafe Needleman]], [[Tim O'Reilly]], and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] who cited its wearability, price, and lack of subscription fees.

==== Fitbit Ultra ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Ultra_-_teal.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Ultra activity tracker in teal clipped to pocket. ]]
{{Clear}}
The Fitbit Ultra was announced on October 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fitbit.com/?p=522|title=Fitbit Blog|work=Fitbit Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new features included:

* an [[altimeter]] that measures elevation gain in terms of floors, with one floor roughly equivalent to ten feet
* a digital clock visible on the device's display
* a [[stopwatch]] that can be used to time activities
* randomized "Chatter" messages show when the Ultra is moved after sitting idle for a while
* new colors

The Fitbit Ultra is powered by a small [[lithium polymer battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.takeitapart.com/guide/11|title=Fitbit Ultra|work=takeitapart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fitbit Ultra suffered from a small design flaw: the unit had a permanently curved shape in order to clip directly onto any piece of clothing. The plastic used in the unit was not appropriate for the strain experienced at the looped end, and with time would become brittle, and crack. While most users experienced only minor cracking with no effects to the device's function, in a few cases the cracking led to total failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatguyshrinking.com/fitbit-ultra-repair/|title=Fitbit Ultra Repair|website=www.fatguyshrinking.com|accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://azurelunatic.dreamwidth.org/7102302.html|title=Fitbit! In which I switch from my failing Fitbit Ultra to a Fitbit One, with error messages.|website=azurelunatic.dreamwidth.org|accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.technicallyrunning.com/2012/12/fitbit-one-review/|title=Fitbit One Review|website=Technically Running|language=en-US|accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit offered replacement or repair of affected units that were under warranty.

==== Fitbit One ====
Announced on September 17, 2012, the Fitbit One is an update to the Fitbit Ultra that uses a more vivid digital display, has a separate clip and a separate charging cable and wireless sync [[dongle]].&lt;ref name="Co.Design article about new One"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670906/fitbits-newest-gadget-247-fitness-tracking-meets-247-app-syncing#1|title=Fitbit's Newest Gadget: 24/7 Fitness Tracking Meets 24/7 App Syncing|last=Wilson|first=Mark|work=Co.Design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fitbit One and the Fitbit Zip were the first wireless activity trackers to sync using Bluetooth 4.0 or [[Bluetooth SMART]] technology. The wireless syncing is currently available on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices such as the iPhone 4S and higher, iPad 3rd generation, iPod touch 5th generation, Samsung Galaxy Note II and higher, [[Samsung Galaxy S III]] and higher, LG G2, HTC One, Moto X, and Nexus 4 or higher.&lt;ref name="fitbit.com" /&gt; Fitbit One can record several daily activities, including but not limited to, number of steps taken, distance traveled on foot, number of floors climbed, calories burned, vigorously active minutes, and sleep efficiency.

=== Wristband trackers ===

==== Fitbit Flex ====
[[ Image:Fitibit_Flex.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Flex with accompanying wristband. ]]
{{Clear}}
In May 2013, Fitbit released the Fitbit Flex, the first Fitbit tracker worn on the wrist. It tracks movement 24 hours a day, including sleep patterns. It has a simple display of 5 LED lights that indicate the progress toward the goal number of steps walked in a day and vibrates to indicate when the goal has been reached. The sync functions are similar to the Fitbit One and Zip. The Flex is the most water-resistant tracker, though cannot be worn while swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/au/flex#features|title=Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity &amp; Sleep Wristband – Specifications|publisher=Fitbit|quote=Flex has been tested up to 1 ATM meaning it is sweat, rain and splash proof. However, the device is not swim proof.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a specialized USB charger; the battery lasts 5–7 days, and it takes 1–2 hours to charge.

==== Fitbit Force ====
The Fitbit Force was announced on October 10, 2013. It has an OLED display&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitgadgetreviews.com/fitbit-force-review/|title=The best activity tracker yet... The Fitbit Force reviewed}}&lt;/ref&gt; that shows time and daily activity. The Force tracks a number of statistics in real-time, including steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, stairs climbed and active minutes throughout the day. At night, the Force tracks sleep and can wake a user silently with a vibrating alarm.

On January 13, 2014 it was reported that an unconfirmed number of Fitbit customers had complained about skin irritation after wearing the Force for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/14/fitbit-apologies-_n_4599193.html|title=Fitbit Apologizes To Customers Who've Experienced Skin Reactions|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit stated on its website that the company consulted with medical professionals whose assessments are that these irritations are most likely [[Allergic contact dermatitis|allergic reactions to nickel]], a component of the surgical-grade steel or the adhesives used to assemble the Fitbit Force.&lt;ref name="ForceCEO"&gt;[https://www.fitbit.com/forcesupport CEO letter 2/20/14]. February 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit, working with the Consumer Protection Safety Commission, recalled the Fitbit Force on February 20, 2014.&lt;ref name="ForceCEO" /&gt; On March 12, 2014 the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) made the recall official.&lt;ref name="ForceRecall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2014/Fitbit-Recalls-Force-Activity-Tracking-Wristband/|title=Fitbit Recalls Force Activity-Tracking Wristband Due to Risk of Skin Irritation|date=12 March 2014|work=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was revealed that The Fitbit Force had caused about 9,900 injuries.&lt;ref name="ForceRecall" /&gt; It is no longer for sale on Fitbit's website.

==== Fitbit Charge ====
Announced in October 2014, the Fitbit Charge is intended as a replacement for the recalled Fitbit Force. It was released in November 2014 for US$130 retail. The Charge's wrist band is textured and has a screen that can display caller ID information from a connected smartphone through the Fitbit app. The Charge automatically tracks users' steps, sleep, flights of stairs (using an altimeter) and an approximation of distance traveled. It tracks steps using a 3 axis accelerometer by tracking forward movement along with upward movements.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;Burns, Matt (October 27, 2014). "[https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/fitbits-latest-activity-trackers-feature-heartheart-monitoring-smartwatch-functions/ Fitbit's Latest Activity Trackers Feature Heart Monitoring, Smartwatch Functions]".

==== Fitbit Charge HR ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Charge_HR.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Charge HR. ]]
{{Clear}}
Announced in October 2014 and released in early January 2015, the Charge HR is similar to the Charge, with an additional heart-rate monitor. With this addition, the 7-day battery life is reduced to 5 days. The Charge HR has the same textured band as the Charge and comes in black, plum, blue, tangerine, pink, and teal colors. The Charge HR band clasp resembles that of a traditional watch instead of the snap-on band of the original Charge, as the band needs to fit tightly for the heart rate feature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fitbit.com/chargehr#specs|title=Fitbit Charge HR Wireless Heart Rate + Activity Wristband|work=fitbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Matt.

==== Fitbit Charge 2 ====
The Fitbit Charge 2 featured a new multi-sport mode allowing users to start workouts from their Fitbit. Compared to its predecessor it had a larger screen.

=== Smartwatches ===

==== Fitbit Surge ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Surge.JPG | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Surge. ]]
{{Clear}}
Announced in October 2014, the Surge was a [[smartwatch]] and an activity tracker. It features a heart-rate monitor and the ability to track pace, distance, and elevation using the GPS on the device. The Surge also can send alerts of text and incoming calls from a connected smartphone.

The Surge was discontinued in late 2017.

==== Fitbit Blaze ====
[[ Image:FitBitBlazeMomentDisplay.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Blaze. ]]
{{Clear}}
Released in January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10702524/fitbit-blaze-fitness-tracker-watch-lcd-announced-ces-2016|title=Fitbit's new wearable is a fitness watch called Blaze|last=Goode|first=Lauren|date=January 5, 2016|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fitbit Blaze is a smartwatch made to compete with the [[Apple Watch]], [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]], and [[Android Wear]]. The Blaze comes with a colored touchscreen, and exchangeable strap and frame. It can auto-tracking exercises and has a heart-rate monitor. Blaze has connected GPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techvedic.com/uk/innovation-and-revolution/ces-2016-highlights/|title=CES 2016 highlights|work=Techvedic}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it tracks location using the connected smartphone's GPS. It can display notifications, including incoming calls, texts and calendar appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Cipriani, Jason (March 29, 2016). "[http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-setup-use-fitbit-blaze-smartwatch/ Getting started with the Fitbit Blaze]". CNET.&lt;/ref&gt; The Blaze introduces the Sleep Stages feature.

The Fitbit Blaze also integrates with Fitstar, Fitbit's website for customized workouts. These workouts can be displayed on the Blaze's screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-blaze-review|title=Fitbit Blaze review|last=Stables|first=James|date=March 3, 2016|work=Wareable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blaze was discontinued in early 2018.

=== Smart scales ===

==== Fitbit Aria ====
[[ Image:Fitbit_Aria.jpg | thumb | left | 200px | Fitbit Aria. ]]
{{Clear}}
In April 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdgt.com/fitbit/|title=Fitbit|work=Engadget|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303003913/http://gdgt.com/fitbit/|archive-date=2010-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitbit released a [[weighing scale]] called the Fitbit Aria. It recognizes users and measures weight, body mass index ([[Body mass index|BMI]]) and percentage of body fat of the user. It can keep track of eight individual users and updates information to fitbit.com automatically via Wi-Fi network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbit.com/product/aria|title=Fitbit Aria™ Wi-Fi Smart Scale|work=fitbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information is also updated to smartphone apps.

'''Live television''' is a [[Video production|television production]] broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. In a secondary meaning, it may refer to [[streaming television]] over the internet.  In most cases live programming is not being recorded as it is shown on TV, but rather was not rehearsed or edited  and is being shown only as it was recorded prior to being aired. Shows broadcast live include [[News broadcasting|newscast]]s, [[Breakfast television|morning shows]], awards shows, sports programs, reality programs and, occasionally, episodes of scripted television series.

Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when [[videotape]] technology was invented.  Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television shows remained live until the 1970s, such as [[soap opera]]s.  To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be [[Broadcast delay|delayed]], which allows censors to edit the program.  Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others.

== Types of shows ==
From the early days of television until about 1958, live television was used heavily, except for [[film]]ed shows such as ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. Although [[videotape]] was invented in 1956, it cost $300 per one hour reel ({{Inflation|US|300|1956|fmt=eq}})
meaning it was only very gradually adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A3224936 "The History of Magnetic Recording"], ''BBC'',  20 December 2004. Retrieved on 23 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, such as [[soap opera]]s, did not completely abandon live broadcasts until the mid-1970s.

In general, a live [[television program]] was more common for broadcasting content produced specifically for [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] in the early years of the medium, before technologies such as video tape appeared. As [[video tape recorder]]s (VTR) became more prevalent, many entertainment programs were recorded and edited before broadcasting rather than being shown live.

=== Morning shows ===
[[Television network]]s provide most live television for [[Breakfast television|morning shows]] with television programs such as: ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'', ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'', etc. broadcast live in the UK; [[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]] live in Australia; [[Canada AM]] live in Canada; and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', and ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' in the U.S., which air live only in the Eastern Time Zone. The only exceptions are ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning - Saturday]]'' and ''[[Weekend Today|Sunday Today with Willie Geist]]'', which air live in the Eastern and Central time zones. Spanish-language morning shows (such as ''[[Despierta America]]'' and ''[[Un Nuevo Día]]''), unlike their English speaking counterparts, air live in across the mainland U.S. except for viewers in the Pacific time zone, which, along with viewers in Hawaii and Alaska, have tape-delayed shows.

A few daytime talk shows in the U.S. broadcast live before a studio audience in select time zones. Shows such as ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'' and the ''[[Wendy Williams Show]]'' air live in the Eastern time zone only, while shows such as ABC's ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' air live in the Eastern and Central time zones. ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'' on CBS airs live in the Eastern and Central time zones Monday through Thursday. A separate program is taped on Thursday afternoon for airing on Friday.  Affiliates in the remaining time zones air these programs on a [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]. Most other daytime talk shows and [[Late-night talk show|late night programs]] are taped before a live studio audience earlier in the day and edited for later broadcast.

=== Entertainment shows ===
During [[prime time]], [[Miss USA]], [[Miss America]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2011 Miss America Pageant: Ratings increase 47% for ABC telecast|url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2011/jan/17/2011-miss-america-pageant-ratings-increase-47-abc-/|quote=... 2-hour live telecast (tape delayed on the West Coast) ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and talent shows (such as ''[[Dancing With The Stars]]'') air live in the Eastern and Central time zones. Other talent shows (such as ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'', and ''[[America's Got Talent]]'') will pre-record audition rounds and broadcast the live rounds in the Eastern and Central time zones where viewers have the opportunity to vote for their favorite contestants. In particular, until today, several live prime time U.S. entertainment telecasts are still tape-delayed for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones.

For decades, the [[Academy Awards]] have been televised live in all U.S. time zones within mainland North America. The advent of the Internet and social media outlets (e.g. Facebook and Twitter, which resulted in numerous "spoilers") in the late 2000s, however, prompted several broadcasters to air live awards shows simultaneously across both U.S. coasts, beginning with NBC in 2009 with the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. The [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and [[Billboard Music Awards]] followed suit in the following decade.

Meanwhile, CBS began offering its affiliates in the Mountain and Pacific time zones an optional live broadcast of the [[Grammy Awards]] in 2016 (with stations in the Pacific time zone airing a rebroadcast of the Grammys immediately after the live broadcast during primetime).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grammy.com/news/cbs-to-broadcast-58th-grammy-awards-live-nationwide "CBS To Broadcast 58th GRAMMY Awards Live Nationwide"], "www.grammy.com", 19 January 2016. Retrieved 22 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning 2017, both the Grammys and the Primetime Emmys have been aired to totality live in all U.S. territories, including Alaska and Hawaii. Most other award shows in the U.S. typically air live in the Eastern and Central time zones. Currently, the [[Tony Awards]] is the only major awards show that continues the practice of tape delaying to the West Coast.

=== News shows ===
Most local television station [[News broadcasting|newscast]]s are broadcast live in the U.S. as they are an essential medium for providing up-to-the-minute weather forecasts and breaking news stories. Broadcast television networks in the United States typically air their evening newscasts live in the Eastern and Central time zones. A separate "Western Edition" is broadcast to viewers in the [[Pacific Time Zone]]. When a major breaking news event occurs, whether nationally or globally, broadcast television networks will break into regularly scheduled programming and will televise a live "[[special report]]" in all time zones. Local television stations break into regularly scheduled programming in the event of [[Severe weather|severe weather warnings]] or major local breaking news stories that occur within their viewing area.

Cable news outlets (such as [[CNN]] and [[Fox News Channel]]) air continuous live programming during the day, and air rebroadcasts of earlier live shows during the late night hours, except in cases where [[breaking news]] occurs.&lt;ref name="rebroadcasts"&gt;Shows such as [[Hannity]] on the Fox News Channel are pre-recorded the afternoon of its broadcast. However, this show occasionally airs live if breaking news or special events are being covered..&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' airs live on PBS stations in the Eastern Time Zone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/about/history/ "History - PBS NewsHour"], www.pbs.org. Retrieved 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunday morning news programs in the USA such as ''[[Meet The Press]]'' on NBC, ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on ABC, and ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' air live in the Eastern Time Zone (including a limited number of small markets in the Central Time Zone), while ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' and ''[[Face The Nation]]'' on CBS air live in the Eastern and Central time zones.

Cable outlets (such as CNN and Fox News Channel) incorporate the word ''LIVE'' in their network logo (also known as a [[digital on-screen graphic]]) when those networks broadcast live content.  Some (but not all) sports cable networks will opt to insert the word ''LIVE'' somewhere on the corner of the screen. With the exception of [[breaking news|special breaking news reports]] and overseas sporting events, broadcast television networks rarely display such a graphic during its live programming. (although NBC did display the word LIVE next to their logo during its Olympic coverage when live content was being broadcast, a practice that is being continued by its sister station: [[NBCSN]])&lt;ref name="Broadcast networks"&gt;In 2015, NBC began inserting the word ''LIVE'' above its on-air graphic during live telecasts of "Undateable" and "The Wiz", and in 2016, the Golden Globe Awards. However, they do not display the ''LIVE'' graphic during programs such as ''Saturday Night Live'' and the ''NBC Nightly News''. Broadcast networks such as CBS, ABC, PBS, and FOX typically do not display a LIVE graphic during any of their live telecasts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local television station newscasts display time and temperature during their broadcasts, and only display the word LIVE when they air a news report or a [[live shot]] on location. Some networks have begun to insert (in addition to the word LIVE) the local time of where that news report is originating from, particularly when that report is airing live via satellite from overseas.

Beginning in 2014, a trend began of harassing female journalists who are broadcasting live, including shouting profane phrases.&lt;ref name=kiss&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/08/10/do-you-know-the-man-who-kissed-this-tv-reporter-on-the-air.html|title=Teen who kissed CBC reporter live on-air apologizes|last=Pelley|first=Laura|work=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common phrase, "fuck her right in the pussy", comes from a viral video on [[YouTube]] in which a comedian staged a fake blooper reel that used the phrase.  Fans later started using it to interrupt live broadcasts and humiliate journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/14/mallick_sick_new_trend_of_trying_to_humiliate_female_tv_reporters.html|title=Mallick: sick new trend of trying to humiliate female TV reporters|last=Mallick|first=Heather|work=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=November 14, 2014|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, a female [[CityNews]] journalist confronted a group of young men who had used the phrase; one of them later lost his job after he was identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/448956/man-gets-fired-after-sexist-heckling-toronto-reporter-shauna-hunt|title=Man gets fired after sexist heckling of Toronto reporter Shauna Hunt|last=Nelson|first=Miranda|work=[[The Georgia Straight]]|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, a teen boy kissed a [[CBC News]] reporter during a live broadcast, prompting a discussion of what constitutes sexual assault.  The teen later apologized and called it a poorly-considered joke; the reporter declined to press charges.&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt;  In New Zealand, the boyfriend of a [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] reporter said she was groped after two young men shouted the phrase at her.  When her boyfriend confronted them, the men said the news show should have sent a male reporter.  One later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11583542|title=TV3 reporter Kim Vinnell was groped, claims boyfriend|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=February 3, 2016|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports and other events ===
As of the current decade, major [[sports television|sporting events]] like the [[Super Bowl]], [[World Cup]] and [[Olympic Games]] have been broadcast entirely live in all U.S. territories, encompassing both prime time hours of both U.S. coasts, simultaneous with the live global telecasts of these events in accordance with the official international broadcasters of such games.

Other events that air live all across U.S. territories include multi-network coverage of U.S. presidential and congressional elections, U.S. [[inauguration|presidential inaugurations]], the [[State of the Union|State of the Union Address]], [[News conference|presidential news conferences]], [[Oval Office Address|Presidential Addresses to the Nation]], the [[Rose Parade|Tournament of Roses Parade]], and funerals of major national or international public and religious figures. Local television stations air live local election coverage and special events, such as large scale [[parade]]s, [[Marathon|big city marathons]], funerals of major local public and religious figures, inauguration ceremonies of big city mayors and governors, installation masses of cardinals or bishops in a major Catholic archdiocese, and [[Pep rally|pep rallies]] for a major sports team. In the UK, events such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]] are broadcast live.

==Uses of live television==
Live television is often used as a device, even in scripted programming to take advantage of these often to great success in terms of attracting viewers. The [[NBC]] live comedy/variety program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', for example, has been on that network continuously since 1975 and airs live in the Eastern and Central zones (including the Pacific and Mountain zones beginning 2017) during the show's season which runs from October though May.

On September 25, 1997, NBC aired two separate live broadcasts (for viewers in both West and East Coasts) of an episode of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which at the time ranked as the most watched episode of any U.S. [[medical drama]] program ever. Many [[News broadcasting#Television news|television news]] programs, particularly [[local news]] ones in North America, have also used live television as a device to gain [[audience]] viewers by making their programs appear more exciting. With technologies such as [[production truck]]s, [[satellite truck]] uplinks, a [[Journalist|news reporter]] can report live "on location" from anywhere where a story is happening in the city. This technique has attracted criticism for its overuse (like minor car accidents which often have no injuries) and resulting tendency to make stories appear more urgent than they actually are.

The unedited nature of live television can pose problems for [[television network]]s because of the potential for mishaps. To enforce the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations, television networks often [[broadcast delay|broadcast live programs on a slight delay]] (usually on single-digit seconds only) to give them the ability to censor words and images while keeping the broadcast as "live" as possible.

==Notable events on live television==
Many events have happened on live television broadcasts that are well-remembered, sometimes because they were part of a major breaking news story already, and always because they happened unexpectedly and before audiences of thousands or millions of viewers.

==Live television episodes==
Although all programs were once live, the use of video tape means that very few television programs in the modern era have ever attempted such a feat. In the U.S., [[soap opera]]s including ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' were broadcast live until [[1975 in television|1975]].

On rare occasions, a scripted series will do an episode live to attract ratings. In the U.S. and Canada, the episode is occasionally performed twice: once for the east coast which is composed of the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central Time Zone]] and again three hours later for the west coast which is composed of the [[Mountain Time Zone]] and the [[Pacific Time Zone]] unless they have [[Dish Network]] or [[Direct TV]] who provides the live feed in all states. The most recent scripted series to air all live episodes was ''[[Undateable]]'' on NBC during its third season, which aired from October 2015 until January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Nededog, Jethro.

Since 2000, there have been a number of special films broadcast live. These include the remakes of [[Fail Safe (2000 TV)|''Fail Safe'']] (2000) and ''[[The Quatermass Experiment (2005)|The Quatermass Experiment]]'' (2005). Some recent examples of live episodic TV series include shows such as [[Melissa and Joey]] (2010), [[Whitney (TV series)|Whitney]] (2011) and [[Undateable]] (2014).

A live television advertisement was shown for the first time in 40 years to celebrate the arrival of the new Honda Accord in the United Kingdom. It was broadcast on Channel Four on 29 May 2008 at 20:10 during a special episode of 'Come Dine With Me'. The ad featured skydivers forming the letters of the word Honda over Spain.

==Live television specials==
Many live [[television special]]s were telecast during the pre-videotape era. Among the most successful were the 1955 and 1956 telecasts of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', a 1954 musical adaptation of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1904 play, starring [[Mary Martin]], and [[Cyril Ritchard]]. This was such a hit that the show was restaged and rebroadcast (this time on videotape) with the same two stars and most of the rest of the cast in 1960, and rerun several times after that. The ''Peter Pan'' telecasts marked the first-ever telecasts of a complete Broadway musical with most of its original cast.

On December 5, 2013, [[NBC]] broadcast a live television special called ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]'' starring [[Carrie Underwood]]. This program aired live in the Eastern and Central time zones, and was the first television musical special to air live on NBC in almost fifty years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">The '''Maintenance Equipment Integrated System of Telecontrol Robot''' (MEISTeR) is a service robot by the [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] (MHI). It was specifically designed to work at the devastated [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]].

It was presented to the public on December 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=MHIDec2012&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57557810-76/mitsubishi-unveils-two-armed-nuclear-plant-bot/ "Mitsubishi unveils two-armed nuclear plant bot"] ''CNET.com'',7 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and the destruction of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the industry went on a quest of providing robots able to do dangerous work at the power plant. One such solution was the [[HAL (robot)|HAL]] exoskeleton. However, the HAL exoskeleton required a human pilot. On November 23, 2012, Toshiba presented a Tetrapod which failed during the presentation.&lt;ref name=ToshibaDec2012&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57553524-1/toshiba-nuclear-robot-cant-make-it-through-demo/ "Toshiba nuclear robot can't make it through demo"] ''CNET.com'', 23 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, MHI had only create a household communication robot and the MARS-D robot. As a constructor of 20 nuclear plants in Japan, it was natural for the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to respond to the crisis with their own robot.&lt;ref name=MHIDec2012/&gt;

==Design==
The MEISTeR (German for master) is a twin-armed four-tracked robot. It is based on the Rabot robot and the experimental MARS-D robot, designed as a nuclear plant inspector. It stands {{convert|130|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}, is {{convert|70|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|125|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} long, and weights in at {{convert|440|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Its robotic arms have seven [[degrees of freedom]](=seven axes) just like a human arm and can lift {{convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}} each. Unlike the MARS-D robot MEISTeR is robust enough to withstand the radiation environment. The remote-controlled robot can attached with a variety of tools to its hands such as cutters and drills, clear obstacles, and pierce through concrete to check radiation levels. A special tool has been developed that can take samples from walls and concrete floors in contaminated areas with a depth up to {{convert|70|mm|in}}. It can move at up to {{convert|2|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and negotiates uneven terrain, including stairsteps up to {{convert|22|cm|in|abbr=on}} on its four independently moving tank tracks. It has an expected working time of two hours.&lt;ref name=MHIDec2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=izmagDec2012&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/mitsubishi-heavy-industries-mhi-meister-robot/25336/ "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries reveals nuclear plant inspection robot MHI-MEISTeR"] ''Gizmag.com'', 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanisation''' is the process of changing from working largely or exclusively by hand or with animals to doing that work with machinery.  In an early engineering text a machine is defined as follows:

{{quote|Every machine is constructed for the purpose of performing certain mechanical operations, each of which supposes the existence of two other things besides the machine in question, namely, a moving power, and an object subject to the operation, which may be termed the work to be done.
Machines, in fact, are interposed between the power and the work, for the purpose of adapting the one to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Mechanism: Designed For The Use Of Students In The Universities And For Engineering Students Generally |last=Willis |first= Robert |year=1861 |publisher =John W. Parker |location=London |isbn= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CCEKSqQaqcC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools.  In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies [[machine]]ry more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an ungeared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as [[gear]]s, [[pulley]]s or [[line shaft|sheaves]] and belts, [[drive shaft|shafts]], [[cam]]s and [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], usually are considered machines.  After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome (1934) gives the industry classification of machine tools as being "other than hand power". Beginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a factory, distinguishing it from a workshop.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Salisbury 02.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Salisbury cathedral clock]] ca. 1386.  A clock is a mechanical instrument rather than a true machine.  Although this clock had iron gears, many machines of the early Industrial Revolution used wooden parts until around 1800.]]

===Ancient times===
[[Water wheel]]s date to the Roman period and were used to grind grain and lift irrigation water. Water powered bellows were in use on [[blast furnaces]] in China in 31 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention  |last1=Temple |first1= Robert |authorlink= 
|author2=Joseph Needham |year=1986 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page=55 | postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, water wheels powered [[sawmill]]s&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[trip hammer]]s, to full cloth and pound flax and later cotton rags into pulp for making paper. Trip hammers are shown crushing ore in ''[[De re Metallica]]'' (1555).

[[Clock]]s were some of the most complex early mechanical devices.  Clock makers were important developers of [[machine tools]] including gear and screw cutting machines, and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs.  Clocks were some of the earliest mass-produced items, beginning around 1830.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson&amp;Musson"/&gt;

Water powered bellows for blast furnaces, used in China in ancient times, were in use in Europe by the 15th century. ''De re Metallica'' contains drawings related to bellows for blast furnaces including a fabrication drawing.

Improved gear designs decreased wear and increased efficiency.  Mathematical gear designs were developed in the mid 17th century.  French mathematician and engineer [[Girard Desargues|Desargues]] designed and constructed the first mill with [[Epicyclic gearing|epicycloidal teeth]] ca. 1650.  In the 18th century [[involute gear]]s, another mathematical derived design, came into use.  Involute gears are better for meshing gears of different sizes than epicycloidal.&lt;ref name="Robinson&amp;Musson"/&gt;  Gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

===Industrial revolution===
{{main|Industrial revolution}}

The [[Newcomen steam engine]] was first used, to pump water from a mine, in 1712. [[John Smeaton]] introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century.  Smeaton also conducted a scientific investigation into the design of water wheels which led to significant efficiency increases. The [[Industrial Revolution]] started mainly with textile machinery, such as the [[spinning jenny]] (1764) and [[water frame]] (1768).

Demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many [[machine tool]]s in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s.   After the early decades of the 19th century, iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Self-acting tools displaced hand dexterity and allowed one unskilled operator to tend several machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |last=Musson |author2=Robinson |year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press|location=|isbn= |page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machinery was developed to make nails ca. 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790-1865 |last=Thomson  |first= Ross |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher =The Johns Hopkins University Press|location= Baltimore, MD|isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourdrinier [[paper machine]] paper machine for [[continuous production]] of paper was patented in 1801, displacing the centuries-old hand method of making individual sheets of paper.

One of the first mechanical devices used in agriculture was the [[seed drill]] invented by [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] around 1700.  The seed drill allowed more uniform spacing of seed and planting depth than hand methods, increasing yields and saving valuable seed.  [[Mechanized agriculture]] greatly increased in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries with horse drawn [[reaper]]s and horse powered [[threshing machine]]s.&lt;ref name="Rumely1910"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rumely|1910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared.  Internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century.  Threshing and harvesting was originally done with attachments for tractors, but in the 1930s independently powered [[combine harvester]]s were in use.

In the mid to late 19th century, hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions, such as positioning tools or work pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730-1930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power |last=Hunter  |first= Louis C.|authorlink=|author2=Bryant, Lynwood |year=1991 |publisher =MIT Press |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts, London|isbn=0-262-08198-9 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pile drivers and steam hammers are examples for heavy work.  In food processing, pneumatic or hydraulic devices could start and stop filling of cans or bottles on a conveyor.  Power steering for automobiles uses hydraulic mechanisms, as does practically all earth moving equipment and other construction equipment and many attachments to tractors.  Pneumatic (usually compressed air) power is widely used to operate industrial valves.

===Twentieth century===
By the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;   An example is the glass bottle making machine developed 1905.  It replaced highly paid glass blowers and child labor helpers and led to the mass production of glass bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web | title = The American Society of Mechanical Engineers Designates the Owens "AR" Bottle Machine as  an International Historic Engineering Landmark | year = 1983 | url = http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5612.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130405015937/http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5612.pdf | archivedate = 2013-04-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1900 factories were [[electrification|electrified]], and electric motors and controls were used to perform more complicated mechanical operations. This resulted in mechanized processes to manufacture almost all goods.

===Categories===
[[Image:Involute wheel.gif|right|frame|Two [[involute gear]]s, the left driving the right: Blue arrows show the contact forces between them.  The force line (or [[gear#Line of Action|Line of Action]]) runs along a tangent common to both base circles. (In this situation, there is no force, and no contact needed, along the opposite common tangent not shown.)  The involutes here are traced out in converse fashion: points (of contact) move along the ''stationary'' force-vector "string" as if it was being unwound from the left ''rotating'' base circle, and wound onto the right ''rotating'' base circle.]]

In manufacturing, mechanization replaced hand methods of making goods. Prime movers are devices that convert thermal, potential or kinetic energy into mechanical work.  Prime movers include internal combustion engines, combustion turbines (jet engines), water wheels and turbines, windmills and wind turbines and steam engines and turbines. Powered transportation equipment such as locomotives, automobiles and trucks and airplanes, is a classification of machinery which includes sub classes by engine type, such as internal combustion, combustion turbine and steam. Inside factories, warehouses, lumber yards and other manufacturing and distribution operations, [[material handling]] equipment replaced manual carrying or hand trucks and carts.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

Mechanized agriculture
*See:[[Mechanized agriculture]]
*See also: [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)]] Section 4
*See also: [[list of agricultural machinery]]

In mining and excavation, power shovels replaced picks and shovels.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;  Rock and ore crushing had been done for centuries by water powered [[trip hammer]]s, but trip hammers have been replaced by modern ore [[crusher]]s and [[ball mill]]s.

[[Bulk material handling]] systems and equipment are used for a variety of materials including coal, ores, grains, sand, gravel and wood products.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

Construction equipment includes [[crane (machine)|cranes]], [[concrete mixer]]s, [[concrete pump]]s, [[cherry picker]]s and an assortment of power tools.

===Powered machinery===
Powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine.  Before the first decade of the 20th century powered usually meant by steam engine, water or wind.

Many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered, but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century.

Before [[electrification]], mill and factory power was usually transmitted using a [[line shaft]].  Electrification allowed individual machines to each be powered by a separate motor in what is called ''unit drive''.  Unit drive allowed factories to be better arranged and allowed different machines to run at different speeds.  Unit drive also allowed much higher speeds, which was especially important for [[machine tools]].

A step beyond mechanization is [[automation]].  Early production machinery, such as the glass bottle blowing machine (ca. 1890s), required a lot of operator involvement.  By the 1920s fully automatic machines, which required much less operator attention, were being used.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Jerome | first1=Harry| title=Mechanization in Industry, National Bureau of Economic Research | year=1934 | url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c5238.pdf |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military usage ===
{{main|Armoured warfare}}
The term is also used in the military to refer to the use of [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]], particularly [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, to move troops that would otherwise have marched or ridden trucks into combat. In military terminology, ''mechanized'' refers to ground units that can fight from vehicles, while ''motorized'' refers to units that go to battle in vehicles but then dismount and fight without them. Thus, a towed artillery unit is considered motorized while a self-propelled one is mechanized.

==Mechanical vs human labour==
When we compare the efficiency of a labourer, we see that he has an efficiency of about 1%-5.5% (depending on whether he uses arms, or a combination of arms and legs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internal combustion engines mostly have an efficiency of about 20%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/102spring2002_Web_projects/Z.Yates/Zach%27s%20Web%20Project%20Folder/EICE%20-%20Main.htm IC Engine 20% efficient]&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C|large diesel engines]], such as those used to power ships, may have efficiencies of nearly 50%. Industrial electric motors have efficiencies up to the low 90% range, before correcting for the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity of about 35%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-traction.eu/content_thewheel_advantages.php Electrical engines with combined power converter / motor at 86% efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

When we compare the costs of using an internal combustion engine to a worker to perform work, we notice that an engine can perform more work at a comparative cost. 1 liter of fossil fuel burnt with an IC engine equals about 50 hands of workers operating for 24 hours or 275 arms and legs for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manicore.com/anglais/documentation_a/slaves.html 1 liter of fuel yielding 100 arms for 24 hours, when efficiency is 40% which is never]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home documentary by Yann Arthus Bertrand too stating that 1 liter of fuel yields 100 arms for 24 hours; probably from same calculation&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the combined work capability of a human is also much lower than that of a machine. An average human worker can provide work good for around 0,9&amp;nbsp;hp (2.3 MJ per hour) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ozkan |first=Burhan |year=2004 |title=Energy input–output analysis in Turkish agriculture |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=29 |issue=1 |page=39 |doi=10.1016/s0960-1481(03)00135-6|url=http://www.econturk.org/Turkisheconomy/energyinput.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a machine (depending on the type and size) can provide for far greater amounts of work. For example, it takes more than one and a half hour of hard labour to deliver only one kWh - which a small engine could deliver in less than one hour while burning less than one litre of petroleum fuel.   This implies that a gang of 20 to 40 men will require a financial compensation for their work at least equal to the  required expended food calories (which is at least 4 to 20 times higher). In most situations, the worker will also want compensation for the lost time, which is easily 96 times greater per day.  Even if we assume the real wage cost for the human labour to be at US $1.00/day, an energy cost is generated of about $4.00/kWh. Despite this being a low wage for hard labour, even in some of the  countries with the lowest wages, it represents an energy cost that is significantly more expensive than even exotic power sources such as solar photovoltaic panels (and thus even more expensive when compared to wind energy harvesters or luminescent solar concentrators).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E08.htm Combined work capability of human vs machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Robert Eric Miller, an Australian engineer from Sydney, invented the fluid head for motion picture cameras for which he was granted an Australian patent in 1946 and US patent in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US 2459040 A - Tripod head|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2459040|website=Google Patent Search|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [http://www.millertripods.com Miller Camera Support Equipment] in 1954, manufacturing fluid heads and tripods. The same year, he developed the Miller Viscosity Drag. This invention greatly improved image quality in films by applying user-variable dampening to the pan and tilt movements of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinematographer.org.au/freestyler/gui/files/AC30_pt2_pp16-31.pdf ACS magazine, June 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915130026/http://www.cinematographer.org.au/freestyler/gui/files/AC30_pt2_pp16-31.pdf |date=15 September 2009 }} (p22).

The '''Ministry of Electric Power''' ({{lang-my|လျှပ်စစ်စွမ်းအားဝန်ကြီးဌာန}}; abbreviated '''MOEP''') administers Burma's electric power policies.

The Ministry is currently led by Win Khaing who is the minister for both [[Ministry of Electricity and Energy (Myanmar)|MOEE]] and [[Ministry of Construction (Myanmar)|MOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.president-office.gov.mm/?q=briefing-room/announcements/2016/05/25/id-10325|title=Change of Union Government|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myanmar Engineering Society]] has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to [[Yangon]] which is a significant underutilized resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=DuByne| first=David| title= Geothermal Energy in Myanmar Securing Electricity for Eastern Border Development  | journal=Myanmar Business Today Magazine |date=November 2015| url=http://www.oilseedcrops.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geothermal-Energy-in-Myanmar-Securing-Electricity-for-Eastern-Border-Development-David-DuByne.pdf|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing Geothermal projects in Myanmar use an estimated break even power cost of 5.3-8.6 U.S cents/kWh or in Myanmar Kyat 53-86K per kWh. This pegs a non-fluctuating 1$=1000K, which is a main concern for power project funding. The main drawback with depreciation pressures, in the current FX market.
Between June 2012 and October 2015, the Myanmar Kyat depreciated by approximately 35%, from 850 down to 1300 against the US Dollar. Local businesses with foreign denominated loans from abroad suddenly found themselves rushing for a strategy to mitigate currency risks. Myanmar’s current lack of available currency hedging solutions presents a real challenge for Geothermal project financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=DuByne| first=David| title= How Myanmar can Hedge Foreign Loans for Geothermal Projects to Mitigate Kyat Devaluation Risks  | journal=OilSeedCrops.org |date=November 2015| url= http://www.oilseedcrops.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How-Myanmar-can-Hedge-Foreign-Loans-for-Geothermal-Projects-to-Mitigate-Devaluation-Risks_David-DuByne-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 1 October 1951, Electricity Supply Board (ESB) was organized under the [[Ministry of Industry (Myanmar)|Ministry of Industry]]. On 16 March 1972, it was changed as Electric Power Corporation (EPC). On 1 April 1975, the Ministry of Industry was organized as No 1 and No 2, the EPC was composed under the Ministry of No 2 Industry. On 12 April 1985,the Ministry of No 2 Industry was changed as [[Ministry of Energy (Myanmar)|Ministry of Energy]], so the EPC was composed under it. On 1 April 1989, the EPC was changed into Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moep.gov.mm/history|title=History of Myanmar's Electricity|language=my|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 1997,the Ministry of Electrical Power was started organized and there were three departments under it, Department of Electrical Power, Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise and Department of Hydropower. On 15 May 2006, the ministry was divided into No 1 and No 2. On 5 September 2012, they were composed as one Ministry as Ministry of Electrical Power (MOEP).

In the new Myanmar cabinet of U [[Htin Kyaw]], the MOEP was composed with Ministry of Energy as [[Ministry of Electricity and Energy (Myanmar)|Ministry of Electricity and Energy]] (MOEE).

A '''nanowire''' is a nanostructure, with the diameter of the order of a nanometer (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meters). It can also be defined as the ratio of the length to width being greater than 1000. Alternatively, nanowires can be defined as structures that have a thickness or diameter constrained to tens of [[nanometer]]s or less and an unconstrained length. At these scales, quantum mechanical effects are important—which coined the term "[[quantum wire]]s". Many different types of nanowires exist, including superconducting (e.g. [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1251594 |pmid=24812400 |title=In Situ TEM Observation of a Microcrucible Mechanism of Nanowire Growth |journal=Science |volume=344 |issue=6184 |pages=623–6 |year=2014 |last1=Boston |first1=R. |last2=Schnepp |first2=Z. |last3=Nemoto |first3=Y. |last4=Sakka |first4=Y. |last5=Hall |first5=S.

[[Molecular nanowires]] are composed of repeating molecular units either organic (e.g. [[DNA]]) or inorganic (e.g. Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;).

Typical nanowires exhibit aspect ratios (length-to-width ratio) of 1000 or more. As such they are often referred to as one-dimensional (1-D) materials. Nanowires have many interesting properties that are not seen in bulk or 3-D (three-dimensional) materials. This is because [[electron]]s in nanowires are [[quantum]] confined laterally and thus occupy energy levels that are different from the traditional continuum of energy levels or bands found in bulk materials.

Peculiar features of this [[quantum confinement]] exhibited by certain nanowires manifest themselves in discrete values of the [[electrical conductance]]. Such discrete values arise from a quantum mechanical restraint on the number of electrons that can travel through the wire at the nanometer scale. These discrete values are often referred to as the quantum of conductance and are [[integer]] multiples of

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2e^2}{h} \simeq 77.41\; \mu S&lt;/math&gt;

They are inverse of the well-known resistance unit ''h/e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', which is roughly equal to 25812.8 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s, and referred to as the von Klitzing constant ''R''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; (after [[Klaus von Klitzing]], the discoverer of [[Quantum Hall Effect#Applications|exact quantization]]). Since 1990, a fixed conventional value ''R''&lt;sub&gt;K-90&lt;/sub&gt; is accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rk von Klitzing constant]. physics.nist.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of nanowires include inorganic molecular nanowires (Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which can have a diameter of 0.9&amp;nbsp;nm and be hundreds of micrometers long. Other important examples are based on semiconductors such as InP, Si, GaN, etc., dielectrics (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or metals (e.g. Ni, Pt).

There are many applications where nanowires may become important in electronic, opto-electronic and nanoelectromechanical devices, as additives in advanced composites, for metallic interconnects in nanoscale quantum devices, as field-emitters and as leads for biomolecular nanosensors.

==Synthesis==
[[Image:Epitaxial Nanowire Heterostructures SEM image.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] image of epitaxial nanowire heterostructures grown from catalytic gold nanoparticles.]]

There are two basic approaches to synthesizing nanowires: [[Silicon Nanowire#Top Down Synthesis Methods|top-down]] and [[Silicon Nanowire#Bottom-up Synthesis Methods|bottom-up]]. A top-down approach reduces a large piece of material to small pieces, by various means such as [[lithography]], [[Ball_mill|milling]] or [[thermal oxidation]]. A bottom-up approach synthesizes the nanowire by combining constituent [[adatom]]s. Most synthesis techniques use a bottom-up approach. Initial synthesis via either method may often be followed by a [[Silicon Nanowire#Thermal Oxidation of Silicon Nanowires|nanowire thermal treatment step]], often involving a form of self-limiting oxidation, to fine tune the size and aspect ratio of the structures.&lt;ref name="slo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Liu| first1=M.| last2= Peng |first2=J.| display-authors= etal |title=  Two-dimensional modeling of the self-limiting oxidation in silicon and tungsten nanowires | journal= Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters  | year= 2016 |  volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=195–199 | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306273009 | doi= 10.1016/j.taml.2016.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanowire production uses several common laboratory techniques, including suspension, electrochemical deposition, vapor deposition, and [[Vapor-liquid-solid method|VLS]] growth. [[Ion track technology (track replication)|Ion track technology]] enables growing homogeneous and segmented nanowires down to 8&amp;nbsp;nm diameter. As nanowire oxidation rate is controlled by diameter, [[thermal oxidation]] steps are often applied to tune their morphology.

===Suspension===
A suspended nanowire is a wire produced in a high-vacuum chamber held at the longitudinal extremities. Suspended nanowires can be produced by:
*The chemical etching of a larger wire
*The bombardment of a larger wire, typically with highly energetic ions
*Indenting the tip of a [[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] in the surface of a metal near its melting point, and then retracting it

===VLS growth===
A common technique for creating a nanowire is [[vapor-liquid-solid method]] (VLS), which was first reported by Wagner and Ellis in 1964 for silicon whiskers with diameters ranging from 100s of nm to 100s of µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner |first=R. S.|author2=Ellis, W. C. |year=1964|title=Vapor-liquid-solid mechanism of single crystal growth|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=4|issue=5|pages=89|doi=10.1063/1.1753975|bibcode=1964ApPhL...4...89W}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can produce high-quality crystalline nanowires of many semiconductor materials, for example,  VLS–grown single crystalline [[Silicon Nanowire|silicon nanowires (SiNWs)]] with smooth surfaces could have excellent properties, such as ultra-large elasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Zhang | first1= H. | display-authors=etal |title= Approaching the ideal elastic strain limit in silicon nanowires | journal=Science Advances | year=2016| volume=2 |issue=8| pages=e1501382 | url= http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1501382 | doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501382| pmid= 27540586 | pmc= 4988777 | bibcode=2016SciA....2E1382Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method uses a source material from either laser [[ablation|ablated]] particles or a feed gas such as [[silane]].

VLS synthesis requires a catalyst. For nanowires, the best catalysts are liquid metal (such as [[gold]]) [[nanocluster]]s, which can either be self-assembled from a thin film by [[dewetting]], or purchased in colloidal form and deposited on a substrate.

The source enters these nanoclusters and begins to saturate them. On reaching supersaturation, the source solidifies and grows outward from the nanocluster. Simply turning off the source can adjust the final length of the nanowire. Switching sources while still in the growth phase can create compound nanowires with super-lattices of alternating materials.

A single-step vapour phase reaction at elevated temperature synthesises inorganic nanowires such as Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.  From another point of view, such nanowires are cluster [[polymer]]s.

===Solution-phase synthesis===
Solution-phase synthesis refers to techniques that grow nanowires in solution. They can produce nanowires of many types of materials. Solution-phase synthesis has the advantage that it can produce very large quantities, compared to other methods. In one technique, the [[polyol]] synthesis, ethylene glycol is both solvent and reducing agent. This technique is particularly versatile at producing nanowires of gold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Xi|last2=Wu|first2=Jianbo|last3=Li|first3=Panpan|last4=Shi|first4=Miao|last5=Yang|first5=Hong|title=Self-Heating Approach to the Fast Production of Uniform Metal Nanostructures|journal=ChemNanoMat|date=January 2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1002/cnma.201500123}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead, platinum, and silver.

The supercritical fluid-liquid-solid growth method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10688792|year=2000|author1=Holmes|first1=J.

By using metal nanocrystals as seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200390101|title=Supercritical Fluid–Liquid–Solid (SFLS) Synthesis of Si and Ge Nanowires Seeded by Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=15|issue=5|pages=437–440|year=2003|last1=Hanrath|first1=T.|last2=Korgel|first2=B.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Si and Ge organometallic precursors are fed into a reactor filled with a supercritical organic solvent, such as toluene. Thermolysis results in degradation of the precursor, allowing release of Si or Ge, and dissolution into the metal nanocrystals.  As more of the semiconductor solute is added from the supercritical phase (due to a concentration gradient), a solid crystallite precipitates, and a nanowire grows uniaxially from the nanocrystal seed.

===Non-catalytic growth===
Nanowires can be also grown without the help of catalysts, which gives an advantage of pure nanowires and minimizes the number of technological steps. The simplest methods to obtain metal oxide nanowires use ordinary heating of the metals, e.g. metal wire heated with battery, by [[Joule heating]] in air&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rackauskas | first1 = S. | last2 = Nasibulin | first2 = A.

The vast majority of nanowire-formation mechanisms are explained through the use of catalytic nanoparticles, which drive the nanowire growth and are either added intentionally or generated during the growth.  However the mechanisms for catalyst-free growth of nanowires (or whiskers) were known from 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sears | first1 = G.W. | year = 1955 | title = A Growth Mechanism for Mercury Whiskers | doi = 10.1016/0001-6160(55)90041-9 | journal = Acta Metall | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 361–366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous nanowire formation by non-catalytic methods were explained by the [[dislocations|dislocation]] present in specific directions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = F.

===DNA-templated metallic nanowire synthesis===
An emerging field is to use DNA strands as scaffolds for metallic nanowire synthesis. This method is investigated both for the synthesis of metallic nanowires in electronic components and for biosensing applications, in which they allow the transduction of a DNA strand into a metallic nanowire that can be electrically detected. Typically, ssDNA strands are stretched, whereafter they are decorated with metallic nanoparticles that have been functionalised with short complementary ssDNA strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guo et al. | title = Efficient DNA-assisted synthesis of trans-membrane gold nanowires | doi=10.1038/micronano.2017.84 | journal = Microsystems and Nanoengineering| volume = 4 | pages = 17084 | year = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Langmuir | volume = 32 | issue = 40 | pages = 10159–10165 | title = Temperature-Dependent Charge Transport through Individually Contacted DNA Origami-Based Au Nanowires | doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01961| pmid = 27626925 | year = 2016 | last1 = Teschome | first1 = Bezu | last2 = Facsko | first2 = Stefan | last3 = Schönherr | first3 = Tommy | last4 = Kerbusch | first4 = Jochen | last5 = Keller | first5 = Adrian | last6 = Erbe | first6 = Artur }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 86 | issue = 16 | pages = 3670-3 | title = Metallic Conduction through Engineered DNA: DNA Nanoelectronic Building Blocks | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3670| pmid = 11328050 | bibcode=2001PhRvL..86.3670R| last1 = Rakitin | first1 = A | last2 = Aich | first2 = P | last3 = Papadopoulos | first3 = C | last4 = Kobzar | first4 = Yu | last5 = Vedeneev | first5 = A.

===Conductivity of nanowires===
[[Image:Wire15micron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|An [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] image of a 15 micrometer nickel wire.]]

Several physical reasons predict that the conductivity of a nanowire will be much less than that of the corresponding bulk material. First, there is scattering from the wire boundaries, whose effect will be very significant whenever the wire width is below the free electron mean free path of the bulk material. In copper, for example, the mean free path is 40&amp;nbsp;nm. Copper nanowires less than 40&amp;nbsp;nm wide will shorten the mean free path to the wire width.

Nanowires also show other peculiar electrical properties due to their size. Unlike single wall carbon nanotubes, whose motion of electrons can fall under the regime of [[ballistic transport]] (meaning the electrons can travel freely from one electrode to the other), nanowire conductivity is strongly influenced by edge effects. The edge effects come from atoms that lay at the nanowire surface and are not fully bonded to neighboring atoms like the atoms within the bulk of the nanowire. The unbonded atoms are often a source of defects within the nanowire, and may cause the nanowire to conduct electricity more poorly than the bulk material. As a nanowire shrinks in size, the surface atoms become more numerous compared to the atoms within the nanowire, and edge effects become more important.

Furthermore, the conductivity can undergo a quantization in energy: i.e. the energy of the electrons going through a nanowire can assume only discrete values, which are multiples of the [[conductance quantum]] ''G = 2e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h'' (where ''e'' is the [[charge of the electron]] and ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. See also the [[Quantum Hall effect]]).

The conductivity is hence described as the sum of the transport by separate ''channels'' of different quantized energy levels. The thinner the wire is, the smaller the number of channels available to the transport of electrons.

This quantization has been demonstrated by measuring the conductivity of a nanowire suspended between two electrodes while pulling it: as its diameter reduces, its conductivity decreases in a stepwise fashion and the plateaus correspond to multiples of G.

The quantization of conductivity is more pronounced in semiconductors like Si or GaAs than in metals, due to their lower electron density and lower effective mass. It can be observed in 25&amp;nbsp;nm wide silicon fins, and results in increased [[threshold voltage]].  In practical terms, this means that a [[MOSFET]] with such nanoscale silicon fins, when used in digital applications, will need a higher gate (control) voltage to switch the transistor on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.075311 |journal=Physical Review B|volume=68|issue=7|page=075311|year=2003|title=Quantum interference in a one-dimensional silicon nanowire|last1=Tilke|first1=A.

===Welding nanowires===
To incorporate nanowire technology into industrial applications, researchers in 2008 developed a method of welding nanowires together: a [[sacrificial metal]] nanowire is placed adjacent to the ends of the pieces to be joined (using the manipulators of a [[scanning electron microscope]]); then an electric current is applied, which fuses the wire ends. The technique fuses wires as small as 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Halford, Bethany |title=Wee Welding with Nanosolder|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|volume=86|issue=51 |year=2008|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For nanowires with diameters less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm, existing welding techniques, which require precise control of the heating mechanism and which may introduce the possibility of damage, will not be practical. Recently scientists discovered that single-crystalline ultrathin gold nanowires with diameters ~3–10&amp;nbsp;nm can be "cold-welded" together within seconds by mechanical contact alone, and under remarkably low applied pressures (unlike macro- and micro-scale [[cold welding]] process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.4|pmid=20154688|title=Cold welding of ultrathin gold nanowires|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=218–24|year=2010|last1=Lu|first1=Yang|last2=Huang|first2=Jian Yu|last3=Wang|first3=Chao|last4=Sun|first4=Shouheng|last5=Lou|first5=Jun|bibcode=2010NatNa...5..218L}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-resolution [[transmission electron microscopy]] and [[in situ]] measurements reveal that the welds are nearly perfect, with the same crystal orientation, strength and electrical conductivity as the rest of the nanowire. The high quality of the welds is attributed to the nanoscale sample dimensions, oriented-attachment mechanisms and mechanically assisted fast [[surface diffusion]]. Nanowire welds were also demonstrated between gold and silver, and silver nanowires (with diameters ~5–15&amp;nbsp;nm) at near room temperature, indicating that this technique may be generally applicable for ultrathin metallic nanowires. Combined with other nano- and microfabrication technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1090899 |pmid=14631034 |title=Nanowire Crossbar Arrays as Address Decoders for Integrated Nanosystems |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5649 |pages=1377–9 |year=2003 |last1=Zhong |first1=Z. |last2=Wang |first2=D |last3=Cui |first3=Y |last4=Bockrath |first4=M.

=== Mechanical properties of nanowires ===

==== Investigation of mechanical properties of nanowires ====
[[File:Stress Strain Ductile Material.pdf|thumb|upright=1.2|Stress-strain curve provides all the relevant mechanical properties including; tensile modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture strength]]
The study of nanowire mechanics has boomed since the advent of the [[Atomic force microscopy|Atomic Force Microscope]] (AFM), and associated technologies which have enabled direct study of the response of the nanowire to an applied load.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Shiliang|last2=Shan|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Huang|first3=Han|date=2017-01-03|title=The Mechanical Properties of Nanowires|journal=Advanced Science|volume=4|issue=4|pages=1600332|doi=10.1002/advs.201600332 |pmc=5396167|pmid=28435775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a nanowire can be clamped from one end, and the free end displaced by an AFM tip. In this cantilever geometry, the height of the AFM is precisely known, and the force applied is precisely known. This allows for construction of a force vs. displacement curve, which can be converted to a [[Stress–strain curve|stress vs. strain]] curve if the nanowire dimensions are known. From the stress-strain curve, the elastic constant known as the [[Young's modulus|Young’s Modulus]] can be derived, as well as the [[toughness]], and degree of [[strain-hardening]]. Moreover, if this process occurs while simultaneously viewing the nanowire in a [[scanning electron microscope]], the resulting mechanical properties can be directly correlated with the nanowire’s [[microstructure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Young's modulus of nanowires ====
The elastic component of the stress-strain curve described by the Young’s Modulus, has been reported for nanowires, however the modulus depends very strongly on the microstructure. Thus a complete description of the modulus dependence on diameter is lacking. Analytically, [[continuum mechanics]] has been applied to estimate the dependence of modulus on diameter: &lt;math&gt;E=E_{0}[1+4(E_{0}/E_{s}-1)(r_{s}/D-r_{s}^{2}/D^{2})]&lt;/math&gt; in tension, where &lt;math&gt;E_{0}
&lt;/math&gt; is the bulk modulus, &lt;math&gt;r_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of a shell layer in which the modulus is surface dependent and varies from the bulk, &lt;math&gt;E{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface modulus, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This equation implies that the modulus increases as the diameter decreases. However, various computational methods such as molecular dynamics have predicted that modulus should decrease as diameter decreases. 

Experimentally, gold nanowires have been shown to have a Young’s modulus which is effectively diameter independent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Bin|last2=Heidelberg|first2=Andreas|last3=Boland|first3=John J.|date=2005-06-05|title=Mechanical properties of ultrahigh-strength gold nanowires|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat1403|journal=Nature Materials|volume=4|issue=7|pages=525–529|doi=10.1038/nmat1403|pmid=15937490|issn=1476-1122|bibcode=2005NatMa...4..525W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Nanoindentation|nano-indentation]] was applied to study the modulus of silver nanowires, and again the modulus was found to be 88 GPa, very similar to the modulus of bulk Silver (85 GPa)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xiaodong|last2=Gao|first2=Hongsheng|last3=Murphy|first3=Catherine J.|last4=Caswell|first4=K. K.|date=Nov 2003|title=Nanoindentation of Silver Nanowires|journal=Nano Letters|volume=3|issue=11|pages=1495–1498|doi=10.1021/nl034525b|issn=1530-6984|bibcode=2003NanoL...3.1495L}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works demonstrated that the analytically determined modulus dependence seems to be suppressed in nanowire samples where the crystalline structure highly resembles that of the bulk system.

In contrast, Si solid nanowires have been studied, and shown to have a decreasing modulus with diameter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Zhong Lin|last2=Dai|first2=Zu Rong|last3=Gao|first3=Ruiping|last4=Gole|first4=James L.|date=2002-03-27|title=Measuring the Young's modulus of solid nanowires byin situTEM|url=https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article/51/suppl_1/S79/885374|journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy|volume=51|issue=suppl 1|pages=S79–S85|doi=10.1093/jmicro/51.Supplement.S79|issn=0022-0744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of that work report a Si modulus which is half that of the bulk value, and they suggest that the density of point defects, and or loss of chemical stoichiometry may account for this difference.

==== Yield strength of nanowires ====
The plastic component of the stress strain curve (or more accurately the onset of plasticity) is described by the [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]]. The strength of a material is increased by decreasing the number of defects in the solid, which occurs naturally in [[nanomaterials]] where the volume of the solid is reduced. As a nanowire is shrunk to a single line of atoms, the strength should theoretically increase all the way to the molecular tensile strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gold nanowires have been described as ‘ultrahigh strength’ due to the extreme increase in yield strength, approaching the theoretical value of E/10.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This huge increase in yield is determined to be due to the lack of [[Dislocation|dislocations]] in the solid. Without dislocation motion, a ‘dislocation-starvation’ mechanism is in operation. The material can accordingly experience huge stresses before dislocation motion is possible, and then begins to strain-harden. For these reasons, nanowires (historically described as 'whiskers') have been used extensively in composites for increasing the overall strength of a material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, nanowires continue to be actively studied, with research aiming to translate enhanced mechanical properties to novel devices in the fields of [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] or [[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]].

==Applications==

===Electronic devices===

[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|right|500px|Atomistic simulation result for formation of inversion channel (electron density) and attainment of threshold voltage (IV) in a nanowire MOSFET. Note that the threshold voltage for this device lies around 0.45V.]]

Nanowires can be used for transistors. [[Transistors]] are used widely as fundamental building element in today's electronic circuits. As predicted by [[Moore's law]], the dimension of transistors is shrinking smaller and smaller into nanoscale. One of the key challenges of building future nanoscale [[transistors]] is ensuring good gate control over the channel. Due to the high aspect ratio, if the gate dielectric is wrapped around the nanowire channel, we can get good control of channel electrostatic potential, thereby turning the transistor on and off efficiently.

Due to the unique one-dimensional structure with remarkable optical properties, the nanowire also opens new opportunities for realizing high efficiency photovoltaic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Peng|last2=Wu|first2=Jiang|last3=Liu|first3=Shenting|last4=Xiong|first4=Jie|last5=Jagadish|first5=Chennupati|last6=Wang|first6=Zhiming M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Design and fabrication of silicon nanowires towards efficient solar cells|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748013216302110|journal=Nano Today|volume=11|issue=6|pages=704–737|doi=10.1016/j.nantod.2016.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with its bulk counterparts, the nanowire solar cells are less sensitive to impurities due to bulk recombination, and thus silicon wafers with lower purity can be used to achieve acceptable efficiency, leading to the a reduction on material consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kayes|first=Brendan M.|last2=Atwater|first2=Harry A.|last3=Lewis|first3=Nathan S.|date=2005-05-23|title=Comparison of the device physics principles of planar and radial p-n junction nanorod solar cells|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=97|issue=11|pages=114302-114302-11|doi=10.1063/1.1901835|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=2005JAP....97k4302K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create active electronic elements, the first key step was to chemically dope a semiconductor nanowire. This has already been done to individual nanowires to create p-type and n-type semiconductors.

The next step was to find a way to create a [[p–n junction]], one of the simplest electronic devices. This was achieved in two ways. The first way was to physically cross a p-type wire over an n-type wire. The second method involved chemically doping a single wire with different dopants along the length. This method created a p-n junction with only one wire.

After p-n junctions were built with nanowires, the next logical step was to build [[logic gates]]. By connecting several p-n junctions together, researchers have been able to create the basis of all logic circuits: the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate|NOT]] gates have all been built from semiconductor nanowire crossings.

In August 2012, researchers reported constructing the first [[NAND gate]] from undoped silicon nanowires. This avoids the problem of how to achieve precision doping of complementary nanocircuits, which is unsolved. They were able to control the [[Schottky barrier]] to achieve low-resistance contacts by placing a [[silicide]] layer in the metal-silicon interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/nl300930m|pmid=22594644|arxiv=1208.1465|title=Multifunctional Devices and Logic Gates with Undoped Silicon Nanowires|journal=Nano Letters|volume=12|issue=6|pages=3074–9|year=2012|last1=Mongillo|first1=Massimo|last2=Spathis|first2=Panayotis|last3=Katsaros|first3=Georgios|last4=Gentile|first4=Pascal|last5=De Franceschi|first5=Silvano|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.3074M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that semiconductor nanowire crossings will be important to the future of digital computing. Though there are other uses for nanowires beyond these, the only ones that actually take advantage of physics in the nanometer regime are electronic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Toward nanowire electronics|journal= IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|volume= 55|issue= 11|pages= 2827–2845|url= https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1169&amp;context=nanodocs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Dzh-CN%26q%3Dnanowire%2Belectronics%26btnG%3D%26lr%3D#search=%22nanowire%20electronics%22|doi=10.1109/TED.2008.2008011|year= 2008|last1= Appenzeller|first1= Joerg|last2= Knoch|first2= Joachim|last3= Bjork|first3= Mikael T.|last4= Riel|first4= Heike|author4-link=Heike Riel|last5= Schmid|first5= Heinz|last6= Riess|first6= Walter|bibcode= 2008ITED...55.2827A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, nanowires are also being studied for use as photon ballistic waveguides as interconnects in [[quantum dot]]/quantum effect well photon logic arrays. Photons travel inside the tube, electrons travel on the outside shell.

When two nanowires acting as photon waveguides cross each other the juncture acts as a [[quantum dot]].

Conducting nanowires offer the possibility of connecting molecular-scale entities in a molecular computer. Dispersions of conducting nanowires in different polymers are being investigated for use as transparent electrodes for flexible flat-screen displays.

Because of their high [[Young's moduli]], their use in mechanically enhancing composites is being investigated. Because nanowires appear in bundles, they may be used as tribological additives to improve friction characteristics and reliability of electronic transducers and actuators.

Because of their high aspect ratio, nanowires are also uniquely suited to [[Dielectrophoresis|dielectrophoretic]] manipulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Wissner-Gross, A.

===Nanowire lasers===
[[File:Nanowire laser.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Nanowire lasers for ultrafast transmission of information in light pulses]]
[[Nanowire lasers]] are nano-scaled [[lasers]] with potential as optical interconnects and optical data communication on chip. Nanowire lasers are built from III–V semiconductor heterostructures, the high refractive index allows for low optical loss in the nanowire core. Nanowire lasers are subwavelength lasers of only a few hundred nanometers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/semiconductor-nanowire-lasers Koblmüller, Gregor, et al.

"Long-term mutual phase locking of picosecond pulse pairs generated by a semiconductor nanowire laser." Nature Communications 8 (2017): 15521.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensing of proteins and chemicals using semiconductor nanowires===
In an analogous way to FET devices in which the modulation of conductance (flow of electrons/holes) in the semiconductor, between the input (source) and the output (drain) terminals, is controlled by electrostatic potential variation (gate-electrode) of the charge carriers in the device conduction channel, the methodology of a Bio/Chem-FET is based on the detection of the local change in charge density, or so-called “field effect”, that characterizes the recognition event between a target molecule and the surface receptor.

This change in the surface potential influences the Chem-FET device exactly as a ‘gate’ voltage does, leading to a detectable and measurable change in the device conduction. When these devices are fabricated using semiconductor nanowires as the transistor element the binding of a chemical or biological species to the surface of the sensor can lead to the depletion or accumulation of charge carriers in the "bulk" of the nanometer diameter nanowire i.e. (small cross section available for conduction channels). Moreover, the wire, which serves as a tunable conducting channel, is in close contact with the sensing environment of the target, leading to a short response time, along with orders of magnitude increase in the sensitivity of the device as a result of the huge S/V ratio of the nanowires.

While several inorganic semiconducting materials such as Si, Ge, and metal oxides (e.g. In2O3, SnO2, ZnO, etc.) have been used for the preparation of nanowires, Si is usually the material of choice when fabricating nanowire FET-based chemo/biosensors.

Several examples of the use of [[Silicon Nanowire|silicon nanowire]](SiNW) sensing devices include the ultra sensitive, real-time sensing of biomarker proteins for cancer, detection of single virus particles, and the detection of nitro-aromatic explosive materials such as 2,4,6 Tri-nitrotoluene (TNT) in sensitives superior to these of canines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engel |first1=Yoni |last2=Elnathan |first2=Roey |last3=Pevzner |first3=Alexander |last4=Davidi |first4=Guy |last5=Flaxer |first5=Eli |last6=Patolsky |first6=Fernando |title=Supersensitive Detection of Explosives by Silicon Nanowire Arrays |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2010 |volume=49 |issue=38 |pages=6830–6835 |doi=10.1002/anie.201000847 |pmid=20715224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Silicon nanowires could also be used in their twisted form, as electromechanical devices, to measure intermolecular forces with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=J. C.|last2=Justo|first2=J. F.|title=Twisted ultrathin silicon nanowires: A possible torsion electromechanical nanodevice|journal=Europhys.

==== Limitations of sensing with [[silicon nanowire]] FET devices ====
Generally, the charges on dissolved molecules and macromolecules are screened by dissolved counterions, since in most cases molecules bound to the devices are separated from the sensor surface by approximately 2–12&amp;nbsp;nm (the size of the receptor proteins or DNA linkers bound to the sensor surface). As a result of the screening, the electrostatic potential that arises from charges on the analyte molecule decays exponentially toward zero with distance. Thus, for optimal sensing, the [[Debye length]] must be carefully selected for nanowire FET measurements.
One approach of overcoming this limitation employs fragmentation of the antibody-capturing units and control over surface receptor density, allowing more intimate binding to the nanowire of the target protein. This approach proved useful for dramatically enhancing the sensitivity of [[Cardiac marker|cardiac biomarkers]] (e.g. [[Troponin]]) detection directly from serum for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elnathan|first=Roey |author2=Kwiat, M. |author3=Pevzner, A. |author4=Engel, Y. |author5=Burstein, L. |author6=Khatchtourints, A. |author7=Lichtenstein, A. |author8=Kantaev, R. |author9=Patolsky, F.|title=Biorecognition Layer Engineering: Overcoming Screening Limitations of Nanowire-Based FET Devices|journal=Nano Letters|date=10 September 2012|volume=12|issue=10|pages=5245–5254|doi=10.1021/nl302434w|pmid=22963381|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.5245E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanowood''' is heat-insulating material made from wood that is considered a slightly better insulator than [[Styrofoam]]. Unlike Styrofoam, the material is more environmentally friendly and [[biodegradable]]. It is considered light, strong and created entirely from stripped-down wood fibers.&lt;ref name="phys_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' an invention that could reduce humanity's carbon footprint| author = Khan, Amina| work = phys.org| date = 2018-03-12| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://phys.org/news/2018-03-nanowood-humanity-carbon-footprint.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The material was invented by engineer, Liangbing Hu and his team at [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. The material "when exposed to the solar spectrum" reflected approximately 95% of radiation energy absorbing only approximately 2%. Silica aerogel "absorbed approximately 20% and transmits approximately 60% of the radiative heat" according to study authors.&lt;ref name="lati_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' a new invention that could greatly reduce humanity's carbon footprint| last = Khan | first = Amina| work = latimes.com| date = 10 March 2018| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-nanowood-20180309-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanowood could potentially save "billions in energy costs" according to Tian Li, a team member.&lt;ref name="smit_Coul"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Could 'Nanowood' Replace Styrofoam?| last = Matchar | first = Emily| work = Smithsonian| date = 2018-03-26| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/could-nanowood-replace-styrofoam-180968575/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28135">A '''nonthermal plasma''', '''cold plasma''' or '''non-equilibrium plasma''' is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which is not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], because the electron temperature is much hotter than the temperature of heavy species (ions and neutrals). As only electrons are thermalized, their [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution]] is very different than the ion velocity distribution.&lt;ref&gt;von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) "Flame Plasma" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L. Marton (ed.), Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-0-12-014520-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 p. 99] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202013244/https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&amp;lpg=PA99 |date=2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the velocities of a species does not follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the plasma is said to be non-Maxwellian.

A kind of common nonthermal plasma is the [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury-vapor gas]] within a [[fluorescent lamp]], where the "electron gas" reaches a temperature of {{convert|20,000|K|C F|lk=on}} while the rest of the gas, ions and neutral atoms, stays barely above room temperature, so the [[Electric light|bulb]] can even be touched with hands while operating.

== Applications ==

===Food industry===
In the context of [[food processing]], a nonthermal plasma ('''NTP''') or '''cold plasma''' is specifically an [[antimicrobial]] treatment being investigated for application to fruits, vegetables and other foods with fragile surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?ACCN_NO=409114 |title=Decontamination of Fresh Production with Cold Plasma |accessdate=2006-07-28 |website=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Misra|first=N.N.|title=Nonthermal Plasma Inactivation of Food-Borne Pathogens|url=http://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1097&amp;context=schfsehart|publisher=Springer|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954222385|title=Cold plasma in food and agriculture : fundamentals and applications|others=Misra, N N, Schlüter, Oliver,, Cullen, P.

The term ''cold plasma'' has been recently used as a convenient descriptor to distinguish the one-[[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], near [[room temperature]] plasma discharges from other plasmas, operating at hundreds or thousands of degrees above ambient (see {{format link|Plasma (physics)#Temperatures}}). Within the context of food processing the term "cold" can potentially engender misleading images of refrigeration requirements as a part of the plasma treatment. However, in practice this confusion has not been an issue. "Cold plasmas" may also loosely refer to [[Plasma (physics)#Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases|weakly ionized gases]] ([[degree of ionization]] &lt; 0.01%).

==== Nomenclature ====
The nomenclature for nonthermal plasma found in the scientific literature is varied. In some cases, the plasma is referred to by the specific technology used to generate it ("gliding arc", "[[plasma pencil]]", "plasma needle", "plasma jet", "[[dielectric barrier discharge]]", "[[Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma]]", etc.), while other names are more generally descriptive, based on the characteristics of the plasma generated ("one atmosphere uniform [[glow discharge]] plasma", "atmospheric plasma", "ambient pressure nonthermal discharges", "non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas", etc.). The two features which distinguish NTP from other mature, industrially applied plasma technologies, is that they are 1) nonthermal and 2) operate at or near atmospheric pressure.

|Approx. 1 – 5&amp;nbsp;cm; arcing can occur at higher power settings, can contact target
|Approx. ≤ 1&amp;nbsp;cm; arcing can occur between electrodes and target at higher power settings

|-
|Electrical conduction through target
|No
|Not under normal operation, but possible during arcing
|Yes, if target is used as an electrode OR if target between mounted electrodes is electrically conductive

|-
|Suitability for irregular surfaces
|High - remote nature of NTP generation means maximum flexibility of application of NTP afterglow stream
|Moderately high - NTP is conveyed to target in a directional manner, requiring either rotation of target or multiple NTP emitters

Magnetohydrodynamic power generation, a [[direct energy conversion]] method from a hot gas in motion within a magnetic field was developed in the 1960s and 1970s with pulsed [[Magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD generator]]s known as [[shock tube]]s, using non-equilibrium plasmas seeded with [[alkali metal]] vapors  (like [[caesium]], to increase the limited [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] of gases) heated at a limited temperature of 2000 to 4000 [[kelvin]]s (to protect walls from thermal erosion) but where electrons were heated at more than 10,000 kelvins.&lt;ref name="Kerrebrock 1964a"&gt;{{cite journal

Studies conducted in [[wind tunnel]]s involve most of the time low [[atmospheric pressure]] similar to an [[altitude]] of 20–50 km, typical of [[hypersonic flight]], where the electrical conductivity of air is higher, hence non-thermal weakly ionized plasmas can be easily produced with a fewer energy expense.

===Catalysis===

Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma can be used to promote chemical reactions. Collisions between hot temperature electrons and cold gas molecules can lead to dissociation reactions and the subsequent formation of radicals. This kind of discharge exhibits reacting properties that are usually seen in high temperature discharge systems.&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitehead |first1=J Christopher |title=Plasma–catalysis: the known knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns |journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics |date=22 June 2016 |volume=49 |issue=24 |pages=243001 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/49/24/243001|bibcode=2016JPhD...49x3001W |url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/plasmacatalysis(04b2ec5b-0229-4ba9-8b12-ac07c038905c).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-thermal plasma is also used in conjunction with a catalyst to further enchance the chemical conversion of reactants or to alter the products chemical composition.

====Configurations====

The coupling between the two different mechanisms can be done in two different ways:

* Two-stage configuration, also called Post-Plasma Catalysis (PPC)
* One-stage configuration, also called In-plasma catalysis (IPC) or Plasma Enhanced Catalysis (PEC)

In the first case the catalytic reactor is placed after the plasma chamber. This means that only the long-lived species can reach the catalyst surface and react, while short-lived radicals, ions and excited species decay in the first part of the reactor. As an example, the oxygen ground state atom O(3P) has a lifetime of about 14 μs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holzer |first1=F |title=Combination of non-thermal plasma and heterogeneous catalysis for oxidation of volatile organic compounds Part 1.

This means that only a small region of the catalyst is in contact with active radicals. In a such two-stage set-up, the main role of the plasma is to alter the gas composition fed to the catalytic reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neyts |first1=E C |last2=Bogaerts |first2=A |title=Understanding plasma catalysis through modelling and simulation—a review |journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics |date=4 June 2014 |volume=47 |issue=22 |pages=224010 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/47/22/224010|bibcode=2014JPhD...47v4010N }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a PEC system, synergistic effects are greater since short-lived excited species are formed near the catalyst surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harling |first1=Alice M. |last2=Glover |first2=David J. |last3=Whitehead |first3=J.

It can be placed inside the reactor in different ways:

* in powder form ([[Packed bed]])
* deposited on foams
* deposited on structured material (honeycomb)
* coating of the reactor walls

Packed bed plasma-catalytic reactor are commonly used for fundamental studies&lt;ref name="Whitehead" /&gt; and a scale-up to industrial applications is difficult since the pressure drop increase with the flow rate.

====Plasma-Catalysis Interactions====

In a PEC system, the way the catalyst is positioned in relation to the plasma can affect the process in different ways. The catalyst can positively influence the plasma and vice versa resulting in an output that cannot be obtained using each process individually. The synergy that is established is ascribed to different cross effects

* Plasma effects on catalyst:
** '''Change in the physiochemical properties'''. Plasma change the adsorption/desorption equilibrium on the catalyst surface leading to higher adsorption capabilities. An interpretation to this phenomenon is not yet clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blin-Simiand |first1=Nicole |last2=Tardiveau |first2=Pierre |last3=Risacher |first3=Aurore |last4=Jorand |first4=François |last5=Pasquiers |first5=Stéphane |title=Removal of 2-Heptanone by Dielectric Barrier Discharges – The Effect of a Catalyst Support |journal=Plasma Processes and Polymers |date=31 March 2005 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=256–262 |doi=10.1002/ppap.200400088}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Higher catalyst surface area'''. A catalyst exposed to a discharge can give rise to the formation of nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hong |first1=Jingping |last2=Chu |first2=Wei |last3=Chernavskii |first3=Petr A. |last4=Khodakov |first4=Andrei Y. |title=Cobalt species and cobalt-support interaction in glow discharge plasma-assisted Fischer–Tropsch catalysts |journal=Journal of Catalysis |date=7 July 2010 |volume=273 |issue=1 |pages=9–17 |doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2010.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher surface/volume ratio leads to better catalyst performances.
** '''Higher adsorption probability'''.
** '''Change in the catalyst oxidation state'''. Some metallic catalyst (e.g. Ni, Fe) are more active in their metallic form. The presence of a plasma discharge can induce a reduction of the catalyst metal oxides, improving the catalytic activity.
** '''Reduced coke formation'''. When dealing with hydrocarbons, coke formation leads to a progressive deactivation of the catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Beuther |first1=H. |last2=Larson |first2=O.A. |last3=Perrotta |first3=A.J. |title=The Mechanism of Coke Formation on Catalysts |journal=Catalyst Deactivation |volume=6 |date=1980 |pages=271–282 |doi=10.1016/s0167-2991(08)65236-2 |series=Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis |isbn=9780444419200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced coke formation in presence of plasma reduces the poisoning/deactivation rate and thus extending the life of a catalyst.
** Presence of '''new gas phase species'''. In a plasma discharge a wide range of new speceis is produced allowing the catalyst to be exposed to them. Ions, vibrationally and rotationally excited species do not affect the catalyst since they loose the charge and the additional energy they possess when they reach a solid surface. Radicals, instead, show high sticking coefficients for chemisorption, increasing the catalytic activity. 

* Catalyst effects on plasma:
** Local '''electric field enhancement'''. This aspect is mainly related to a packed-bed PEC configuration. The presence of a packing material inside an electric field generates local field enhancements due to the presence of asperities, solid material surface inhomogeneities, presence of pores and other physical aspects. This phenomenon is related to surface charge accumulation on the packing material surface and it is present even if a packed-bed is used without a catalyst. Despite this is a physical aspect, it also affects the chemistry since it alters the electron energy distribution in proximity of the asperities.
** '''Discharges formation inside pores'''. This aspect is strictly related to the previous one. Small void spaces inside a packing material affect the electric field strength. The enhancement can also lead to a change in the discharge characteristics, which can be different from the discharge condition of the bulk region (i.e. far from the solid material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Yu-Ru |last2=Van Laer |first2=Koen |last3=Neyts |first3=Erik C. |last4=Bogaerts |first4=Annemie |title=Can plasma be formed in catalyst pores?

** '''Change in the discharge type'''. Inserting a dielectric material in a discharge region leads to a shifting in the discharge type. From a filamentary regime a mixed filamentary/surface discharge is estlablished. Ions, excited species and radicals are formed in a wider region if a surface discharge regime is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bednar |first1=Nikola |last2=Matović |first2=Jovan |last3=Stojanović |first3=Goran |title=Properties of surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator for fabrication of nanomaterials |journal=Journal of Electrostatics |date=December 2013 |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=1068–1075 |doi=10.1016/j.elstat.2013.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalyst effects on plasma are mostly related to the presence of a dielectric material inside the discharge region and do not necessarily require the presence of a catalyst.

An '''overhead projector''' is a variant of [[slide projector]] that is used to display images to an audience. The name is often abbreviated to OHP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Power|first1=Stephen|title=‘The pedagogic perfection of the overhead projector – and why interactive whiteboards alone won’t ever match it’|url=https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/pedagogic-perfection-overhead-projector-and-why-interactive|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kavita|first1=GU|last2=Shashikala|first2=P|last3=Sreevidyalata|first3=GM|title=Use of Over Head Projector for teaching and learning Fine  Needle  Aspiration Cytology skills to undergraduate students and their perception|journal=Journal of  Educational Research &amp; Medical Teacher|date=2015|volume=3|issue=1|pages=31–33|url=http://jermt.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Optical system==
An overhead projector works on the same principle as a 35mm [[slide projector]], in which a focusing lens projects light from an illuminated slide onto a [[projection screen]] where a [[real image]] is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the [[transparency (overhead projector)|transparencies]] used (generally the size of a printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the focusing lens to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a [[mirror image]] thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and focusing lens), in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or [[film projector]] (which lack such a mirror) where the slide's image is non-reversed on the side ''opposite'' the focusing lens.

The device has sometimes been called a "Belshazzar", after [[Belshazzar's feast]] ("In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote" ({{Bibleverse|Daniel|5:5|KJV}})).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523986908547852 |title=A Survey of the Use of the Overhead Projector in the United Kingdom |first=N. E. |last=Willis |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condenser===
Because the focusing lens (typically less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm [4&amp;nbsp;in] in diameter) is much smaller than the transparency, a crucial role is played by the optical [[Condenser (optics)|condenser]] which illuminates the transparency. Since this requires a large optical lens (at least the size of the transparency) but may be of poor optical quality (since the sharpness of the image does not depend on it), a [[Fresnel lens]] is employed. The Fresnel lens is located at (or is part of) the glass plate on which the transparency is placed, and serves to redirect most of the light hitting it into a converging cone toward the focusing lens. Without such a [[Condenser (optics)|condenser]] at that point, most of the light would miss the focusing lens (or it would have to be very large and prohibitively expensive). Additionally, mirrors or other condensing elements below the Fresnel lens serve to increase the portion of the light bulb's output which reaches the Fresnel lens in the first place. In order to provide sufficient light on the screen, a high intensity bulb is used which must be [[Forced convection|fan cooled]].

===Focus adjustment===
Overhead projectors normally include a manual focusing mechanism which raises and lowers the position of the focusing lens (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the lens) to [[thin lens#Image formation|focus]] at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed [[focal length]] of the focusing lens. This permits a range of projection distances.

Increasing (or decreasing) the projection distance increases (or decreases) the focusing system's [[Magnification#Magnification as a number (optical magnification)|magnification]] in order to fit the projection screen in use (or sometimes just to accommodate the room setup). Increasing the projection distance also means that the same amount of light is spread over a larger screen, resulting in a dimmer image. With a change in the projection distance, the focusing must be readjusted for a sharp image. However, the condensing optics (Fresnel lens) is optimized for one particular vertical position of the lens, corresponding to one projection distance. Therefore, when it is focused for a greatly different projection distance, part of the light cone projected by the Fresnel lens towards the focusing lens misses that lens. This has the greatest effect towards the outer edges of the projected image, so that one typically sees either blue or brown fringing at the edge of the screen when the focus is towards an extreme. Using the projector near its recommended projection distance allows a focusing position where this is avoided and the intensity across the screen is approximately uniform.

===Source of illumination===
The lamp technology of an overhead projector is typically very simple compared to a modern LCD or DLP video projector. Most overheads use an extremely high-power halogen lamp that may consume up to 750 watts. A high-flow blower is required to keep the bulb from melting due to the heat generated, and this blower is often on a timer that keeps it running for a period after the light is extinguished.

Further, the intense heat accelerates failure of the high intensity lamp, often burning out in less than 100 hours, requiring replacement. In contrast, a modern LCD or DLP projector uses an [[arc lamp]] which has a higher [[luminous efficacy]] and lasts for thousands of hours. A drawback of that technology is the warm up time required for arc lamps.

Older overhead projectors used a tubular quartz bulb which was mounted above a bowl-shaped polished reflector. However, because the lamp was suspended above and outside the reflector, a large amount of light was cast to the sides inside the projector body that was wasted, thus requiring a higher power lamp for sufficient screen illumination. More modern overhead projectors use an integrated lamp and conical reflector assembly, allowing the lamp to be located deep within the reflector and sending a greater portion of its light towards the Fresnel lens; this permits using a lower power lamp for the same screen illumination.

A useful innovation for overhead projectors with integrated lamps/reflectors is the quick-swap dual-lamp control, allowing two lamps to be installed in the projector in movable sockets. If one lamp fails during a presentation the presenter can merely move a lever to slide the spare into position and continue with the presentation, without needing to open the projection unit or waiting for the failed bulb to cool before replacing it.

==History==
Some ancient [[projectors]] like the [[magic lantern]] can be regarded as predecessors of the overhead projector. The steganographic mirror possibly came closest to how the overhead projector was used.

German Jesuit scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s 1645 book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' included a description of his invention, the "Steganographic Mirror": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hUvNnJteew4C&amp;pg=RA1-PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|page=912|year=1645}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1654 Belgian Jesuit mathematician [[André Tacquet]] used Kircher's technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary [[Martino Martini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch, Latin|title=De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 10|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001199401_01/_zev001199401_01_0033.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how exactly Tacquet used Kircher's system, but it is imaginable that he drew pictures on the projecting mirror while details of the journey were explained.

French physicist Edmund Becquerel developed the first known overhead projection apparatus in 1853. It was demonstrated by French instrument maker and inventor Jules Duboscq in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Debbie D. Griggs, "Projection Apparatus for Science in Late Nineteenth Century America", Rittenhouse, 7, 9-15 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projectors and Slides|url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Optics/Projector/Projector.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overhead projector designed by American scientist [[Henry Morton (scientist)|Henry Morton]] was marketed around 1880 as a "vertical lantern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/mobilizing-minds/overhead-projectors|title=Overhead Projectors|publisher=[[National Museum of American History]]|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Transparency (projection)|transparent sheets]] for overhead projection, called viewfoils or viewgraphs, was largely developed in the United States.

Overhead projectors were introduced into [[U.S. Army|U.S. military]] training during [[World War II]]. After the war they were used at schools like the U.S. Military Academy.&lt;ref&gt;http://americanhistory.si.edu/mobilizing-minds/overhead-projectors&lt;/ref&gt;

Overhead projectors were used early on for police work with a cellophane roll over a 9-inch stage, allowing facial characteristics to be rolled across the stage.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the demand for projectors grew, Buhl Industries was founded in 1953, and became the leading US contributor for several optical refinements for the overhead projector and its projection lens.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Overhead projectors began to be widely used in schools and businesses in the late 1950s and early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the late 1950s Roger Appeldorn was challenged by his boss at [[3M]] to find a use for the transparencies that were the waste of their color copy process. Appeldorn developed a process for the projection of transparent sheets that led to 3M’s first marketable transparency film. The Strategic Air Command base in Omaha was one of the first big clients, using circa 20,000 sheets per month. 3M then decided to develop their own overhead projector instead of the one they had been selling until then, which was produced by an outside manufacturer. It took several prototypes before a cost-effective, small and foldable version could be presented on January 15, 1962. It had a new fresnel lens made with a structured-surface plastic, much better than other plastic lenses and much cheaper than glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/171240O/3m-coi-book-tif.pdf|title=A Century of Innovation - The 3M Sory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the United States' first [[subsidy|Federal Aid to Education]] program stimulated overhead sales which remained high up to the late 1990s and into the 21st Century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Use in education ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The overhead projector facilitates an easy low-cost interactive environment for educators. Teaching materials can be pre-printed on plastic sheets, upon which the educator can directly write using a non-permanent, washable color marking pen. This saves time, since the transparency can be pre-printed and used repetitively, rather than having materials written manually before each class.

The overhead is typically placed at a comfortable writing height for the educator and allows the educator to face the class, facilitating better communication between the students and teacher. The enlarging features of the projector allow the educator to write in a comfortable small script in a natural writing position rather than writing in an overly large script on a blackboard and having to constantly hold his arm out in midair to write on the blackboard.

When the transparency sheet is full of written or drawn material, it can simply be replaced with a new, fresh sheet with more pre-printed material, again saving class time vs a blackboard that would need to be erased and teaching materials rewritten by the educator. Following the class period, the transparencies are easily restored to their original unused state by washing off with soap and water.

=== LCD overhead displays ===
{{main|LCD projector}}
In the early 1980s&amp;ndash;1990s, overhead projectors were used as part of a classroom computer display/projection system. A liquid-crystal panel mounted in a plastic frame was placed on top of the overhead projector and connected to the video output of the computer, often splitting off the normal monitor output. A cooling fan in the frame of the LCD panel would blow cooling air across the LCD to prevent overheating that would fog the image.

The first of these LCD panels were monochrome-only, and could display NTSC video output such as from an [[Apple II]] computer or VCR. In the late 1980s color models became available, capable of "thousands" of colors (16-bit color), for the color [[Macintosh]] and [[VGA]] PCs. The displays were never particularly fast to refresh or update, resulting in the smearing of fast-moving images, but it was acceptable when nothing else was available.

The Do-It-Yourself community has started using this idea to make low-cost home theater projectors. By removing the casing and backlight assembly of a common LCD monitor, one can use the exposed LCD screen in conjunction with the overhead projector to project the contents of the LCD screen to the wall at a much lower cost than with standard LCD projectors. Due to the mirroring of the image in the head of the overhead projector, the image on the wall is "re-flipped" to where it would be if one was looking at the LCD screen normally.

==Decline in use==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2017}}

Overhead projectors were once a common fixture in most [[classroom]]s and business conference rooms, but today are slowly being replaced by [[document camera]]s, dedicated computer projection systems and [[interactive whiteboard]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Such systems allow the presenter to project video directly from a computer file, typically produced using software such as  [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] and [[LibreOffice]]. Such presentations can also include animations, interactive components, or even video clips, with ease of paging between slides. The relatively expensive printing or photocopying of color transparencies is eliminated.

The primary reason{{dubious|date=June 2014}} for this gradual replacement is the deeply ingrained use of computing technology in modern society and the inability of overheads to easily support the features that modern users demand. While an overhead can display static images fairly well, it performs poorly at displaying moving images. The LCD video display panels that were once used as an add-on to an overhead projector have become obsolete, with that combination of display technology and projection optics now optimally integrated into a modern [[video projector]].

The standards of users have also increased{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, so that a dim, fuzzy overhead projection that is too bright in the center and too dim around the edges is no longer acceptable. The optical focus, linearity, brightness and clarity of an overhead generally cannot match that of a video projector {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Video projectors use extremely small picture generation mechanisms, allowing for precision optics{{dubious|date=June 2014}} that far exceed the plastic fresnel lens' optical performance. They also include additional optics that eliminate the ''hotspot'' in the center of the screen{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} directly above the light source, so that the brightness is uniform everywhere on the projection screen.

Critics{{who|date=May 2015}} feel that there are some downsides as these technologies are more prone to failure and have a much steeper learning curve for the user than a standard overhead projector.

'''Patrick Bruce Whitehouse [[OBE]]''' (1922–1993) was one of the pioneers of [[heritage railway|railway preservation]], when he helped save the [[Talyllyn Railway]] in 1951. He also led the restoration to working order of several of Britain's [[steam locomotive]]s after they were replaced by [[Diesel locomotive|diesel locomotion]] in the 1960s.

==Early life==
Patrick Bruce Whitehouse was born in [[Warwick]], the son of Cecil Whitehouse who was the co-owner of the family construction firm B. Whitehouse and Sons based in [[Birmingham]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and his wife Phyllis (nee Bucknell), who was a descendant of the founding family of the shipping line that became the [[Ellerman Lines|Ellerman &amp; Bucknell Steamship Company]].&lt;ref name=RailMag112017&gt;{{cite magazine

==Career==
===RAF: 1939–1945===
Educated at [[Warwick School]], on graduation he was due to join the family firm, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] meant that he tried to follow his ambition of becoming a pilot. With less than perfect eyesight, the [[Royal Air Force]] approved his training as a navigator, which he completed in [[Canada]] under the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]]. Returning to the UK he was posted to [[No. 15 Squadron RAF]], completing three tours each of 30 flights over [[Nazi Germany]] and occupied western-Europe.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

Assigned to [[RAF Transport Command]], he was then posted by them to what was consider the less stressful [[Middle East]]. Shot down over the [[Mediterranean]], he was the sole survivor of a crew of four, picked-up four days later from his RAF issue rubber dinghy by a Greek freighter. By the time of his demobilisation in 1946, he had reached the rank of [[Squadron Leader]].&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

===Construction: 1946–1970===
Post-WW2, Whitehouse returned to the family firm, initially becoming number three behind his father and uncle. He succeeded his uncle as Chairman, but sold the business in 1964 to Holland Hannen &amp; Cubbits Ltd. This allowed him to serve on their board until 1971, being appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 1960s for his campaign for safety regulations on [[building site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 17 August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railway preservation==
Whitehouse was a member of what later became chronicled as the "Birmingham Railway Mafia", a group centred around a core of steam railway enthusiasts who were members of both the Birmingham Locomotive Club and West Midlands branch of the [[Stephenson Locomotive Society]].&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

Newly married, Whitehouse bought a [[Rolleiflex]] camera, and began chronicling the demise of steam and the railways in some of his favourite railway locations in the West Midlands. These were supplemented by photographs from SLS tours organised by the Birmingham Mafia, including one Whitehouse co-arranged on the [[Ashover Light Railway]], [[Derbyshire]]. Inspired by H Fayle's book ''Narrow Gauge Railways of Ireland'', Whitehouse and his wife toured [[Ireland]] in the summers of the early 1950s, in 1952 accompanied by fellow publisher [[Ian Allan (publisher)|Ian Allan]], with the group especially enjoying chasing trains along the [[Tralee and Dingle Railway]]. These tours are also where Whitehouse met fellow enthusiasts who would later play a key role in preservation of the UK's steam railway heritage, including [[Ivo Peters]], Henry S Orbach and [[Peter Allen (industrialist)|Peter Allen]], later knighted for his chairmanship of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]].&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt; With a good volume and sufficient personal confidence in his own photographic ability, in the mid-1950s Whitehouse submitted a selected portfolio to the [[Royal Photographic Society]],&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt; and in 1958 co-authored with John Powell published a book on the Tralee &amp; Dingle.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

===Talyllyn Railway===
On 11 October 1950, as part of the Birmingham Railway Mafia, Whitehouse was one of the attendees at a meeting at the Imperial Hotel, Birmingham, called and chaired by his friend [[Tom Rolt]] to save the [[Talyllyn Railway]], a [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge slate railway]] in mid-[[Wales]]. At the end of the meeting, having agreed to form the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society (TRPS), the world's first [[railway preservation]] society, Whitehouse accepted the position of Secretary. He later became vice-president of the society, used his construction knowledge and connections with regards preservation and development of the permanent way, and became a skilled steam engine fireman on the line.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

Friends from his time on the Talyllyn soon became enthused by the idea of reviving the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] in [[North Wales]], which Whitehouse also became involved in the early stages of.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt; In 1968, a group of business people including Whitehouse made an offer to BR to purchase the [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]], which was turned down by the then governing [[socialist]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government.&lt;ref&gt;''The Railway Preservation Revolution: A History of Britain's Heritage Railways'' by Jonathan Brown, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===4555 and the Dart Valley Railway===
In 1962/3, B Whitehouse &amp; Sons Ltd had been commissioned to rebuild a bridge and walls at [[Walsall railway station]]. With the oncoming introduction of diesel and electric services to the area, and subsequent rationalisation and simplification of the required infrastructure, the BR specification changed on numerous occasions resulting in large cost rises. At a subsequent meeting between Whitehouse and the regional manager Stanley Raymond (who as Sir Stanley Raymond, succeeded [[Richard Beeching|Dr Richard Beeching]] as Chairman of the Board of British Railways), the cost issues were resolved, and Raymond asked if he could help Whitehouse with anything else? Whitehouse responded that he wanted to buy a steam locomotive, which after within the room discussions with his staff, Raymond agreed to.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

Whitehouse and fellow Talyllyn member Pat Garland secured [[Great Western Railway]] [[GWR 4500 Class|4500 Class ''Small Prairie'' Tank]] No.4555 for £750, which included a light overhaul at [[Swindon Works]], a spare boiler, a wagon load of spares and free delivery to [[Tyseley TMD]]. Subsequently utilised lightly by BR around the Birmingham area, Whitehouse and his friends wanted to run the locomotive on a GWR branch line. Having originally focused on the already closed [[Dartmouth Steam Railway|GWR Kingswear branch]] in Devon, with track already being removed they then focused on the [[South Devon Railway (heritage railway)|Dart Valley Railway]] from Buckfastleigh to [[Ashburton railway station|Ashburton]]. Operated from the outset – as had the Talyllyn and the Ffestiniog – as a commercial railway, in the first year the Dart Valley carried 60,000 passengers at a profit.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

===Clun Castle and Tyseley===
With an agreement already in place to purchase [[Castle class locomotive|Castle Class]] [[GWR 4073 Class 7029 Clun Castle|No.7029 '' Clun Castle '']] from BR for its scrap price of £2,400, in January 1966 Whitehouse and John Evans topped up the fund to allow the transaction to be completed.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

Purchased under the Standard Gauge Steam Trust, Whitehouse was instrumental in subsequently securing a lease from BR on a residual area of the soon to be demolished GWR Tyseley [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], encompassing the coaling stage, ash shelter and watering tower. Unable to negotiate at the time a return to the BR mainline with Dr Beeching, these residual MDP elements later became the [[Birmingham Railway Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyseleylocoworks.co.uk/tlw/brm.htm|title=Tyseley Loco Works|website=Tyseleylocoworks.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|16|acre|m2|adj=on}} site equipped to preserve and maintain main line [[steam locomotive]]s. There he led a team which restored the [[LMS Jubilee Class]] [[LMS Jubilee Class 5593 Kolhapur|No.5593 ''Kolhapur'']]. By the 1970s the Birmingham Railway Museum housed up to 15 locomotives, and now{{when|date=October 2017}} leases engines to preservation lines throughout Britain. It is also the home of the '' Shakespeare Express '' on the BR main line from Birmingham to [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shakespeareexpress.com/se.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811062901/http://www.shakespeareexpress.com/se.htm |archivedate=11 August 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photographer, writer and publisher===
In 1952, with Tom Rolt undertaking the writing and Whitehouse contributing the photographs and research, Whitehouse co-authored his first book "Lines of Character". Five years later he wrote his first solo book "Narrow Gauge Album", published by [[Ian Allan Publishing]].&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt; Whitehouse became the author or co-author of 53 books on railways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_at_ep_srch/183-2752189-6412441?ie=UTF8&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=P.+B.+Whitehouse&amp;sort=relevancerank|title=Amazon.com: P. B. Whitehouse: Books|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built up a collection of more than a quarter of a million photographs of British and foreign railways. In the 1980s, his travels in China led to a long-standing friendship with the China Railway Publishing House in Beijing, and a treaty of friendship between Birmingham and the north-eastern city of [[Changchun]], [[Manchuria]].

Published under the title Millbrook House, the publishers collection of over 250,000 photographs – from both those taken by Whitehouse, and the collections he purchased – became known as the Millbrook House collection. After his death, the majority of the photographs that he took himself known as the Whitehouse Collection was donated to the nation, acquired by the [[National Railway Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/a911a70c-be0c-4ed3-93ac-c9cc86a10634|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehouse had inherited a [[Kodak]] film camera, on which he chronicled his excursions across the UK, Ireland and mainland Europe. In 1956, he produced his first commercial film with John Adams, about the railways of the [[Isle of Man]]. Showing the production at a local film club in Birmingham, they met BBC Children's producer Peggy Bacon, who commissioned the pair to present and produce some full-length railway programmes for Children. Whitehouse and John Adams subsequently filmed, produced and co-presented the [[BBC1]] Children's programme ''Railway Roundabout''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ltmuseumshop.co.uk/LTM/World_cities/DVDs/Product/Railway-roundabout-DVD-box-set.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180022/http://www.ltmuseumshop.co.uk/LTM/World_cities/DVDs/Product/Railway-roundabout-DVD-box-set.html |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the films exist still to this day, the programme commentaries and links were live to air and hence not recorded. Film archivist John Huntley estimates the pair were responsible for 137 films, of which around 100 were shown on ''Railway Roundabout''.&lt;ref name=RailMag112017/&gt;

== Family ==
His book, ''China By Rail'' was co-authored by his daughter [[Maggy Whitehouse]]. His son Michael Whitehouse is a lawyer specialising in rail transport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wragge.com/lawyersearch_michael_whitehouse.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126234159/http://www.wragge.com/lawyersearch_michael_whitehouse.asp |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-executive director of the Rail Freight Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/Michael_Whitehouse|title=Michael Whitehouse - Festipedia|website=Festipedia.org.uk|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''platform display''', '''destination display''' or '''train describer''' (British English) is supplementing the [[destination sign]] on arriving trains giving passengers an advance information. Historically they did only show the next destination and sometimes the type of train. In later usage they were replaced by [[Passenger information system|passenger information display systems]] (PIDS) allowing for [[real-time business intelligence|real-time]] passenger information.

The first railway stations had only a time table for passenger information. On larger stations the [[train porter]]s would help passengers to board the correct train matching with their ticket. They were supervised by a [[station manager]] that would handle the security requirements for each departing train. The first help in that task was a bell to remind passengers to board the train in time which on smaller stations does also announce the next train. Different directions would then be called out on the platform. At the time that trains grew into mass transport systems this was not enough anymore. The train handling became optimized to allow for less than a minute from arrival to departure at a stop which triggered the usage of loudspeakers and platform displays. The mechanical types were not standardized and every station had its own range of facilities as they seemed useful.

A train describer is originally an additional apparatus at [[Great Britain|British]] railways that ensures that the identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.safety.networkrail.co.uk/Services/Jargon-Buster/T/TP-TT/Train-describer] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This routing information would then be passed through to the platform display for passenger information. Technically the [[train reporting number]] was pushed from one signal box to the next. A series of interconnected signal boxes form a train describer system (TDS) transferring train describer data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a train describer display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davros.org/rail/photos/p009.html|title=Cambridge Panel - Stansted to Whittlesford|website=Davros.org|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Interlocking#Relay interlocking|electric relay interlocking]] boxes were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.

In a centralized [[Interlocking#Electronic interlocking|electronic interlocking]] the current train location and identification is used to predict the arrival at the next stop allowing for countdown clocks for passenger information. The term ''passenger information display'' has widely replaced the term platform display as station design can include different types of information displays - like a departure board in the main hall, a shorter list in the tunnels and an announcement of the next train on each platform side - which all get their information from a central electronic railway control system. Additionally passenger information displays have come into use for bus and tram stops as well where the destination display equipment is technically similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5394">The '''Prix Pierre Guzman''' ('''Pierre Guzman Prize''') was the name given to two prizes, one astronomical and one medical.  Both were established by the will of Anne Emilie Clara Goguet (died June 30, 1891), wife of Marc Guzman, and named after her son Pierre Guzman.&lt;ref name="nyac" /&gt;

==Astronomical==
This prize was a sum of 100,000 francs, to be given to a person who succeeded in communicating with a celestial body, other than Mars, and receiving a response.  Until this occurred, the will also allowed for the accumulated interest on the 100,000 francs to be given, every five years, to a person who had made significant progress in astronomy.  The prize was to be awarded by the French [[Académie des sciences]].&lt;ref name="nyac"&gt;pp. 2-7 (minutes of meeting), ''Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences'', series I, '''11''' (October–November 1891; issue 1-2), {{doi|10.1111/j.2164-0947.1891.tb01835.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pierre Guzman had been interested in the work of [[Camille Flammarion]], the author of ''[[La planète Mars et ses conditions d'habitabilité]]'' (The Planet Mars and Its Conditions of Habitability, 1892).  Communication with Mars was specifically exempted as many people believed that Mars was inhabited at the time and communication with that planet would not be a difficult enough challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Camille Flammarion, ''Dreams of an Astronomer'', trans. [[E. E. Fournier D'Albe]] (New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1923), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was later announced in 1900 by the French [[Académie des sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3087z/f1147.image.r= ''Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences'', '''131''' (1900), p. 1147].&lt;/ref&gt;

The five-yearly prize of interest was awarded, starting in 1905, as follows:
* In Dec. 1905, to [[Henri Joseph Anastase Perrotin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3095m/f1071.image.r= ''Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences'', '''141''' (1905), p. 1071].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 491, ''Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France'', '''20''' (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the prize was also given to [[Louis Fabry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3095m/f1077.image.r= ''Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences'', '''141''' (1905), p. 1077].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 339, ''Bulletin de la société de géographie de Marseille'', '''29''' (1905).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Dec. 1910, to [[Maurice Loewy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31042/f1187.image.r= ''Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences'', '''151''' (1910), p. 1187].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed in 1937 that he should receive the prize for "his discovery relating to the interstellar transmission of energy."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tesla-coil-builder.com/Articles/july_11_1937.htm Sending of Messages to Planets Predicted by Dr. Tesla on Birthday]," ''New York Times'', 11 July 1937, p. 13, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was awarded to the crew of Apollo 11 in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Collins, ''Mission To Mars'', ({{ISBN|0802111602}}, Grove Weidenfeld, 1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 60, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&amp;dat=19691210&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Apollo 11 Crew Awarded Medals for Moon Trip"], [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|''The Blade'' (Toledo, Ohio, USA)]], Dec. 10, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical==
This prize was a sum of 50,000 francs, to be awarded by the French [[Académie de médecine]], to be given to a person who succeeded in developing an effective treatment for the most common forms of heart disease.  Until this occurred, the will also allowed for the accumulated interest to be given yearly to someone who had made progress in heart disease.&lt;ref name="nyac" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 222, [https://archive.org/details/b24749473 ''L'Aesculpe: guide pratique à l'usage des étudiants et des docteurs en médecine'', Paris: Masson &amp; Cie, 1905].&lt;/ref&gt;

The yearly prize of interest was awarded as follows:
* In 1903, to Paul Bergougnan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k408710h/f545.image.r= p. 545, ''Bulletin de l'Académie de médecine'', 3rd series, '''50''' (1903)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1905, to Gillet, with an honorable  mention to Braillon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4087141/f425.image.r= pp. 424-425, ''Bulletin de l'Académie de médecine'', 3rd series, '''54''' (1905)].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project RESISTANCE''' was a domestic espionage operation coordinated under the Domestic Operations Division (DOD) of the [[CIA]]. Its purpose was to collect background information on groups around the U.S. that might pose threats to CIA facilities and personnel. From 1967 to 1973, many local police departments, college campus staff members, and other independent informants collaborated with the CIA to keep track of [[student radical]] groups that opposed the U.S. government's foreign policies on [[Vietnam]]. Project RESISTANCE and its twin program, [[Project MERRIMAC]] were both coordinated by the CIA Office of Security. In addition, the twin projects were branch operations that relayed civilian information to their parent program, [[Operation CHAOS]].

Gary Kayye, a prominent member of the AV community, founded Kayye Consulting in 1998.&lt;ref name="ravepubs1"/&gt; Kayye graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Journalism and Mass Communication|School of Journalism and Mass Communication]] with an emphasis on marketing and public relations at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (where he serves as an adjunct faculty member).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jomc.unc.edu/faculty-staff-lecturers/lecturers |title=Lecturers |publisher=Jomc.unc.edu |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=76849714&amp;authType=name&amp;authToken=J7Ey&amp;trk=tyah&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Embed Video Subscribe to comments Post Comment |url=http://www.slideshare.net/carolinaprssa/social-media-in-pr-by-gary-kayye |title=PRSSA Meeting – Social Media in PR by Gary Kayye |publisher=Slideshare.net |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been in the industry since 1987 when he started at Extron Electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Net Income: Cut Costs, Boost Profits, and Enhance Operations Online |last=Bock |first=Wally |authorlink=|author2=Jeff Senné  |year=1997 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-471-28839-8 |pages=102–103 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047128839X.html |accessdate=5/1/11}}&lt;/ref&gt; before eventually moving to [[AMX LLC|AMX]]. In addition to consulting, Kayye Consulting  worked with AV professionals through training, development and marketing.&lt;ref name="dailydooh1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydooh.com/archives/28371 |title=Blog Archive » Projection Summit 2010 Round Up |publisher=DailyDOOH |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalavbuyersguide.com/kayyeconsulting.php |title=Kayye Consulting |publisher=Professional AV Buyers Guide |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sixteen-nine.net/?p=4952 |title=Sixteen:Nine – rAVe: Kayye's Krystal Ball – 2011 Edition |publisher=Sixteen-nine.net |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Kayye Consulting published its first e-newsletter – Gary Kayye's rAVe – which largely covered commercial AV news. This e-newsletter eventually became the ProAV e-newsletter,  and continues to cover the commercial AV sector. In 2004, Kayye Consulting added the HomeAV e-newsletter, in partnership with CEDIA, covering the residential sector.

With a larger focus on AV industry news coverage, Kayye Consulting Inc. became publicly known as rAVe [Publications] in 2008. rAVe [Publications] is a [[Doing business as|DBA]] of Kayye Consulting Inc.

In 2007, rAVe began using social media to enhance its coverage of the AV community.  Beginning at InfoComm 2007 rAVe tweeted about new products, and after a positive response, started using social media as a critical aspect of their coverage.&lt;ref name="sonicfoundry1"/&gt; rAVe NOW was launched in 2008 to incorporate all of rAVe's social media efforts.

Today, rAVe has six e-newsletters, two international partners and an extensive social media site in rAVe NOW.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9671">'''Range gate pull-off''' ('''RGPO''') is an [[electronic warfare]] technique used to break [[radar lock-on]]. The basic concept is to produce a pulse of radio signal similar to the one that the target radar would produce when it reflects off the aircraft. This second pulse is then increasingly delayed in time so that the radar's [[range gate]] begins to follow the false pulse instead of the real reflection, pulling it off the target.

[[Doppler radar]]s may not use range gates and instead select a single target by narrowly filtering frequencies on either side of the target's initial return. Against these radars, the related '''velocity gate pull-off''' can be used. These send a return signal that slowly changes in frequency, rather than time, hoping the radar's velocity gate will be pulled off the target in the same general fashion.

Pull-off belongs to the wider family of "deceptive jamming" concepts that use details of the target radar to their advantage, rather than attempting to simply overpower the radar's signal. Alternate names for "pull-off" include "stealing" and "walk-off". A related technique is [[angle deception jamming]].

==Description==
===Range gates and strobing===
Even the earliest [[radar]] systems included a system to highlight a single selected target for further analysis. For instance, the [[GL Mk. I radar|Gun-Laying Mark I]], the [[British Army]]'s first operational radar, used an on-screen cursor known as the ''strobe'' to highlight a single target. This worked by filtering out, or ''gating'', signals that were not within the strobe's short time period, typically a few microseconds, corresponding to a range of a few hundred meters. The signal within the strobe's window was then sent to secondary displays where two operators would determine the azimuth and elevation of that single target, by keeping its ''blip'' centered in their displays. Similar systems were used by many radars by the mid-war period.

By the end of the war, many experiments were being carried out on automatic target following, or [[radar lock-on]]. In these systems, the operator would select a target using the strobe, and then circuits in the radar would automatically track the target in azimuth and elevation. This eliminated the need for the additional operators. Since the target's range would continue to change as it moved, the circuitry also attempted to keep the strobe centered in range. Some systems automated even the strobing; the [[AI Mk. IV radar|AI Mark V]] was designed for single-seat [[fighter aircraft]] where the pilot would be too busy to adjust the strobe, and instead had a second system to sweep the strobe through a wide range and then lock onto the first signal it saw.

In the post-war era the circuitry that produced the strobe and filtered out other returns became more widely known as a [[range gate]].

===Range Pull-off===
While testing a late-war radar design, the [[AI Mk. VIII radar|AI Mk. IX]], a serious problem with the auto-follow system was found.

While this system was being tested, [[Bomber Command]] was pressing the [[Air Ministry]] to use "window", better known today as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]], as a radar countermeasure. [[Fighter Command]] pointed out that the Germans could easily copy the system and use it against England, potentially re-opening [[The Blitz]].{{efn|Ironically, the Germans had already discovered window on their own, and decided not to use it against the UK because they thought they might copy it and use it against Germany.}} It was suggested that the AI Mk. IX would ignore window because it deccelerated rapidly after it was dropped, and would thus quickly pass out of the range gates and not be tracked. But exactly the opposite occurred in testing; the radar unerringly locked onto the window and the target disappeared from the display.

Range gate pull-off is essentially an electronic version of window. Instead of producing the secondary return by dropping a packet of foil reflectors, the second return is created by a [[transponder]] in the target aircraft. The transponder initially responds as rapidly as possible to the radar's signal, producing a second blip that overlaps the original. Over a period of time it increasingly delays the return so that it falls "behind" the radar signal in time. The goal is to delay the signal so it counters the aircraft's motion, leaving a signal at what appears to be a (nearly) fixed location in space. If the radar was locked on to the aircraft, it may remain locked to this second pulse as the aircraft moves away from the original location. Eventually, the aircraft will fall outside the range gate and disappear, while the radar continues tracking the false signal. Thus, the false signal is said to pull the range gate off the target.

The system can be further improved through detailed control of the returned signal. One improvement is to have another signal sent out at "zero time", immediately on reception. This may require the transponder to listen to the radar's signal and determine its [[pulse repetition frequency]] so it can properly time the response to be exactly the same as the radar's reflection. This signal is then added to the one from the reflected radar signal, making the target signal stronger. The system then begins sending the second signal as well, at exactly the same strength as this doubled-up return, while at the same time reducing the false reflection as the second signal moves away in time. The result on the radar display is that the real signal fades back to its original smaller value, while the fake second signal remains a constant stronger strength. This makes the real return look like the fake.

One problem with a simple RGPO system is that the false signals will always appear further away from the radar, due to the slight delay in the transponder. On a [[plan-position indicator]], the false signal will appear as a second dot at increasing distances from the first, which the operator can then manually strobe to regain lock. This can be offset by having the transponder store how rapidly the radar signals are being received, and then estimating the [[pulse repetition frequency]] so that it can predict future pulses. Then it can send its signal before the next pulse, allowing it to pull off in either direction and making manual re-lock more difficult.

===Velocity pull-off===
[[Doppler radar]]s directly measure the target's velocity via the [[Doppler effect]]. In typical early implementations, the received signal was amplified and then sent into a bank of narrow-band filters, each one corresponding to a particular target velocity.

If an RGPO jammer responds to such a signal by sending out the same frequency it received, this additional signal will be sent into the same filter, adding to the original signal and making it stronger. It the transponder instead responds at a fixed frequency, it will fall into a different filter and can be easily distinguished. In either case, the original target return remains locked-on.

Modifying a transponder to deal with Doppler radars is easy, it simply requires it to be able to adjust its frequency. In this case, the system initially responds at the same frequency as the original signal, and then increasingly shifts the frequency over time in a manner similar to the RGPO case. This will cause a second signal to appear in adjacent filters, with no way to know which is the original. Since the frequency can be easily adjusted up or down, it does not have the added complication seen in RGPOs that want to pull-off in either direction.

[[Pulse-Doppler radar]]s use both pulse timing and Doppler shifting to track targets, so by varying both the frequency and return timing, these can be pulled off as well. Such a transponder will continue to work against non-Doppler radars as well, as these generally have wide frequency response and continue to see the signal as long as its frequency shift does not become significant.

===Countermeasures===
The effectiveness of the pull-off can be reduced if the radar changes its pulse repetition frequency, thereby making it difficult for the transponder to continue smoothly delaying the fake signal. [[Frequency agility]] has the same effect, as the transponder cannot guess what frequency to send out the fake signals on until it hears the one from the radar.

Denying this capability means the signal from the transponder can only respond to signals after hearing them on its receiver. These signals will always represent returns from greater distances than the jammer aircraft. Pulse-to-pulse comparison techniques, like [[moving target indication]], can be used to filter out these sorts of returns as they appear on the radar to be slower-moving targets.

'''Roger Lee Easton, Sr.''' (April 30, 1921 – May 8, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] scientist/physicist who was the principal inventor and designer of the [[Global Positioning System]], along with [[Ivan A. Getting]] and [[Bradford Parkinson]].&lt;ref name="invent"&gt;{{cite web| title=Mr. Roger L Easton, Sr.| url=http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100405-045.pdf| date=October 28, 2013| publisher=[[Air Force Space Command]]| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203157/http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100405-045.pdf| archivedate=October 29, 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Craftsbury, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the IEEE|publisher=IEEE|volume=48|p=1–844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1955, Easton co-wrote the [[Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory's]] [[Project Vanguard]] proposal for a U.S. [[satellite]] program in competition with two other proposals, including a proposal from the [[U.S. Army]] prepared by [[Wernher Von Braun]]. The Eisenhower Administration selected Project Vanguard. In 1957, Easton invented the [[Minitrack]] tracking system to determine the Vanguard satellite's orbit. When [[Sputnik I]] was launched, Easton extended the system to actively follow unknown orbiting satellites.&lt;ref name="invent"/&gt;

In 1959, he designed the Naval Space Surveillance (NAVSPASUR) system. The [[Naval Space Surveillance System]] became the first system to detect and track all types of Earth-orbiting objects. It goes through the 33rd parallel, which is effectively coast to coast of the US.&lt;ref name="invent"/&gt;

Later in his career at NRL, Easton conceived, patented, and led the development of essential enabling technologies for the United States Global Positioning System (GPS). During the 1960s and early 1970s he developed a time-based navigational system with passive ranging, circular orbits, and space-borne high precision clocks placed in satellites. The idea was tested with four experimental satellites: TIMATION I and II (in 1967 and 1969) and Navigation Technology Satellites (NTS) 1 and 2 (in 1974 and 1977). NTS-2 was the first satellite to transmit GPS signals.&lt;ref name="invent"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Easton was born in [[Craftsbury, Vermont]], to Dr. Frank B. Easton, a physician, and Della Donnocker, a school teacher. He graduated from [[Middlebury College]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=NIHF&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Easton|url=http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=410|work=Inductees|publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended the [[University of Michigan]] for 1 semester before joining the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Melanson|first=Donald|title=GPS pioneer Roger L.

Easton also worked in the laboratory's Rocket-Sonde Branch which was dealing with space related research.&lt;ref name="invent"/&gt;

Easton retired in 1980.&lt;ref name=NIHF/&gt; In 1986, Easton ran for Governor and served 3 terms on the Board of the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=President announces Roger Easton recipient of National Medal of Technology|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-11/nrl-par112205.php|publisher=National Research Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury Thermometer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]-in-glass [[thermometer]] showing an ambient temperature within the range of room temperature]]

Colloquially, '''room temperature''' is the range of air temperatures that most people prefer for indoor settings, which feel comfortable when wearing typical indoor clothing. As a medical definition, the range generally considered suitable for human occupancy is between 15 degrees [[Celsius]] (59 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]) and {{convert|25|C|F|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2016|title=Merriam Webster's Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/room%20temperature|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410144100/http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/room%20temperature|archivedate=2010-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though human comfort can extend beyond this range depending on humidity, air circulation and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/arizona-inside-home-temperatures-2683747 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044859/https://www.tripsavvy.com/arizona-inside-home-temperatures-2683747 |archivedate=2017-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain fields, like science and engineering, and within a particular context, room temperature can mean different agreed-on ranges. In contrast, '''ambient temperature''' is the actual temperature of the air in any particular place, as measured by a thermometer. It may be very different from usual room temperature, for example an unheated room in winter.

==Comfort levels==
{{main|Thermal comfort}}
''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' identifies room temperature as around {{convert|20|to|22|C}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|date=2014|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=room+temperature|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108000657/https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=room+temperature|archivedate=2015-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Oxford English Dictionary claims that it is "conventionally taken as about {{convert|20|C}}".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, November 2010), sub-entry at ''room''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to variations in humidity and likely clothing, recommendations for summer and winter may vary; a suggested typical range for summer is {{convert|23|to|25.5|C|0}}, with that for winter being {{convert|20|to|23.5|C|0}},&lt;ref name="airQuality"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBbHmp2yisEC&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;ots=yTqUP4xIOx&amp;dq=%2BASHRAE%20%2B%22recommended%20temperatures%22&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q=+ASHRAE%20+%22recommended%20temperatures%22&amp;f=false|pages=149–151|title=Managing Indoor Air Quality|publisher=Fairmont Press|year=2011|first1=H.

Some studies have suggested that thermal comfort preferences of men and women may differ significantly, with women on average preferring higher ambient temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beshir|first1=MY|last2=Ramsey|first2=JD |date=March 1981|title=Comparison between male and female subjective estimates of thermal effects and sensations|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003687081900910?via%3Dihub|journal=Applied Ergonomics|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=Aug 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karjalainen |first1=Sami |last2= |first2= |date=April 2007|title=Gender differences in thermal comfort and use of thermostats in everyday thermal environments|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132306000242|journal=Building and Environment|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=Aug 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kingma|first1=Boris|last2=van Marken Lichtenbelt |first2=Wouter|date=August 2015|title=Energy consumption in buildings and female thermal demand|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2741|journal=Nature Climate Change |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=Aug 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=August 2018}}

The [[World Health Organization]]'s standard for comfortable warmth is {{convert|18|C|F}} for normal, healthy adults who are appropriately dressed. For those with respiratory problems or allergies, they recommend no less than {{convert|16|C|F}}, and for the sick, disabled, very old or very young, a minimum of {{convert|20|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12606943|title=BBC News Magazine: How warm is your home|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231162144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12606943|archivedate=2017-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions in science and industry==
Temperature ranges are defined as ''room temperature'' for certain products and processes in industry, science, and consumer goods. For instance, for the shipping and storage of [[pharmaceuticals]], the [[United States Pharmacopeia]]-National Formulary (USP-NF) defines ''controlled room temperature'' as between {{convert|20|to|25|C}}, with excursions between {{convert|15|to|30|C}} allowed, provided the mean kinetic temperature does not exceed {{convert|25|C}}.&lt;ref name="USP 2017"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uspnf.com/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/revisions/659_rb_notice.pdf |title=General Chapter &lt; 659&gt; Packaging and Storage Requirements  |date=1 May 2017 |website=[[United States Pharmacopeia]] |access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Pharmacopoeia]] defines it as being simply {{convert|15|to|25|C}}, and the [[Japanese Pharmacopeia]] defines "ordinary temperature" as {{convert|15|to|25|C}}, with room temperature being {{convert|1|to|30|C}}.&lt;ref name="ECA 2017"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gmp-compliance.org/gmp-news/what-are-the-regulatory-definitions-for-ambient-room-temperature-and-cold-chain |title=What are the regulatory Definitions for "Ambient", "Room Temperature" and "Cold Chain"? |date=2 March 2017 |website=ECA Academy |access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chow2007a&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9XccGzr4wIC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22room+temperature%22+definition&amp;hl=en|title=Statistical Design and Analysis of Stability Studies|author=Shein-Chung Chow|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2007 |series=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]]/[[CRC Press|CRC]] [[Biostatistics]] Series|access-date=4 April 2018 |isbn=9781584889069|page=7|quote=1.2.3.3 Definition of Room Temperature: According to the ''United States Pharmacopeia National Forumlary (USP-NF)'', the definition of room temperature is between 15 and 30 °C in the United States.

==Serving temperature of red wine==
People traditionally serve red wine at room temperature. This practice dates from before central heating, when room temperature in wine-drinking countries was considerably lower than it is today, usually in the range between {{convert|15|C|F|0}} and {{convert|18|C|F|0}}. The advice is therefore to serve the wine at, at most, about {{convert|18|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wine Bible |author=Karen MacNeil |edition=revised second |page=130 |publisher=Workman Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-7611-8715-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10283">The '''Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology''' was convened by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 1997 to provide guidance to law enforcement agencies and others in the criminal justice system regarding the best practices for photography, videography, and video and image analysis. '''This group was terminated in 2015.'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swgit.org/farewellLetter SWGIT Farewell Letter, http://www.swgit.org/farewellLetter (accessed May 12, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As technology has advanced through the years, law enforcement has needed to stay abreast of emerging technological advances and use these in the investigation of crime. A factor that is considered when new technology is used in these investigations is the determination of whether the use of that new technology will be admissible in court. The judicial system in the United States currently has two standards used in the determination of admissibility of testimony regarding scientific evidence; the [[Scientific evidence (law)|Daubert Standard and the Frye Standard]]. These standards guide the courts in the admissibility of testimony derived from the use of new technologies and scientific techniques. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), seeking to address possible admissibility issues with such testimony, established [[Scientific Working Group]]s starting with the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis and Methods (SWGDAM) in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/july2000/swgroups.htm Forensic Science Communications, July 2000 Volume 2 Number 3].&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of these groups is to open lines of communication between law enforcement agencies and forensic laboratories around the world while providing guidance on the use of new and innovative technologies and techniques. This guidance can lead to admissibility of evidence and/or testimony, provided proper methods in the collection of evidence and its analysis are employed. In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences released a report entitled, "Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward." This report addresses many topics including challenges and disparities facing the forensic science community, standardization, certification of practitioners and accreditation of their respective entities, problems related to the interpretation of forensic evidence, the need for research, and the admission of forensic science evidence in litigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf National Research Council of the National Academies (2009), ''Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward'', ISBN 0-309-13131-6, Strengthening Oversight of Forensic Science Practice, Standards and Guidelines for Quality Control]&lt;/ref&gt;  This report mentions the Scientific Working Groups and their role in forensic science.

The [[history of photography|history of imaging technology (photography)]] can be said to extend back to the times of Chinese philosopher Mo-Ti (470-390 B.C.) who described the principles behind the precursor to the [[camera obscura]]. Since that time, advances in imaging technology include the discovery of chemical photographic processes in the 19th century and the use of electronic imaging technology that includes analog video cameras and digital video and still cameras. By the mid 1990s, it was apparent that technologically advanced camera systems such as these were being adopted for use in the criminal justice system. This led the FBI to convene a meeting of individuals working in the field of forensic imaging from federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement, and the U.S. military, during the summer of 1997. As a result of this meeting, the Technical Working Group on Imaging Technology was formed from a core group of the meeting’s participants. This group later became the Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology (SWGIT).
Prior to the inception of SWGIT, some law enforcement agencies began adopting digital imaging technology. Due to the lack of guidelines or standards, some of these agencies attempted to replace all their film cameras with substandard digital cameras, only to find that the equipment they had purchased was not capable of accomplishing the mission for which they were intended. At that time only low resolution digital cameras were deemed affordable by some law enforcement agencies. Some of these agencies were forced to rethink their photography procedures and reverted to the use of film cameras or replaced their low-resolution digital cameras with higher quality, more expensive equipment. Also lacking at this early stage was guidance on how to store and archive digital image files. When SWGIT was formed, it was tasked with providing guidance to law enforcement and others in the criminal justice system by releasing documents that describe the best practices and guidelines for the use of imaging technology, to include these concerns and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_digintegr.pdf Reis, George, Digital Image Integrity, 2006, Technical Papers, http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_digintegr.pdf (accessed June 8, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;  '''This group was terminated in 2015.'''

==SWGIT Function==
During its existence, SWGIT provided information on the appropriate use of various imaging technologies including both established and new. This was accomplished through the release of documents such as the [http://www.swgit.org SWGIT Best Practices documents].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swgit.org The Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology, Home Page, http://www.swgit.org (accessed June 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; As changes in technology occurred, these documents were updated. Over the course of its existence, SWGIT collaborated with other Scientific Working Groups to address imaging concerns within their respective disciplines. SWGIT published over 20 documents that dealt specifically with imaging technology. SWGIT also co-published documents with the [[Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence]] (SWGDE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swgde.org The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence, Home Page, http://www.swgde.org (accessed June 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; that had a component or components dealing with imaging technology. SWGIT also provided imaging technology guidance and input for documents from the Scientific Working Group on Friction Ridge Analysis, Study and Technology [http://www.swgfast.org (SWGFAST)],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swgfast.org The Scientific Working Group on Friction Ridge Analysis, Study and Technology, Home Page, http://www.swgfast.org (accessed June 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Scientific Working Group for Forensic Document Examination (SWGDOC)5, and the Scientific Working Group on Shoeprint and Tire Tread Evidence [http://www.swgtread.org (SWGTREAD)].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swgtread.org The Scientific Working Group for Shoeprint and Tire Tread Evidence, Home Page, http://www.swgtread.org (accessed June 10, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; SWGIT assisted the American Society of Crime Lab Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB) in the writing of definitions and standards for the accreditation of Digital and Multimedia Evidence sections of crime laboratories. 
In addition to releasing documents, SWGIT members disseminated best practices for law enforcement professionals where imaging technology was concerned. This was carried out by attending and lecturing at meetings and conferences of various forensic organizations that included:
*The American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS)
*The International Association for Identification (IAI)
*The Law Enforcement and Emergency Services Video Association (LEVA)
*The American Society of Crime Lab Directors (ASCLD)

The SWGIT membership consisted of approximately fifty scientists, photographers, instructors, and managers from more than two dozen federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as from the academic and research communities. The membership elected its officers from within.
SWGIT was composed of the Executive Committee, four standing subcommittees, and ad hoc subcommittees appointed on an as-needed basis. The standing subcommittees were: Image Analysis, Forensic Photography, Video, and Outreach.  '''This group was terminated in 2015.'''

==Legal Proceedings==
The following court cases have conducted Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) hearings in which SWGIT best practice documents have been cited as accepted protocol, methodology, and as generally accepted techniques in the forensic community:

*U. S. v. Rudy Frabizio, U.S. District Court, Boston, MA, 2008 (Image Authentication)
*U.S. v. Nobumochi Furukawa, U.S. District Court, Minnesota, 2007 (Video Authentication)
*U.S. v. John Stroman, U.S. District Court, South Carolina, 2007 (Facial Comparison Analysis)
*State of Texas v. Daniel Day, Tarrant County Texas, 2005 (Camera Identification to Images)
*U.S. v. Marc Watzman, U.S. District Court, Northern Illinois, 2004 (Video Authentication)
*U.S. v. McKreith, U.S. District Court, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 2002 (Photo comparison of shirt)

==Termination==
'''This group was unfunded by the FBI in 2015'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swgit.org/farewellLetter SWGIT Farewell Letter, http://www.swgit.org/farewellLetter (accessed May 12, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Totem and Ore''''' is a book written by [[B Wongar]] in 2006. It is an [[A4 (paper size)|A4]] coffee table format book which has a number of photos which show the effect of the [[List of nuclear tests#UK|British nuclear testing]] on the aboriginal people of Australia during the 1950s and 60s. There is also a foreword which talks about the devastation of nuclear weapons in Australia and recent conflicts.

==Summary==
The Australian Aborigines are the only people who have lived through a dual nuclear tragedy, the mining of uranium and the subsequent British nuclear testing, both of which took place on tribal land. The photographs of Totem and Ore collection tell what it was like to be at the forefront of the tragedy.

UniFirst was founded in 1936 by the Croatti family,&lt;ref name="Pasiuk2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie Pasiuk|title=Vault Guide to the Top Business Services Employers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcmwZuL-58QC&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=30 April 2006|publisher=Vault Inc.|isbn=978-1-58131-402-1|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name of National Overall Dry Cleaning Company.&lt;ref name="FundingUniverse"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of UniFirst Corporation|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/unifirst-corporation-history/|publisher=FundingUniverse|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began in a horse barn that had been converted into a makeshift laundry and its equipment consisted of a single washing machine and a delivery truck. It served Boston area factory workers and other laborers, whose heavy soiled work clothing needed to be cleaned frequently.&lt;ref name="FundingUniverse"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of UniFirst Corporation|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/unifirst-corporation-history/|publisher=FundingUniverse|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Overall Dry Cleaning Company was incorporated in Massachusetts on October 6, 1950.&lt;ref name="Service1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moody's Investors Service|title=Moody's industrial news reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cccgAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22incorporated+in+Massachusetts%22+unifirst|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=May 1984|publisher=Moody's Investors Service|page=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, UniFirst was sued by residents of Woburn, Massachusetts in a class-action lawsuit. The residents alleged that Unifirst, along with two other firms, had released pollution that had leaked into the water supply, and that this was a cause of increased instances of [[leukemia]] in the town. UniFirst settled with the residents without going to trial, for a sum of one million dollars.&lt;ref name="Marshall1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=E|title=Woburn case may spark explosion of lawsuits|journal=Science|volume=234|issue=4775|year=1986|pages=418–420|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.3764418}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode was featured in the non-fiction book ''A Civil Action'' by Jonathan Harr.&lt;ref name="Bergslien2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elisa Bergslien|title=An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuOHHh-eIFcC&amp;pg=PA438|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=15 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-6054-4|pages=437–438}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, UniFirst's enivronmental record has improved; it has received awards for its water treatment processes from the Missouri Water Environment Association and the Water and Wastewater Utility Special Service Division of Austin, Texas, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UniFirst Wins Awards for ‘Green’ Laundering Processes|url=http://www.americanlaundrynews.com/article/unifirst-wins-awards-%E2%80%98green%E2%80%99-laundering-processes|newspaper=American Laundry News|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12516">'''Unified Diagnostic Services''' (UDS) is a diagnostic [[communication protocol]] in the [[electronic control unit]] (ECU) environment within the automotive electronics, which is specified in the ISO 14229-1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/standard/55283.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from ISO 14230-3 ([[KWP2000]]) and ISO 15765-3 (Diagnostic Communication over [[Controller Area Network]] (DoCAN)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/standard/55284.html&lt;/ref&gt;). Unified in this context means that it is an international and not a company-specific standard. By now this communication protocol is used in almost all new ECUs made by Tier 1 suppliers of [[Original Equipment Manufacturer]] (OEM). These ECUs control a wide range of functions in vehicles including [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI), [[Engine control unit|engine control]], the transmission, anti-lock braking system, door locks, braking, and more.

The diagnostic tool contacts all control units installed in a vehicle, which have UDS services enabled. In contrary to the CAN protocol, which only uses the first and second layers of the [[OSI model]], UDS services utilize the fifth and seventh layers of the OSI model. The Service ID (SID) and the parameters associated with the services are contained in the 8 data bytes of a message frame issued from the diagnostic tool. 

Modern vehicles have a diagnostic interface for off-board diagnostics, which makes it possible to connect a computer (client) or diagnostics tool, which is referred to as tester, to the bus system of the vehicle. Thus, the messages defined in UDS can be sent to the controllers which must provide the predetermined UDS services. This makes it possible to [[Interrogation|interrogate]] the fault memory of the individual control units or to update them with a new firmware.

== Services ==

SID (Service Identifier)
{| Class = "wikitable sortable"
|-
! Function group !! Request &amp;nbsp; SID !! Response &amp;nbsp; SID !! Service !! Description
|-
| Rowspan = 10 | Diagnostic and Communications Management
| Style = "text-align: center" | $10
| Style = "text-align: center" | $50
| Diagnostic Session Control
| UDS uses different operating sessions, which can be changed using the "Diagnostic Session Control". Depending on which session is active, different services are available. On start, the control unit is by default in the "Default Session". Other sessions are defined, but are not required to be implemented depending on the type of device:

* "Programming Session" used to upload software.
* "Extended Diagnostic Session" used to unlock additional diagnostic functions, such as the adjustment of sensors.
* "Safety system diagnostic session" used to test all safety-critical diagnostic functions, such as airbag tests.

In addition, there are reserved session identifiers that can be defined for vehicle manufacturers and vehicle suppliers specific use.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $11
| Style = "text-align: center" | $51
| ECU Reset
| The service "ECU reset" is used to restart the control unit (ECU). Depending on the control unit hardware and implementation, different forms of reset can be used:

* "Hard Reset" simulates a shutdown of the power supply.
* "key off on Reset" simulates the drain and turn on the ignition with the key.
* "Soft Reset" allows initialization of certain program units and their storage structures.

Again, there are reserved values that can be defined for vehicle manufacturers and vehicle suppliers specific use.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $27
| Style = "text-align: center" | $67
| Security Access
| Security check is available to enable the most security-critical services. For this purpose a "Seed" is generated and sent to the client by the control unit. From this "Seed" the client has to compute a "Key" and send it back to the control unit to unlock the security-critical services.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $28
| Style = "text-align: center" | $68
| Communication Control
| With this service, both the sending and receiving of messages can be turned off in the control unit.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $3E
| Style = "text-align: center" | $7E
| Tester Present
| If no communication is exchanged with the client for a long time, the control unit automatically exits the current session and returns to the "Default Session" back, and might go to sleep mode. Therefore, there is an extra service which purpose is to signal to the device that the client is still present.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $83
| Style = "text-align: center" | $C3
| Access Timing Parameters
| In the communication between the controllers and the client certain times must be observed. If these are exceeded, without a message being sent, it must be assumed that the connection was interrupted. These times can be called up and changed.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $84
| Style = "text-align: center" | $C4
| Secured Data Transmission
|
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $85
| Style = "text-align: center" | $C5
| Control DTC Settings
| Enable or disable the detection of any or all errors. This is important when diagnostic work is performed in the car, which can cause an anomalous behavior of individual devices.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $86
| Style = "text-align: center" | $C6
| Response On Event
|
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $87
| Style = "text-align: center" | $C7
| Link Control
| The Service Link Control is used to set the baud rate of the diagnostic access. It is usually implemented only at the central gateway.
|-
| Rowspan = 7 | Data Transmission
| Style = "text-align: center" | $22
| Style = "text-align: center" | $62
| Read Data By Identifier
| With this service it is possible to retrieve one or more values of a control unit. This can be information of all kinds and of different lengths such as Partnumber or the software version. Dynamic values such as the current state of the sensor can be queried. Each value is associated to a Data Identifier (DID) between 0 and 65535. Normal CAN signals are meant for information that some ECU uses in its functionality. DID data is sent on request only, and is for information that no ECU uses, but a service tool or a software tester can benefit from.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $23
| Style = "text-align: center" | $63
| Read Memory By Address
| Read data from the physical memory at the provided address. This function can be used by a testing tool, in order to read the internal behaviour of the software.
|
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $24
| Style = "text-align: center" | $64
| Read Scaling Data By Identifier
|
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $2A
| Style = "text-align: center" | $6A
| Read Data By Identifier Periodic
| With this service values are sent periodically by a control unit. The values to be sent must be defined to only using the "Dynamically Define Data Identifier".
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $2C
| Style = "text-align: center" | $6C
| Dynamically Define Data Identifier
| This service offers the possibility of a fix for a device specified Data Identifier (DID) pool to configure another Data Identifier. This is usually a combination of parts of different DIDs or simply a concatenation of complete DIDs.

The requested data may be configured or grouped in the following manner:

* Source DID, position, length (in bytes), Sub-Function Byte: defineByIdentifier
* Memory address length (in bytes), Sub-Function Byte: defineByMemoryAddress
* Combinations of the two above methods through multiple requests.

|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $2E
| Style = "text-align: center" | $6E
| Write Data By Identifier
| With the same Data Identifier (DID), values can also be changed. In addition to the identifier, the new value is sent along.
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $3D
| Style = "text-align: center" | $7D
| Write Memory By Address
|
|-
| Rowspan = 2 | Stored Data Transmission
| Style = "text-align: center" | $14
| Style = "text-align: center" | $54
| Clear Diagnostic Information
| Delete all stored DTC
|-
| Style = "text-align: center" | $19
| Style = "text-align: center" | $59
| Read DTC Information
| DTC stands for "[[Diagnostic Trouble Code]]s". Each DTC handled by the control unit fault is stored with its own code in the error memory and can be read at any time. In addition to the error, additional information will be stored, which can also be read.
|-
| Input / Output Control
| Style = "text-align: center" | $2F
| Style = "text-align: center" | $6F
| Input Output Control By Identifier
| This service allows an external system intervention on internal / external signals via the diagnostic interface.

By specifying a so-called option bytes additional conditions for a request can be specified, the following values are specified:

''ReturnControlToECU'': The device must get back controls of the mentioned signals.

''ResetToDefault'': The tester prompts to reset signals to the system wide default value.

| Routine Control
| The Control service routine services of all kinds can be performed. There are three different message types:
* With the start-message, a service can be initiated. It can be defined to confirm the beginning of the execution or to notify when the service is completed.
* With the Stop message, a running service can be interrupted at any time.
* The third option is a message to query the results of the service.
The start and stop message parameters can be specified. This makes it possible to implement every possible project-specific service.

| Request Download
| Downloading new software or other data into the control unit is introduced using the "Request Download". Here, the location and size of the data is specified. In turn, the controller specifies how large the data packets can be.

| Request Upload
| The service "request upload" is almost identical to the service "Request Download". With this service, the software from the control unit is transferred to the tester. The location and size must be specified. Again, the size of the data blocks are specified by the tester.

| Transfer Data
| For the actual transmission of data, the service "Transfer Data" is used. This service is used for both uploading and downloading data. The transfer direction is notified in advance by the service "Request Download" or "Upload Request". This service should try to send packets at maximum length, as specified in previous services. If the data set is larger than the maximum, the "Transfer Data" service must be used several times in succession until all data has arrived.

| Style = "text-align: center" | $77
| Request Transfer Exit
| A data transmission can be 'completed' when using the "Transfer Exit" service. This service is used for comparison between the control unit and the tester. When it is running, a control unit can answer negatively on this request to stop a data transfer request. This will be used when the amount of data (set in "Request Download" or "Upload Request") has not been transferred.

| Request File Transfer
| This service is used to initiate a file download from the client to the server or upload from the server to the client. Additionally information about the file system are available by this service.
