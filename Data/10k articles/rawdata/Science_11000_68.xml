'''''A Letter to a Friend''''' (written 1656; published posthumously in 1690), by Sir [[Thomas Browne]], the 17th century [[philosopher]] and [[physician]], is a medical treatise of case-histories and witty speculations upon the [[human condition]].

It is believed to be the source of a term Mary Leitao found in 2001 to describe her son's skin condition. She chose the name "[[Morgellons]] disease" from a skin condition described by Browne in ''Letter to a Friend'', thus:

:''"...&amp;nbsp;that endemial distemper of children in Languedoc, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Major Works of Sir Thomas Browne", edited and with an Introduction by C.&amp;nbsp;A. Partides. Penguin 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, no suggestion that the symptoms described by Browne are linked to the alleged modern cases of Morgellons.

The '''[[Alan T. Waterman]] Award''' is the United States's highest honorary award for scientists no older than 40, or no more than 10 years past receipt of their Ph.D. It is awarded on a yearly basis by the [[National Science Foundation]].  In addition to the medal, the awardee receives a grant of $1,000,000 to be used at the institution of their choice over a period of five years for advanced scientific research. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Alan_T._Waterman_Award.jpg|frame|Alan T. Waterman Award]] --&gt;

==History of the Award==

Congress established the annual award in August 1975 to mark the 25th Anniversary of the National Science Foundation and to honor its first Director, Alan T. Waterman.  The annual award recognizes an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported by the National Science Foundation. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/waterman/waterman.jsp Waterman Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility and nomination process==

Candidates must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Prior to the 2018 competition, candidates must have been 35 years of age or younger or not more than 7 years beyond receipt of the Ph.D. degree by December 31 of the year in which they are nominated. As of the 2018 competition, these requirements were changed to 40 years of age or 10 years post-PhD. Candidates should have demonstrated exceptional individual achievements in scientific or engineering research of sufficient quality to place them at the forefront of their peers. Criteria include originality, innovation, and significant impact on the field.  Potential candidates must be nominated and require four letters of reference, but none can be submitted from the nominee’s home institution.  Solicitation announcements are sent to universities and colleges, scientific, engineering and other professional societies and organizations, members of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Academy of Engineering]].

==Award process and committee composition==

Candidates are reviewed by the Alan T. Waterman Award committee, which is made up of 12 members, 8 rotators and 4 members ''ex officio''.  The current ''ex officio'' members are [[Ralph Cicerone]], President of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], [[Subra Suresh]], Director of the [[National Science Foundation]], [[Steven C. Beering]], Chairman of the [[National Science Board]], and [[Charles M. Vest]], President of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].  After review of the nominees, the Committee recommends the most outstanding candidate(s) to the Director of the National Science Foundation and the [[National Science Board]], which then makes the final determination.

Such anomalies could be already ruled out from existing data on cosmic rays, thus contradicting the OPERA results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giudice|first1=G.

While at CERN in June 2018, Strumia and [[Riccardo Torre]] worked on a new set of algorithms with which to evaluate the impact of published scientific research. Basing their investigation on [[PageRank]] used by [[Google]], they proposed a similar system of ranking scientific papers and authors. Researchers had "mixed reaction", suggesting that it would be useful for "lifetime achievement" but possibly subject to "transparency issues".&lt;ref name=PhysicsToday&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/pt.6.1.20180607a|title=New metrics rank physicists and their work|journal=[[Physics Today]]|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "simplicity" of current methods of evaluation allows for [[gaming the system]]. The difference in Strumia and Torres' approach is that they include what they describe as "second-generation" and later-generation citations in their algorithms. Therefore, not only the original citations of the work are taken into account, but subsequent citations to derivative material also. They named their systems ''PaperRank'' and ''AuthorRank''. They also proposed a system called ''CitationCoin'' to reduce the effect of groups who "inflate" each other citation count.&lt;ref name=PhysicsToday/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Amen Clinics uses [[SPECT]] scans to measure blood flow and activity patterns in the brain.&lt;ref name="NN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="controversial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9836429/Dr-Daniel-Amen-interview-the-shrink-who-believes-technology-will-replace-the-couch.html|title=Dr Daniel Amen interview: the shrink who believes technology will replace the couch|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sanjiv|date=6 February 2013|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also uses diagnostics such as questionnaires, clinical histories, and clinical interviews.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;  Amen Clinics claims that SPECT scans enable doctors to tailor treatment to individual patients' brains.

The '''Archon Genomics X PRIZE presented by Express Scripts''' for [[Genomics]], the second [[X Prize]] offered by the [[X Prize Foundation]], based in [[Playa Vista]], [[California]], was announced on October 4, 2006 stating that the prize of "$10 million will be awarded to the first team to rapidly, accurately and economically sequence 100 whole human genomes to an unprecedented level of accuracy."&lt;ref name="xprize"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Archon Genomics XPRIZE presented by Express Scripts -- Overview | url=http://genomics.xprize.org/competition-details/prize-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30 day evaluation phase of the competition to begin on September 5, 2013, was canceled August 22, 2013 and this cancellation was debated on March 27, 2014.&lt;ref name="debate" /&gt;

==Goals and History==

In November 2011 the prize goals were stated as: "The $10 million grand prize will be awarded to the  team(s) able to sequence 100 human genomes  within 30 days to an accuracy of 1 error per  1,000,000 bases, with 98% completeness,  identification of insertions, deletions and  rearrangements, and a complete haplotype, at an audited total cost of $1,000 per genome."&lt;ref name="pmid22030612" /&gt;

The $10 million was donated by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[geologist]] and philanthropist [[Stewart Blusson]], who co-discovered the [[Ekati Diamond Mine]]. The name "Archon" is the name of Blusson's company, which refers to the type of [[lithosphere]] beneath northern Canada. Upon cancellation, the money was returned to the Blussons because no Master Team Agreements were in place.

The Archon X Prize in genomics began as a joint effort of the X Prize Foundation and the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation.&lt;ref name="pmid22030612"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The J. Craig Venter Science Foundation offered the $500,000 (US) Innovation in Genomics Science and Technology Prize in September 2003 aimed at stimulating development of less expensive and faster sequencing technology. To attract even more resources to this goal, Dr. Venter joined forces with the X Prize Foundation, wrapping his competition and prize purse into a later incarnation, The Archon Genomics X Prize presented by Express Scripts.

==Test genomes==
The 100 human genomes to be sequenced in this competition were donated by 100 centenarians (ages 100 or older) from all over the world, known as the 100 Over 100. Sequencing the genomes of the 100 Over 100 presented an unprecedented opportunity to identify those "rare genes" that protect against diseases, while giving researchers valuable clues to health and longevity. These centenarians’ genes would provide us with a window to the past, significantly impacting the future of healthcare. Although the contest is cancelled, the X PRIZE foundation collected blood samples and created cell-lines to preserve the DNA from more than 100 centenarians. Those genomes are expected to be sequenced nonetheless and put into an open data forum.

==Teams==
The only two pre-registered teams were [[Ion Torrent]] in Guilford, CT and [[Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering]] in Boston MA.  These teams were announced 23-Jul-2012 and 3-Oct-2012.&lt;ref name="debate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://genomics.xprize.org/teams | title=Archon Genomics X PRIZE Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The result was going to be the world's first "medical grade” genome, a critically needed clinical standard that would transform genomic research into usable medical information to improve patient diagnosis and treatment. This global competition was expected to inspire breakthrough genome sequencing innovations and technologies that would usher in a new era of personalized medicine.

The evaluation phase of the competition was officially set to begin on September 5, 2013, and conclude 30 days later on October 5, but was canceled August 22, 2013 because it was "outpaced by innovation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Outpaced by Innovation: Canceling an XPRIZE| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-diamandis/outpaced-by-innovation-ca_b_3795710.html | author=P Diamandis | publisher=Huffington Post | date=August 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A public debate concerning the validity and potential implications of the cancellation was published March 27, 2014.&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://genomics.xprize.org/blog/2014/03/27/cancellation-archon-genomics-xprize-public-debate  | title= Cancellation of the Archon Genomics XPRIZE: A Public Debate | date=27 Mar 2014 | author=  P Diamandis | author2=  G Church | last-author-amp=  yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of [[arthropods]] (insects, arachnids and others) regularly or occasionally bite or sting human beings. Insect saliva contains [[anticoagulant]]s and enzymes that cause local irritation and [[allergic reaction]]s.&lt;ref name = Atkins&gt;{{cite book |title=Insects in Perspective  |last=Atkins |first=Michael D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=978-0-02-304500-4 |page=359 |url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insect venom]]s can be delivered by their stingers, which often are modified [[ovipositor]]s, or by their mouthparts. Insect, spider and scorpion venom can cause serious injury or death. [[Dipterans]] account for the majority of [[insect bites]], while [[Hymenoptera|hymenopterans]] account for the majority of stings. Among arachnids [[spider bites]] and [[Acariasis|mite bites]] are the most common. Arthropods bite or sting humans for a number of reasons including feeding or defense. Arthropods are major [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s of human disease, with the pathogens typically transmitted by bites.

'''Carl Erik Alexander Bovallius''' (or '''Bowallius''') (31 July 1849 – 8 November 1907) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] biologist and archaeologist.&lt;ref name=ne/&gt;&lt;ref name=NF/&gt;
 
==Life==
Bovallius became a student in Uppsala in 1868, and received a Ph.D. in 1875. Bovallius undertook, for scientific purposes, travel along the Swedish and [[Norway|Norwegian]] coasts.

In 1881-83, he made zoological and ethnographic studies in [[Latin America]], to where he returned in the late 1890s.

Starting in 1881, Carl Bovallius explored Central America, and especially [[Nicaragua]], in search of ancient sites. He studied places like [[Ometepe (archaeological site)|Ometepe]], and [[Zapatera (archaeological site)|Zapatera]], and also researched the ethnography of local tribes.

A species of snake, ''[[Rhinobothryum bovallii]]'', is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Bovall", p. 36).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Channel stuffing''' is a business practice in which a company, or a sales force within a company, inflates its sales figures by forcing more products through a [[distribution channel]] than the channel is capable of selling.&lt;ref name="Markham2006"&gt;{{cite book
 |author=Jerry W. Markham |author-link=Jerry Markham |title=A Financial History of Modern U.S. Corporate Scandals: From Enron to Reform |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7qTGiF8FCgC&amp;pg=PA218 |year=2006 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |isbn=978-0-7656-1583-1 |pages=218–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as '''trade loading''', this can be the result of a company attempting to inflate its sales figures.  Alternatively, it can be a consequence of a poorly managed sales force attempting to meet short term objectives and quotas in a way that is detrimental to a company in the long term.

Channel stuffing has a number of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a carrying cost and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with this excess inventory, leads to costly overtimes and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as sales works to make up for prior [[overselling]]. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish [[gray market]] channels as salesmen no longer adequately qualify their prospects. 

Occasionally, distribution channels such as large retailers have been known to identify the practice of channel stuffing in their suppliers, and use the phenomenon to their advantage. This is done by holding back on orders until the end of the suppliers' quota period. The supplier's sales force then panics, and sells a large amount of the product under more favorable terms than they would under ordinary circumstances. At the beginning of the next period, no new orders are placed, and, barring any action, the cycle is then repeated. This affects customers, with gluts and shortages as buyers turn to competing products. 

Corporations have been known to engage in channel stuffing and hide such activities from their investors. In the United States, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] has in some cases litigated against such corporations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

{{about||file sharing software|Comparison of file sharing applications|file synchronization software|Comparison of file synchronization software}}

This article lists [[communication protocol]]s that are designed for [[file transfer]] over a [[telecommunications network]].

Protocols for [[shared resource|shared]] [[file system]]s—such as [[9P (protocol)|9P]] and the [[Network File System]]—are beyond the scope of this article, as are [[file synchronization]] protocols.

==Protocols for packet-switched networks==

A [[packet-switched]] network [[Data transmission|transmits data]] that is divided into units called ''[[Network packet|packets]]''. A packet comprises a [[Header (computing)|header]] (which describes the packet) and a [[Payload (computing)|payload]] (the data). The [[Internet]] is a packet-switched network, and most of the protocols in this list are designed for its [[protocol stack]], the [[IP protocol suite]].

They use one of two [[transport layer]] protocols: the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) or the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). In the tables below, the "Transport" column indicates which [[Communications protocols|protocol]](s) the transfer protocol uses at the transport layer. Some protocols designed to transmit data over UDP also use a TCP port for oversight.

The "[[Port (computer networking)|Server port]]" column indicates the port from which the server transmits data. In the case of [[FTP]], this port differs from the listening port. Some protocols—including FTP, [[FTP Secure]], [[FASP]], and [[Tsunami UDP Protocol|Tsunami]]—listen on a "control port" or "command port", at which they receive commands from the client.

Similarly, the encryption scheme indicated in the "Encryption" column applies to transmitted data only, and not to the [[authentication]] system.

===Features===
The "Managed" column indicates whether the protocol is designed for [[managed file transfer]] (MFT). MFT protocols prioritise [[secure transmission]] in industrial applications that require such features as auditable transaction records, monitoring, and [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end]] [[data security]]. Such protocols may be preferred for [[electronic data interchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jscape.com/blog/oftp-odette-file-transfer-protocol |title=Managed File Transfer and Network Solutions |last=Villanueva |first=John Carl |date=17 February 2015 |website=JSCAPE.com |publisher=JSCAPE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the table below, the ''data port'' is the [[network port]] or range of ports through which the protocol transmits file data. The ''control port'' is the port used for the dialogue of commands and status updates between client and server.

The column "Assigned by IANA" indicates whether the port is listed in the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry, which is curated by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA). IANA devotes each port number in the registry to a specific service with a specific [[transport protocol]]. The table below lists the transport protocol in the "Transport" column.

==Serial protocols==
[[File:RS-232-Cable-9-25.jpg|thumb|160px|A 9-pin to 25-pin [[RS-232]] adapter cable]]

The following protocols were designed for [[serial communication]], mostly for the [[RS-232]] standard. They are used for [[upload]]ing and [[download]]ing [[computer file]]s via [[modem]] or [[serial cable]] (e.g., by [[null modem]] or [[direct cable connection]]). [[UUCP]] is one protocol that can operate with either RS-232 or the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] as its transport. [[OBject EXchange]] is a protocol for [[binary object]] wireless transfer via the [[Bluetooth]] standard. Bluetooth was conceived as a wireless replacement for RS-232.

[[Image:ArmyDARWARS.jpg|thumb|DARWARS Ambush]]
'''DARWARS''' is a research program intended to accelerate the development and deployment of military training systems. These are envisioned as low-cost, mobile, web-centric, simulation-based, “lightweight” systems designed to take advantage of the ubiquitous presence of the PC and of new technology, including multi-player games, virtual worlds, off-the-shelf PC simulations, intelligent agents, and on-line communities.  The project started in 2003.

The program is producing an architectural framework, including a set of web services, tools, and system interface definitions that facilitate the development of networked training systems. The scalable framework supports training for individuals, teams, or teams of teams (involving students at PCs interacting on a [[virtual battlefield]]). Training systems keep track of student performance in order to offer individual and group feedback. The program envisions an on-line community of students, instructors and developers around the DARWARS family of training systems, although, realistically the creators only hoped to get this kind of training started - not see it to that complete end.

==Sponsorship==

DARWARS is sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) and is co-sponsored by U.S. Joint Forces Command ([[United States Joint Forces Command|JFCOM]]) and the United States Marine Corps Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS). The integration and architecture contractor for the DARWARS project is [[BBN Technologies]]. The program is the core DARPA's Training Superiority initiative.

==Exemplar trainers==

As part of the DARWARS program, several training systems have been developed as exemplars of what is possible. Some of these systems have been deployed to meet training needs related to current U.S. military efforts. Among these is the DARWARS Ambush! tactical trainer and the language trainer Tactical IraqiTM.

===''DARWARS Ambush!''===
''DARWARS Ambush!'' is a PC-based, networked, multiplayer training simulator, or, [[serious game]]. It provides military training based on experiences of personnel in the field, and includes capabilities to ensure the capture and dissemination of lessons learned. The initial application involved road-convoy-operations training, while subsequent applications include training for platoon level mounted infantry tactics, dismounted infantry operations, Rules-of-Engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, and other areas. The software was developed by [[Total Immersion Software]], based on the technology of ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis|Operation Flashpoint]]''.

''DARWARS Ambush!'' is generally restricted to U.S. Military and U.S. Government organizations and personnel.  The ''DARWARS Ambush!'' software is free of charge. The costs of the underlying [[game engine]] and networking infrastructure is nominal compared to traditional simulation-training systems.
The most important innovation of DARWARS Ambush! is that it is user-authorable. Soldiers themselves can create new scenarios and training in a few hours or days without a contractor between them and their tactics, techniques and procedures.

===''Tactical Language &amp; Culture Training System''===
[[Tactical Language &amp; Culture Training System]]s are PC-based courses that teach foreign languages and cultural knowledge needed to conduct tasks effectively and safely during both daily life and military missions. They are self-paced foreign-language training programs that use numerous research-based pedagogic and technologic innovations—including interactive 3D video game simulations—to teach what to say, how to say it, and when to say it. The courses to learn Iraqi, Pashto, French, and Dari {under development} are available to any member of the U.S. Armed Forces by free download from the company's website.

==Replacement==
[[Game After Ambush]], which is based on [[VBS2]] is scheduled to replace DARWARS Ambush! during 2009.

{{unsourced|article|date=March 2017}}
'''Embodied embedded cognition''' ('''EEC''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theoretical position in [[cognitive science]], closely related to [[situated cognition]], [[embodied cognition]], [[embodied cognitive science]] and [[dynamical systems theory]]. The theory states that intelligent [[behaviour]] emerges from the interplay between [[brain]], body and world&lt;ref name=EEE1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/|title=Embodied Cognition |date=25 July  2011|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The world is not just the 'play-ground' on which the brain is acting. Rather, brain, body and world are equally important factors in the explanation of how particular intelligent behaviours come about in practice. There are concerns about whether EEC constitutes a novel and substantive approach to cognition or whether it is merely a manifestation of frustration with the classical [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] approach{{Citation needed|reason=Who has concerns? Any source?|date=June 2018}}.

==Embodiment and embeddedness==

EEC is divided into two aspects: embodiment and embeddedness (or situatedness).

''Embodiment'' refers to the idea that the body's internal milieu (a.o. [[homeostatic]] and hormonal states)  heavily influences the higher 'cognitive' processes in the brain, presumably via the [[emotion]]al system (see e.g. [[Antonio Damasio]]'s theory of [[Somatic markers hypothesis|somatic markers]]). To put it simply: the state of your body is a direct factor of importance on the kinds of [[cognitive process]]es that may arise in the higher parts of your brain.

''Embeddedness'' refers to the idea that physical interaction between the body and the world strongly constrain the possible behaviours of the organism, which in turn influences (indeed, partly constitutes) the cognitive processes that emerge from the interaction between organism and world.

The theory is an explicit reaction to the currently dominant [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] paradigm, which states that cognitive systems are essentially computational-representational systems (like computer [[software]]), processing input and generating output (behaviour) on the basis of internal information processing. In cognitivism, the causal root of behaviour lies in the 'virtual' processes governed by the software that runs on our brains. The brain is purely the [[computer hardware|hardware]] on which the software is implemented. The body (sensors and actors) are purely input-output devices that are in service of the brain. The world is merely the play-ground (the object) in which the cognitive agent acts.

In contrast, EEC holds that the actual physical processes in body and in body-world interaction partly constitute whatever it is that we call 'the cognitive system' as a whole. Body, world and brain form a system. Together these system-parts 'cause' intelligent behaviour to arise as a system property. [[Dynamical Systems|Dynamical Systems Theory]] is a way of modeling behaviour that teams up quite naturally with the theoretical concepts of EEC.

Current discussions include:
* Is EEC really a (positive) theory of itself, or merely a bunch of complaints about what is wrong about (a too extreme version of) cognitivism? 
* Is EEC too 'descriptive', instead of really explaining anything about cognition?
* How can EEC explain [[natural language|linguistic]] processes and processes of explicit conscious [[reasoning]]?
* What would be the most informative empirical hypotheses, starting from an EEC perspective?
* Can we use traditional methods (stimulus-response paradigms) of [[experimental psychology]] to test EEC hypotheses?

==Theorists==

Theorists that inspired the EEC programme (but might not necessarily adhere to the above position) include:

Flow cytometry bioinformatics requires extensive use of and contributes to the development of techniques from [[computational statistics]] and [[machine learning]].
Flow cytometry and related methods allow the quantification of multiple independent [[Biomarker (cell)|biomarkers]] on large numbers of single [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data, particularly in the 2000s, has led to the creation of a variety of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public databases for the sharing of results.

Computational methods exist to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data, identifying cell populations within it, matching those cell populations across samples, and performing diagnosis and discovery using the results of previous steps. For preprocessing, this includes compensating for spectral overlap, [[Data transformation (statistics)|transforming]] data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis, assessing data for quality, and [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] data across samples and experiments.
For population identification, tools are available to aid traditional manual identification of populations in two-dimensional [[scatter plot]]s (gating), to use [[dimensionality reduction]] to aid gating, and to find populations automatically in higher-dimensional space in a variety of ways.
It is also possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways, such as the density-guided [[binary space partitioning]] technique known as probability binning, or by combinatorial gating.
Finally, diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by [[supervised learning]] techniques, and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned methods.

[[Open standard]]s, [[Open data|data]] and [[Open-source software|software]] are also key parts of flow cytometry bioinformatics.
Data standards include the widely adopted Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) defining how data from cytometers should be stored, but also several new standards under development by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) to aid in storing more detailed information about experimental design and analytical steps.
Open data is slowly growing with the opening of the CytoBank database in 2010, and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely distribute their data, and the latter of which has been recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant data by ISAC.
Open software is most widely available in the form of a suite of [[Bioconductor]] packages, but is also available for web execution on the [[GenePattern]] platform.

[[File:Cytometer.svg|thumb|400px|Schematic diagram of a flow cytometer, showing focusing of the fluid sheath, laser, optics (in simplified form, omitting focusing), photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), analogue-to-digital converter, and analysis workstation]]

Flow cytometers operate by [[Hydrodynamic focusing|hydrodynamically focusing]] suspended cells so that they separate from each other within a fluid stream.
The stream is interrogated by one or more lasers, and the resulting [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] and [[Light scattering|scattered]] light is detected by [[photomultiplier]]s.
By using [[Filter (optics)|optical filters]], particular [[fluorophore]]s on or within the cells can be quantified by peaks in their [[Emission spectrum|emission spectra]].
These may be [[Autofluorescence|endogenous fluorophores]] such as [[chlorophyll]] or [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] [[green fluorescent protein]], or they may be artificial fluorophores [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to detection molecules such as [[antibody|antibodies]] for detecting [[protein]]s, or [[hybridization probe]]s for detecting [[DNA]] or [[RNA]].

The ability to quantify these has led to flow cytometry being used in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

Until the early 2000s, flow cytometry could only measure a few fluorescent markers at a time.
Through the late 1990s into the mid-2000s, however, rapid development of new fluorophores resulted in modern instruments capable of quantifying up to 18 markers per cell.&lt;ref name="pmid19137647"&gt;{{Cite journal

The rapid increase in the dimensionality of flow cytometry data, coupled with the development of high-throughput robotic platforms capable of assaying hundreds to thousands of samples automatically have created a need for improved computational analysis methods.&lt;ref name="pmid19137647"/&gt;

==Data==
[[File:Fcsmatrix.svg|thumb|400px|left|Representation of flow cytometry data from an instrument with three scatter channels and 13 fluorescent channels. Only the values for the first 30 (of hundreds of thousands) of cells are shown.]]

Flow cytometry data is in the form of a large matrix of intensities over M wavelengths by N events.  Most events will be a particular cell, although some may be doublets (pairs of cells which pass the laser closely together).  For each event, the measured fluorescence intensity over a particular wavelength range is recorded.

The measured fluorescence intensity indicates the amount of that fluorophore in the cell, which indicates the amount that has bound to detector molecules such as antibodies.  Therefore, fluorescence intensity can be considered a proxy for the amount of detector molecules present on the cell. A simplified, if not strictly accurate, way of considering flow cytometry data is as a matrix of M measurements of amounts of molecules of interest by N cells.

==Steps in computational flow cytometry data analysis==
[[File:AutomatedFlowPipeline.svg|thumb|400px|right|An example pipeline for analysis of FCM data and some of the Bioconductor packages relevant to each step.]]
The process of moving from primary FCM data to disease diagnosis and biomarker discovery involves four major steps:

# Data pre-processing (including compensation, transformation and normalization)
# Cell population identification (a.k.a. gating) 
# Cell population matching for cross sample comparison 
# Relating cell populations to external variables (diagnosis and discovery)

Saving of the steps taken in a particular flow cytometry [[workflow]] is supported by some flow cytometry software, and is important for the reproducibility of flow cytometry experiments.
However, saved workspace files are rarely interchangeable between software.&lt;ref name=GatingML&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spidlen | first1 = J. | last2 = Leif | first2 = R.

An attempt to solve this problem is the development of the Gating-ML [[XML]]-based data standard (discussed in more detail under the standards section), which is slowly being adopted in both commercial and open source flow cytometry software.&lt;ref name="GatingML2"&gt;{{Cite report|title=Gating-ML 2.0|publisher=International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry |date=2013| url=http://flowcyt.sourceforge.net/gating/latest.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CytoML R package is also filling the gap by importing/exporting the Gating-ML that is compatible with FlowJo, CytoBank and FACS Diva softwares.

==Data pre-processing==
Prior to analysis, flow cytometry data must typically undergo pre-processing to remove artifacts and poor quality data, and to be transformed onto an optimal scale for identifying cell populations of interest. Below are various steps in a typical flow cytometry preprocessing pipeline.

===Compensation===
When more than one fluorochrome is used with the same laser, their [[emission spectrum|emission spectra]] frequently overlap. Each particular fluorochrome is typically measured using a bandpass optical filter set to a narrow band at or near the fluorochrome's emission intensity peak.
The result is that the reading for any given fluorochrome is actually the sum of that fluorochrome's peak emission intensity, and the intensity of all other fluorochromes' spectra where they overlap with that frequency band.
This overlap is termed spillover, and the process of removing spillover from flow cytometry data is called compensation.&lt;ref name="pmid18770762"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensation is typically accomplished by running a series of representative samples each stained for only one fluorochrome, to give measurements of the contribution of each fluorochrome to each channel.&lt;ref name="pmid18770762"/&gt;
The total signal to remove from each channel can be computed by solving a system of [[linear equation]]s based on this data to produce a spillover matrix, which when [[Invertible matrix|inverted]] and multiplied with the raw data from the cytometer produces the compensated data.&lt;ref name="pmid18770762"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8494206"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Transformation===
Cell populations detected by flow cytometry are often described as having approximately [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]] expression.&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Shapiro | first1 = Howard M. | title = Practical flow cytometry | year = 2003 | publisher = Wiley-Liss | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-471-41125-3 | pages = 235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As such, they have traditionally been [[Data transformation (statistics)|transformed]] to a [[logarithmic scale]].
In early cytometers, this was often accomplished even before data acquisition by use of a [[log amplifier]].
On modern instruments, data is usually stored in linear form, and transformed digitally prior to analysis.

However, compensated flow cytometry data frequently contains negative values due to compensation, and cell populations do occur which have low means and normal distributions.&lt;ref name=logicle&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Parks DR, Roederer M, Moore WA | title=A new "Logicle" display method avoids deceptive effects of logarithmic scaling for low signals and compensated data | journal=Cytometry Part A | year= 2006 | volume= 69 | issue= 6 | pages= 541–51 | pmid=16604519| doi=10.1002/cyto.a.20258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison of commonly used transformations concluded that the biexponential and Box-Cox transformations, when optimally parameterized, provided the clearest visualization and least variance of cell populations across samples.&lt;ref name=flowTrans/&gt; However, a later comparison of the flowTrans package used in that comparison indicated that it did not parameterize the Logicle transformation in a manner consistent with other implementations, potentially calling those results into question.&lt;ref name="pmid22431383"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality control===
Particularly in newer, high-throughput experiments, there is a need for [[Information visualization|visualization]] methods to help detect technical errors in individual samples.
One approach is to visualize summary statistics, such as the [[empirical distribution function]]s of single dimensions of technical or biological replicates to ensure they are the similar.&lt;ref name=flowq&gt;{{Cite journal

| pmc =2768034 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For more rigor, the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] can be used to determine if individual samples deviate from the norm.&lt;ref name="flowq" /&gt;
The [[Grubbs' test for outliers]] may be used to detect samples deviating from the group.

A method for quality control in higher-dimensional space is to use probability binning with bins fit to the whole data set pooled together.&lt;ref name=CFP&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Rogers | first1 = W. T. 
| last2 = Moser | first2 = A. R. 
| last3 = Holyst | first3 = H. A.

| pages = 430–441 
| year = 2008 
| pmid = 18383310 
| pmc = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Then the [[standard deviation]] of the number of cells falling in the bins within each sample can be taken as a measure of multidimensional similarity, with samples that are closer to the norm having a smaller standard deviation.&lt;ref name="CFP" /&gt;
With this method, higher standard deviation can indicate outliers, although this is a relative measure as the absolute value depends partly on the number of bins.

With all of these methods, the cross-sample variation is being measured. However, this is the combination of technical variations introduced by the instruments and handling, and actual biological information that is desired to be measured. Disambiguating the technical and the biological contributions to between-sample variation can be a difficult to impossible task.&lt;ref name="flowStats"/&gt;

===Normalization===
Particularly in multi-centre studies, technical variation can make biologically equivalent populations of cells difficult to match across samples.
[[Normalization (statistics)|Normalization methods]] to remove technical variance, frequently derived from [[image registration]] techniques, are thus a critical step in many flow cytometry analyses.
Single-marker normalization can be performed using landmark registration, in which peaks in a [[kernel density estimate]] of each sample are identified and aligned across samples.&lt;ref name="flowStats"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Identifying cell populations==

The complexity of raw flow cytometry data (dozens of measurements for thousands to millions of cells) makes answering questions directly using statistical tests or supervised learning difficult. Thus, a critical step in the analysis of flow cytometric data is to reduce this complexity to something more tractable while establishing common features across samples. This usually involves identifying multidimensional regions that contain functionally and phenotypically homogeneous groups of cells.&lt;ref name="lugli2010data"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[cluster analysis]].  There are a range of methods by which this can be achieved, detailed below.

===Gating===
The data generated by flow-cytometers can be plotted in one or two [[dimension]]s to produce a [[histogram]] or scatter plot. The regions on these plots can be sequentially separated, based on fluorescence [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], by creating a series of subset extractions, termed "[[Gate (cytometry)|gate]]s". These gates can be produced using software, e.g. Flowjo,&lt;ref name="FlowJo"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.flowjo.com/vX/en/ws.boolean.html| title=FlowJo|accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCS Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.denovosoftware.com/site/Flow-RUO-Overview.shtml| title=FCS Express|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; WinMDI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://facs.scripps.edu/software.html| title=TSRI Cytometry Software Page| accessdate=2009-09-03| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961119132627/http://facs.scripps.edu/software.html| archivedate=1996-11-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   CytoPaint (aka Paint-A-Gate),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://leukobyte.com| title=CytoPaint Classic|accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; VenturiOne, [[Cellcion]], CellQuest Pro, Cytospec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cyto.purdue.edu/Purdue_software| title=PUCL Cytometry Software Page|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaluza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.beckmancoulter.com| title=Beckman Coulter|accessdate=2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or flowCore.

In datasets with a low number of dimensions and limited cross-sample technical and biological variability (e.g., clinical laboratories), manual analysis of specific cell populations can produce effective and reproducible results. However, exploratory analysis of a large number of cell populations in a high-dimensional dataset is not feasible.&lt;ref name="Bendall2012From"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, several computational gating algorithms performed better than manual analysis in the presence of some variation.&lt;ref name="FlowCAP" /&gt; However, despite the considerable advances in computational analysis, manual gating remains the main solution for the identification of specific rare cell populations that are not well-separated from other cell types.

====Gating guided by dimension reduction====
The number of scatter plots that need to be investigated increases with the square of the number of markers measured (or faster since some markers need to be investigated several times for each group of cells to resolve high-dimensional differences between cell types that appear to be similar in most markers).&lt;ref name="pmid22028426"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Probability binning methods===
[[File:FlowFPExample.png|thumb|300px|left|An example of frequency difference gating, created using the flowFP Bioconductor package. The dots represent individual events in an FCS file. The rectangles represent the bins.]]

Probability binning is a non-gating analysis method in which flow cytometry data is split into [[quantile]]s on a univariate basis.&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Roederer | first1 = M. 
| last2 = Treister | first2 = A.

| year = 2001 
| pmid = 11598945 
| pmc = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The locations of the quantiles can then be used to test for differences between samples (in the variables not being split) using the chi-squared test.&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;

This was later extended into multiple dimensions in the form of frequency difference gating, a [[binary space partitioning]] technique where data is iteratively partitioned along the median.&lt;ref name=FDG&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Roederer | first1 = M. 
| last2 = Hardy | first2 = R. R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These partitions (or bins) are fit to a control sample. 
Then the proportion of cells falling within each bin in test samples can be compared to the control sample by the chi squared test.

Finally, cytometric fingerprinting uses a variant of frequency difference gating to set bins and measure for a series of samples how many cells fall within each bin.&lt;ref name="CFP" /&gt; These bins can be used as gates and used for subsequent analysis similarly to automated gating methods.

===Combinatorial gating===
High-dimensional clustering algorithms are often unable to identify rare cell types that are not well separated from other major populations. Matching these small cell populations across multiple samples is even more challenging. In manual analysis, prior biological knowledge (e.g., biological controls) provides guidance to reasonably identify these populations. However, integrating this information into the exploratory clustering process (e.g., as in [[semi-supervised learning]]) has not been successful.

An alternative to high-dimensional clustering is to identify cell populations using one marker at a time and then combine them to produce higher-dimensional clusters. This functionality was first implemented in FlowJo.&lt;ref name="FlowJo"/&gt; The flowType algorithm builds on this framework by allowing the exclusion of the markers.&lt;ref name="flowType"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Diagnosis and discovery==
[[File:FlowType-RchyOptimyx.png|thumb|400px|right|Overview of the flowType/RchyOptimyx pipeline for identification of correlates of protection against HIV: First, tens of thousands of cell populations are identified by combining one-dimensional partitions (panel one). The cell populations are then analyzed using a statistical test (and bonferroni's method for multiple testing correction) to identify those correlated with the survival information. The third panel shows a complete gating hierarchy describing all possible strategies for gating that cell population. This graph can be mined to identify the "best" gating strategy (i.e., the one in which the most important markers appear earlier). These hierarchies for all selected phenotypes are demonstrated in panel 4. In panel 5, these hierarchies are merged into a single graph that summarized the entire dataset and demonstrates the trade-off between the number of markers involved in each phenotype and the significance of the correlation with the clinical outcome (e.g., as measured by the [[:Kaplan–Meier estimator|Kaplan–Meier estimator]] in panel 6). Figure reproduced in part from&lt;ref name="flowType" /&gt; and.&lt;ref name="RchyOptimyx" /&gt;]]
After identification of the cell population of interest, a cross sample analysis can be performed to identify phenotypical or functional variations that are correlated with an external variable (e.g., a clinical outcome). These studies can be partitioned into two main groups:

===Diagnosis===
In these studies, the goal usually is to diagnose a disease (or a sub-class of a disease) using variations in one or more cell populations. For example, one can use multidimensional clustering to identify a set of clusters, match them across all samples, and then use [[supervised learning]] to construct a classifier for prediction of the classes of interest (e.g., this approach can be used to improve the accuracy of the classification of specific lymphoma subtypes&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Discovery===
In a discovery setting, the goal is to identify and describe cell populations correlated with an external variable (as opposed to the diagnosis setting in which the goal is to combine the predictive power of multiple cell types to maximize the accuracy of the results). Similar to the diagnosis use-case, cluster matching in high-dimensional space can be used for exploratory analysis but the descriptive power of this approach is very limited, as it is hard to characterize and visualize a cell population in a high-dimensional space without first reducing the dimensionality.&lt;ref name=peng2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ali"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, combinatorial gating approaches have been particularly successful in exploratory analysis of FCM data. Simplified Presentation of Incredibly Complex Evaluations (SPICE) is a software package that can use the gating functionality of FlowJo to statistically evaluate a wide range of different cell populations and visualize those that are correlated with the external outcome. flowType and RchyOptimyx (as discussed above) expand this technique by adding the ability of exploring the impact of independent markers on the overall correlation with the external outcome. This enables the removal of unnecessary markers and provides a simple visualization of all identified cell types. In a recent analysis of a large (n=466) cohort of HIV+ patients, this pipeline identified three correlates of protection against HIV, only one of which had been previously identified through extensive manual analysis of the same dataset.&lt;ref name=flowType /&gt;

==Data formats and interchange==

===Flow Cytometry Standard===
{{main|Flow Cytometry Standard}}

Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) was developed in 1984 to allow recording and sharing of flow cytometry data.&lt;ref name=FCS1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = R.

The FCS specification has traditionally been developed and maintained by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC).&lt;ref name="ISAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isac-net.org/|title=International Society for Advancement of Cytometry|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, updates were incorporated to adapt to technological advancements in both flow cytometry and computing technologies with FCS 2.0 introduced in 1990,&lt;ref name=FCS2&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = P.

Recently, additional standard file formats have been developed by ISAC.

===netCDF===
ISAC is considering replacing FCS with a flow cytometry specific version of the [[NetCDF|Network Common Data Form]] (netCDF) file format.&lt;ref name=netCDF&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert C. Leif, Josef Spidlen, Ryan R. Brinkman |title=Cytometry Standards Continuum |journal=SPIE Proceedings |year=2009 |volume=6859 |url=http://newportinstrument.com/cytometryml/pdf/Cytometry_Stds_Continuum08.pdf |bibcode=2008SPIE.6859E..17L |pages=17 |doi=10.1117/12.762514 |series=Imaging, Manipulation, and Analysis of Biomolecules, Cells, and Tissues VI |editor1-last=Farkas| editor1-first=Daniel L |editor2-last=Nicolau |editor2-first=Dan V |editor3-last=Leif |editor3-first=Robert C|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.3647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
netCDF is a set of freely available software libraries and machine independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. In 2008, ISAC drafted the first version of netCDF conventions for storage of raw flow cytometry data.&lt;ref name=netCDFProposal&gt;[http://flowcyt.sourceforge.net/netcdf/latest.pdf International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (2008). Analytical Cytometry Standard NetCDF Conventions for List Mode Binary Data File Component]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archival Cytometry Standard (ACS)===
The Archival Cytometry Standard (ACS) is being developed to bundle data with different components describing cytometry experiments.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spidlen | first1 = J. | last2 = Shooshtari | first2 = P. | last3 = Kollmann | first3 = T. R. | last4 = Brinkman | first4 = R. R. | title = Flow cytometry data standards | doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-4-50 | journal = BMC Research Notes | volume = 4 | pages = 50 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21385382 | pmc =3060130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It captures relations among data, metadata, analysis files and other components, and includes support for audit trails, versioning and digital signatures. The ACS container is based on the [[Zip (file format)|ZIP file format]] with an [[XML]]-based table of contents specifying relations among files in the container. The [[XML Signature]] [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] Recommendation has been adopted to allow for digital signatures of components within the ACS container.
An initial draft of ACS has been designed in 2007 and finalized in 2010. Since then, ACS support has been introduced in several software tools including FlowJo and Cytobank.

===Gating-ML===
The lack of gating interoperability has traditionally been a bottleneck preventing reproducibility of flow cytometry data analysis and the usage of multiple analytical tools. To address this shortcoming, ISAC developed Gating-ML, an XML-based mechanism to formally describe gates and related data (scale) transformations.&lt;ref name=GatingML/&gt;
The draft recommendation version of Gating-ML was approved by ISAC in 2008 and it is partially supported by tools like FlowJo, the flowUtils, CytoML libraries in R/BioConductor, and FlowRepository.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; It supports rectangular gates, polygon gates, convex polytopes, ellipsoids, decision trees and Boolean collections of any of the other types of gates. In addition, it includes dozens of built in public transformations that have been shown to potentially useful for display or analysis of cytometry data. In 2013, Gating-ML version 2.0 was approved by ISAC's Data Standards Task Force as a Recommendation. This new version offers slightly less flexibility in terms of the power of gating description; however, it is also significantly easier to implement in software tools.&lt;ref name="GatingML2"/&gt;

===Classification Results (CLR)===
The Classification Results (CLR) File Format&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://flowcyt.sourceforge.net/clr/latest.pdf|title=Classification Results File Format
|publisher=International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed to exchange the results of manual gating and algorithmic classification approaches in a standard way in order to be able to report and process the classification.  CLR is based in the commonly supported [[Comma-separated values|CSV file format]] with columns corresponding to different classes and cell values containing the probability of an event being a member of a particular class. These are captured as values between 0 and 1. Simplicity of the format and its compatibility with common spreadsheet tools have been the major requirements driving the design of the specification. Although it was originally designed for the field of flow cytometry, it is applicable in any domain that needs to capture either fuzzy or unambiguous classifications of virtually any kinds of objects.

==Public data and software==
As in other bioinformatics fields, development of new methods has primarily taken the form of [[Free and open source software|free open source software]], and several databases have been created for depositing [[Open science data|open data]].

===Bioconductor===
{{Main|Bioconductor}}
The Bioconductor project is a repository of free open source software, mostly written in the [[R (programming language)|R programming language]].&lt;ref name=Bioc&gt;{{Cite journal

As of July 2013, Bioconductor contained 21 software packages for processing flow cytometry data.&lt;ref name=BiocFlow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___FlowCytometry|title=BioConductor FlowCytometry view|author=Bioconductor|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These packages cover most of the range of functionality described earlier in this article.

===GenePattern===
{{Main|GenePattern}}
GenePattern is a predominantly genomic analysis platform with over 200 tools for analysis of gene expression, proteomics, and other data. A web-based interface provides easy access to these tools and allows the creation of automated analysis pipelines enabling reproducible research. Recently, a GenePattern Flow Cytometry Suite has been developed in order to bring advanced flow cytometry data analysis tools to experimentalists without programmatic skills. It contains close to 40 open source GenePattern flow cytometry modules covering methods from basic processing of flow cytometry standard (i.e., FCS) files to advanced algorithms for automated identification of cell populations, normalization and quality assessment. Internally, most of these modules leverage functionality developed in BioConductor.

Much of the functionality of the Bioconductor packages for flow cytometry analysis has been packaged up for use with the GenePattern&lt;ref name=genepattern&gt;{{Cite journal

Unlike Bioconductor, it is an interactive program aimed at non-programmers for routine analysis. It supports standard FCS files as well as COPAS profile data.

===Public databases===
The Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry Experiment (MIFlowCyt), requires that any flow cytometry data used in a publication be available, although this does not include a requirement that it be deposited in a public database.&lt;ref name=miflowcyt&gt;{{Cite journal

Thus, although the journals Cytometry Part A and B, as well as all journals from the [[Nature Publishing Group]] require MIFlowCyt compliance, there is still relatively little publicly available flow cytometry data.
Some efforts have been made towards creating public databases, however.

Firstly, CytoBank, which is a complete web-based flow cytometry data storage and analysis platform, has been made available to the public in a limited form.&lt;ref name=cytobank&gt;{{Cite book

===Datasets===
In 2012, the flow cytometry community has started to release a set of publicly available datasets. A subset of these datasets representing the existing data analysis challenges is described below. For comparison against manual gating, the FlowCAP-I project has released five datasets, manually gated by human analysts, and two of them gated by eight independent analysts.&lt;ref name="FlowCAP"/&gt; The FlowCAP-II project included three datasets for binary classification and also reported several algorithms that were able to classify these samples perfectly. FlowCAP-III included two larger datasets for comparison against manual gates as well as one more challenging sample classification dataset. As of March 2013, public release of FlowCAP-III was still in progress.&lt;ref name=flowcapweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flowcap.flowsite.org|title=FlowCAP - Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The datasets used in FlowCAP-I, II, and III either have a low number of subjects or parameters. However, recently several more complex clinical datasets have been released including a dataset of 466 HIV-infected subjects, which provides both 14 parameter assays and sufficient clinical information for survival analysis.&lt;ref name="RchyOptimyx"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HIVData&gt;{{cite web|url=https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZZZK|title=IDCRP's HIV Natural History Study Data Set|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clinicalexample1&gt;{{Cite journal

Another class of datasets are higher-dimensional mass cytometry assays. A representative of this class of datasets is a study which includes analysis of two bone marrow samples using more than 30 surface or intracellular markers under a wide range of different stimulations.&lt;ref name="pmid22693166"/&gt; The raw data for this dataset is publicly available as described in the manuscript, and manual analyses of the surface markers are available upon request from the authors.

==Open problems==
Despite rapid development in the field of flow cytometry bioinformatics, several problems remain to be addressed.

Variability across flow cytometry experiments arises from biological variation among samples, technical variations across instruments used, as well as methods of analysis.
In 2010, a group of researchers from [[Stanford University]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] pointed out that while technical variation can be ameliorated by standardizing sample handling, instrument setup and choice of reagents, solving variation in analysis methods will require similar standardization and computational automation of gating methods.&lt;ref name="pmid22343568"/&gt;
They further opined that centralization of both data and analysis could aid in decreasing variability between experiments and in comparing results.&lt;ref name="pmid22343568"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was echoed by another group of [[Pacific Biosciences]] and Stanford University researchers, who suggested that [[cloud computing]] could enable centralized, standardized, high-throughput analysis of flow cytometry experiments.&lt;ref name="pmid20717155"/&gt;
They also emphasised that ongoing development and adoption of standard data formats could continue to aid in reducing variability across experiments.&lt;ref name="pmid20717155"/&gt;
They also proposed that new methods will be needed to model and summarize results of high-throughput analysis in ways that can be interpreted by biologists,&lt;ref name="pmid20717155"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:PIA19562-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-image19-20150506.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], the largest asteroid, is a G-type]]

'''G-type asteroids''' are a relatively uncommon type of [[carbon]]aceous [[asteroid]] that makes up approximately 5% of asteroids. The most notable asteroid in this class is [[1 Ceres]].

==Characteristics==
Generally similar to the [[C-type asteroid#Characteristics|C-type]] objects, but contain a strong [[ultraviolet]] absorption feature below 0.5 μm. An absorption feature around 0.7 μm may also be present, which is indicative of [[phyllosilicate mineral]]s such as [[clay]]s or [[mica]]. 

In the [[asteroid spectral types#SMASS classification|SMASS classification]]
the '''G-type''' corresponds to the Cgh and Cg types, depending on the presence or absence (respectively) of the absorption feature at 0.7 μm. The G-type, [[C-type asteroid|C-type]] and some rare types are sometimes collected together into a wider [[C-type asteroid#C-group asteroids|C-group]] of [[carbon]]aceous asteroids.

Born in Germany, Hofmann immigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada and studied geology at [[McGill University]], where he earned a Ph.D. under the supervision of [[T. H. Clark]]. He taught for three years at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and then worked at the [[Geological Survey of Canada]]. He was a professor in the geology department of the [[Université de Montréal]] for 31 years (1969–2000). He spent the last ten years of his life as a researcher in the [[Redpath Museum]] and an adjunct professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill.&lt;ref name="RSC"/&gt;

The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] noted him for, "his pioneering discoveries of fossils that have illuminated life's early evolution, from [[Archean]] [[stromatolites]] and [[Proterozoic]] [[cyanobacteria]], to the rise of multicellular organisms."&lt;ref name="RSC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walcott/&gt;

They are mental shortcuts that usually involve focusing on one aspect of a complex problem and ignoring others.&lt;ref name="Lewis2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Alan|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Psychology and Economic Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKcG5H0zXwYC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=17 April 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85665-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Lori A.|title=CliffsAP Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIE6idG8jFgC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=21 May 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-19718-9|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nevid2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nevid|first=Jeffrey S.|title=Psychology: Concepts and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsVK0kSpzx8C&amp;pg=PA251|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-547-14814-4|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules work well under most circumstances, but they can lead to systematic deviations from [[logic]], [[probability]] or [[rational choice theory]]. The resulting errors are called "[[cognitive bias]]es" and many different types have been documented. These have been shown to affect people's choices in situations like valuing a house, deciding the outcome of a legal case, or making an investment decision. Heuristics usually govern automatic, [[Intuition|intuitive judgments]] but can also be used as deliberate mental strategies when working from limited information.

Cognitive scientist [[Herbert A. Simon]] originally proposed that human judgments are limited by available information, time constraints, and cognitive limitations, calling this [[bounded rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bazerman| first=M.

These findings set in motion the heuristics and biases research program,&lt;ref name="KahnemanKlein2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Klein|first2=Gary|title=Conditions for intuitive expertise: A failure to disagree|journal=American Psychologist|volume=64|issue=6|year=2009|pages=515–526|doi=10.1037/a0016755|pmid=19739881}}&lt;/ref&gt; which studies how people make real-world judgments and the conditions under which those judgments are unreliable. This research challenged the idea that human beings are rational actors, but provided a theory of information processing to explain how people make estimates or choices. This research, which first gained worldwide attention in 1974 with the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper "[[#CITEREFTverskyKahneman1974|Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]]",&lt;ref name=Kahneman2011&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Thinking, Fast and Slow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuKTvERuPG8C|year=2011|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-6935-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has guided almost all current theories of decision-making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plous|1999|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although the originally proposed heuristics have been challenged in the further debate, this research program has changed the field by permanently setting the research questions.&lt;ref name=FiedlerSydow2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fiedler |first1=Klaus|last2=von Sydow|first2=Momme |editor-last1=Eysenck |editor-first1=Michael W.|editor-last2=Groome|editor-first2=David |title=Cognitive Psychology: Revising the Classical Studies |publisher=Sage, London |date=2015|pages=146–161 |chapter=Heuristics and Biases: Beyond Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) Judgment under Uncertainty |chapterurl=http://crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de/sites/default/files/vonSydow/Fiedler__von_Sydow_2015_Heuristic_and_biases_Beyond_Tversky__Kahneman_s_1974_In__Eysenck_Groome_Ch_12.pdf |isbn=978-1-4462-9447-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This heuristics-and-biases tradition has been criticised by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others for being too focused on how heuristics lead to errors.&lt;ref name="Gigerenzer1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=G.|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky |journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=103|issue=3|year=1996|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics argue that heuristics can be seen as rational in an underlying sense. According to this perspective, heuristics are good enough for most purposes without being too demanding on the brain's resources. Another theoretical perspective sees heuristics as fully rational in that they are rapid, can be made without full information and can be as accurate as more complicated procedures. By understanding the role of heuristics in human psychology, marketers and other persuaders can influence decisions, such as the prices people pay for goods or the quantity they buy.

==Types==

In their initial research, Tversky and Kahneman proposed three heuristics—availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Subsequent work has identified many more. Heuristics that underlie judgment are called "judgment heuristics". Another type, called "evaluation heuristics", are used to judge the desirability of possible choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===
{{main|Availability heuristic}}
In psychology, ''availability'' is the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic.&lt;ref name="tkavail"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2= Kahneman |first2=Daniel |year=1973 |title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=5 |pages=207–232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an infrequent event can be brought easily and vividly to mind, people tend to overestimate its likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Todorov|first2=Alexander|title=The Least Likely Act: Overweighting Atypical Past Behavior in Behavioral Predictions|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=24 January 2012|volume=3|issue=6|pages=760–766|doi=10.1177/1948550611434784}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a [[tornado]] or [[terrorism]]. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.&lt;ref name="suther_avail"&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, common but mundane events are hard to bring to mind, so their likelihoods tend to be underestimated. These include deaths from [[suicide]]s, [[stroke]]s, and [[diabetes]]. This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.&lt;ref name="plous_avail" /&gt; It may also play a role in the appeal of [[Lottery|lotteries]]: to someone buying a ticket, the well-publicised, jubilant winners are more available than the millions of people who have won nothing.&lt;ref name="suther_avail" /&gt;

When people judge whether more [[English language|English]] words begin with ''T'' or with ''K'', the availability heuristic gives a quick way to answer the question. Words that begin with ''T'' come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with ''K'' in the first position or with ''K'' in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with ''K'', such as ''kangaroo'', ''kitchen'', or ''kept''. It is harder to think of words with ''K'' as the third letter, such as ''lake'', or ''acknowledge'', although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that ''K'' is more common at the start of words.&lt;ref name="tk1974" &gt;{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.&lt;ref name="tkavail" /&gt;

In one experiment that occurred before the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. Presidential election]], some participants were asked to imagine [[Gerald Ford]] winning, while others did the same for a [[Jimmy Carter]] victory. Each group subsequently viewed their allocated candidate as significantly more likely to win. The researchers found a similar effect when students imagined a good or a bad season for a [[college football]] team.&lt;ref name="Carroll1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=J.|title=The Effect of Imagining an Event on Expectations for the Event: An Interpretation in Terms of the Availability Heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88–96|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of imagination on subjective likelihood has been replicated by several other researchers.&lt;ref name="plous_avail"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept's availability can be affected by how recently and how frequently it has been brought to mind. In one study, subjects were given partial sentences to complete. The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]''. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect. A greater interval between the initial task and the judgment decreased the effect.&lt;ref name="SrullWyer1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srull|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Wyer|first2=Robert S.|title=The Role of Category Accessibility in the Interpretation of Information About Persons: Some Determinants and Implications|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=10|year=1979|pages=1660–1672|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tversky and Kahneman offered the availability heuristic as an explanation for [[illusory correlation]]s in which people wrongly judge two events to be associated with each other. They explained that people judge correlation on the basis of the ease of imagining or recalling the two events together.&lt;ref name="tkavail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;

===Representativeness===
{{main|Representativeness heuristic}}
The representativeness heuristic is seen when people use categories, for example when deciding whether or not a person is a criminal. An individual thing has a high ''representativeness'' for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of representativeness, they are using the representativeness heuristic. "Representative" is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and representativeness is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plous_repres"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=109–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the ''base rates''). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the [[base rate fallacy]]. Representativeness explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;

The representativeness heuristic is also an explanation of how people judge cause and effect: when they make these judgements on the basis of similarity, they are also said to be using the representativeness heuristic. This can lead to a bias, incorrectly finding causal relationships between things that resemble one another and missing them when the cause and effect are very different. Examples of this include both the belief that "emotionally relevant events ought to have emotionally relevant causes", and magical [[associative thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard E.|last1= Nisbett |last2= Ross|first2=Lee|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=9780134450735|pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ignorance of base rates====
{{main|Base rate fallacy}}
A 1973 experiment used a psychological profile of Tom W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref name="ktprediction"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Amos Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–251 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (including Law, Engineering and Library Science). Another group had to rate how likely it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e. the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). If people based their judgments on probability, they would say that Tom is more likely to study Humanities than Library Science, because there are many more Humanities students, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.&lt;ref name="ktprediction" /&gt;

====Conjunction fallacy====
{{main|Conjunction fallacy}}
When people rely on representativeness, they can fall into an error which breaks a fundamental law of [[probability]].&lt;ref name="plous_repres" /&gt; Tversky and Kahneman gave subjects a short character sketch of a woman called Linda, describing her as, "31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations". People reading this description then ranked the likelihood of different statements about Linda. Amongst others, these included "Linda is a bank teller", and, "Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement". People showed a strong tendency to rate the latter, more specific statement as more likely, even though a conjunction of the form "Linda is both ''X'' and ''Y''" can never be more probable than the more general statement "Linda is ''X''". The explanation in terms of heuristics is that the judgment was distorted because, for the readers, the character sketch was representative of the sort of person who might be an active feminist but not of someone who works in a bank. A similar exercise concerned Bill, described as "intelligent but unimaginative". A great majority of people reading this character sketch rated "Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby", as more likely than "Bill plays jazz for a hobby".&lt;ref name="tkconjunction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293–315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293}}  reprinted in {{Citation |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=19–48  |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without success, Tversky and Kahneman used what they described as "a series of increasingly desperate manipulations" to get their subjects to recognise the logical error. In one variation, subjects had to choose between a logical explanation of why "Linda is a bank teller" is more likely, and a deliberately illogical [[argument]] which said that "Linda is a feminist bank teller" is more likely "because she resembles an active feminist more than she resembles a bank teller". Sixty-five percent of subjects found the illogical argument more convincing.&lt;ref name="tkconjunction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poundstone|2010|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other researchers also carried out variations of this study, exploring the possibility that people had misunderstood the question. They did not eliminate the error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tentori|first=K.|author2=Bonini, N. |author3=Osherson, D. |title=The conjunction fallacy: a misunderstanding about conjunction?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1 May 2004|volume=28|issue=3|pages=467–477|doi=10.1016/j.cogsci.2004.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moro|first=Rodrigo|title=On the nature of the conjunction fallacy|journal=Synthese|date=29 July 2008|volume=171|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1007/s11229-008-9377-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that individuals with high [[Cognitive reflection test|CRT scores]] are significantly less likely to be subject to the conjunction fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oechssler|first=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|date=2009|title=Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The error disappears when the question is posed in terms of frequencies. Everyone in these versions of the study recognised that out of 100 people fitting an outline description, the conjunction statement ("She is ''X'' and ''Y''") cannot apply to more people than the general statement ("She is ''X''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gigerenzer | first1 = Gerd | year = 1991 | title = How to make cognitive illusions disappear: Beyond "heuristics and biases | url = | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 83–115 | doi = 10.1080/14792779143000033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I think Tversky &amp; Kahneman discovered this before Gigerenzer- ref to come --&gt;

====Ignorance of sample size====
{{Main|Insensitivity to sample size}}
Tversky and Kahneman asked subjects to consider a problem about random variation. Imagining for simplicity that exactly half of the babies born in a hospital are male, the ratio will not be exactly half in every time period. On some days, more girls will be born and on others, more boys. The question was, does the likelihood of deviating from exactly half depend on whether there are many or few births per day? It is a well-established consequence of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling theory]] that proportions will vary much more day-to-day when the typical number of births per day is small. However, people's answers to the problem do not reflect this fact. They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dilution effect====
[[Richard E. Nisbett]] and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the ''dilution effect'', in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a [[stereotype]]. Subjects in one study were asked whether "Paul" or "Susan" was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Kunda |1999| pp=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make relative information less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Zukier1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zukier|first1=Henry|title=The dilution effect: The role of the correlation and the dispersion of predictor variables in the use of nondiagnostic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|year=1982|pages=1163–1174|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misperception of randomness====
Representativeness explains systematic errors that people make when judging the probability of random events. For example, in a sequence of coin tosses, each of which comes up heads (H) or tails (T), people reliably tend to judge a clearly patterned sequence such as HHHTTT as less likely than a less patterned sequence such as HTHTTH. These sequences have exactly the same probability, but people tend to see the more clearly patterned sequences as less representative of randomness, and so less likely to result from a random process.&lt;ref name="tk1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tversky and Kahneman argued that this effect underlies the [[gambler's fallacy]]; a tendency to expect outcomes to even out over the short run, like expecting a [[roulette]] wheel to come up black because the last several throws came up red.&lt;ref name="plous_repres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smallnumbers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Belief in the law of small numbers.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1971|volume=76|issue=2|pages=105–110|doi=10.1037/h0031322}} reprinted in {{cite book|editor1=Daniel Kahneman |editor2=Paul Slovic |editor3=Amos Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521284141|pages=23–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasised that even experts in statistics were susceptible to this illusion: in a 1971 survey of professional psychologists, they found that respondents expected samples to be overly representative of the population they were drawn from. As a result, the psychologists systematically overestimated the [[statistical power]] of their tests, and underestimated the [[sample size]] needed for a meaningful test of their hypotheses.&lt;ref name="tk1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallnumbers" /&gt;

===Anchoring and adjustment===
{{main|Anchoring}}
Anchoring and adjustment is a heuristic used in many situations where people estimate a number.&lt;ref name="baron_anch"&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|2000|p=235?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tversky and Kahneman's original description, it involves starting from a readily available number—the "anchor"—and shifting either up or down to reach an answer that seems plausible.&lt;ref name=baron_anch /&gt; In Tversky and Kahneman's experiments, people did not shift far enough away from the anchor. Hence the anchor contaminates the estimate, even if it is clearly irrelevant. In one experiment, subjects watched a number being selected from a spinning "wheel of fortune". They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, "Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the [[United Nations]] larger or smaller than 65%?" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given.&lt;ref name=baron_anch /&gt;&lt;ref name=plous_anch /&gt;  Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect. An alternative theory is that people form their estimates on evidence which is selectively brought to mind by the anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Koehler|Harvey|2004|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cote de Brouilly bottle of Beaujolais wine.jpg|thumb|160px|The amount of money people will pay in an auction for a bottle of wine can be influenced by considering an arbitrary two-digit number.]]

The anchoring effect has been demonstrated by a wide variety of experiments both in laboratories and in the real world.&lt;ref name=plous_anch /&gt;&lt;ref name=mes197 /&gt; It remains when the subjects are offered money as an incentive to be accurate, or when they are explicitly told not to base their judgment on the anchor.&lt;ref name="mes197"&gt;{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|pp=185–186, 197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is stronger when people have to make their judgments quickly.&lt;ref name=yud_anch /&gt; Subjects in these experiments lack [[introspection|introspective awareness]] of the heuristic, denying that the anchor affected their estimates.&lt;ref name=yud_anch /&gt;

Even when the anchor value is obviously random or extreme, it can still contaminate estimates.&lt;ref name=mes197 /&gt; One experiment asked subjects to estimate the year of [[Albert Einstein]]'s first visit to the United States. Anchors of 1215 and 1992 contaminated the answers just as much as more sensible anchor years.&lt;ref name="yud_anch"&gt;{{Harvnb |Yudkowsky|2008|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments asked subjects if the average temperature in [[San Francisco]] is more or less than 558 degrees, or whether there had been more or fewer than 100,025 top ten albums by [[The Beatles]]. These deliberately absurd anchors still affected estimates of the true numbers.&lt;ref name="plous_anch"&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring results in a particularly strong bias when estimates are stated in the form of a [[confidence interval]]. An example is where people predict the value of a stock market index on a particular day by defining an upper and lower bound so that they are 98% confident the true value will fall in that range. A reliable finding is that people anchor their upper and lower bounds too close to their best estimate.&lt;ref name="tk1974" /&gt; This leads to an [[overconfidence effect]]. One much-replicated finding is that when people are 98% certain that a number is in a particular range, they are wrong about thirty to forty percent of the time.&lt;ref name=tk1974 /&gt;&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{citation|last=Lichtenstein |first=Sarah |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischoff|first3= Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman| editor2-first=Paul|editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos|editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn= 9780521284141 |pages=306–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring also causes particular difficulty when many numbers are combined into a composite judgment. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this by asking a group of people to rapidly estimate the product 8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;1. Another group had to estimate the same product in reverse order; 1&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;8. Both groups underestimated the answer by a wide margin, but the latter group's average estimate was significantly smaller.&lt;ref name=suther168 /&gt; The explanation in terms of anchoring is that people multiply the first few terms of each product and anchor on that figure.&lt;ref name=suther168 /&gt; A less abstract task is to estimate the probability that an aircraft will crash, given that there are numerous possible faults each with a likelihood of one in a million. A common finding from studies of these tasks is that people anchor on the small component probabilities and so underestimate the total.&lt;ref name="suther168"&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=168–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding effect happens when people estimate the probability of multiple events happening in sequence, such as an [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator bet]] in horse racing. For this kind of judgment, anchoring on the individual probabilities results in an overestimation of the combined probability.&lt;ref name=suther168 /&gt;

====Examples====
People's valuation of goods, and the quantities they buy, respond to anchoring effects. In one experiment, people wrote down the last two digits of their [[social security number]]s. They were then asked to consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment. They then entered an [[auction]] to bid for these items. Those with the highest two-digit numbers submitted bids that were many times higher than those with the lowest numbers.&lt;ref name="HastieDawes_anch"&gt;{{harvnb|Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loewenstein2007"&gt;{{citation|author=George Loewenstein |authorlink=George Loewenstein|title=Exotic Preferences: Behavioral Economics and Human Motivation|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199257072|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a stack of soup cans in a supermarket was labelled, "Limit 12 per customer", the label influenced customers to buy more cans.&lt;ref name=yud_anch /&gt; In another experiment, [[real estate agent]]s appraised the value of houses on the basis of a tour and extensive documentation. Different agents were shown different listing prices, and these affected their valuations. For one house, the appraised value ranged from [[United States dollar|US$]]114,204 to $128,754.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring and adjustment has also been shown to affect grades given to students. In one experiment, 48 teachers were given bundles of student essays, each of which had to be graded and returned. They were also given a fictional list of the students' previous grades. The mean of these grades affected the grades that teachers awarded for the essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor1-first=Jean-Paul |editor1-last=Caverni |editor2-first= Jean-Marc |editor2-last=Fabré |editor3-first=Michel |editor3-last=González |publisher=Elsevier |title=Cognitive biases |year=1990|chapter=The Anchoring-Adjustment Heuristic in an 'Information-Rich, Real World Setting': Knowledge Assessment by Experts | first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Caverni|first2=Jean-Luc |last2=Péris|pages=35–45|isbn=9780444884138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study showed that anchoring affected the sentences in a fictional rape trial.&lt;ref name="mes183" /&gt; The subjects were trial judges with, on average, more than fifteen years of experience. They read documents including witness testimony, expert statements, the relevant penal code, and the final pleas from the prosecution and defence. The two conditions of this experiment differed in just one respect: the prosecutor demanded a 34-month sentence in one condition and 12 months in the other; there was an eight-month difference between the average sentences handed out in these two conditions.&lt;ref name="mes183"&gt;{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar mock trial, the subjects took the role of jurors in a civil case. They were either asked to award damages "in the range from $15 million to $50 million" or "in the range from $50 million to $150 million". Although the facts of the case were the same each time, jurors given the higher range decided on an award that was about three times higher. This happened even though the subjects were explicitly warned not to treat the requests as evidence.&lt;ref name=HastieDawes_anch /&gt;

Assessments can also be influenced by the stimuli provided.  In one review, researchers found that if a stimuli is perceived to be important or carry "weight" to a situation, that people were more likely to attribute that stimuli as heavier physically.&lt;ref&gt;Rabelo, A. L., Keller, V. N., Pilati, R., &amp; Wicherts, J. M. (2015). No effect of weight on judgments of importance in the moral domain and evidence of publication bias from a meta-analysis.

===Affect heuristic===
{{main|Affect heuristic}}
"[[Affect (psychology)|Affect]]", in this context, is a [[emotion|feeling]] such as fear, pleasure or surprise. It is shorter in duration than a [[emotional mood|mood]], occurring rapidly and involuntarily in response to a [[stimulation|stimulus]]. While reading the words "lung cancer" might generate an affect of [[Fear|dread]], the words "mother's love" can create an affect of [[affection]] and comfort. When people use affect ("gut responses") to judge benefits or risks, they are using the affect heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finucane|first=M.L.|author2=Alhakami, A. |author3=Slovic, P. |author4=Johnson, S.M. |title=The Affect Heuristic in Judgment of Risks and Benefits|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=January 2000|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(200001/03)13:1&lt;1::AID-BDM333&gt;3.0.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affect heuristic has been used to explain why messages [[framing (social sciences)|framed]] to activate emotions are more persuasive than those framed in a purely factual way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Carmen |author2=Siegrist, Michael |author3=Gutscher, Heinz|title=The Role of Affect and Availability Heuristics in Risk Analysis|date=June 2006|volume=26|issue=3|pages=631–639|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00773.x|journal=Risk Analysis|pmid=16834623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
There are competing theories of human judgment, which differ on whether the use of heuristics is irrational. A ''cognitive laziness'' approach argues that heuristics are inevitable shortcuts given the limitations of the human brain. According to the ''natural assessments'' approach, some complex calculations are already done rapidly and automatically by the brain, and other judgments make use of these processes rather than calculating from scratch. This has led to a theory called "attribute substitution", which says that people often handle a complicated question by answering a different, related question, without being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref name=revisited /&gt; A third approach argues that heuristics perform just as well as more complicated decision-making procedures, but more quickly and with less information. This perspective emphasises the "fast and frugal" nature of heuristics.&lt;ref name="Hardman_frugal"&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2009|pp=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive laziness===
{{See also|Cognitive miser}}
An ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]] states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

===Attribute substitution===
{{main|Attribute substitution}}
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A visual example of attribute substitution. This illusion works because the 2D size of parts of the scene is judged on the basis of 3D (perspective) size, which is rapidly calculated by the visual system.]]
In 2002 Daniel Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed a process called attribute substitution which happens without conscious awareness. According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') which is computationally complex, a rather more easily calculated ''heuristic attribute'' is substituted.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |author2=David A. Lagnado |author3=David R. Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=9781841695884}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, a difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without the person being aware this is happening.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness   Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|date=December 2003|title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=American Economic Review|publisher=American Economic Association|url=http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/lotto/papers/Kahneman2.pdf|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1449–1475|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Associative processes in intuitive judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=October 2010|volume=14|issue=10|pages=435–440|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|pmid=20696611|pmc=5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g. the [[Luminance|brightness]] of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded by [[Neuron|brain cell]]s in a way that is independent of [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be very different in nature.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer" /&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible.&lt;br /&gt;Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible.&lt;br /&gt;This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life and is then asked how happy they are might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than other areas.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system.&lt;br /&gt;For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|date=December 2003|title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=American Economic Review|publisher=American Economic Association|url=http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/lotto/papers/Kahneman2.pdf|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1449–1475|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter. Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip. See Morewedge and Kahneman (2010), for a recent summary of attribute substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Fast and frugal===
[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and colleagues have argued that heuristics can be used to make judgments that are accurate rather than biased. According to them, heuristics are "fast and frugal" alternatives to more complicated procedures, giving answers that are just as good.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group (1999). ''Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart''. Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-514381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===Efficient decision heuristics===
Warren Thorngate, an emeritus social psychologist, implemented 10 simple decision rules or heuristics in a simulation program as computer subroutines chose an alternative. He determined how often each heuristic selected alternatives with highest-through-lowest expected value in a series of randomly generated decision situations. He found that most of the simulated heuristics selected alternatives with highest expected value and almost never selected alternatives with lowest expected value. More information about the simulation can be found in his "Efficient decision heuristics" article (1980).&lt;ref name="Thorngate1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorngate|first1=Warren|title=Efficient decision heuristics|journal=Behavioral Science|volume=25|issue=3|year=1980|pages=219–225|doi=10.1002/bs.3830250306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Beautiful-is-familiar" effect===
Psychologist Benoît Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Monin |first=Benoît |author2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in familiarity is accounted for by the attractiveness of the photograph.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

===Judgments of morality and fairness===
Legal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] has argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]] or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of trusted political or religious authorities can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url= http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf |ssrn=1401432|accessdate=2009-09-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023946/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf|archivedate=November 29, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunstein has been challenged as not providing enough evidence that attribute substitution, rather than other processes, is at work in these cases.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer |date=March 2008 |title=Heuristics Made Easy: An Effort-Reduction Framework |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=207–222 |issn=1939-1455 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.207 |pmid=18298269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient '''history''', the concepts of chance and '''[[randomness]]''' were intertwined with that of fate. Many ancient peoples threw dice to determine fate, and this later evolved into games of chance. At the same time, most ancient cultures used various methods of [[divination]] to attempt to circumvent randomness and fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome'', Lesley Adkins, 1998 {{ISBN|0-19-512332-8}} p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religions of the Ancient World'', Sarah Iles Johnston, 2004 {{ISBN|0-674-01517-7}} p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese were perhaps the earliest people to formalize odds and chance 3,000 years ago. The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] discussed randomness at length, but only in non-quantitative forms. It was only in the sixteenth century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the odds associated with various games of chance. The invention of modern [[calculus]] had a positive impact on the formal study of randomness. In the 19th century the concept of [[entropy]] was introduced in physics.
&lt;!-- and a proof of the randomness of the digits of the number&amp;nbsp;''[[Pi|π]]'' was presented.&lt;ref&gt;''Annotated Readings in the History of Statistics'', Herbert Aron David, 2001 ISBN 0-387-98844-0 p. 115. [[John Venn]] constructed a 2D random walk with the digits in the 1888 edition of his book ''Logic of Chance''. NB. The 1866 edition of Venn's  book (on Google Books) does not include this chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; 
--&gt;

The early part of the twentieth century saw a rapid growth in the formal analysis of randomness, and mathematical foundations for probability were introduced, leading to its [[axiomatization]] in 1933. At the same time, the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] changed the scientific perspective on [[determinacy]]. In the mid to late 20th-century, ideas of [[algorithmic information theory]] introduced new dimensions to the field via the concept of [[algorithmic randomness]].

Although randomness had often been viewed as an obstacle and a nuisance for many centuries, in the twentieth century computer scientists began to realize that the ''deliberate'' introduction of randomness into computations can be an effective tool for designing better algorithms. In some cases, such [[randomized algorithms]] are able to outperform the best deterministic methods.

[[File:Fortuna or Fortune.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of Roman goddess [[Fortuna]] who determined fate, by [[Hans Sebald Beham|Hans Beham]], 1541]]

Pre-Christian people along the [[Mediterranean]] threw dice to determine fate, and this later evolved into games of chance.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life'', Edward J. Beltrami, 1999, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-98737-1}} pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of games of chance played by ancient Egyptians, Hindus and
Chinese, dating back to 2100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Leisure and Outdoor Recreation'', John Michael Jenkins, 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-25226-1}} p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese used dice before the Europeans, and have a long history of playing games of chance.&lt;ref&gt;''Audacious Angles of China'', Elise Mccormick, 2007 {{ISBN|1-4067-5332-7}} p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 3,000 years ago, the problems concerned with the tossing of several coins were considered in the [[Book of Changes|I Ching]], one of the oldest Chinese mathematical texts, that probably dates to 1150 BC. The two principal elements [[yin and yang]] were combined in the I Ching in various forms to produce ''Heads and Tails'' permutations of the type HH, TH, HT, etc. and the Chinese seem to have been aware of [[Pascal's triangle]] long before the Europeans formalized it in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature and Growth of Modern Mathematics'', Edna Ernestine Kramer, 1983, {{ISBN|9780691023724}}, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; However, Western philosophy focused on the non-mathematical aspects of chance and randomness until the 16th century.

The development of the concept of chance throughout history has been very gradual. Historians have wondered why progress in the field of randomness was so slow, given that humans have encountered chance since antiquity. Deborah Bennett suggests that ordinary people face an inherent difficulty in understanding randomness, although the concept is often taken as being obvious and self-evident. She cites studies by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]]; these concluded that statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience because people do not attend to the detail necessary to gain such knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Randomness'', Deborah J. Bennett, Harvard University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-674-10745-4}} pp. 8-9 and 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek philosophers were the earliest Western thinkers to address chance and randomness. Around 400 BC, [[Democritus]] presented a view of the world as governed by the unambiguous laws of order and considered randomness as a subjective concept that only originated from the inability of humans to understand the nature of events. He used the example of two men who would send their servants to bring water at the same time to cause them to meet. The servants, unaware of the plan, would view the meeting as random.&lt;ref&gt;''Design and Analysis of Randomized Algorithms'', Juraj Hromkovič, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-23949-9}} p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] saw chance and necessity as opposite forces. He argued that nature had rich and constant patterns that could not be the result of chance alone, but that these patterns never displayed the machine-like uniformity of necessary determinism. He viewed randomness as a genuine and widespread part of the world, but as subordinate to necessity and order.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle's Physics: a Guided Study'', Joe Sachs, 1995 {{ISBN|0-8135-2192-0}} p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle classified events into three types: ''certain'' events that happen necessarily; ''probable'' events that happen in most cases; and ''unknowable'' events that happen by pure chance. He considered the outcome of games of chance as unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750'', Anders Hald, 2003 {{ISBN|0-471-47129-1}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 300 BC [[Epicurus]] proposed the concept that randomness exists by itself, independent of human knowledge. He believed that in the atomic world, atoms would ''swerve'' at random along their paths, bringing about randomness at higher levels.&lt;ref&gt;''Epicurus: an Introduction'', John M. Rist, 1972 {{ISBN|0-521-08426-1}} p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HoteiMusashi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hotei]], the deity of fortune observing a [[cock fight]] in a 16th-century Japanese print]]
For several centuries thereafter, the idea of chance continued to be intertwined with fate. Divination was practiced in many cultures, using diverse methods. The Chinese analyzed the cracks in turtle shells, while the Germans, who according to [[Tacitus]] had the highest regards for lots and omens, utilized strips of bark.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Chance'', Gerda Reith, 2000 {{ISBN|0-415-17997-1}} p. 15; Tac. Germ. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire]], chance was personified by the Goddess [[Fortuna]]. The Romans would partake in games of chance to simulate what Fortuna would have decided. In 49 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] allegedly decided on his fateful decision to cross the [[Rubicon]] after throwing dice.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life'', Edward J. Beltrami, 1999, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-98737-1}} pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's classification of events into the three classes: ''certain'', ''probable'' and ''unknowable'' was adopted by Roman philosophers, but they had to reconcile it with deterministic [[Christian]] teachings in which even events unknowable to man were considered to be predetermined by God. About 960 Bishop Wibold of [[Cambrai]] correctly enumerated the 56 different outcomes (without permutations) of playing with three dice. No reference to playing cards has been found in Europe before 1350. The Church preached against card playing, and card games spread much more slowly than games based on dice.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750'', Anders Hald, 2003 {{ISBN|0-471-47129-1}} pp. 29-36&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian Church specifically forbade [[divination]]; and wherever Christianity went, divination lost most of its old-time power.&lt;ref&gt;A general history of the Christian church'' Volume 2 by Joseph Priestley 1804 ASIN B002KW4M6O page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic encyclopedia]] [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05048b.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, many Christian scholars wrestled with the conflict between the belief in [[free will]] and its implied randomness, and the idea that God knows everything that happens. Saints [[Augustine]] and [[Aquinas]] tried to reach an accommodation between foreknowledge and free will, but [[Martin Luther]] argued against randomness and took the position that God's omniscience renders human actions unavoidable and determined.&lt;ref&gt;''The Case for Humanism'', Lewis Vaughn, [[Austin Dacey]], 2003 {{ISBN|0-7425-1393-9}} p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed randomness not as the result of a single cause, but of several causes coming together by chance. While he believed in the existence of randomness, he rejected it as an explanation of the end-directedness of nature, for he saw too many patterns in nature to have been obtained by chance.&lt;ref&gt;''The treatise on the divine nature: Summa theologiae I'', 1-13, by Saint Thomas Aquinas, Brian J. Shanley, 2006 {{ISBN|0-87220-805-2}} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks and Romans had not noticed the magnitudes of the relative frequencies of the games of chance. For centuries, chance was discussed in Europe with no mathematical foundation and it was only in the 16th century that Italian mathematicians began to discuss the outcomes of games of chance as ratios.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750'', Anders Hald, 2003 {{ISBN|0-471-47129-1}} pp. 30-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World of Scientific Discovery'', Kimberley A. McGrath and Bridget Traverspage, 1999 {{ISBN|0-7876-2760-7}} p. 893&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Randomness'', Deborah J. Bennett, Harvard University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-674-10745-4}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1565 ''Liber de Lude Aleae'' (a gambler's manual published after his death) [[Gerolamo Cardano]] wrote one of the first formal tracts to analyze the odds of winning at various games.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Scientists'', John Daintith, Derek Gjertsen, 1999 {{ISBN|0-19-280086-8}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th–19th centuries==
[[File:Pascal Pajou Louvre RF2981.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]]]
Around 1620 [[Galileo]] wrote a paper called ''On a discovery concerning dice'' that used an early probabilistic model to address specific questions.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750'', Anders Hald, 2003 {{ISBN|0-471-47129-1}} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1654, prompted by [[Chevalier de Méré]]'s interest in gambling, [[Blaise Pascal]] corresponded with [[Pierre de Fermat]], and much of the groundwork for probability theory was laid. [[Pascal's Wager]] was noted for its early use of the concept of [[infinity]], and the first formal use of [[decision theory]]. The work of Pascal and Fermat influenced [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s work on the [[infinitesimal calculus]], which in turn provided further momentum for the formal analysis of probability and randomness.

The first known suggestion for viewing randomness in terms of complexity was made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in an obscure 17th-century document discovered after his death. Leibniz asked how one could know if a set of points on a piece of paper were selected at random (e.g. by splattering ink) or not. Given that for any set of finite points there is always a mathematical equation that can describe the points, (e.g. by [[Lagrangian interpolation]]) the question focuses on the way the points are expressed mathematically. Leibniz viewed the points as random if the function describing them had to be extremely complex. Three centuries later, the same concept was formalized as [[algorithmic randomness]] by [[A. N. Kolmogorov]] and [[Gregory Chaitin]] as the minimal length of a computer program needed to describe a finite string as random.&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking about Gödel and Turing'', Gregory J. Chaitin, 2007 {{ISBN|981-270-896-0}} p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]'', the first textbook on [[probability theory]] was published in 1718 and the field continued to grow thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Ivo (2005), "Abraham De Moivre, ''The Doctrine of Chances'' (1718, 1738, 1756)", in Grattan-Guinness, I., Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640-1940, Amsterdam: Elsevier, p. 105–120, {{ISBN|0-444-50871-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frequency probability|frequency theory]] approach to probability was first developed by [[Robert Leslie Ellis|Robert Ellis]] and [[John Venn]] late in the 19th century. 
&lt;!--In the 1888 edition of his book ''The Logic of Chance'', [[John Venn]] wrote a chapter on "The conception of randomness" and presented a proof of the randomness of the digits of the number [[Pi]] by using them to construct a [[random walk]] in two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;''Annotated Readings in the History of Statistics'', Herbert Aron David, 2001 ISBN 0-387-98844-0 p. 115. NB. The 1866 edition of Venn's  book (on Google Books) does not include this chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; 
--&gt;

[[File:Vouet, Simon - The Fortune Teller.jpg|thumb|left|''The Fortune Teller'' by [[Vouet]], 1617]]
While the mathematical elite was making progress in understanding randomness from the 17th to the 19th century, the public at large continued to rely on practices such as [[fortune telling]] in the hope of taming chance. Fortunes were told in a multitude of ways both in the Orient (where fortune telling was later termed an addiction) and in Europe by gypsies and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Asia in the Making of Europe'', Volume 3, Donald Frederick Lach, Edwin J. Van Kley, 1998 {{ISBN|0-226-46769-4}} p. 1660&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia'', David M. Crowe, 1996 {{ISBN|0-312-12946-7}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; English practices such as the reading of eggs dropped in a glass were exported to Puritan communities in North America.&lt;ref&gt;''Events that Changed America through the Seventeenth Century'', John E. Findling, Frank W. Thackeray, 2000 {{ISBN|0-313-29083-0}} p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[entropy]], which is now a key element in the study of randomness, was coined by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865 as he studied heat engines in the context of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Clausius was the first to state "entropy always increases".&lt;ref&gt;''Great physicists'' by William H. Cropper 2004 ISBN page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] until about 1890, it was generally believed that if one knows the initial state of a system with great accuracy, and if all the forces acting on the system can be formulated with equal accuracy, it would be possible, in principle, to make predictions of the state of the universe for an infinitely long time. The limits to such predictions in physical systems became clear as early as 1893 when [[Henri Poincaré]] showed that in the [[three-body problem]] in astronomy, small changes to the initial state could result in large changes in trajectories during the numerical integration of the equations.&lt;ref&gt;''On Limited Predictability'', [[Aksel C. Wiin-Nielsen|A. Wiin-Nielsen]], 1999 {{ISBN|87-7304-185-8}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, as probability theory was formalized and better understood, the attitude towards "randomness as nuisance" began to be questioned. [[Goethe]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The tissue of the world
is built from necessities and randomness;
the intellect of men places itself between both
and can control them;
it considers the necessity 
and the reason of its existence;
it knows how randomness can be
managed, controlled, and used.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of Goethe proved prophetic, when in the 20th century [[randomized algorithms]] were discovered as powerful tools.&lt;ref&gt;''Design and Analysis of Randomized Algorithms'', Juraj Hromkovič, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-23949-9}} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, Newton's model of a mechanical universe was fading away as the statistical view of the collision of molecules in gases was studied by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of science and technology'' by James S. Trefil 2001 {{ISBN|0-415-93724-8}} Page cxxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann's equation ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''W'' (inscribed on his tombstone) first related [[entropy]] with [[logarithm]]s.

==20th century==
[[File:Antony Gormley Quantum Cloud 2000.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antony Gormley]]'s ''[[Quantum Cloud]]'' sculpture in [[London]] was designed by a computer using a [[random walk]] algorithm.]]
During the 20th century, the five main [[Probability interpretations|interpretations of probability]] theory (e.g., ''classical'', ''logical'', ''frequency'', ''propensity'' and ''subjective'') became better understood, were discussed, compared and contrasted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of application areas were developed in this century, from finance to physics. In 1900 [[Louis Bachelier]] applied [[Brownian motion]] to evaluate [[stock options]], effectively launching the fields of [[financial mathematics]] and [[stochastic processes]].

[[Émile Borel]] was one of the first mathematicians to formally address randomness in 1909, and introduced [[normal number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E. Borel, ''Les probabilites denombrables et leurs applications arithmetique'' Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 27 (1909) 247-271&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Richard von Mises]] gave the first definition of algorithmic randomness via the [[impossibility of a gambling system]]. He advanced the frequency theory of randomness in terms of what he called ''the collective'', i.e. a [[random sequence]]. Von Mises regarded the randomness of a collective as an empirical law, established by experience. He related the "disorder" or randomness of a collective to the lack of success of attempted gambling systems. This approach led him to suggest a definition of randomness that was later refined and made mathematically rigorous by [[Alonzo Church]] by using [[computable function]]s in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy'' Volume 2, Ivor Grattan-Guinness 0801873975 p. 1412&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard von Mises]] likened the principle of the ''impossibility of a gambling system'' to the principle of the [[conservation of energy]], a law that cannot be proven, but has held true in repeated experiments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Karl Popper'', Herbert Keuth {{ISBN|0-521-54830-6}} p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Mises never totally formalized his rules for sub-sequence selection, but in his 1940 paper "On the concept of random sequence", [[Alonzo Church]] suggested that the functions used for place settings in the formalism of von Mises be computable functions rather than arbitrary functions of the initial segments of the sequence, appealing to the [[Church–Turing thesis]] on effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alonzo Church]], "On the concept of random sequence," Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 46 (1940), 254–260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Alberto Coffa, "Randomness and knowledge," in ''PSA 1972: proceedings of the 1972 Biennial Meeting Philosophy of Science Association'', Volume 20, Springer, 1974 {{ISBN|90-277-0408-2}} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the early 20th century and the formulation of the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] in 1927 saw the end to the Newtonian mindset among physicists regarding the ''determinacy of nature''. In quantum mechanics, there is not even a way to consider all observable elements in a system as random variables ''at once'', since many observables do not commute.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to random time and quantum randomness'' by Kai Lai Chung, Jean-Claude Zambrini 2003 {{ISBN|981-238-415-4}} page&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cafe Central Wenen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Café Central]], one of the early meeting places of the [[Vienna circle]]]]
By the early 1940s, the frequency theory approach to probability was well accepted within the [[Vienna circle]], but in the 1950s [[Karl Popper]] proposed the [[Propensity probability|propensity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, 1957, "The propensity interpretation of the calculus of probability and the quantum theory”, in S. Körner (ed.), ''The Colston Papers'', 9: 65–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, 1959, "The propensity interpretation of probability", ''British Journal of the Philosophy of Science'', 10: 25–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the frequency approach cannot deal with "a single toss" of a coin, and can only address large ensembles or collectives, the single-case probabilities were treated as propensities or chances. The concept of propensity was also driven by the desire to handle single-case probability settings in quantum mechanics, e.g. the probability of decay of a specific atom at a specific moment. In more general terms, the frequency approach can not deal with the probability of the death of a ''specific person'' given that the death can not be repeated multiple times for that person. [[Karl Popper]] echoed the same sentiment as Aristotle in viewing randomness as subordinate to order when he wrote that "the concept of chance is not opposed to the concept of law" in nature, provided one considers the laws of chance.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of Karl Popper'', Herbert Keuth {{ISBN|0-521-54830-6}} p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Shannon]]'s development of [[Information theory]] in 1948 gave rise to the ''[[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] view'' of randomness. In this view, randomness is the opposite of ''determinism'' in a [[stochastic process]]. Hence if a stochastic system has entropy zero it has no randomness and any increase in entropy increases randomness. Shannon's formulation defaults to [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s 19th century formulation of entropy in case all probabilities are equal.&lt;ref&gt;''Single Orbit Dynamics'', Benjamin Weiss 1999 {{ISBN|0-8218-0414-6}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The mathematical theory of information'' by Jan Kåhre 2002 {{ISBN|1-4020-7064-0}} page 218&lt;/ref&gt; Entropy is now widely used in diverse fields of science from [[thermodynamics]] to [[quantum chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reviews in Computational Chemistry, Volume 23'' by Kenneth B. Lipkowitz {{ISBN|0-470-08201-1}} page 279&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martingale (probability theory)|Martingale]]s for the study of chance and betting strategies were introduced by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] in the 1930s and were formalized by [[Joseph L. Doob]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;''Martingale approximation'' by Yu. V. Borovskikh, 1997 {{ISBN|90-6764-271-1}} page 287&lt;/ref&gt; The application of [[random walk hypothesis]] in [[financial theory]] was first proposed by [[Maurice Kendall]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, M. G. (1953). "The analysis of economic time-series-part I: prices", ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society''. A (General) 116 (1): 11–34. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2980947]&lt;/ref&gt; It was later promoted by [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Burton Malkiel]].

Random strings were first studied by in the 1960s by [[A. N. Kolmogorov]] (who had provided the first axiomatic definition of probability theory in 1933),&lt;ref&gt;''Probability theory: the logic of science'' by Edwin T. Jaynes, G. Larry Bretthorst 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-59271-2}} page 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaitin]] and [[Martin-Löf]].&lt;ref&gt;''Information and Randomness: an Algorithmic Perspective'', Cristian Calude, 2002 {{ISBN|3-540-43466-6}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The [[algorithmic randomness]] of a string was defined as the minimum size of a program (e.g. in bits) executed on a [[universal computer]] that yields the string. [[Chaitin's Omega]] number later related randomness and the halting probability for programs.&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking about Gödel and Turing'', Gregory J. Chaitin, 2007 {{ISBN|981-270-896-0}} p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] suggested that most statistical models approached only a first stage of dealing with indeterminism, and that they ignored many aspects of real world turbulance.&lt;ref&gt;''Gaussian Self-Affinity and Fractals'' by Benoit Mandelbrot, F.J. Damerau, M. Frame, and K. McCamy 2001 {{ISBN|0-387-98993-5}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The effortless economy of science?'' by Philip Mirowski 2004 {{ISBN|0-8223-3322-8}} page 255&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1997 he defined ''[[seven states of randomness]]'' ranging from "mild to wild", with traditional randomness being at the mild end of the scale.&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot1977 &gt;''Fractals and scaling in finance'' by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] 1997 {{ISBN|0-387-98363-5}} pages 136-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite mathematical advances, reliance on other methods of dealing with chance, such as fortune telling and [[astrology]] continued in the 20th century. The government of [[Myanmar]] reportedly shaped 20th century economic policy based on fortune telling and planned the move of the capital of the country based on the advice of astrologers.&lt;ref&gt;''Myanmar (Burma) since 1962: the failure of development'' by Peter John Perry 2007 {{ISBN|0-7546-4534-7}} page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KF18Ae02.html Asia Times, June 18, 2009 ''Instant karma in Myanmar'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NY Times, November 11, 2005  ''A government on the move to a half-built capital'', [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/10/world/asia/10iht-burma.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Regan]] criticized the involvement of astrologer [[Joan Quigley]] in decisions made during [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's presidency]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/05/19/back.time/ Time Magazine, May 16, 1988, ''Good Heavens!'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Reagan-Bush years'' 1996 by Peter B.

During the 20th century, [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]] in dealing with randomness were better understood. The best-known example of both theoretical and operational limits on predictability is weather forecasting, simply because models have been used in the field since the 1950s. Predictions of weather and climate are necessarily uncertain. Observations of weather and climate are uncertain and incomplete, and the models into which the data are fed are uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;''Predictability of Weather and Climate'', Tim Palmer, Renate Hagedorn, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-84882-2}} p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Edward Lorenz]] noticed that a very small change to the initial data submitted to a computer program for weather simulation could result in a completely different weather scenario. This later became known as the [[butterfly effect]], often paraphrased as the question: "''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?''".&lt;ref&gt;''Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado'', Nancy Mathis, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7432-8053-2}} p. x&lt;/ref&gt; A key example of serious practical limits on predictability is in geology, where the ability to [[Earthquake prediction|predict earthquakes]] either on an individual or on a statistical basis remains a remote prospect.&lt;ref&gt;L. Knopoff, "Earthquake prediction: the scientific challenge", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 1999 {{ISBN|0-309-05837-6}} p. 3720&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[computer science|computer scientists]] began to realize that the ''deliberate'' introduction of randomness into computations can be an effective tool for designing better algorithms. In some cases, such [[randomized algorithms]] outperform the best deterministic methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Design and Analysis of Randomized Algorithms'', Juraj Hromkovič 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-23949-9}} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indonesian National Science Olympiad ''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Olimpiade Sains Nasional'') is a [[science]] competition for [[Indonesia]]n students held by the Indonesian [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]]. This [[Science Olympiad|Olympiad]] consists some competitions for [[elementary school]] (SD) students, [[junior high school]] (SMP) students, and senior [[high school]] (SMA) students. 

The competition pits students from the thirty-four provinces of Indonesia, and winners of the competition are further selected to represent [[Indonesia]] in their respective subjects' [[International Science Olympiad]].&lt;ref name="estu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suryowati|first1=Estu|title=1.280 Siswa Bersaing di Olimpiade Sains Nasional 2017 - Kompas.com|url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2017/07/03/13471281/1.280.siswa.bersaing.di.olimpiade.sains.nasional.2017|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=KOMPAS.com|agency=Kompas|date=3 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[List of universities in Indonesia#Public universities|Indonesian public universities]] are required to accept medal-winners of the competition into their undergraduate programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kemendikbud wajibkan PTN terima juara OSN tanpa tes|url=https://nasional.sindonews.com/read/669725/15/kemendikbud-wajibkan-ptn-terima-juara-osn-tanpa-tes-1346714187|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=SINDOnews.com|agency=Sindonews|date=4 September 2012|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initiated in 2002 when Indonesia first became host of the [[International Physics Olympiad]]. The first ever national-stage competition was held in [[Yogyakarta]], and in 2003 it was held in [[Balikpapan]] with improved rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OSN dari Masa ke Masa|url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/shortlink/66935|accessdate=21 August 2017|agency=Republika|date=5 August 2009|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
The competition is divided into 3 levels:
#Elementary School (''Sekolah Dasar'', SD)&lt;br&gt;[[Mathematics]], [[Natural sciences]] (IPA)
#Junior High School (''Sekolah Menengah Pertama'', SMP)&lt;br&gt;[[Mathematics]], [[Natural sciences]], [[Social sciences]] (IPS)
#Senior High School (''Sekolah Menengah Atas'', SMA)&lt;br&gt;[[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Computer science]], [[Earth science]], [[Astronomy]], [[Geography]], [[Economy]]

==Selection process==
In general, the overall competition is divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panduan Seleksi Olimpiade Sains Tahun 2016|url=http://disdiktabalong.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DOWNLOAD-panduan-OSN-2016.compressed.pdf|publisher=Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture|accessdate=21 August 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# School stage&lt;br&gt;Schools may select representatives to the olympiad in any desired manner - no fixed rules apply to individual schools. 
# [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|Regency]] stage (''Olimpiade Sains Kabupaten'')&lt;br&gt;Students selected to represent their schools are sent to a centralized location in their regency/city where they take a test with other students from the same area. The set of questions are composed by the central body i.e. the Ministry. No centrally-imposed quota for participant count exists for joining this stage, although most local organizers limit the number of participants from individual schools.&lt;br&gt;In several provinces, particularly ones in [[Java]] such as [[Jakarta]] and [[Central Java]], there may be further pre-provincial stage selections. 
# [[Provinces of Indonesia|Province]] stage (''Olimpiade Sains Provinsi'')&lt;br&gt;Regardless of the pre-provincial stage selections, a single province are allowed to represent themselves by up to three times the number of province's regencies in terms of student count, with a minimum limit of a single student per regency. The aforementioned students sit in a single exam which is held simultaneously across the country.&lt;br&gt;Individual schools are limited to sending 3 students to this exam.
# National stage&lt;br&gt;A minimum of 1 student per province and generally less than 100 students nationally per subject come together and sit exams, generally one theoretical and one experimental, and winners are selected.&lt;br&gt;Individual awards include ''Absolute Winner'' (First place), ''Best Theory'' and ''Best Experiment'' (highest scores in theoretical and experimental exams respectively), along with gold (ranks 1-5), silver (ranks 6-15), and bronze (ranks 16-30) medals.
In 2016, over 320,000 students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oebaidillah|first1=Syarif|title=Menuju OSN, Olimpiade Sains Kabupaten dan Kota Digelar|url=http://mediaindonesia.com/news/read/29530/menuju-osn-olimpiade-sains-kabupaten-dan-kota-digelar/2016-02-18|accessdate=21 August 2017|agency=Media Indonesia|date=18 February 2016|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; participated in the ''Olimpiade Sains Kabupaten'' across Indonesia, with 1,579 eventually making it into the national phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ribuan Siswa Rebutan Medali OSN 2016|url=http://beritapagi.co.id/2016/05/17/ribuan-siswa-rebutan-medali-osn-2016.html|accessdate=21 August 2017|agency=Berita Pagi|date=17 May 2016|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, 420 medals were given out in 2017.&lt;ref name="estu" /&gt;

==Events==
As of 2018, only two provinces have ever won the competition: [[DKI Jakarta]] and [[Central Java]]. Both provinces are commonly seen in the competition as dominant participants, oftentimes sending the largest delegations of students.

The '''International Cometary Explorer''' ('''ICE''') [[spacecraft]] (designed and launched as the '''International Sun-Earth Explorer-3''' ('''ISEE-3''') satellite), was launched August 12, 1978, into a [[heliocentric orbit]]. It was one of three spacecraft, along with the mother/daughter pair of [[ISEE-1]] and [[ISEE-2]], built for the International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) program, a joint effort by [[NASA]] and [[ESRO]]/[[European Space Agency|ESA]] to study the interaction between the [[Earth's magnetic field]] and the [[solar wind]].

ISEE-3 was the first spacecraft to be placed in a [[halo orbit]] at the {{L1|nolink=yes}} Earth-Sun [[Lagrangian point]].&lt;ref name="nasa_sse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=ISEEICE |title=ISEE-3/ICE |work=Solar System Exploration |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renamed ICE, it became the first spacecraft to visit a [[comet]], passing through the plasma tail of comet [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner|Giacobini-Zinner]] within about {{convert|7800|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the nucleus on September 11, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-87/87X.PDF |title=Halley Comet Missions |publisher=NASA |first1=C. |last1=Stelzried |first2=L. |last2=Efron |first3=J. |last3=Ellis |pages=241–242 |date=July–September 1986 |id=TDA Progress Report 42-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA suspended routine contact with ISEE-3 in 1997, and made brief status checks in 1999 and 2008.&lt;ref name="verge20140523"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5745326/spaceship-come-home-isee-3-reboot-project |title=Spaceship come home: can citizen scientists rescue an abandoned space probe? |work=[[The Verge]] |first=Adi |last=Robertson |date=May 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="io9-20140415"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://space.io9.com/can-this-1970s-spacecraft-explore-again-1563432452 |title=Can This 1970s Spacecraft Explore Again? |work=io9.com |first=Mika |last=McKinnon |date=April 15, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISEE-3 carries no cameras; instead, its instruments measure energetic particles, waves, [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], and fields.

ISEE-3 originally operated in a [[halo orbit]] about the {{L1}} Sun-Earth [[Lagrangian point]], 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles).  It was the first artificial object placed at a so-called "libration point", entering orbit there on November 20, 1978,&lt;ref name="nasa_sse" /&gt; proving that such a suspension between gravitational fields was possible. It rotates at 19.76 rpm about an axis perpendicular to the [[ecliptic]], to keep it oriented for its experiments, to generate solar power and to communicate with Earth.

The purposes of the mission were:
* to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere;
* to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere;
* to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the [[plasma sheet]]s; and,
* to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare emissions in the interplanetary region near 1 AU.

==Second mission: International Cometary Explorer==
After completing its original mission, ISEE-3 was re-tasked to study the interaction between the solar wind and a cometary atmosphere. On June 10, 1982, the spacecraft performed a maneuver which removed it from its halo orbit around the {{L1|nolink=yes}} point and placed it in a [[Hohmann transfer orbit|transfer orbit]]. This involved a series of passages between Earth and the Sun-Earth {{L2}} Lagrangian point, through the Earth's [[magnetotail]].&lt;ref name="nssdc-isee3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1978-079A |title=ISEE 3 |work=National Space Science Data Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen propulsive maneuvers and five lunar gravity assists resulted in the spacecraft being ejected from the Earth-Moon system and into a [[heliocentric orbit]]. Its last and closest pass over the Moon, on December 22, 1983, was only {{convert|119.4|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the lunar surface; following this pass, the spacecraft was re-designated as the International Cometary Explorer (ICE).&lt;ref name="eoportal-isee3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/i/isee-3 |title=ISEE-3 / ICE (International Cometary Explorer) mission |work=eoPortal |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its new orbit put it ahead of the Earth on a trajectory to intercept comet [[21P/Giacobini-Zinner|Giacobini-Zinner]]. On September 11, 1985, the craft passed through the comet's plasma tail.&lt;ref name="eoportal-isee3"/&gt;

===Halley encounter===
ICE transited between the Sun and [[Comet Halley]] in late March 1986, when other spacecraft  were near the comet on their early-March comet rendezvous missions. (This "[[Halley Armada]]" included [[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]], [[Vega program|Vega 1 and 2]], [[Suisei (spacecraft)|Suisei]] and [[Sakigake]].) ICE flew through the tail; its minimum distance to the comet nucleus was {{convert|28|e6km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=International Cometary Explorer (ICE) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics |publisher=IOP Science |editor-first=Paul |editor-last=Murdin |date=November 2000 |doi=10.1888/0333750888/4650 |bibcode=2000eaa..bookE4650.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, Earth's minimum distance to Comet Halley in 1910 was {{convert|20.8|e6km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=2295 |title=Comets |work=Astronomy.com |first=Francis |last=Reddy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607084217/http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=2295 |archivedate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heliospheric mission===
An update to the ICE mission was approved by NASA in 1991. It defines a [[heliosphere|heliospheric]] mission for ICE consisting of investigations of [[coronal mass ejection]]s in coordination with ground-based observations, continued [[cosmic ray]] studies, and the [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] probe. By May 1995, ICE was being operated under a low duty cycle, with some data-analysis support from the Ulysses project.

===End of mission===
On May 5, 1997, NASA ended the ICE mission, leaving only a carrier signal operating. The ISEE-3/ICE downlink bit rate was nominally 2048 bits per second during the early part of the mission, and 1024 bit/s during the Giacobini-Zinner comet encounter. The bit rate then successively dropped to 512 bit/s (on December 9, 1985), 256 bit/s (on January 5, 1987), 128 bit/s (on January 24, 1989) and finally to 64 bit/s (on December 27, 1991). Though still in space, NASA donated the craft to the Smithsonian Museum.&lt;ref name=Privateers&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/04/25/privateers_race_to_capture_forgotten_nasa_space_probe_using_crowdsourced_cash/ |title=Privateers race to capture forgotten NASA space probe using crowdsourced cash |work=[[The Register]] |first=Iain |last=Thomson |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1990, ICE was in a 355-day [[heliocentric orbit]] with an [[aphelion]] of 1.03 AU, a [[perihelion]] of 0.93 AU and an inclination of 0.1 degree.

===Further contact===
In 1999, NASA made brief contact with ICE to verify its carrier signal.

On September 18, 2008, NASA, with the help of [[KinetX]], located ICE using the [[NASA Deep Space Network]] after discovering that it had not been powered off after the 1999 contact.  A status check revealed that all but one of its 13 experiments were still functioning, and it still had enough propellant for {{convert|150|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[delta-v|Δv]].

It was determined to be possible to reactivate the spacecraft in 2014,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.about.com/od/spacemissions/p/iseeiceinfo.htm |title=International Sun-Earth Explorer 3 - International Cometary Explorer |work=About.com |first=Nick |last=Greene |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712202824/http://space.about.com/od/spacemissions/p/iseeiceinfo.htm |archivedate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it again made a close approach to Earth, and scientists discussed reusing the probe to observe more comets in 2017 or 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001673/ |title=It's Alive! |publisher=The Planetary Society |first=Emily |last=Lakdawalla |date=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reboot effort==
Sometime after NASA's interest in the ICE waned, others realized that the spacecraft might be steered to pass close to another comet. A team of engineers, programmers, and scientists began to study the feasibility and challenges involved.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140615" /&gt;

In April 2014, its members formally announced their intentions to "recapture" the spacecraft for use, calling the effort the ISEE-3 Reboot Project. A team webpage said, "We intend to contact the ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer) spacecraft, command it to fire its engine and enter an orbit near Earth, and then resume its original mission... If we are successful we intend to facilitate the sharing and interpretation of all of the new data ISEE-3 sends back via crowd sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3.html |title=ISEE-3 Reboot Project (IRP) |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, the project reached its [[crowdfunding]] goal of US$125,000 on [[RocketHub]], which was expected to cover the costs of writing the software to communicate with the probe, searching through the NASA archives for the information needed to control the spacecraft, and buying time on the dish antennas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3-reboot-project-passes-funding-goal.html |title=ISEE-3 Reboot Project Passes Funding Goal |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project then set a "stretch goal" of $150,000, which it also met with a final total of $159,502 raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3-reboot-project-completes-crowdfunding-drive.html |title=ISEE-3 Reboot Project Completes Crowdfunding Drive |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project members were working on deadline: if they got the spacecraft to change its orbit by late May or early June 2014, or in early July by using more fuel, it could use the Moon's gravity to get back into a useful [[halo orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/18/289628696/space-thief-or-hero-one-mans-quest-to-reawaken-an-old-friend |title=Space Thief Or Hero?

===Replacing lost hardware===
Earlier in 2014, officials with the Goddard Space Flight Center said the Deep Space Network equipment necessary to transmit signals to the spacecraft had been decommissioned in 1999, and was too expensive to replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/02070836-isee-3.html |title=ICE/ISEE-3 to return to an Earth no longer capable of speaking to it |publisher=The Planetary Society |first=Emily |last=Lakdawalla |date=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, project members were able to find documentation for the original equipment and were able to simulate the complex modulator/demodulator electronics using modern [[software-defined radio]] (SDR) techniques and open-source programs from the [[GNU Radio]] project. They obtained the needed hardware, an off-the-shelf SDR transceiver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ettus.com/blog/2014/07/contacting-a-36-year-old-space-craft-why-not |title=The ISEE-3 Reboot Project: a dream SDR application |publisher=Ettus Research |first=Balint |last=Seeber |date=July 7, 2014 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and power amplifier,&lt;ref name="Hardware 2014-05-15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3-reboot-project-status-and-schedule-for-first-contact.html |title=ISEE-3 Reboot Project Status and Schedule for First Contact |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=May 15, 2014 |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and installed it on the 305-meter [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo dish antenna]] on May 19, 2014.&lt;ref name="Hardware 2014-05-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arecibo antenna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockethub.com/42228 |title=ISEE-3 Reboot Project by Space College, Skycorp, and SpaceRef |work=RocketHub |date=May 20, 2014 |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once they gained control of the spacecraft, the capture team planned to shift the primary ground station to the 21-meter dish located at Kentucky's [[Morehead State University]] Space Science Center.&lt;ref name="Hardware 2014-05-15"/&gt; The 20-meter dish antenna in [[Bochum Observatory]], Germany, would be a support station.&lt;ref name="Hardware 2014-05-15"/&gt;

Although NASA was not funding the project, it made advisors available and gave approval to try to establish contact. On May 21, 2014, NASA announced that it had signed a Non-Reimbursable [[Space Act Agreement]] with the ISEE-3 Reboot Project. "This is the first time NASA has worked such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again," officials said.&lt;ref name="NASAagreement"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/may/nasa-signs-agreement-with-citizen-scientists-attempting-to-communicate-with-old/index.html |title=NASA Signs Agreement with Citizen Scientists Attempting to Communicate with Old Spacecraft |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Cole |first2=Dennis |last2=Wingo |date=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact reestablished===
On May 29, 2014, the reboot team successfully commanded the probe to switch into Engineering Mode to begin to broadcast telemetry.&lt;ref name="npr29may14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/29/317190053/after-decades-of-silent-wandering-nasa-probe-phones-home |title=After Decades Of Silent Wandering, NASA Probe Phones Home |publisher=National Public Radio |first=Scott |last=Neuman |date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/citizen-scientists-successfully-communicate-with-spacecraft-0/index.html |title=Citizen Scientists Successfully Communicate with Spacecraft |publisher=NASA |date=May 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, project members using the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]] DSS-24 antenna achieved synchronous communication and obtained the four ranging points needed to refine the spacecraft's orbital parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3-status-26-june-2014-dsn-ranging-success.html |title=ISEE-3 Status 26 June 2014: DSN Ranging Success |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=June 26, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project team received approval from NASA to continue operations through at least July 16, and made plans to attempt the orbital maneuver in early July.&lt;ref name="here-now"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/06/27/isee3-satellite-npr |title=A Retired Satellite Gets Back To Work |work=National Public Radio |series=Here &amp; Now |date=June 27, 2014 |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3-status-27-june-2014-another-dsn-ranging-success.html |title=ISEE-3 Status 27 June 2014: Another DSN Ranging Success |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, the reboot project fired the thrusters for the first time since 1987.  They spun up the spacecraft to its nominal roll rate, in preparation for the upcoming trajectory correction maneuver in mid-July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/civil-space/41133isee-3-propulsion-system-awakens-at-11th-hour |title=ISEE-3 Propulsion System Awakens at 11th Hour |work=SpaceNews.com |date=July 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/isee-3-engines-fired-for-spin-up.html |title=ISEE-3 Engines Fired For Spin-Up |work=Space College |date=July 2, 2014 |accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, a longer sequence of thrusters firings failed, apparently due to loss of the nitrogen gas needed to pressurize the fuel tanks.&lt;ref name="ISEE3-20140710" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140718" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140709"/&gt;

On July 24, the ISEE-3 Reboot Team announced that all attempts to change orbit using the ISEE-3 propulsion system had failed. Instead, the team said, the ''ISEE-3 Interplanetary Citizen Science Mission'' would gather data as the spacecraft flies by the Moon on August 10 and enters a heliocentric orbit similar to Earth's. The team began shutting down propulsion components to maximize the electrical power available for the science experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/announcing-the-isee-3-interplanetary-citizen-science-mission.html |title=Announcing the ISEE-3 Interplanetary Citizen Science Mission |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, the team announced that it still planned to acquire data from as much of ISEE-3's 300-day orbit as possible. With five of the 13 instruments on the spacecraft still working, the science possibilities included listening for [[gamma-ray burst]]s, where observations from additional locations in the Solar System can be valuable. The team was also recruiting additional receiving sites around the globe to improve diurnal coverage, in order to upload additional commands while the spacecraft is close to Earth and later to receive data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/26679-vintage-nasa-spacecraft-interplanetary-science-isee3.html |title=Vintage NASA Spacecraft to Tackle Interplanetary Science |work=Space.com |first=Elizabeth |last=Howell |date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10 at 18:16 UTC, the spacecraft passed about {{convert|9700|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the surface of the Moon. It will continue in its heliocentric orbit, and will return to the vicinity of Earth in 2031.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140808"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/science/space/09zombie.html |title=Rudderless Craft to Get Glimpse of Home Before Sinking Into Space's Depths |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=August 8, 2014 |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact lost===
On September 25, 2014, the Reboot team announced that contact with the probe was lost on September 16. It is unknown whether contact can be reestablished because the probe's exact orbit is uncertain. The spacecraft's post-lunar flyby orbit takes it further from the Sun, causing electrical power available from its solar arrays to drop, and its battery failed in 1981. Reduced power could have caused the craft to enter a [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]], from which it may be impossible to awaken without the precise orbital location information needed to point transmissions at the craft.&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

==Spacecraft design==
[[Image:ISEE-C (ISEE 3) in dynamic test chamber.jpg|thumb|upright|The ISEE-3 (later ICE), undergoing testing and evaluation.]]

The ICE spacecraft is a barrel-like cylindrical shape covered by solar panels. Four long antennas protrude equidistant around the circumference of the spacecraft, spanning {{convert|91|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecollege.org/isee3/what-isee-3-really-looks-like.html |title=What ISEE-3 Really Looks Like |work=Space College |first=Keith |last=Cowing |date=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a dry mass of {{convert|390|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and can generate nominal power of 173 watts.

===Payload===
ICE carries 13 scientific instruments to measure plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields.&lt;ref name="nasa_sse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eoportal-isee3"/&gt; {{As of|2014|07}}, five were known to be functional. It does not carry a camera or imaging system. Its detectors measure high energy particles such as X- and gamma-rays, solar wind, plasma and cosmic particles. A data handling system gathers the scientific and engineering data from all systems in the spacecraft and formats them into a serial stream for transmission. The transmitter output power is five watts.

The '''''Lewis and Clark Memorial Column''''' is an outdoor monument by artist Otto Schumann, dedicated to [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] for [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|their expedition]] and located at [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Description==
The sculpture, made of Snake River granite, is a Classical column with a sphere on top. It is approximately 34 feet, 6 inches tall, with a diameter of 2.5 feet. The obelisk sits on a square base that is approximately 5 feet, 5 inches tall. The base's sides display bronze seals for the states of [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]], which once comprised the [[Oregon Territory]]. An illuminated path leads up the monument. According to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the work is administered by City of Portland's Metropolitan Arts Commission.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewis and Clark Memorial Column, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!324193~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The memorial was commissioned around 1902 by the Lewis &amp; Clark Exposition Commission for approximately $10,500 as a "gift of the people of Oregon in memory" of the duo. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] laid the first cornerstone on May 21, 1903, and the piece was completed and dedicated in 1908. It was surveyed and considered "well maintained" by Smithsonian's "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in November 1993.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

'''Benzo''' might also refer to: [[Benzodiazepine]]   
    
In [[organic chemistry]] the addition of the prefix '''benzo''' to the name of a chemical compound indicates the addition of an even number of carbon atoms to an [[unsaturated compound|unsaturated]] or already [[aromatic compound]] by which a new aromatic ring is formed. Between the prefix ''benzo'' and the name of the parent compound then place of the addition of the extra carbon atoms is indicated by letters written between square brackets.&lt;ref&gt;In the names of pages in the Wikipedia curved brackets are used, as square brackets lead to malfunctioning in links to those pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Quite often the number of added carbon atoms is four, although sometimes two else will do the job as shown in the following table. The first entry also shows different routes to the name of the same molecule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2074">'''Martin Spangberg''' or '''Martyn Petrovich Shpanberg''' (Мартын Петрович Шпанберг) was a Danish naval lieutenant in Russian service who took part with his compatriot [[Vitus Bering]] in both [[Great Northern Expedition|Kamchatka expeditions]] as second in command. He is best known for finding a [[Sea lane|sea route]] to [[Japan]] and exploring the [[Kuril Islands]] (one of which, [[Shikotan]], was renamed Shpanberg by the Russians in 1796). 

In 1738, Spangberg was in command of the first Russian naval squadron to visit the island of [[Honshu]] in Japan. The Russians landed in a scenic area which is now part of the [[Rikuchu Kaigan National Park]]. Despite the prevalent policy of [[sakoku]], the sailors were treated with politeness if not friendliness.&lt;ref name="Barratt"&gt;Glynn Barratt. ''Russia in Pacific Waters, 1715-1825''.

He died in 1761.

'''Massive Online Analysis''' (MOA) is a free [[open-source software]] project specific for [[data stream mining]] with [[concept drift]]. It is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and developed at the [[University of Waikato]], [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="bifet2010moa"&gt;{{cite journal

==Description==

MOA is an open-source framework software that allows to build and run experiments
of machine learning or data mining on evolving data streams. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that can be used from the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the command-line, and the Java API.
MOA contains several collections of machine learning algorithms:

'''Mephisto''' was the name given to a [[chess]]-playing "pseudo-automaton" built in 1876. Unlike [[The Turk]] and [[Ajeeb]] it had no hidden operator, instead being remotely controlled by electromechanical means.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;

Constructed by Charles Godfrey Gumpel (c.1835 - 1921), an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] manufacturer of artificial limbs, it took some 6 or 7 years to build and was first shown in 1878 at Gumpel's home in [[Leicester Square]], London. Mephisto was mainly operated by chess master [[Isidor Gunsberg]].&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;{{cite book| title = Eminent Victorian Chess Players: Ten Biographies| isbn = 978-0-7864-6568-2| pages = 283–286| author = Tim Harding| authorlink = Tim Harding (chess player) |orig-year = 2012.| publisher= McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.| location = London| chapter  = Isidor Arthur Gunsberg |url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=CygTBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=hu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Mephisto'' consisted of a life-size figure of an elegant devil, with one foot rendered as a cloven hoof, dressed in red velvet and seated in an armchair in front of an unenclosed, open-sided table.  This table set-up was provided to reassure the player that there were no compartments beneath the board where a man could be hidden (as in "The Turk").  In addition, the public was invited to inspect the contraption before each exhibition, with the intention of demonstrating that there was no player inside. The chessboard was noted as having had indentations on each square that held the bases of the chessmen to prevent them from moving unintentionally. The figure of Mephisto itself was bolted to the table at the chest to enable its arm full reach across the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gumpel| first = Charles Godfrey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Mephisto", the marvellous automaton, exhibited at the International Theatre, Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1889 | publisher = T.

==History==
It was the first automaton to win a Chess tournament when it was entered in the [[Counties Chess Association]] in [[London]] in 1878 and at one time had its own chess club. In 1879 Mephisto, with Gunsberg, went on tour, defeating every male player. When playing ladies, however, Mephisto would first obtain a winning position before losing the game then courteously offer to shake their hand afterwards.

When Mephisto was shown at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]] it was operated by [[Jean Taubenhaus]]. After 1889 it was dismantled and its subsequent whereabouts are unknown.

''[[Mephisto (chess computer)|Mephisto]]'' was later used as the name of a top-line dedicated [[chess computer]] which won the [[World Microcomputer Chess Championship]] in the years 1985-1990. The name is now used by the consumer electronics company [[Saitek]] on its line of standalone [[chess computer]]s.

'''Nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy''' is a [[synchrotron]]-based technique that probes [[Molecular vibration|vibrational energy levels]].  The technique, often called '''NRVS''', is specific for samples that contain nuclei that respond to [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]], most commonly iron.  The method exploits the high resolution offered by synchrotron light sources, which enables the resolution of vibrational fine structure, especially those vibrations that are coupled to the position of the Fe centre(s).&lt;ref&gt;E.

Spiering, Eds. 2003, Springer Netherlands. {{DOI|10.1007/978-94-010-0045-1_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method is popularly applied to problems in [[bioinorganic chemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Scheidt, S. M. Durbin, J. T. Sage, "Nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy – NRVS", J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005, vol. 99, 60-71. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2004.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[materials science]], and [[geophysics]]. A novel aspect of the method is the ability to determine the 3D-trajectory of iron atoms within vibrational modes, providing a unique appraisal of DFT-prediction accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Pavlik, A. Barabanschikov, A. G. Oliver, E. E. Alp, W. Sturhahn, J. Zhao, J. T. Sage, W. R. Scheidt, "Probing Vibrational Anisotropy with Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy" , Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010, volume 49, pp. 4400-4404.  {{DOI|10.1002/anie.201000928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for this method include nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS), nuclear inelastic absorption (NIA), nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS), and phonon assisted Mössbauer effect.

==Experimental set-up==
[[File:Schéma de principe du synchrotron.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a synchrotron, which provides the incident X-ray beams for this technique.]]
In the experimental setup, X-rays are released from the particle beam by an undulator; a high-resolution monochromator produces a beam with small energy dispersion (typically 1.0 meV). The sample is irradiated with photons chosen around the resonance of the Mössbauer isotope and further information is provided for the specific isotope. Typical parameters for the experimental scan are –20 meV below recoil-free resonance energy to +100 meV above it. The number of scans (often recorded for 5 seconds every 0.2 meV) depends on the amount of [[Mössbauer effect|Mössbauer]]-active nuclei in the sample.  The number of photons absorbed by the sample at any wavelength are measured by detecting the fluorescence emitted from the excited atom with an avalanche [[Avalanche diode|photodiode detector]]. The resulting raw spectrum contains a high-intensity resonance at corresponds to the nuclear excited state of the probed nucleus.  For bulk samples, the technique detects natural abundance &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe.  For many dilute or biological samples, the sample is often enriched in &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27055">The '''Oort constants''' (discovered by [[Jan Oort]]) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are empirically derived parameters that characterize the local rotational properties of our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; are the rotational velocity and distance to the [[Galactic Center|Galactic center]], respectively, measured at the position of the [[Sun]], and {{var|v}} and {{var|r}} are the velocities and distances at other positions in our part of the galaxy. As derived below, {{var|A}} and {{var|B}} depend only on the motions and positions of stars in the solar neighborhood.  As of 2018, the most accurate values of these constants are '''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 15.3 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -11.9 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''.&lt;ref name="Bovy17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bovy|first=J.|title=Galactic rotation in Gaia DR1|journal=MNRAS|date=June 2017|volume=468|pages=L63–L67|arxiv=1610.07610|bibcode = 2017MNRAS.468L..63B|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slx027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Oort constants, it is possible to determine the [[Astrodynamics|orbital properties]] of the Sun, such as the orbital velocity and [[Orbital period|period]], and infer local properties of the Galactic disk, such as the [[Density|mass density]] and how the rotational velocity changes as a function of radius from the Galactic center.

==Historical significance and background==

By the 1920s, a large fraction of the astronomical community had recognized that some of the diffuse, cloud-like objects, or [[nebulae]], seen in the night sky were collections of [[star]]s located beyond our own, local collection of star clusters. These ''[[Galaxy|galaxies]]'' had diverse morphologies, ranging from ellipsoids to disks. The concentrated band of starlight that is the visible signature of the Milky Way was indicative of a disk structure for our galaxy; however, our location within our galaxy made structural determinations from observations difficult.

[[Classical mechanics]] predicted that a collection of stars could be supported against gravitational collapse by either [[Velocity dispersion|random velocities]] of the stars or their rotation about its center of mass.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 312-321, &amp;sect;4.4, ''Galactic dynamics (2nd edition)'', James Binney, Scott Tremaine, Princeton University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-13027-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a disk-shaped collection, the support should be mainly rotational.  Depending on the mass density, or distribution of the mass in the disk, the rotation velocity may be different at each radius from the center of the disk to the outer edge. A plot of these rotational velocities against the radii at which they are measured is called a [[rotation curve]]. For external disk galaxies, one can measure the rotation curve by observing the [[Doppler shift]]s of spectral features measured along different galactic radii, since one side of the galaxy will be moving towards our line of sight and one side away.  However, our position in the Galactic midplane of the Milky Way, where dust in molecular clouds [[Extinction (astronomy)|obscures]] most optical light in many directions, made obtaining our own rotation curve technically difficult until the discovery of the [[21 cm line|21 cm hydrogen line]] in the 1930s.

To confirm the rotation of our galaxy prior to this, in 1927 [[Jan Oort]] derived a way to measure the Galactic rotation from just a small fraction of stars in the local neighborhood.&lt;ref name="oort1927"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = J. H. Oort | journal = Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands | date = 1927-04-14 | volume = 3 | issue = 120 | title = Observational evidence confirming Lindblad's hypothesis of a rotation of the galactic system | pages = 275–282 | postscript = .|bibcode = 1927BAN.....3..275O }}&lt;/ref&gt; As described below, the values he found for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; proved not only that the Galaxy was rotating but also that it rotates [[Differential rotation|differentially]], or as a fluid rather than a solid body.

==Derivation==
[[File:Oort constants derivation diagram.jpg|frame|right|Figure 1: Geometry of the Oort constants derivation, with a field star close to the Sun in the midplane of the Galaxy.]]

Consider a star in the midplane of the Galactic disk with [[Galactic longitude]] &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; from the Sun.  Assume that both the star and the Sun have [[circular orbit]]s around the center of the Galaxy at radii of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; from the [[galactic center]] and rotational velocities of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  The motion of the star along our line of sight, or ''[[radial velocity]]'', and motion of the star across the plane of the sky, or ''[[Proper motion|transverse velocity]]'', as observed from the position of the Sun are then:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=V_{\text{star, r}}-V_{\text{sun, r}}=V\cos\left(\alpha\right)-V_{0}\sin\left(l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=V_{\text{star, t}}-V_{\text{sun, t}}=V\sin\left(\alpha\right)-V_{0}\cos\left(l\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the assumption of circular motion, the rotational velocity is related to the [[angular velocity]] by &lt;math&gt;v=\Omega r&lt;/math&gt; and we can substitute this into the velocity expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=\Omega R\cos\left(\alpha\right)-\Omega_{0}R_{0}\sin\left(l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=\Omega R\sin\left(\alpha\right)-\Omega_{0}R_{0}\cos\left(l\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry in Figure 1, one can see that the triangles formed between the galactic center, the Sun, and the star share a side or portions of sides, so the following relationships hold and substitutions can be made:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; R\cos\left(\alpha\right)=R_{0}\sin\left(l\right)   \\
&amp; R\sin\left(\alpha\right)=R_{0}\cos\left(l\right)-d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and with these we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=\left(\Omega-\Omega_{0}\right)R_{0}\sin\left(l\right)          \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=\left(\Omega-\Omega_{0}\right)R_{0}\cos\left(l\right)-\Omega d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To put these expressions only in terms of the known quantities &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, we take a [[Taylor expansion]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega-\Omega_{0}&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\left(\Omega-\Omega_{0}\right)=\left(R-R_{0}\right)\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}+...&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, we take advantage of the assumption that the stars used for this analysis are ''local'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;R-R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is small, and the distance d to the star is smaller than &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and we take:
::&lt;math&gt;R-R_{0}=-d \cdot \cos\left(l\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |year=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0 |oclc=39108765}}&lt;/ref&gt;
So:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d \cdot \cos\left(l\right)\sin\left(l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d \cdot \cos^{2}\left(l\right)-\Omega d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the sine and cosine [[List of trigonometric identities#Double-.2C triple-.2C and half-angle formulae|half angle formulae]], these velocities may be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d\frac{\sin\left(2l\right)}{2} \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d\frac{\left(\cos\left(2l\right)+1\right)}{2}-\Omega d=-R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}d\frac{\cos\left(2l\right)}{2}+\left(-\frac{1}{2}R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}-\Omega\right)d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Writing the velocities in terms of our known quantities and two coefficients &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=Ad\sin\left(2l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=Ad\cos\left(2l\right)+Bd \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=-\frac{1}{2}R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}} \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}R_{0}\frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}-\Omega \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

At this stage, the observable velocities are related to these coefficients and the position of the star. It is now possible to relate these coefficients to the rotation properties of the galaxy. For a star in a circular orbit, we can express the derivative of the angular velocity with respect to radius in terms of the rotation velocity and radius and evaluate this at the location of the Sun:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; \Omega=\frac{v}{r} \\
&amp; \frac{d\Omega}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}=\frac{d(v/r)}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}=-\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}^{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{0}}\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
so
[[File:OortConstant'sLeiden2017.jpg|thumb|Oort constants on a wall in Leiden]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the Oort constant describing the shearing motion and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the Oort constant describing the rotation of the Galaxy.  As described below, one can measure &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; from plotting these velocities, measured for many stars, against the galactic longitudes of these stars.

==Measurements==
[[File:Oortmeasure.jpg|frame|right|Figure 2: Measuring the Oort constants by fitting to large data sets. Note that this graph erroneously shows B as positive. A negative B value contributes a westerly component to the transverse velocities.]]

As mentioned in an intermediate step in the derivation above:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; V_{\text{obs, r}}=A\,d\,\sin\left(2l\right) \\
&amp; V_{\text{obs, t}}=A\,d\,\cos\left(2l\right)+B\,d \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can write the Oort constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; A=\frac{V_{\text{obs, r}}}{d\,\sin\left(2l\right)} \\
&amp; B=\frac{V_{\text{obs, t}}}{d}-A\,\cos\left(2l\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Oort constants can be expressed in terms of the radial and transverse velocities, distances, and galactic longitudes of objects in our Galaxy - all of which are, in principle, observable quantities.

However, there are a number of complications. The simple derivation above assumed that both the Sun and the object in question are traveling on circular orbits about the Galactic center. This is not true for the Sun (the Sun's velocity relative to the [[local standard of rest]] is approximately 13.4&amp;nbsp;km/s),&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; and not necessarily true for other objects in the Milky Way either. The derivation also implicitly assumes that the gravitational potential of the Milky Way is [[axisymmetric]] and always directed towards the center. This ignores the effects of [[Spiral galaxy|spiral arms]] and the Galaxy's [[Barred spiral galaxy|bar]]. Finally, both [[Proper motion|transverse velocity]] and [[Cosmic distance ladder|distance]] are notoriously difficult to measure for objects which are not relatively nearby.

Since the non-circular component of the Sun's velocity is known, it can be subtracted out from our observations to compensate. We do not know, however, the non-circular components of the velocity of each individual star we observe, so they cannot be compensated for in this way. But, if we plot transverse velocity divided by distance against galactic longitude for a large sample of stars, we know from the equations above that they will follow a sine function. The non-circular velocities will introduce scatter around this line, but with a large enough sample the true function can be fit for and the values of the Oort constants measured, as shown in figure 2. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is simply the amplitude of the sinusoid and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical offset from zero.  Measuring transverse velocities and distances accurately and without biases remains challenging, though, and sets of derived values for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; frequently disagree.

Most methods of measuring &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are fundamentally similar, following the above patterns. The major differences usually lie in what sorts of objects are used and details of how distance or proper motion are measured. Oort, in his original 1927 paper deriving the constants, obtained &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 31.0 ± 3.7&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. He did not explicitly obtain a value for &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, but from his conclusion that the Galaxy was nearly in Keplerian rotation (as in example 2 below), we can presume he would have gotten a value of around -10&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=oort1927 /&gt; These differ significantly from modern values, which is indicative of the difficulty of measuring these constants. Measurements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; since that time have varied widely; in 1964 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] adopted &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 15&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -10&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as standard values.&lt;ref name="kerr86" /&gt; Although more recent measurements continue to vary, they tend to lie near these values.&lt;ref name="Branham10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branham|first=Richard|title=Kinematics and velocity ellipsoid of the F giants|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=409|issue=3|pages=1269–1280|date=September 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17389.x|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17389.x|accessdate=2010-11-22|bibcode=2010MNRAS.409.1269B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olling03"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olling|first=Rob|author2=Dehnen, Walter|title=The Oort constants measured from proper motions|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 December 2003|volume=599|issue=1|pages=275–296|doi=10.1086/379278|bibcode=2003ApJ...599..275O|arxiv = astro-ph/0301486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobylev10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobylev|first=Vadim|author2=Bajkova, Anisa|title=Galactic parameters from masers with trigonometric parallaxes|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=November 2010|volume=408|issue=3|pages=1788–1795|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17244.x|bibcode=2010MNRAS.408.1788B|arxiv = 1006.5152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hipparcos]] satellite, launched in 1989, was the first space-based [[Astrometry|astrometric]] mission, and its precise measurements of parallax and [[proper motion]] have enabled much better measurements of the Oort constants. In 1997 Hipparcos data were used to derive the values &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 14.82 ± 0.84&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -12.37 ± 0.64&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Feast97" /&gt; The [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] spacecraft, launched in 2013, is an updated successor to Hipparcos; which allowed new levels of accuracy in measuring four Oort constants &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = 15.3 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = -11.9 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = -3.2 ± 0.4&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = -3.3 ± 0.6&amp;nbsp;km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bovy17" /&gt;

With the Gaia values, we find
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{dv}{dr}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}=-A-B=-3.4\text{ km/s/kpc} \\
&amp; \frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}=\Omega=A-B=27.2\text{ km/s/kpc} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This value of Ω corresponds to a period of 226 million years for the sun's present neighborhood to go around the Milky Way. However, the time it takes for the sun to go around the Milky Way (a [[galactic year]]) may be longer because (in a simple model) it is circulating around a point further from the centre of the galaxy where Ω is smaller (see [[Sun#Orbit in Milky Way]]).

The values in km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; can be converted into [[milliarcsecond]]s per year by dividing by 4.740. This gives the following values for the average [[proper motion]] of stars in our neighborhood at different galactic longitudes, after correction for the effect due to the sun's velocity with respect to the local standard of rest:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Galactic longitude!!Constellation !!average proper motion!! [[milliarcsecond|mas]]/year!!approximate direction
|-
| 0°|| [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] || B+A  || 0.7 ||north-east
|-
| 45°|| [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]  || B || 2.5 ||south-west
|-
| 90°|| [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] || B−A || 5.7 || west
|-
| 135°|| [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] || B || 2.5 || west

|-
| 315°|| [[Centaurus (constellation)|Centaurus]] || B || 2.5 || west
|-
|}
The motion of the sun towards the [[solar apex]] in Hercules adds a generally westward component to the observed proper motions of stars around Vela or Centaurus and a generally eastward component for stars around Cygnus or Cassiopeia. This effect falls off with distance, so the values in the table are more representative for stars that are further away. On the other hand, more distant stars or objects will not follow the table, which is for objects in our neighborhood. For example, [[Sagittarius A*]], the radio source at the centre of the galaxy, will have a proper motion of approximately Ω or 5.7 mas/y southwestward (with a small adjustment due to the sun's motion toward the solar apex) even though it is in Sagittarius. Note that these proper motions cannot be measured against "background stars" (because the background stars will have similar proper motions), but must be measured against more stationary references such as [[quasar]]s.

== Meaning ==
[[File:Rotation curve eqs.jpg|frame|right|Figure 3: Diagram of the various [[rotation curve]]s in a galaxy]]
The Oort constants can greatly enlighten one as to how the Galaxy rotates. As one can see &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are both functions of the Sun's orbital velocity as well as the first derivative of the Sun's velocity. As a result, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; describes the shearing motion in the disk surrounding the Sun, while &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; describes the angular momentum gradient in the solar neighborhood, also referred to as [[vorticity]].

To illuminate this point, one can look at three examples that describe how stars and gas orbit within the Galaxy giving intuition as to the meaning of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. These three examples are solid body rotation, Keplerian rotation and constant rotation over different annuli. These three types of rotation are plotted as a function of radius (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;), and are shown in Figure 3 as the green, blue and red curves respectively. The grey curve is approximately the [[rotation curve]] of the [[Milky Way]].

===Solid body rotation===
To begin, let one assume that the rotation of the [[Milky Way]] can be described by solid body rotation, as shown by the green curve in Figure 3. Solid body rotation assumes that the entire system is moving as a rigid body with no [[differential rotation]]. This results in a constant [[angular velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, which is independent of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Following this we can see that velocity scales linearly with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; v \propto r&lt;/math&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\frac{d v}{dr}  =\frac{v}{r}= \Omega \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the two Oort constant identities, one then can determine what the &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; constants would be,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; A= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega_{0} R_{0}}{R_{0}}-{\Omega}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=0 \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega_{0}R_{0}}{R_{0}}+{\Omega}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=-\Omega_{0} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This demonstrates that in solid body rotation, there is no shear motion, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the vorticity is just the angular rotation, &lt;math&gt;B=-\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. This is what one would expect because there is no difference in orbital velocity as radius increases, thus no stress between the annuli. Also, in solid body rotation, the only rotation is about the center, so it is reasonable that the resulting vorticity in the system is described by the only rotation in the system. One can actually measure and find that is non-zero (&lt;math&gt;A=14&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Feast97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feast|first=M.|author2=Whitelock, P.|title=Galactic Kinematics of Cepheids from HIPPARCOS Proper Motions|journal=MNRAS|date=November 1997|volume=291|pages=683–693|arxiv=astro-ph/9706293|bibcode = 1997MNRAS.291..683F|doi=10.1093/mnras/291.4.683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kerr86"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=F. J|author2=Lynden-Bell, D.|title=Review of Galactic Constants|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=15 August 1986|volume=221|pages=1023–1038|bibcode = 1986MNRAS.221.1023K|doi=10.1093/mnras/221.4.1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus the galaxy does not rotate as a solid body in our local neighborhood, but may in the inner regions of the Galaxy.

===Keplerian rotation===
The second illuminating example is to assume that the orbits in the local neighborhood follow a [[Keplerian orbit]], as shown by the blue line in Figure 3. The orbital motion in a Keplerian orbit is described by,
:&lt;math&gt; v=\sqrt{ \frac{G M}{r} } &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravitational Constant]], and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass enclosed within radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative of the velocity with respect to the radius is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d v}{dr}  = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{R^3} }=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{v}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

The Oort constants can then be written as follows,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+\frac{v}{2r}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)= \frac{3V_{0}}{4R_{0}} \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-\frac{v}{2r}\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=-\frac{1V_{0}}{4R_{0}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For values of Solar velocity, &lt;math&gt;V_{0}=218&lt;/math&gt; km/s, and radius to the [[Galactic center]], &lt;math&gt;R_{0}=8&lt;/math&gt; kpc,&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; the Oort's constants are &lt;math&gt;A= 20&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B=-7&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the observed values are &lt;math&gt;A=14&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = -12&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Feast97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kerr86" /&gt; Thus, Keplerian rotation is not the best description the [[Milky Way]] rotation.  Furthermore, although this example does not describe the local rotation, it can be thought of as the limiting case that describes the minimum velocity an object can have in a stable orbit.

===Flat rotation curve===
The final example is to assume that the rotation curve of the Galaxy is flat, i.e. &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is constant and independent of radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The rotation velocity is in between that of a solid body and of Keplerian rotation, and is the red dottedline in Figure 3. With a constant velocity, it follows that the radial derivative of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is 0, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dr}=0&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore the Oort constants are,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
&amp; A=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}-0\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\right) \\
&amp; B=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}+0\Bigg\vert_{R_{0}}\right)=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V_{0}}{R_{0}}\right) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the local velocity and radius given in the last example, one finds &lt;math&gt;A= 13.6&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=-13.6&lt;/math&gt; km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is close to the actual measured Oort constants and tells us that the constant-speed model is the closest of these three to reality in the solar neighborhood. But in fact, as mentioned above, &lt;math&gt;-A-B&lt;/math&gt; is negative, meaning that at our distance, speed decreases with distance from the centre of the galaxy.

What one should take away from these three examples, is that with a remarkably simple model, the rotation of the [[Milky Way]] can be described by these two constants. The first two examples are used as constraints to the Galactic rotation, for they show the fastest and slowest the Galaxy can rotate at a given radius. The flat rotation curve serves as an intermediate step between the two rotation curves, and in fact gives the most reasonable Oort constants as compared to current measurements.

== Uses ==
One of the major uses of the Oort constants is to calibrate the galactic rotation curve. A relative curve can be derived from studying the motions of gas clouds in the Milky Way, but to calibrate the actual absolute speeds involved requires knowledge of V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; We know that:

:&lt;math&gt;V_0 = R_0(A-B)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Since R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be determined by other means (such as by carefully tracking the motions of stars near the Milky Way's [[Sagittarius A*|central supermassive black hole]]),&lt;ref name="Eisenhauer03"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenhauer|first=F.|display-authors=etal |title=A Geometric Determination of the Distance to the Galactic Center|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=November 2003|volume=597|issue=2|pages=121–124|doi=10.1086/380188|bibcode=2003ApJ...597L.121E | arxiv=astro-ph/0306220}}&lt;/ref&gt; knowing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; allows us to determine V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

It can also be shown that the mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho_R&lt;/math&gt; can be given by:&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_R = \frac{B^2 - A^2}{2 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt;

So the Oort constants can tell us something about the mass density at a given radius in the disk. They are also useful to constrain mass distribution models for the Galaxy.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; As well, in the epicyclic approximation for nearly circular stellar orbits in a disk, the [[epicyclic frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2 = -4B\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galaxies in the Universe|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-67186-6|author=Sparke, L|author2=Gallagher, J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Oort constants can tell us a great deal about motions in the galaxy.

A '''pH meter''' is a [[scientific instrument]] that measures the [[hydrogen-ion]] [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] in [[Aqueous solution|water-based solutions]], indicating its [[acidity]] or [[alkalinity]] expressed as [[pH]].&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|title=pH meter|date=2016|website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/technology/pH-meter|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pH meter measures the difference in [[electrical potential]] between a pH electrode and a reference electrode, and so the pH meter is sometimes referred to as a "potentiometric pH meter". The difference in electrical potential relates to the acidity or pH of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (2 ed.), ed. Richard Cammack, Teresa Atwood, Peter Campbell, Howard Parish, Anthony Smith, Frank Vella, and John Stirling, Oxford University Press 2006, {{ISBN|9780198529170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pH meter is used in many applications ranging from [[Experimentation|laboratory experimentation]] to [[quality control]].&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite web|title=pH Measurement and Value|url=http://www.globalw.com/support/ph-measurement.html|website=Global Water|publisher=Xylem, Inc.|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- this diagram is inadequate as there should be three knobs: calibrate, slope and temperature.
[[Image:PH_Meter_01.JPG|thumbnail|A simple pH meter with its probe immersed in a mildly basic solution. The two knobheads are used to calibrate the instrument.]] --&gt;

==Applications==
The rate and outcome of chemical reactions taking place in water often depends on the acidity of the water, and it is therefore useful to know the acidity of the water, typically measured by means of a pH meter.&lt;ref name="Brittanica1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Ronald Percy|title=Acid-Base Reaction|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/acid-base-reaction|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of pH is useful or critical in many situations, including [[chemical laboratory]] analyses. pH meters are used for [[soil]] measurements in [[agriculture]], [[water quality]] for [[municipal water]] supplies, [[swimming pools]], [[environmental remediation]]; [[brewing]] of wine or beer; [[manufacturing]], healthcare and clinical applications such as [[blood chemistry]]; and many other applications.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

Advances in the instrumentation and in [[detection]] have expanded the number of applications in which pH measurements can be conducted. The devices have been [[miniaturized]], enabling direct measurement of pH inside of [[living cells]].&lt;ref name="MMB2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loiselle|first1=F.B.|last2=Casey|first2=J.R.|title=Measurement of Intracellular pH|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|date=2010|volume=637|page=311|doi=10.1007/978-1-60761-700-6_17|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|isbn=978-1-60761-699-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to measuring the pH of liquids, specially designed electrodes are available to measure the pH of semi-solid substances, such as foods. These have tips suitable for piercing semi-solids, have electrode materials compatible with ingredients in food, and are resistant to clogging.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=pH Measurement Handbook|url=http://www.pragolab.cz/files/aktuality/2015-03/pH-Measurement-Handbook.pdf|website=PragoLab|publisher=Thermo Scientific, Inc.|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and use==
[[File:George Garcelon using Beckman pH meter 2004.012.020.tif| thumb | right| 300px| Using an early Beckman pH meter in a lab]]

===Principle of operation===
[[Potentiometric]] pH meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding pH value. They comprise a simple electronic amplifier and a pair of electrodes, or alternatively a combination electrode, and some form of display calibrated in pH units. It usually has a [[glass electrode]] and a [[reference electrode]], or a combination electrode. The electrodes, or probes, are inserted into the solution to be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Riddle|title=pH meters and their electrodes: calibration, maintenance and use|journal=The Biomedical Scientist|date=2013|volume=April|pages=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the electrodes is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the [[Nernst equation]].

The [[reference electrode]] is insensitive to the pH of the solution, being composed of a metallic conductor, which connects to the display.  This conductor is immersed in an electrolyte solution, typically potassium chloride, which comes into contact with the test solution through a porous ceramic membrane.&lt;ref name="Seafriends"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anthoni|first1=J. Floor|title=pH Meter Principles|url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/dda/ph.htm|website=seafriends.org|publisher=Seafriends Marine Conservation and Education Centre|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The display consists of a [[voltmeter]], which displays voltage in units of pH.&lt;ref name="Seafriends" /&gt;

On immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution, an [[electrical circuit]] is completed, in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter. The circuit can be thought of as going from the conductive element of the reference electrode to the surrounding potassium-chloride solution, through the ceramic membrane to the test solution, the hydrogen-ion-selective glass of the glass electrode, to the solution inside the glass electrode, to the silver of the glass electrode, and finally the voltmeter of the display device.&lt;ref name="Seafriends" /&gt; The voltage varies from test solution to test solution depending on the potential difference created by the difference in hydrogen-ion concentrations on each side of the glass membrane between the test solution and the solution inside the glass electrode.  All other potential differences in the circuit do not vary with pH and are corrected for by means of the calibration.&lt;ref name="Seafriends" /&gt;

For simplicity, many pH meters use a combination probe, constructed with the glass electrode and the reference electrode contained within a single probe. A detailed description of combination electrodes is given in the article on [[glass electrode]]s.&lt;ref name="Vanysek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vanýsek|first1=Petr|title=The Glass pH Electrode|url=https://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum04/IF6-04-Pages19-20.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=Interface|issue=Summer|publisher=The Electrochemical Society|date=2004|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pH meter is [[calibrated]] with solutions of known pH, typically before each use, to ensure [[accuracy]] of measurement.&lt;ref name=magub&gt;[http://bitesizebio.com/8750/how-to-care-for-your-ph-meter/ Bitesize Bio: How to Care for Your pH Meter], Steffi Magub, 18 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  To measure the pH of a solution, the electrodes are used as probes, which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrate]] with the [[ions]] on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode. This equilibration provides a stable pH measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theory and Practice of pH Measurement|url=http://www.emerson.com/resource/blob/70736/dc7766471ccd3e4d6fe257f75c4f2053/manual--theory-and-practice-of-ph-measurement-data.pdf|website=Emerson Process Management|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH electrode and reference electrode design===
Details of the fabrication and resulting microstructure of the glass membrane of the pH electrode are maintained as [[trade secrets]] by the manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Galster"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galster|first1=Helmuth|title=pH Measurement: Fundamentals, Methods, Applications, Instrumentation|date=1991|publisher=VCH Publishers, Inc.|location=Weinheim|isbn=3-527-28237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}} However, certain aspects of design are published. Glass is a solid electrolyte, for which alkali-metal ions can carry current. The pH-sensitive glass membrane is generally spherical to simplify manufacture of a uniform membrane. These membranes are up to 0.4 millimeters in thickness, thicker than original designs, so as to render the probes durable. The glass has [[silicate]] [[chemical function]]ality on its surface, which provides binding sites for alkali-metal ions and hydrogen ions from the solutions. This provides an ion-exchange capacity in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mol/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Selectivity for hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) arises from a balance of ionic charge, volume requirements versus other ions, and the coordination number of other ions. Electrode manufacturers have developed compositions that suitably balance these factors, most notably lithium glass.&lt;ref name="Galster" /&gt;{{rp|113–139}}

The [[silver chloride electrode]] is most commonly used as a [[reference electrode]] in pH meters, although some designs use the [[saturated calomel electrode]]. The silver chloride electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high [[reproducibility]]. The reference electrode usually consists of a platinum wire that has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, which serves as a contact to the test solution, providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions.&lt;ref name="Galster" /&gt;{{rp|76–91}}

With these electrode designs, the voltmeter is detecting potential differences of ±1400 millivolts.&lt;ref name="Bye"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Potentiometric pH Meter|journal=Journal of Scientific Instruments|date=1962|volume=39|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrodes are further designed to rapidly equilibrate with test solutions to facilitate [[ease of use]]. The equilibration times are typically less than one second, although equilibration times increase as the electrodes age.&lt;ref name="Galster" /&gt;{{rp|164}}

===Maintenance===
Because of the sensitivity of the electrodes to contaminants, cleanliness of the probes is essential for [[accuracy and precision]]. Probes are generally kept moist when not in use with a medium appropriate for the particular probe, which is typically an aqueous solution available from probe manufacturers.&lt;ref name=magub/&gt;&lt;ref name=mrc/&gt; Probe manufacturers provide instructions for cleaning and maintaining their probe designs.&lt;ref name=magub/&gt; For illustration, one maker of laboratory-grade pH gives cleaning instructions for specific contaminants: general cleaning (15-minute soak in a solution of bleach and detergent), salt (hydrochloric acid solution followed by sodium hydroxide and water), grease (detergent or methanol), clogged reference junction (KCl solution), protein deposits (pepsin and HCl, 1% solution), and air bubbles.&lt;ref name=mrc&gt;[http://mrclab.com/media/uploads/ph_electrode_maintenance.pdf MRC lab: How to Store, Clean, and Recondition pH Electrodes].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph-meter.info/pH-electrode-cleaning Cleaning electrodes].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calibration and operation===
[[File:PH Meter 01.jpg|thumb|5.739 pH/Ion at 23 °C temperature shown on photo. pH 7110 pH meter manufactured by inoLab]]
The [[German Institute for Standardization]] publishes a standard for pH measurement using pH meters, DIN 19263.&lt;ref name="DIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=pH Measurement - pH Measuring Chains|url=https://www.beuth.de/de/norm/din-19263/96105863|website=Beuth publishing DIN|publisher=Beuth Verlag GmbH|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very precise measurements necessitate that the pH meter is calibrated before each measurement. More typically calibration is performed once per day of operation. Calibration is needed because the glass electrode does not give reproducible [[electrostatic potential]]s over longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="Galster" /&gt;{{rp|238–239}}

Consistent with principles of [[good laboratory practice]], calibration is performed with at least two standard [[buffer solution]]s that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the [[temperature dependence]] of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature [[thermocouples]] in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06&amp;nbsp;volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with [[distilled water]] or [[deionized water]] to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.&lt;ref name="all-about-pH"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to perform a pH meter calibration|url=http://www.all-about-ph.com/ph-meter-calibration.html|website=all-about-pH.com|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of pH meters==
[[Image:2009-03-30 Red pH meter reads 4.96.jpg|thumb|right|A simple pH meter]]
[[Image:Soil pH meter.jpg|thumb|right|Soil pH meter]]

pH meters range from simple and inexpensive pen-like devices to complex and expensive laboratory instruments with computer interfaces and several inputs for indicator and temperature measurements to be entered to adjust for the variation in pH caused by temperature. The output can be digital or analog, and the devices can be [[battery-powered]] or rely on [[line power]]. Some versions use telemetry to connect the electrodes to the voltmeter display device.&lt;ref name="Galster" /&gt;{{rp|197–215}}

==History==
[[File:Here's the new Beckman Pocket pH Meter 2012.002 b49f13 001.tif | thumb| right| "Here's the new Beckman Pocket pH Meter", 1956]]

The concept of pH was defined in 1909 by [[S. P. L. Sørensen]], and electrodes were used for pH measurement in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Determinants&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travis|first1=Anthony S.|last2=Schröter|first2=H.G.|last3=Homburg|first3=E.|last4=Morris|first4=P.J.T.|title=Determinants in the evolution of the European chemical industry : 1900-1939 : new technologies, political frameworks, markets and companies|date=1998|publisher=Kluwer Acad.

In October 1934 [[Arnold Orville Beckman]] registered the first patent for a complete chemical instrument for the measurement of pH, U.S. Patent No. 2,058,761, for his "acidimeter", later renamed the pH meter. Beckman developed the prototype as an assistant professor of chemistry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], when asked to devise a quick and accurate method for measuring the acidity of [[lemon]] juice for the [[California Fruit Growers Exchange]] ([[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]]). On April 8, 1935, Beckman's renamed [[National Technical Laboratories]] focused on the manufacture of scientific instruments, with the Arthur H. Thomas Company as a distributor for its pH meter.&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-941901-23-9 |author1=Arnold Thackray  |author2=Minor Myers, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |others = foreword by James D.

The [[Radiometer (company)|Radiometer]] Corporation of Denmark was founded in 1935, and began marketing a pH meter for medical use around 1936, but "the development of automatic pH-meters for industrial purposes was neglected. Instead American instrument makers successfully developed industrial pH-meters with a wide variety of applications, such as in breweries, paper works, alum works, and water treatment systems."&lt;ref name=Determinants/&gt;

In the 1970s Jenco Electronics of [[Taiwan]] designed and manufactured the first portable digital pH meter.

==Building a pH meter==
Specialized manufacturing is required for the electrodes, and details of their design and construction are typically trade secrets.&lt;ref name="Galster" /&gt;{{rp|125}} However, with purchase of suitable electrodes, a standard [[multimeter]] can be used to complete the construction of the pH meter.&lt;ref name="Simple"&gt;{{cite web|title=Building the Simplest Possible pH Meter|url=http://www.66pacific.com/ph/simplest-ph.aspx|website=66pacific.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, commercial suppliers offer voltmeter displays that simplify use, including calibration and temperature compensation.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34136">A '''pragmatic theory of truth''' is a [[theory of truth]] within the philosophies of [[pragmatism]] and [[pragmaticism]]. Pragmatic theories of truth were first posited by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]]. The common features of these theories are a reliance on the ''[[pragmatic maxim]]'' as a means of clarifying the meanings of difficult concepts such as ''truth''; and an emphasis on the fact that ''[[belief]]'', ''[[certainty]]'', ''[[knowledge]]'', or ''[[truth]]'' is the result of an [[inquiry]].

==Background==

Pragmatic theories of truth developed from the earlier ideas of [[ancient philosophy]], the [[Scholastics]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].  Pragmatic ideas about truth are often confused with the quite distinct notions of "logic and inquiry", "judging what is true", and "truth predicates".

===Logic and inquiry===

In one classical formulation, truth is defined as the good of [[logic]], where logic is a [[normative science]], that is, an [[inquiry]] into a ''good'' or a ''[[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]'' that seeks [[knowledge]] of it and the means to achieve it.  In this view, truth cannot be discussed to much effect outside the context of inquiry, knowledge, and logic, all very broadly considered.

Most inquiries into the character of truth begin with a notion of an informative, meaningful, or significant element, the truth of whose information, meaning, or significance may be put into question and needs to be evaluated.  Depending on the context, this element might be called an ''artefact'', ''expression'', ''image'', ''impression'', ''lyric'', ''mark'', ''performance'', ''picture'', ''sentence'', ''sign'', ''string'', ''symbol'', ''text'', ''thought'', ''token'', ''utterance'', ''word'', ''work'', and so on.  Whatever the case, one has the task of judging whether the bearers of information, meaning, or significance are indeed [[truthbearer|truth-bearers]].  This judgment is typically expressed in the form of a specific ''truth predicate'', whose positive application to a sign, or so on, asserts that the sign is true.

===Judging what is true===

Considered within the broadest horizon, there is little reason to imagine that the process of judging a ''work'', that leads to a predication of false or true, is necessarily amenable to formalization, and it may always remain what is commonly called a ''judgment call''.  But there are indeed many well-circumscribed domains where it is useful to consider disciplined forms of evaluation, and the observation of these limits allows for the institution of what is called a ''[[wikt:method|method]]'' of judging truth and falsity.

One of the first questions that can be asked in this setting is about the relationship between the significant performance and its reflective critique.  If one expresses oneself in a particular fashion, and someone says "that's true", is there anything useful at all that can be said in general terms about the relationship between these two acts?  For instance, does the critique add value to the expression criticized, does it say something significant in its own right, or is it just an insubstantial echo of the original sign?

===Truth predicates===

Theories of truth may be described according to several dimensions of description that affect the character of the predicate "true".  The truth predicates that are used in different theories may be classified by the number of things that have to be mentioned in order to assess the truth of a sign, counting the sign itself as the first thing.

In formal logic, this number is called the ''[[arity]]'' of the predicate. The kinds of truth predicates may then be subdivided according to any number of more specific characters that various theorists recognize as important.

# A ''monadic'' truth predicate is one that applies to its main subject — typically a concrete representation or its abstract content — independently of reference to anything else.  In this case one can say that a [[truthbearer]] is true in and of itself.
# A ''dyadic'' truth predicate is one that applies to its main subject only in reference to something else, a second subject.  Most commonly, the auxiliary subject is either an ''object'', an ''interpreter'', or a ''language'' to which the representation bears some [[relation (mathematics)|relation]].
# A ''triadic'' truth predicate is one that applies to its main subject only in reference to a second and a third subject.  For example, in a pragmatic theory of truth, one has to specify both the object of the sign, and either its interpreter or another sign called the ''interpretant'' before one can say that the sign is true ''of'' its object ''to'' its interpreting agent or sign.

Several qualifications must be kept in mind with respect to any such radically simple scheme of classification, as real practice seldom presents any pure types, and there are settings in which it is useful to speak of a theory of truth that is "almost" ''k''-adic, or that "would be" ''k''-adic if certain details can be abstracted away and neglected in a particular context of discussion.  That said, given the generic division of truth predicates according to their arity, further species can be differentiated within each genus according to a number of more refined features.

The truth predicate of interest in a typical [[correspondence theory of truth]] tells of a relation between representations and objective states of affairs, and is therefore expressed, for the most part, by a dyadic predicate.  In general terms, one says that a representation is ''true of'' an objective situation, more briefly, that a sign is true of an object.  The nature of the correspondence may vary from theory to theory in this family.  The correspondence can be fairly arbitrary or it can take on the character of an ''[[analogy]]'', an ''[[icon]]'', or a ''[[morphism]]'', whereby a representation is rendered true of its object by the existence of corresponding elements and a similar structure.

==Peirce==
{{Main|Charles Sanders Peirce}}

Very little in Peirce's thought can be understood in its proper light without understanding that he thinks all thoughts are signs, and thus, according to his theory of thought, no thought is understandable outside the context of a [[sign relation]].  Sign relations taken collectively are the subject matter of a [[theory]] of [[sign (semiotic)|sign]]s.  So Peirce's ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: logic, or semiotic|semiotic]]'', his theory of sign relations, is key to understanding his entire philosophy of pragmatic thinking and thought.

In his contribution to the article "Truth and Falsity and Error" for [[James Mark Baldwin|Baldwin]]'s ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' (1901),&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–720 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce defines truth in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.  (Peirce 1901, see ''Collected Papers'' (CP) 5.565).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement emphasizes Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce occasionally uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he follows long tradition in relegating to a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That truth is the correspondence of a representation with its object is, as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] says, merely the nominal definition of it.  Truth belongs exclusively to propositions.  A proposition has a subject (or set of subjects) and a predicate.  The subject is a sign;  the predicate is a sign;  and the proposition is a sign that the predicate is a sign of that of which the subject is a sign.  If it be so, it is true.  But what does this correspondence or reference of the sign, to its object, consist in?  (Peirce 1906, CP 5.553).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Peirce makes a statement that is decisive for understanding the relationship between his pragmatic definition of truth and any theory of truth that leaves it solely and simply a matter of representations corresponding with their objects.  Peirce, like Kant before him, recognizes [[Aristotle]]'s distinction between a ''[[nominal definition]]'', a definition in name only, and a ''[[real definition]]'', one that states the function of the concept, the [[vera causa|reason]] for conceiving it, and so indicates the ''[[essence]]'', the underlying ''[[Substance theory|substance]]'' of its object.  This tells us the sense in which Peirce entertained a ''[[correspondence theory of truth]]'', namely, a purely nominal sense.  To get beneath the superficiality of the nominal definition it is necessary to analyze the notion of correspondence in greater depth.

In preparing for this task, Peirce makes use of an allegorical story, omitted here, the moral of which is that there is no use seeking a conception of truth that we cannot conceive ourselves being able to capture in a humanly conceivable concept.  So we might as well proceed on the assumption that we have a real hope of comprehending the answer, of being able to "handle the truth" when the time comes.  Bearing that in mind, the problem of defining truth reduces to the following form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now thought is of the nature of a sign.  In that case, then, if we can find out the right method of thinking and can follow it out — the right method of transforming signs — then truth can be nothing more nor less than the last result to which the following out of this method would ultimately carry us.  In that case, that to which the representation should conform, is itself something in the nature of a representation, or sign — something noumenal, intelligible, conceivable, and utterly unlike a thing-in-itself.  (Peirce 1906, CP 5.553).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce's theory of truth depends on two other, intimately related subject matters, his theory of ''[[sign relation]]s'' and his theory of ''[[inquiry]]''.  Inquiry is a special case of ''[[semiosis]]'', a process that transforms signs into signs while maintaining a specific relationship to an object, which object may be located outside the trajectory of signs or else be found at the end of it.  Inquiry includes all forms of [[belief revision]] and [[logical inference]], including ''[[scientific method]]'', what Peirce here means by "the right method of transforming signs".  A sign-to-sign transaction relating to an object is a transaction that involves three parties, or a relation that involves three roles.  This is called a ''[[triadic relation|ternary or triadic relation]]'' in logic.  Consequently, pragmatic theories of truth are largely expressed in terms of triadic truth predicates.

The statement above tells us one more thing:  Peirce, having started out in accord with Kant, is here giving notice that he is parting ways with the Kantian idea that the ultimate object of a representation is an unknowable ''[[thing-in-itself]]''.  Peirce would say that the object is knowable, in fact, it is known in the form of its representation, however imperfectly or partially.

''Reality'' and ''truth'' are coordinate concepts in pragmatic thinking, each being defined in relation to the other, and both together as they participate in the time evolution of inquiry.  Inquiry is not a disembodied process, nor the occupation of a singular individual, but the common life of an unbounded community.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you.  Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a COMMUNITY, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge.  (Peirce 1868, CP 5.311).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Different minds may set out with the most antagonistic views, but the progress of investigation carries them by a force outside of themselves to one and the same conclusion.  This activity of thought by which we are carried, not where we wish, but to a foreordained goal, is like the operation of destiny.  No modification of the point of view taken, no selection of other facts for study, no natural bent of mind even, can enable a man to escape the predestinate opinion.  This great law is embodied in the conception of truth and reality.  The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real.  That is the way I would explain reality.  (Peirce 1878, CP 5.407).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William James]]'s version of the pragmatic theory is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJMT&gt;James, William. ''The Meaning of Truth'' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; By this, James meant that truth is a quality the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to actual practice (thus, "pragmatic").   James's pragmatic theory is a synthesis of [[correspondence theory of truth]] and [[coherence theory of truth]], with an added dimension.  Truth is verifiable to the extent that thoughts and statements correspond with actual things, as well as "hangs together," or coheres, fits as pieces of a puzzle might fit together, and these are in turn verified by the observed results of the application of an idea to actual practice.&lt;ref name=WJMT/&gt;&lt;ref name="James_Pragmatism_1907"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking |orig-year=1907 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |year=1981 |ISBN=0-915145-05-7 |first=William |last=James}} Dover 1995: {{ISBN|0-486-28270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, William.  ''A World of Pure Experience'' (1904).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, William. ''Essays in Radical Empiricism'', Ch.3: "The Thing and its Relations" (1912): 92-122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.6, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", p427-428 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; James said that "all true processes must lead to the face of directly verifying sensible experiences somewhere."&lt;ref name="James_Pragmatism_1907_6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lecture 6: Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking |orig-year=1907 |location=New York |first=William |last=James |chapter-url=https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1907/James_1907_06.html |chapter=Pragmatism's Conception of Truth |publisher=Longman Green and Co |pages=76-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} He also extended his pragmatic theory well beyond the scope of scientific verifiability, and even into the realm of the mystical: "On pragmatic principles, if the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, then it is 'true.' "&lt;ref name="James_Pragmatism_1907_8"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking |orig-year=1907 |location=New York |first=William |last=James |chapter-url=https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1907/James_1907_08.html |chapter=Lecture 8: Pragmatism and Religion
 |publisher=Longman Green and Co |pages=105-116}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas.  It means their 'agreement', as falsity means their disagreement, with 'reality'.  Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this definition as a matter of course.  They begin to quarrel only after the question is raised as to what may precisely be meant by the term 'agreement', and what by the term 'reality', when reality is taken as something for our ideas to agree with."&lt;ref name="James_Pragmatism_1907_6"/&gt;{{rp|76}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William James (1907) begins his chapter on "Pragmatism's Conception of Truth"&lt;ref name="James_Pragmatism_1907_6"/&gt; in much the same letter and spirit as the above selection from Peirce (1906), noting the nominal definition of truth as a plausible point of departure, but immediately observing that the pragmatist's quest for the meaning of truth can only begin, not end there.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The popular notion is that a true idea must copy its reality.  Like other popular views, this one follows the analogy of the most usual experience.  Our true ideas of sensible things do indeed copy them. Shut your eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such a true picture or copy of its dial. But your idea of its 'works' (unless you are a clockmaker) is much less of a copy, yet it passes muster, for it in no way clashes with reality.  Even though it should shrink to the mere word 'works', that word still serves you truly; and when you speak of the 'time-keeping function' of the clock, or of its spring's 'elasticity', it is hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy."&lt;ref name="James_Pragmatism_1907_6"/&gt;{{rp|77}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James exhibits a knack for popular expression that Peirce seldom sought, and here his analysis of correspondence by way of a simple thought experiment cuts right to the quick of the first major question to ask about it, namely:  To what extent is the notion of correspondence involved in truth covered by the ideas of analogues, copies, or iconic images of the thing represented?  The answer is that the iconic aspect of correspondence can be taken literally only in regard to sensory experiences of the more precisely eidetic sort.  When it comes to the kind of correspondence that might be said to exist between a symbol, a word like "works", and its object, the springs and catches of the clock on the wall, then the pragmatist recognizes that a more than nominal account of the matter still has a lot more explaining to do.

===Making truth===
Instead of truth being ready-made for us, James asserts we and reality jointly "make" truth. This idea has two senses: (1) truth is mutable, (often attributed to William James and F.C.S. Schiller); and (2) truth is relative to a conceptual scheme (more widely accepted in Pragmatism).

'''(1) Mutability of truth'''

"Truth" is not readily defined in Pragmatism. Can beliefs pass from being ''true'' to being ''untrue'' and back? For James, beliefs are not true until they have been made true by verification. James believed propositions become true over the long term through proving their utility in a person's specific situation. The opposite of this process is not falsification, but rather the belief ceases to be a "live option."  F.C.S. Schiller, on the other hand, clearly asserted beliefs could pass into and out of truth on a situational basis. Schiller held that truth was relative to specific problems. If I want to know how to return home safely, the true answer will be whatever is useful to solving that problem. Later on, when faced with a different problem, what I came to believe with the earlier problem may now be false. As my problems change, and as the most useful way to solve a problem shifts, so does the property of truth.

C.S. Peirce considered the idea that beliefs are true at one time but false at another (or true for one person but false for another) to be one of the "seeds of death"&lt;ref&gt;See Peirce's 1908 "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", final paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; by which James allowed his pragmatism to become "infected." For Peirce the pragmatic view implies theoretical claims should be tied to verification processes (i.e. they should be subject to test). They shouldn't be tied to our specific problems or life needs. Truth is defined, for Peirce, as what ''would'' be the ultimate outcome (not any outcome in real time) of inquiry by a (usually scientific) community of investigators. William James, while agreeing with this definition, also characterized truthfulness as a species of [[Form of the Good|the good]]: if something is true it is trustworthy and reliable and will remain so in every conceivable situation.  Both Peirce and Dewey connect the definitions of truth and warranted assertability. Hilary Putnam also developed his [[internal realism]] around the idea a belief is true if it is ideally justified in epistemic terms. About James' and Schiller's view, Putnam says:

{{quotation|Truth cannot simply ''be'' rational acceptability for one fundamental reason; truth is supposed to be a property of a statement that cannot be lost, whereas justification can be lost. The statement 'The earth is flat' was, very likely, rationally acceptable 3000 years ago; but it is not rationally acceptable today. Yet it would be wrong to say that 'the earth is flat' was true 3,000 years ago; for that would mean that the earth has changed its shape. (Putnam 1981, p. 55)}}

Rorty has also weighed in against James and Schiller:

{{quotation|Truth is, to be sure, an absolute notion, in the following sense: "true for me but not for you" and "true in my culture but not in yours" are weird, pointless locutions. So is "true then, but not now." [...] James would, indeed, have done better to say that phrases like "the good in the way of belief" and "what it is better for us to believe" are interchangeable with "justified" rather than with "true." (Rorty 1998, p. 2)}}

'''(2) Conceptual relativity'''

With James and Schiller we make things true by verifying them—a view rejected by most pragmatists. However, nearly all pragmatists do accept the idea there can be no truths without a conceptual scheme to express those truths. That is,

{{quotation|Unless we decide upon how we are going to use concepts like 'object', 'existence' etc., the question 'how many objects exist' does not really make any sense. But once we decide the use of these concepts, the answer to the above-mentioned question within that use or 'version', to put in Nelson Goodman's phrase, is no more a matter of 'convention'. (Maitra 2003 p. 40)}}

F.C.S. Schiller used the analogy of a chair to make clear what he meant by the phrase that truth is made: just as a carpenter ''makes'' a chair out of existing materials and doesn't ''create'' it out of nothing, truth is a transformation of our experience—but this doesn't imply reality is something we're free to construct or imagine as we please.

==Dewey==
{{Main|John Dewey}}

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than William James but much more broadly than Charles Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, "Dewey, John" p383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' (1938), Dewey gave the following definition of inquiry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.  (Dewey, p. 108).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The index of the same book has exactly one entry under the heading ''truth'', and it refers to the following footnote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The best definition of ''truth'' from the logical standpoint which is known to me is that by Peirce:  "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real [CP 5.407].  (Dewey, 343 ''n'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dewey says more of what he understands by ''truth'' in terms of his preferred concept of ''[[warranted assertibility]]'' as the end-in-view and conclusion of inquiry (Dewey, 14–15).

==Criticisms==
Several objections are commonly made to pragmatist account of truth, of either sort.

First, due originally to [[Bertrand Russell]] (1907) in a discussion of James's theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, is that pragmatism mixes up the notion of truth with ''epistemology''. Pragmatism describes an ''indicator'' or a ''sign'' of truth.  It really cannot be regarded as a theory of the ''meaning'' of the word "true". There's a difference between ''stating an indicator'' and ''giving the meaning''. For example, when the streetlights turn on at the end of a day, that's an [[wikt:indicator|indicator]], a sign, that evening is coming on.  It would be an obvious mistake to say that the word "evening" just means "the time that the streetlights turn on".  In the same way, while it might be an ''indicator'' of truth, that a proposition is part of that perfect science at the ideal limit of inquiry, that just isn't what "true" ''means''.

Russell's objection is that pragmatism mixes up an ''indicator'' of truth with the ''meaning'' of the predicate 'true'. There is a difference between the two and pragmatism confuses them.  In this pragmatism is akin to Berkeley's view that to be is to be perceived, which similarly confuses an indication or proof of that something exists with the meaning of the word 'exists', or with what it is for something to exist.

Other objections to pragmatism include how we define what it means to say a [[belief]] "works", or that it is "useful to believe". The vague usage of these terms, first popularized by James, has led to much debate.

A final objection is that pragmatism of James's variety entails relativism. What is useful for ''you'' to believe might not be useful for ''me'' to believe. It follows that "truth" for you is different from "truth" for me (and that the relevant facts don't matter). This is relativism.

A viable, more sophisticated consensus theory of truth, a mixture of Peircean theory with [[speech-act theory]] and social theory, is that presented and defended by [[Jürgen Habermas]], which sets out the universal pragmatic conditions of ideal consensus and responds to many objections to earlier versions of a pragmatic, consensus theory of truth.  Habermas distinguishes explicitly between [[factual consensus]], i.e. the beliefs that happen to hold in a particular community, and [[rational consensus]], i.e. consensus attained in conditions approximating an "[[ideal speech situation]]", in which inquirers or members of a community suspend or bracket prevailing beliefs and engage in rational discourse aimed at truth and governed by the force of the better argument, under conditions in which all participants in discourse have equal opportunities to engage in constative (assertions of fact), normative, and expressive speech acts, and in which discourse is not distorted by the [[wikt:intervene|intervention]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] or the [[internalization]] of systematic blocks to [[communication]].

Recent Peirceans, Cheryl Misak, and [[Robert B. Talisse]] have attempted to formulate Peirce's theory of truth in a way that improves on [[Habermas]] and provides an epistemological conception of [[deliberative democracy]].

A '''community''' is distinguished from a loose group of individuals by an integrative system of organization that establishes both individual, private resources and common, public resources, and that organizes the activities required for the community’s continuity.

A '''proprietary community''' is a special type of community in which a single owner leases units to multiple tenants.

In ''The Art of Community'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacCallum|first=Spencer|title=The Art of Community|publisher=Institute for Humane Studies|year=1970|asin=B001AMWWY4|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Spencer MacCallum]] defines community as follows:

"A '''community''' is an occupation by two or more persons of a place divided into private and common areas according to a system of relations which defines and allocates responsibility for the performance of all activities that might be required for its continuity." (p.&amp;nbsp;3)

"A '''proprietary community''' is a community administered as a proprietary enterprise in which the relations of every member of the community are formed directly with the proprietary authority." (p.&amp;nbsp;5)

Proprietary communities are thus distinguished from other types of community such as [[private community|private communities]], [[voluntary community|voluntary communities]], and [[intentional community|intentional communities]] by the fact that none of these latter types of community are necessarily organized on a proprietary basis. For example, residential communes, [[Amish]] communities, and Israeli [[kibbutz]]im are voluntary, but not proprietary. Importantly, proprietary communities are also distinguished from private communities such as home owners' associations, which operate on political principles (democratic voting by the multiple owners), not on proprietary principles (which require a single owner who leases units to multiple tenants). Examples of proprietary communities include hotels, marinas, office buildings, industrial parks, entertainment complexes, and ever-larger and more complex combinations of these.

In ''The Art of Community'' and other works MacCallum argues that the property relations in a community fundamentally determine the physical structure and dynamics of the community.{{cn|date=April 2017}} He writes that proprietary leasehold communities provide an optimal incentive system for communities by internalizing externalities and solving many of the coordination and cooperation problems that plague contemporary societies.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== History ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}
The first truly proprietary communities developed in the nineteenth century in the form of forerunners of the modern customer-service-oriented hotel. The twentieth century saw a veritable explosion of proprietary community types, and of ever-increasing generality and scale (for example, [[Walt Disney World Resort|Disney World]], [[The Venetian (Las Vegas)|The Venetian]] in Las Vegas, and [[Masdar City]] in the UAE). However, to date these proprietary communities have only existed within the framework of a larger nation-state—not as fully generalized independent sovereign jurisdictions. Since the 1960s, there have been various attempts to create such sovereign proprietary communities—unsuccessfully to date. A new initiative to develop experimental new societies is being spearheaded by the [[Seasteading Institute]], founded by [[Patri Friedman]] (grandson of economist Milton Friedman), and funded by PayPal founder [[Peter Thiel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">'''Ricardo Miledi''' (15 September, 1927 – 18 December, 2017) was a Mexican neuroscientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary Notices|url=http://www.physoc.org/joint-meeting-of-feps-the-hungarian-physiological-society/obituary-notices|publisher=The Physiology Society|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of seven children, many of whom settled in the US, Miledi embodied the essence of a global scientist working with the brightest and the best from across the world. Research and discovery was as paramount to him as was bringing forward the next generation of scientists. Miledi devoted time continuously over his career to enabling PhD students to succeed and adopt a discripline of inquiry and ingenuity. He was forever approachable and had a wonderfully engaging personality that belied his global status.

Most recently he was a Distinguished Professor at [[University of California, Irvine]] having joined the faculty in the early 1980s where he was known for work on the role of calcium in [[Chemical synapse#Neurotransmitter release|neurotransmitter release]]. He received undergraduate and medical degrees at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://kfip.org/professor-ricardo-miledi/| title =Ricardo Miledi}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in medical school, he decided that he would make a "terrible clinician", as "he imagined that he would end up seeing only one patient per week, because he would always be too interested in every unknown detail of the case, trying to work out how medicines might act."&lt;ref name="Jeng2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jeng |first= Jade-Ming |date= 2002|title=Ricardo Miledi and the calcium hypothesis of neurotransmitter release |url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v3/n1/pdf/nrn706.pdf |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume= 3|issue= 1|pages= 71–6|doi=10.1038/nrn706|pmid= 11823807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when required to perform social service as a component of his training in medical school, he chose a research fellowship at the Instituto Nacional de Cardiología under [[Arturo Rosenblueth]]. There, he studied the electrical origins of ventricular fibrillation and became skilled at delicate laboratory work.

In 1955, he spent a summer at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at [[Wood's Hole]]. There, he began his study of synapses in the common squid and began to see the importance of calcium in synaptic transmission. Around 1956/1957 Miledi conducted research in Canberra, Australia.

In 1958, he met frequent collaborator Noble Laureate [[Bernard Katz]], who offered him a position in the Department of Biophysics at [[University College London]]. There, he studied the release of [[Acetylcholine]](ACh) and the expression of its receptors. In the early 1960s, he again became interested in the role of calcium. He found that "in zero-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; medium, the nerve impulse still fully invades the nerve terminal, but does not release any neurotransmitter. And then as soon as you give a little Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; , you get neurotransmitter release." He and Katz published a paper establishing the major role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in ACh release. Further work with squid contributed to an even better understanding of the role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in neurotransmitter release.&lt;ref name="Jeng2002"/&gt;

Miledi was elected as a fellow to the British Royal Society in 1970.

During the early 1970s Miledi was a frequent research scientist during the summer months at the Stazione Zooalogica in Naples, Italy ostensibly as the local squid made excellent research specimen.

His awards include the [[Royal Medal]] (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1750|title=Royal Medal Winners: 2007 - 1990|accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpa.es/en/awards/1999/ricardo-miledi-y-enrique-moreno-1/jury/ | title=Prince of Asturias Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society for Neuroscience's Ralph W.

'''Selective dissemination of information''' ("SDI") was originally a phrase related to library and information science. SDI refers to tools and resources used to keep a user informed of new resources on specified topics.  

SDI services pre-date the [[world wide web]], and the term itself is somewhat dated. Contemporary analogous systems for SDI services include alerts, current awareness tools or trackers. These systems provide automated searches that inform the user of the availability of new resources meeting the user's specified keywords and search parameters. Alerts can be received a number of ways, including [[email]], RSS feeds, [[voice mail]], Instant messaging, and [[text messaging]]. 

Selective dissemination of information was a concept first described by [[Hans Peter Luhn]] of IBM in the 1950s.  Software was developed in many companies and in government to provide this service in the 1950s and 60s, which allowed distribution of items recently published in abstract journals to be routed to individuals who are likely to be interested in the contents.  For example, the system at Ft. Monmouth automatically sent out (by mail) a different set of abstracts to each of about 1,000 scientists and engineers in the army depending on what they were working on.  The selection was based on an "interest profile," a list of keywords that described their interests.  In some organizations, the 'interest profile' was much more than a simple list of keywords. Librarians or information professionals conducted extensive interviews with their clients to establish a fairly complex profile for each individual.  Based on these profiles, the information professionals would then distribute selectively appropriate information to their clients. This labour-intensive operation, while initially costly, over time was made less so.
A survey at the time (1970s) indicated that a large number of projects were affected by the SDI service.  The software was developed by Edward Housman at the Signal Corps Research Laboratories Technical Information Division.

[[File:Figure 2 Colorimeter Cat no33-29-40 p4.tif | thumb|right | Schematic electrical diagram of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Spectronic 20 Colorimeter]]

The Bausch &amp; Lomb Spectronic 20 colorimeter uses a [[diffraction grating]] [[monochromator]] combined with a system for the detection, amplification, and measurement of light wavelengths in the 340 [[Nanometer|nm]] to 950&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bausch &amp; Lomb Spectronic 20 Colorimeter Cat No. 33-29-40, Reference manual|date=1962|publisher=Bausch &amp; Lomb Incorporated|location=Rochester, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

[[File:Figure 1 Colorimeter Cat no33-29-40 p3.tif | thumb|left | Schematic optical diagram of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Spectronic 20 Colorimeter]]

As shown in the schematic optical diagram (see left), polychromatic light from a source in the system passes through lenses which are reflected and dispersed by the diffraction grating to restrict the range of light wavelengths. This restricted range of wavelengths is then passed through the sample to be measured. The intensity of the transmitted light is determined by a [[phototube]] [[detector]]. Mechanical movement of the diffraction grating by means of the cam attached to the wavelength control enables the user to select for various wavelengths. This is the "λ knob", wherein λ refers to wavelength of light used for the measurement.&lt;ref name="Reference"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

==Quantitative measurements==
[[File:Beer's Law Plot.jpg|thumb|left |Beer-Lambert Relationship Plot]]

{{external media | width = 200px | align = right | headerimage= [[File:Figure 3 Colorimeter Cat no33-29-40 p5.tif |200px]]  |video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdufRwbkeKo  “Introduction to Colorimetry“ (Spectronic 20)], David Frank | video2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOftc3f60OE “Absorbance Spectrophotometry Video 02, Function test for Spectronic 20+”], Robin Aiken |video3 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkUGz6kEQMg “Lab Protocol - Spec 200 (Unit 2 Spectrophotometry)“], Mark Garcia}}

Many substances absorb light in the ultraviolet - visible light range. Absorption at any particular wavelength in the ultraviolet visible range is proportional to the concentration of the substances in the solution or other medium, in accord with the [[Beer-Lambert |Beer-Lambert relationship]]. In a practical sense, the Beer-Lambert relationship can be stated as:

        ''A'' = ε x ''l'' x ''c''

in which ''A'' is the absorbance measured by the instrument, ε is the molar absorption coefficient of the sample, ''l'' is the [[pathlength]] of the light beam through the sample, and c is the concentration of the substance in the solution or medium.&lt;ref name="chemguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beer-Lambert Law|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/uvvisible/beerlambert.html|website=chemguide.co.uk|publisher=Jim Clark|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spectronic 20 is thereby commonly used for [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative determination]] of the concentration of a substance of interest. The Spectronic 20 measures the absorbance of light at a pre-determined concentration, and the concentration is calculated from the Beer-Lambert relationship.&lt;ref name="chemguide" /&gt;

The absorbance of the light is the [[base 10 logarithm]] of the [[ratio]] of the [[Transmittance]] of the pure solvent to the transmittance of the sample, and so the two absorbance and transmittance can be interconverted.&lt;ref name="chemguide" /&gt; Either transmittance or absorbance can therefore be plotted versus concentration using measurements from the Spectronic 20.  Plotting a curve using percent transmittance of light yields an exponential curve. However, absorbance is linearly related to concentration, and so absorbance is often preferred for plotting a standard curve. This type of standard curve relates the concentration of the solution (on the x-axis) to measures of its absorbance (y-axis).&lt;ref name="Austin"/&gt;

To obtain such a curve, a series of dilutions of known concentration of a solution are prepared and readings are obtained for each of the dilutions (see plot at left).&lt;ref name="Austin"&gt;{{cite web|title=BIOL 1406  PreLab 2.2  How can I use a spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of solutes in a solution?|url=http://www.austincc.edu/biocr/1406/labm/ex2/prelab_2_2.htm|website=Austin Community College|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this plot, the slope of the line is the product ε x ''l''. By measuring a series of standards and creating the standard curve, it is possible to quantify the amount or concentration of a substance within a sample by determining the absorbance on the Spec 20 and finding the corresponding concentration on the calibration curve. Alternatively, the logarithm of percent transmittance can be plotted versus concentration to create a standard curve using the same procedure.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of the Spec 20|url=http://abacus.bates.edu/~ganderso/biology/resources/spec20.html|website=Bates College|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absorbance measured by the Spectronic 20 is the sum of the absorbance of each of the constituents of the solution. Therefore, the Spectronic 20 can be used to analyze more complex solutions. For example, if a sample solution has two [[Chromophore|light-absorbing compounds]] in it, then the user performs measurements at two different wavelengths and constructs standard curves for each compound. Then the concentration of each compound can be [[Algebra|calculated algebraically]].&lt;ref name="Wiki"&gt;Wikipedia contributors. "[[Beer–Lambert law]]." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

The Spectronic 20 can be used for [[Turbidimetry|turbidimetric measurements]]. In [[Microbiology|microbiological work]], the turbidity of a [[Microbiological culture|liquid culture of bacterial cells]] relates to the [[cell count]], and [[OD600]] measurements can be conducted for this purpose using the Spectronic 20.&lt;ref name="OD600"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baribeau|first1=Hélène|title=Formation and Decay of Disinfection By-Products in the Distribution System|url=http://www.waterrf.org/PublicReportLibrary/91115.pdf|website=waterrf.org|publisher=AWWA Research Foundation|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the turbidity of water suspensions of [[clays]] and other [[Light scattering by particles|particles]] of size suitable for [[light scattering]] can be quantitatively determined by means of a Spectronic 20.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kissa|first1=Erik|title=Dispersions: Characterization, Testing, and Measurement|date=1999|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0824719948|pages=291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the Spectronic 20 was used for [[Clinical chemistry|clinical diagnostic]] purposes.&lt;ref name="Clinical"&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Methods Manual: Spectronic 20|date=1965|publisher=Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Before testing a sample, the Spectronic 20 is calibrated using a [[Blank (solution)|blank]] solution, which is the pure solvent that is used in the experimental sample.  It is typically water or an [[organic solvent]].  In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right.&lt;ref name="Thermo2007" /&gt; After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or [[cuvette]] containing the [[Sample (material)|sample]] solution to be measured into the sample compartment.&lt;ref name="Reference"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for [[Frequency drift|drift]]. To measure wavelengths above 650 [[Nanometres|nm]], the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red [[filter (optics)|filter]] and a red-sensitive [[photocell]] is installed.&lt;ref name="Reference"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

The original design of the Spectronic 20 utilized an [[analog device|analog]] dial&lt;ref name=Spectrophotometer&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectrophotometer|url=http://www2.ohlone.edu/people/jklent/labs/101a_labs/spectrophotometer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; for readout of transmission from 100%T to 1%T (top scale),&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt; 0A - 2A (lower scale). Using the original instrument requires manual setting of the [[wavelength]]&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt; and making readings from a moving-needle analog display.&lt;ref name=Comparison/&gt;

==Replacement==
The Spectronic 20D (launched in 1985) and later the 20D+ replaced the analog dial with a red digital [[LED]] readout, offering greater [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] in the readout, if not greater [[accuracy]] in the actual reading.  A side-by-side comparison of the features of the 20+ and 20D+ is available in the 2001 operating manual.&lt;ref name=Comparison&gt;{{cite web|title=SPECTRONIC ®  20 +  SERIES Spectrophotometers Operator's Manual|url=http://www.cienytec.com/PDFS/Espec_SPEC20_OpMan_ing.pdf|website=ThermoSpectronic|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spectronic 20 was replaced by the Spectronic 200 in the Thermo Scientific spectrophotometer product line in 2011.&lt;ref name=Ritter/&gt; The Spectronic 200 utilizes an array detector and digital control of the measured wavelength, while retaining the characteristic λ knob of the Spec 20 for setting the wavelength. In addition to replicating the user modes of the Spec 20D+ (which it can emulate on a color LCD screen) the Spec 200 accommodates both test-tubes and square cuvettes without needing to install an adapter. Software modes described in the Spectronic 200's specifications include scanning, four wavelength simultaneous measurement, and [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] with up to four standards,&lt;ref name=Spec200&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermo Scientific  SPECTRONIC  200 Visible Spectrophotometer|url=http://www.kobis.si/prodajni-program/molekulska-spektroskopija/SPECTRONIC%20200%20Visible%20Spectrophotometer_routine.pdf|website=Thermo Scientific|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the SPEC 20D+ which offered only single point calibration.

==Product line history==
Originally introduced by Bausch &amp; Lomb in 1953,  the product line was sold to Milton Roy in 1985. Milton Roy sold its instrument group to Life Sciences International, renamed Spectronic instruments, Inc. in 1995. Spectronics Instruments was purchased by Thermo Optek in 1997, renamed Spectronic-Unicam in 2001 and Thermo-Spectronic in 2002. In 2003 the product line was moved to [[Madison, WI]] and the brand renamed to [[Thermo Electron]].&lt;ref name=Entities2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermo Fisher Scientific  Legal Entity Reference Guide US and Canada|url=https://corporate.thermofisher.com/content/dam/tf/Footer/Documents/2015%20Legal%20Entity%20Reference%20Guide.pdf|website=Thermo Fisher Scientific|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the merger of Thermo Electron and [[Fisher Scientific]] in 2006 the brand changed to [[Thermo Scientific]], and remained such until the end of the production run.&lt;ref name=Thermo2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific to Combine in Industry-Transforming Transaction|url=http://ir.thermofisher.com/investors/news-and-events/news-releases/news-release-details/2006/Thermo-Electron-and-Fisher-Scientific-to-Combine-in-Industry-Transforming-Transaction/default.aspx|accessdate=11 November 2015|website=Thermo Fisher Scientific|date=May 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectronic 20 instruments found in labs today may bear any of the Bausch and Lomb, Milton Roy, Spectronic, Thermo Electron or Thermo Scientific brand names.&lt;ref name=Entities2015/&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The Spectronic 20 is apparently one of the few lab instruments to remain intact after the destruction of the laboratory in the movie ''[[Back to the Future]]''.&lt;ref name=50years&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating 50 years of spectrophotometry|url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/analytical-instruments/spectroscopy/spectrophotometers/celebrating-50-years-of-spectrophotometry/54496.article|website=Thermo Fisher Scientific (Molecular Spectroscopy)|accessdate=10 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trophic species have identical prey and a shared set of predators in the food web. This means that members of a trophic species share many of the same kinds of ecological functions.&lt;ref name="Dunne02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pimm91"/&gt; The idea of trophic species was first devised by [[Joel E.

The reassessment grouped similar species according to habit rather than genetics. This resulted in a ratio of predator to prey in food webs is generally 1:1.&lt;ref name="comf"/&gt; By assigning groups in a trophic manner, relationships are linear in scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">'''VERDE (Visualizing Energy Resources Dynamically on the Earth)''' is a visualization and analysis capability of the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). The system, developed and maintained by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), provides wide-area situational understanding of the U.S. electric grid. Enabling grid monitoring, weather impacts prediction and analysis, VERDE supports preparedness and response to potentially large outage events. As a real-time geo-visualization capability, it characterizes the dynamic behavior of the grid over interconnects giving views into bulk transmission lines as well as county-level power distribution status. By correlating grid behaviors with cyber events, the platform also enables a method to link cyber-to-infrastructure dependencies.

VERDE integrates different data elements from other available on-line services, databases, and social media. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) and other major utilities spanning multiple regions across the electric grid interconnection provide real-time status of their systems. Social media sources such as Twitter provide additional data-sources for visualization and analyses.

The VERDE software, which was developed by the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division (CSED) of ORNL, is used outside of the DOE for a number of related national security requirements.

== Summary ==
In a world of [[Unemployment|non-work]], ruined by human-created [[climate change]] and [[pollution]], and where people are under [[surveillance]] and ruled over by a mega-rich [[elite]], Hubert, Etc, his friend Seth, and Natalie, decide that they have nothing to lose by turning their backs and walking away from the everyday world or "default reality".&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

With the advent of [[3D printing]] – and especially the ability to use these to fabricate even better fabricators – and with machines that can search for and reprocess waste or discarded materials, they no longer have need of Default for the basic essentials of life, such as food, clothing and shelter.&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

As more and more people choose to "walkaway", the ruling elite do not take these social changes sitting down. They use the military, police and [[mercenaries]] to attack and disrupt the walkaways' new [[Intentional communities|settlements]].&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

One thing that the elite are especially interested in is scientific research that the walkaways are carrying out which could finally put an end to death – and all this leads to revolution and eventual war.&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Writing on ''[[NPR]]'' online, Jason Sheehan is of the opinion that Doctorow's writing is "super weird in the best possible way."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

The reviewer says that ''Walkaway'' is a remarkable "story of a utopia in progress, as messy as every new thing ever is, told in the form of people talking to each other, arguing with each other and working together to solve problems. It's all about the deep, disturbing, recognizable weirdness of the future that must come from the present we have already made for ourselves, trying to figure out what went wrong and what comes next."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

In ''[[The Verge]]'', Adi Robertson writes: "''Walkaway'' imagines a future shaped by the same problems and possibilities Doctorow's been playing with for years: the threat of ubiquitous surveillance and artificial scarcity, and the promise that almost any technology can be repurposed and turned against its creator".&lt;ref name="the_verge" /&gt;

Robertson goes on to say that "one of Doctorow's core themes in ''Walkaway'' is subverting what he described as the popular 'man against man against nature' pulp plot."&lt;ref name="the_verge" /&gt;

In ''[[Ars Technica]]'', Sean Gallagher writes that "the future is open source in this optimistic sci-fi disaster epic full of big ideas."&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt; He and Doctorow see ''Walkaway'' as a prequel to the author's debut novel ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]''.&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;

Gallagher concludes that ''Walkaway'' "shows us a world trying to make things right after having made all the wrong decisions about how to use technology. But Walkaway executes that move beautifully. And like all great performances, it's worth witnessing over and over again."&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;

The '''weak gravity conjecture''' ('''WGC''') is a conjecture regarding the strength [[gravity]] can have in a theory of [[quantum gravity]] relative to the gauge forces in that theory. It roughly states that gravity should be the weakest force in any consistent theory of quantum gravity.&lt;ref&gt;"The string landscape, black holes and gravity as the weakest force", Nima Arkani-Hamed, Luboš Motl, Alberto Nicolis and Cumrun Vafa, published 15 June 2007,  ''Journal of High Energy Physics'', Volume 2007, JHEP06 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
