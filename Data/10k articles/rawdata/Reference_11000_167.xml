[[File:Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography (1900, volume 5).djvu|thumb|''Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography'' (1900, volume 5)]]
'''''Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography''''' is a six-volume collection of [[biography|biographies]] of notable people involved in the history of the [[New World]]. Published between 1887 and 1889, its unsigned articles were widely accepted as authoritative for several decades. Later the encyclopedia became notorious for including dozens of biographies of people who had never existed. The apostrophe in the title is correctly placed and indicates that more than one person, i.e. a company, authored the work.

==Overview==
The ''Cyclopædia'' included the names of over 20,000 native and adopted citizens of the United States, including living persons.  Also included were the names of several thousand citizens of all the other countries of North and South America. The aim was to embrace all noteworthy persons of the New World. The work also contained the names of nearly 1,000 people of foreign birth who were closely identified with American history. The ''Cyclopædia'' was illustrated with about sixty full-page portraits supplemented by some 1,500 smaller vignette portraits accompanied by facsimile autographs, and also several hundred views of birthplaces, residences, monuments, and tombs famous in history.&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Preface|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the articles are signed either with names or with initials. The clue to authorship is obtained, when obtained at all, through a list of contributors and their contributions arranged alphabetically as to contributors. One reviewer found this a rather inconvenient method, complaining that the finding of the author of a particular sketch often involved a voyage of discovery through the entire list. These lists are searched in vain, however, for the authors of many sketches, including the one of President [[Grover Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|&amp;ldquo;[[s:The New York Times/Our Men of Note|Our Men of Note]],&amp;rdquo; ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 1887, p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictitious biographies==
''Appletons' Cyclopædia'' is notorious for including an estimated 200 biographies of [[fictitious entry|fictitious persons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/cyclopedia.html Museum of Hoaxes]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first to discover these fictions was [[John Hendley Barnhart]], in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, "Some fictitious botanists", ''Journal of the New York Botanical Garden'' '''20''' (1919:171-81).  The event was amusing and momentous enough to be mentioned in the obituary written at Dr. Barnhart's death, ''Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''7'''.19  (November 1950:35-61) p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; who identified and reprinted, with commentary, 14 biographical sketches of supposed European [[botanist]]s who had come to the New World to study in Latin America. By 1939, 47 fictitious biographies had been discovered, though only the letters H and V had been systematically investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial note by "G.S." in Dobell (1939). The 47 are listed in Schindler (1937) — see below — which is cited on p. 272 of the note by "G.S." Dr. Uplavici was another fictitious person similar to the ''Cyclopædia's'' fictitious entries.  Dobell's article revealed the spectral "Dr. [[O. Uplavici]]" to have his origin in non-Czech-literate writers' mistaking an article on amoebic dysentery by Dr. Jaroslav Hlava, which was titled "O úplavici" ("On dysentery").&lt;/ref&gt; The status of fictions in ''Appletons' Cyclopædia'' was assessed by Margaret Castle Schindler, of [[Goucher College]], in 1937.&lt;ref name=Schindler&gt;Schindler, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1839450 "Fictitious biography"], ''American Historical Review'' '''42''' (1937:680-90)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schindler
&lt;blockquote&gt;The writer (or writers) of these articles must have had some scientific training, for most of the creations were scientists, and sufficient linguistic knowledge to have invented or adapted titles in six languages. He was certainly familiar with the history and geography of South America. Most of the places visited by his characters are real places, and most of the historical events in which they participated are genuine. However, he sometimes made mistakes by which his fraudulent work can be detected.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler (1937), p. 683.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some, such as [[Huet de Navarre]], were about a real person but in most details were fictional.&lt;ref name=Schindler/&gt;
George Zorn identifies the author of "phantom Jesuit" articles as William Christian Tenner, and identifies 42 fictitious subjects of this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zorn |first=George, S.J. |url=http://cdm.slu.edu/utils/getfile/collection/woodstock/id/1791/filename/2406.pdf |title=Woodstock Letters Index: Volumes 1-80 (1872-1951) |location=Woodstock, Maryland |publisher=Woodstock College Press |year=1960 |accessdate=13 October 2011}} Search on "Appleton's" or "phantom Jesuit".&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson suggests Hermann Ritter, who appears as the source of “Articles on South and Central Americans” beginning with volume 3, as a likely author of the fictitious articles.  Dobson notes that the first two volumes, where Juan G. Puron appears in this role, are practically free of problem articles, although Barnhart identifies the article on “Dávila, Nepomuceno” as suspicious, but not fictitious beyond a shadow of a doubt.

Contributors to ''Appletons' Cyclopædia'' were free to suggest new subjects and were paid according to the length of the article. Articles were only checked for form by the editorial staff.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler (1937), p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; While conceding that ''Appletons' Cyclopædia'' was a "valuable and authoritative work," and that her results should not reflect on the many authentic articles, Schindler noted that articles on Latin American subjects should be used cautiously until verified against other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler (1937), p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedents==
''Appletons' Cyclopædia'' incorporated an earlier work by [[Francis Samuel Drake (historian)|Francis Samuel Drake]] called ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (not to be confused with a more modern and comprehensive work of the [[Dictionary of American Biography|same name]]). The original of this work was issued in 1872, and along with the original material, Drake's latest corrections, and all the materials that he had gathered for a new edition, were used in the ''Cyclopædia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Drake, Samuel Gardner|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original work had 10,000 biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Drake, Francis Samuel|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The first edition of the ''Cyclopædia'' was published between 1887 and 1889 by [[D. Appleton and Company]] of [[New York City]].  The general editors were [[James Grant Wilson]] and [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]]; the managing editor from 1886 to 1888 was [[Rossiter Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Editorial note by "G.S." (i.e. [[George Sarton]]) in Clifford Dobell, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/226292 "Dr O. Uplavici (1887-1938)"], ''Isis'' '''30'''.2 (May 1939:268-272).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Johnson, Rossiter|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh volume, containing an appendix and supplementary lists, and thematic indexes to the whole work, was issued in 1901.

The ''Cyclopædia'' was republished, uncorrected, by the [[Gale Research Company]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Appleton's cyclopaedia of American biography. Ausgabe 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are [[self-archiving|self-archived]] on the arXiv repository.

== History ==
[[File:ArXiv 1994.png|thumb|A screenshot of the arXiv taken in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/fig3.gif&lt;/ref&gt; using the browser [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]]. At the time, [[Form (HTML)|HTML forms]] were a new technology.]]

arXiv was made possible by the low-bandwidth [[TeX]] file format, which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the [[Internet]] and rendered [[client-side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=O'Connell|first1=Heath|title=Physicists Thriving with Paperless Publishing |date=2000 |arxiv=physics/0007040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1990, [[Joanne Cohn]] began emailing [[physics]] preprints to colleagues as TeX files, but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity. [[Paul Ginsparg]] recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] mailbox stored at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: [[FTP]] in 1991, [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] in 1992, and the [[World Wide Web]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="dddmag2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ginsparg [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/35983 "The global-village pioneers"] ''[[Physics World]]'' October 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[e-print]] was quickly adopted to describe the articles.

It began as a physics archive, called the [[LANL]] preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, [[quantitative biology]] and, most recently, statistics. Its original domain name was &lt;tt&gt;xxx.lanl.gov&lt;/tt&gt;. Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions to [[Cornell University]] and changed the name of the repository to &lt;tt&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with eight [[mirror website|mirrors]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=arXiv mirror sites|url=https://arxiv.org/servers.html|publisher=arXiv|accessdate=September 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055824/http://arxiv.org/help/mirrors| archivedate= August 10, 2014 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in [[scientific publishing]] known as [[open access (publishing)|open access]]. [[Mathematician]]s and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Glanz |title=The World of Science Becomes a Global Village; Archive Opens a New Realm of Research |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/world-science-becomes-global-village-archive-opens-new-realm-research.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes for reviews before they are published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal|journals]]. Ginsparg was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.

The annual budget for arXiv is approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the [[Simons Foundation]] (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/127116484/arXiv+Business+Model.pdf |format=PDF |title=CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ARXIV FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR 2013-2017 |date=March 28, 2012 |website=Confluence.cornell.edu |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=340900096|title=arXiv Member Institutions (2018) - arXiv public wiki - Dashboard|website=confluence.cornell.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development.  Ginsparg was quoted in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' as saying it "was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence".&lt;ref name="CHE 2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-first-free-research-sharing-site-arxiv-turns-20/32778 | title=The First Free Research-Sharing Site, arXiv, Turns 20 With an Uncertain Future | work=Chronicle of Higher Education | date=August 10, 2011 | accessdate=August 12, 2011 | author=Fischman, Joah}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Ginsparg remains on the &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/help/scientific_ad_board arXiv Scientific Advisory Board] and on the [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html arXiv Physics Advisory Committee]&lt;/span&gt;.

== Moderation process and endorsement ==
Although arXiv is not [[peer review]]ed, a collection of moderators for each area review the [[Electronic submission|submissions]]; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic,&lt;ref name="mckinney"&gt;{{citation|last=McKinney|first=Michelle|title=arXiv.org|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=25|issue=7|year=2011|pages=35–36|doi=10.1108/09504121111168622}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reject submissions that are not scientific papers. The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses Computing Research Repository Subject Areas and Moderators]; [http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/categories/math Mathematics categories];
[https://arxiv.org/new/stat.html Statistics archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/q-bio.html Quantitative Biology archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html Physics archive]&lt;/ref&gt; but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.

Additionally, an "endorsement" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=As we may read|last=Ginsparg|first=Paul|year=2006|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=38|pages=9606–9608|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3161-06.2006|pmid=16988030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area.&lt;ref name="mckinney" /&gt; New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all.  However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=July 2005|volume=44|issue=7|pages=691–692|title=Preface to the Proceedings of Quantum Structures 2002|first1=Richard|last1=Greechie|first2=Sylvia|last2=Pulmannova|first3=Karl|last3=Svozil|doi=10.1007/s10773-005-7053-z|quote=The new endorsement system may contribute to an effective barrier, a digital divide|bibcode = 2005IJTP...44..691G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the [[e-print]]s are also submitted to [[scientific journal|journals]] for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal.  A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]], including the [[Poincaré conjecture]] as a particular case, uploaded by [[Grigori Perelman]] in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|eprint = math.DG/0211159|date=November 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: "If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there {{bracket|on the arXiv}}{{spnd}}let them go and read about it".&lt;ref&gt;Nadejda Lobastova and Michael Hirst, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/maths-genius-living-in-poverty/2006/08/20/1156012411120.html "Maths genius living in poverty"], Sydney Morning Herald, August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the [[Fields Medal]] and [[Millennium Prize Problems|Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes]] to Perelman, both of which he refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070106247.html|title=Russian mathematician wins $1 million prize, but he appears to be happy with $0|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 2, 2010|first=Marc|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submission formats ==

Papers can be submitted in any of several formats, including [[LaTeX]], and [[PDF]] printed from a [[word processor]] other than TeX or LaTeX. The [[Electronic submission|submission]] is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large.  arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.

== Access ==
The standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations. These include the [[University of California, Davis]]'s ''front'', a [[web portal]] that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ |title=Front for the arXiv |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date=September 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar function used to be offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the [[Institute of Physics]], and was switched off on June 30, 2014. Carnegie Mellon provides Table&lt;sup&gt;arXiv&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/eager/arxiv/ |title=Table&lt;sup&gt;arXiv&lt;/sup&gt;  |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications.  [[Google Scholar]] and [[Live Search Academic]] (now defunct) can also be used to search for items in arXiv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Stevens (andy.stevens@iop.org) |url=http://eprintweb.org |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full text and author search engine for arXiv is provided by [[Scientillion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scientillion.com/service/about |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or [[RSS feed]]s of all submissions in them.

== Copyright status of files ==
Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/help/license |title=arXiv License Information |publisher=Arxiv.org |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some are [[public domain]], in which case they will have a statement saying so.
#Some are available under either the [[Creative Commons]] 3.0 [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-ShareAlike license]] or the Creative Commons 3.0 [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license]].
#Some are copyright to the publisher, but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arXiv a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.
#Most are copyright to the author, and arXiv has only a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.

== Controversy ==
While arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] using only high-school mathematics, they are "surprisingly rare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond''' is a British fictional character, created by [[H. C. McNeile]] and published under his pen name "Sapper". Following McNeile's death in 1937, the novels were continued by [[Gerard Fairlie]].  Drummond is a World War I veteran who, fed up with his sedate lifestyle, advertises looking for excitement, and becomes a gentleman adventurer.  The character has appeared in novels, short stories, on the stage, in films, on radio and television, and in graphic novels.

==Overview==
After an unsuccessful one-off appearance as a policeman in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', the character was reworked by McNeile into a gentleman adventurer for his 1920 novel ''[[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|Bulldog Drummond]]''. McNeile went on to write ten Drummond novels, four short stories, four stage plays and a screenplay before his death in 1937. The stories were continued by his friend [[Gerard Fairlie]] between 1938 and 1954.

Drummond is a First World War veteran, brutalised by his experiences in the trenches and bored with his post-war lifestyle. He publishes an advertisement looking for adventure, and soon finds himself embroiled in a series of exploits, many of which involve Carl Peterson—who becomes his nemesis—and Peterson's mistress, the [[femme fatale]] Irma. After his first adventure Drummond marries his client, Phyllis Benton; in later episodes she becomes involved in Drummond's exploits, often as the victim of kidnapping by Drummond's enemies.

In 1921 an adaptation of the first novel was staged in London, with [[Gerald du Maurier]] playing the role of Drummond; the play was further adapted and resulted in the 1922 silent film ''[[Bulldog Drummond (1922 film)|Bulldog Drummond]]'', with [[Carlyle Blackwell]] in the lead role. Several other Drummond films have followed, either based on McNeile's stories or with unique storylines.

==Fictional biography==
{{Quote box|align=right|quote = "Demobilised officer,&amp;nbsp;... finding peace incredibly tedious, would welcome diversion. Legitimate, if possible; but crime, if of a comparatively humorous description, no objection. Excitement essential."|source = Advertisement placed in ''[[The Times]]'' by Drummond in [[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|''Bulldog Drummond'']]{{sfn|McNeile|1920|p=25}}|width = 300px|salign = right}}
The Bulldog Drummond stories of [[H. C. McNeile]] follow [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]]. Drummond is a member of "the Breed", a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and "physically and morally intrepid".{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, formerly an officer in the fictional "[[Loamshire Regiment|Royal Loamshire Regiment]]", who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel [[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|''Bull-dog Drummond'']], which was a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]].{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}}{{efn|The novel was first published as ''Bull-Dog Drummond'', with a hyphen, but was later changed to ''Bulldog''.&lt;ref name="EB: Drummond" /&gt;}} The character was an amalgam of McNeile's friend [[Gerard Fairlie]], and his idea of an English gentleman,{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie's claim to be a model for the character, noting that "he was still at school when Sapper created his&amp;nbsp;... hero".{{sfn|Bourn|1990|p=31}} Drummond also had roots in the literary characters [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Sexton Blake]], [[Richard Hannay]] and [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]].{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=78}}

[[File:No-man's-land-flanders-field - digitally cleaned up.jpg|thumb|left|750px|[[No man's land#World War I|No man's land]], where Drummond honed the skills he later used during his exploits]]

Drummond's wartime experience had given him a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second".{{sfn|McNeile|1920|p=104}} During his time on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] he would take himself on solitary raids through [[No man's land#World War I|no man's land]].{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=153}} Drummond was also proficient in [[jujutsu]] and boxing, was a crack shot,{{sfn|Bourn|1990|p=28}} played cricket for the [[Free Foresters Cricket Club|Free Foresters]], and was an excellent poker player.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=134}} In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=60}}

Drummond is characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an "apparently brainless hunk of a man",{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=150}} He is six feet tall, weighs around 14 stone,{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=54}} and has a "cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate confidence in its owner".{{sfn|McNeile|1920|p=26}} Throughout his exploits, Drummond is joined by several of his ex-army friends and colleagues, including Algy Longworth (who would appear in many of the films, as Drummond's sidekick), MC; Toby Sinclair, [[Victoria Cross|VC]];{{efn|The VC is "a good one", according to Drummond.{{sfn|McNeile|1920|p=127}}}} Peter Darrell and Ted Jerningham.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=55}} Dummond's ex-[[Batman (military)|batman]] from his military days, James Denny, runs Drummond's flat on Half-Moon Street in [[Mayfair]], London, along with Mrs Denny. (Denny appeared as Drummond's sidekick in the radio series, a version of the character named ''Tenny'' appeared in the films){{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=56}} Drummond is a gentleman with a private income;{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=153}} he is also construed as "a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact {{sic}} the war",{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=138}} although the character was later described by [[Cecil Day-Lewis]], author of gentleman detective [[Nigel Strangeways]], as an "unspeakable public school bully".{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=69}}

The novel ''Bulldog Drummond'' begins when Drummond places an advertisement in a newspaper looking for adventure to lift the ennui of his life in post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for the health and well-being of her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At the end of the novel Drummond and Phyllis marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|pp=12–13}} Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories,{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=57}} including ''The Black Gang''{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=15}} and ''The Female of the Species''.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=65}}

In the matter of his personal tastes, Drummond is a member of the fictional Junior Sports Club, a [[gentleman's club]] on [[St. James's Square]], London.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=93}} His preferred drink is beer{{sfn|Bourn|1990|p=27}} although he also enjoys drinking martinis and is knowledgeable about wines.{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=212}} Drummond owns both a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and a [[Bentley]].{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=56}}

Although Drummond's actions are intended to maintain the conservative status quo of Britain,{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} academic Hans Bertens considers that instead, he comes across as "a murderous exponent of a fierce competitive individualism".{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=67}}

===Carl and Irma Peterson===
The first four books deal with Drummond against Carl Peterson, who becomes Drummond's arch-enemy. Peterson is also a master of disguise and uses several aliases. Peterson is killed in the fourth book, ''The Final Count'',{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=131}} although Fairlie brings him back for his final novel, ''The Return of the Black Gang''.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=139}} Drummond forms a grudging respect for Peterson, and offers an honourable duel to the death at the end of ''The Third Round'', instead of the usual summary justice that normally befalls members of Peterson's gang.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=225}} The writer Richard Usborne sees the mass-murdering terrorist Peterson as "quite a sympathetic character. Almost, in fact, a hero",{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=166}} and wrote that "authors&amp;nbsp;... fall in love with their big villains&amp;nbsp;... Sapper came to love Carl Peterson dearly, and so did Drummond".{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=167}}

The title of the fifth Bulldog Dummond book, ''The Female of the Species'' refers to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s line "the female of the species is more deadly than the male".{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=65}} Irma is described by Jonathon Green as "the slinky epitome of a twenties '[[femme fatale|vamp]]{{' "}},{{sfn|Green|2004}} and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, "a true ''femme fatale''".{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=132}} After Carl Peterson's death in ''The Final Count'', Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in ''Bulldog Drummond''—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=225}} Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=132}}{{efn|The six Drummond novels with Irma Peterson are: ''Bulldog Drummond'' (1920), ''The Black Gang'' (1922), ''The Third Round'' (1924), ''The Final Count'' (1926), ''The Female of the Species'' (1928) and ''The Return of Bulldog Drummond'' (1932).{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=132}}}}

In 1933 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was set to direct a Bulldog Drummond film&lt;ref&gt;''British Film Production'' ''The Times'' 1 February 1933&lt;/ref&gt; with a screenplay by [[Charles Bennett (screenwriter)|Charles Bennett]] entitled ''Bulldog Drummond's Baby''. The rights to the character of Drummond were then held by [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] who would not sell the rights to use the character's for Bennett's screenplay.

=== Radio ===
{{main article|Bulldog Drummond (radio program)}}
A [[Bulldog Drummond (radio program)|''Bulldog Drummond'' radio series]] ran on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An attempt was made at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was initially portrayed by [[George Coulouris]], before being taken over by [[Santos Ortega]] and Ned Wever after 1942; [[Cedric Hardwicke]] took over in 1954.{{sfn|Dunning|1998|p=123}}

=== Television ===
A 30-minute episode of ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents]]'' featured Drummond in "The Ludlow Affair", first broadcast on UK television on 16 December 1956. Drummond was played by [[Robert Beatty]]; he was aided by Kelly, played by [[Michael Ripper]].&lt;ref name="BFI: Ludlow" /&gt; A 1973 [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'', "The British Hero", featured [[Christopher Cazenove]] playing Drummond, as well as a number of other such heroic characters, including [[Richard Hannay]], [[Beau Geste]] and James Bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Radio Times|date=6–12 October 1973|pages=74–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic novels===
Drummond has also appeared in two [[graphic novel]]s. In 2004 [[Moonstone Books]] released a ''Bulldog Drummond'' comic book written by [[William Messner-Loebs]] and illustrated by Brett Barkley,&lt;ref name="War games" /&gt; while in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], a thinly disguised, elderly version of Drummond, called "Hugo Drummond", is one of the three Secret Service agents tasked to hunt down the heroes of the piece.&lt;ref name="Black Dossier" /&gt;

==Reception==
The Drummond series proved popular with contemporary audiences, with ''Bulldog Drummond'' selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copy benchmark for "best-sellers".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=122}} At his peak in the 1920s, McNeile was the highest-paid short-story writer in the world,&lt;ref name="Indie: Fowler" /&gt; and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £10,000 a year;&lt;ref name="S Times: Obit" /&gt; the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' estimated that during his writing career he had earned £85,000.&lt;ref name="Mirror: £85,000" /&gt;

When reviewing ''Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back''{{efn|The novel was first published in the UK under the title ''Knock-Out'' and had been renamed ''Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back'' for the US market.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|pp=221–22}}}} for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the critic observed that "if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond";&lt;ref name="NYT: Knock-out" /&gt; for the novel ''Bulldog Drummond at Bay'', the reviewer considered that "as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate".&lt;ref name="NYT: BD at bay" /&gt; In the British market, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' also characterised McNeile as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=158}}

Throughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by the academic Joan DelFattore to be "intensely conservative by modern standards";{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as [[Agatha Christie]], "exhibit the inevitable [[xenophobia]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms".{{sfn|Green|2004}} J.D. Bourn considers his language to be "rather distasteful",{{sfn|Bourn|1990|p=26}} while the academic [[Michael Denning]] observed that "Drummond is a bundle of chauvinisms, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners".{{sfn|Denning|1987|p=55}} The academic [[Ion Trewin]] comments that for the readers of the 1920s and '30s, McNeile was seen at the time as "simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen".{{sfn|McNeile|Trewin|1983|p=xi|ps=: as quoted in {{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}}}

'''''Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush''''', [http://openjurist.org/304/f3d/183/center-for-reproductive-law-and-policy-v-w-bush 304 F.3d 183] (2d Cir. 2002), was a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] upheld the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]]'s re-imposition of the [[Mexico City Policy]], which states that "the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations." 

==Background==
The [[Foreign Assistance Act]] provided the president the option of not funding abortions through the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. After the election, the [[George W. Bush Administration]] re-imposed the policy and the [[Center for Reproductive Law and Policy]] sued.

==Decision==
The decision was written by then-Judge [[Sonia Sotomayor]], who wrote that the policy did not constitute a violation of [[equal protection]], as "the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34093">A number of '''[[vector graphics editor]]s''' exist for various platforms. Potential users of these editors will make a decision based on factors such as the availability for the user's platform, the [[software license]], the feature set, the merits of the [[user interface]] (UI) and the focus of the program. Some programs are more suitable for artistic work while others are better for technical drawings. Another important factor is the application's support of various vector and bitmap image formats for import and export.

==Some editors in detail==
* [[Adobe Fireworks]] (formerly Macromedia Fireworks) is a vector editor with bitmap editing capabilities with its main purpose being the creation of graphics for Web and screen. Fireworks supports RGB color scheme and has no CMYK support. This means it is mostly used for screen design. The native Fireworks file format is editable PNG (FWPNG or PNG). Adobe Fireworks has a competitive price, but its features can seem limited in comparison with other products. It is easier to learn than other products and can produce complex vector artwork. The Fireworks editable PNG file format is not supported by other Adobe products. Fireworks can manage the PSD and AI file formats which enables it to be integrated with other Adobe apps. Fireworks can also open FWPNG/PNG, PSD, AI, EPS, JPG, GIF, BMP, TIFF file formats, and save/export to FWPNG/PNG, PSD, AI (v.8), FXG (v.2.0), JPG, GIF, PDF, SWF and some others; recently, also some support for exporting to SVG has been added (via a free Export extension).
* [[Adobe Flash]] (formerly a [[Macromedia]] product) has straightforward vector editing tools that make it easier for designers and illustrators to use. The most important of these tools are vector lines and fills with bitmap-like selectable areas, simple modification of curves via the "selection" or the control points/handles through "direct selection" tools. Flash uses [[Actionscript]] for [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]], and has full XML functionality through E4X support.
* [[Adobe FreeHand]] (formerly Macromedia Freehand and Aldus Freehand) is mainly used by professional graphic designers. The functionality of FreeHand includes flexibility of the application in the wide design environment, catering to the output needs of both traditional image reproduction methods and to contemporary print and digital media with its page-layout capabilities and text attribute controls. Specific functions of FreeHand include a superior image-tracing operation for vector editing, page layout features within multiple-page documents, and embedding custom print-settings (such as variable halftone-screen specifications within a single graphic, etc.) to each document independent of auxiliary printer-drivers. User-operation is considered to be more suited for designers with an artistic background compared to designers with a technical background. When being marketed, FreeHand lacked the promotional backing, development and PR support in comparison to other similar products. FreeHand was transferred to the classic print group after Macromedia was purchased by Adobe in 2005. On May 16, 2007, Adobe announced that no further updates to Freehand would be developed but continues to sell FreeHand MX as a Macromedia product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod&amp;category=/Applications/FreeHand&amp;distributionMethod=FULL&amp;nr=0#loc=en_us&amp;category=/Applications/FreeHand&amp;store=OLS-US&amp;view=ols_prod|title=Adobe Store-North America: FreeHand MX|publisher=Adobe|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; FreeHand continues to run on [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard]] (using an Adobe fix) and on [[Windows 7]].

==Plot==
Jack Gable is the lead writer and producer of the soap opera ''Beyond Our Dreams''. Consumed by his work, he harbors an unspoken attraction to Laura Claybourne, the selfish actress playing the lead character, Rachel Hedison.   

Jack crosses paths with Louise, who is there to audition for the part of Janet DuBois, a character Jack did not want introduced. Jack then has a contentious meeting with his co-producers, the Sherwoods. The Sherwoods reveal that they are displeased with several elements of Jack's outline for the upcoming season and wish to kill off Rachel, due to Laura's outrageous contract demands. Feigning compromise, the Sherwoods immediately hire Arnie Federman, a rival of Jack's, to make the changes they desire. At the same time, Jack has suggested a new character, Jack Gates, a ruthless tycoon. The Sherwoods make no promise of writing Gates into the show, despite Jack's interest.

Planning a trip to Vermont for the weekend, Jack is contacted by Laura. She has just broken up with her boyfriend Dennis, the actor who plays Dr. Paul Kirkwood on the show, and wishes to accompany Jack. As Jack loads their luggage into the trunk, Dennis suddenly calls out to Rachel. Jack looks up to see them kissing just as the trunk lid hits him in the head. Upon awakening, he leaves for Vermont alone. Not far out of New York, he crashes his car.  

Upon waking, Jack finds himself in Ashford Falls Community Hospital, one of the settings of his show. Thinking himself the victim of a prank by the actors, he goes to the window to confirm his suspicions, only to see a real town. Incredulous, he manages to convince Dr. Kirkwood of his good health and checks out of the hospital. He is immediately intercepted by Janet DuBois. She believes him to be Jack Gates, who is seeking to buy a miracle weight-loss formula developed by her late father. Jack rebuffs her, denies he is Gates and says that he is only a writer. As she leaves in frustration, she angrily tells him to "write his way out". On a whim, Jack gets out his typewriter and writes a scene of the local mechanic calling to say that his damaged car is fixed. Immediately after, the mechanic calls and confirms the repairs are finished. Jack realizes that he can control events by writing them.

Jack seizes his new found power to pursue Rachel, saving her from the death arranged for her by Federman. Despite his writing skills, she ignores him. His efforts are redeemed by the attentions of Janet. He assists her in her efforts to avoid the machinations of the Hedisons, including patriarch Carter and his sons, Blake and Ty. The Hedisons own a large pharmaceutical company, and wish to acquire her formula at any cost. The Federman version of Jack Gates appears, but Jack sends him on a business trip to Cleveland. 

As Jack works to ingratiate himself to Rachel, he continues to run into Janet. The episodes culminate in a party at the Hedison mansion, where Jack accidentally breaks his typewriter. Helen Caldwell, a nurse at the hospital reveals that Rachel and Janet were switched at birth, with Janet being Carter's actual daughter. Rachel is confronted by a gun-wielding Blake, who has been experiencing side effects of an overdose of medication prescribed by Kirkwood, a scheme orchestrated by Rachel. Blake shoots Janet and she is rushed to the hospital, where Rachel convinces Kirkwood to kill her in surgery. Jack must race against time to repair his typewriter and write Janet back to health. As Jack begins to write, he is confronted by Gates, who is furious at having been sent to Cleveland and shoots at Jack with a shotgun, hitting the typewriter.

Jack wakes up back in New York, on the set of his own show, tended to by Laura and Dennis. He immediately confronts Laura about her behavior, revealing to her that she will be fired from the show. He confronts the Sherwoods about their plans for the show, and ensures that they will do things his way. He finds Louise in a delicatessen, gets her the part of Janet, and begins a relationship with her.

[[Image:Dymaxion house.jpg|right|thumb|375px|Dymaxion House as installed in [[Henry Ford Museum]]]]

The '''Dymaxion House''' was developed by inventor and architect [[Buckminster Fuller]] to address several perceived shortcomings with existing homebuilding techniques. Fuller designed several versions of the house at different times &amp;mdash; all of them factory manufactured kits, assembled on site, intended to be suitable for any site or environment and to use resources efficiently. A key design consideration of the design was ease of shipment and assembly.

As he did when naming many of his inventions, Fuller combined the words dynamic, maximum, and tension to arrive at the term ''[[Dymaxion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
The Dymaxion House was completed in 1930 after two years of development, and redesigned in 1945. Buckminster Fuller wanted to mass-produce a bathroom and a house. His first "Dymaxion" design was based on the design of a grain bin. During [[World War II]], the [[U.S. Army]] commissioned Fuller to send these housing units to the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/studios/s97/burns/p_fullerd.html |title=Buckminster Fuller: Dymaxion Deployment Unit |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416134505/http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/studios/s97/burns/p_fullerd.html |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, science-fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] placed an order for one to be delivered to Los Angeles, but the order was never filled.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, William H. ''Robert A. Heinlein: Learning Curve, Volume 1'', p. 371. Macmillan, 2010. {{ISBN|0-7653-1960-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siberia]]n grain-silo house was the first system in which Fuller noted the "[[urban dust dome]]" effect: many installations have reported that a dome induces a local vertical heat-driven vortex that sucks cooler air downward into a dome, if the dome is vented properly - a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents. Fuller adapted the later units of the grain-silo house to use this effect.

The final design of the Dymaxion house used a central vertical stainless-steel [[strut]] on a single foundation. Structures similar to the [[spokes]] of a [[bicycle]]-wheel hung down from this supporting the roof, while beams radiating out supported the floor. Wedge-shaped fans of sheet metal aluminum formed the roof, ceiling and floor. Each structure was assembled at ground level and then winched up the strut. The Dymaxion house represented the first conscious effort to build an [[autonomous building]] in the 20th century.

It was a prototype proposed to use a [[packaging toilet]], water storage and a convection-driven ventilator built into the roof. It was designed for the stormy areas of the world: temperate oceanic islands, and the [[Great Plains]] of [[North America]], [[South America]] and [[Eurasia]]. In most modern houses, laundry, showers and commodes are the major water uses, with drinking, cooking and dish-washing consuming less than 20 [[litre|liters]] per day. The Dymaxion house was intended to reduce water use by a [[greywater]] system, a packaging commode, and a "fogger" to replace showers.  The fogger was based on efficient compressed-air and water degreasers, but with much smaller water particles to make it comfortable.

==Description ==
[[Image:Dymaxion structure.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Interior of Dymaxion House showing structural details. Visible are the partially assembled aluminum ceiling, struts and exterior skin as well as single central post which supports the entire structure and carries utilities and plumbing.]]  Two Dymaxion houses were prototyped&amp;nbsp;– one indoor (the "Barwise" house) and one outdoor (the "Danbury" house). No Dymaxion house built according to Fuller's intentions was ever constructed and lived in. The only two prototypes of the round, [[aluminum]] house were bought by investor William Graham, together with assorted unused prototyping elements as salvage after the venture failed. In 1948, Graham constructed a hybridized version of the Dymaxion House as his family's home; the Grahams lived there into the 1970s. Graham built the round house on his lake front property, disabling the ventilator and other interior features. It was inhabited for about 30 years, although as an [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] to an existing [[ranch house]], rather than a standalone structure as intended by Fuller. In 1990, the Graham family donated this house, and all the component prototyping parts, to The [[Henry Ford Museum]]. A painstaking process was used to conserve as many original component parts and systems as possible and restore the rest using original documentation from the Fuller prototyping process. It was installed indoors in the Henry Ford Museum in 2001 with a full exhibit.

Since there was no evidence of the crucial internal rain-gutter system, some elements of the rain collecting system were omitted from the restored exhibit. The roof was designed to wick water inside and drip into the rain-gutter and then to the cistern, rather than have a difficult-to-fit, perfectly waterproof roof.

There was to be a waterless packaging toilet that deftly shrink-wrapped the waste for pickup for later composting. During the prototyping process, the idea for the packaging toilet was quickly replaced by a conventional septic system because the packaging plastic was not available. Other features worked as advertised, notably the heating, and the passive air conditioning system, based on the "dome effect."

[[Image:Pat2220482fig2.GIF|right|thumb|200px|{{US Patent|2220482}}, Prefabricated bathroom, by [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]], issued 1940]]
The inhabitants of the much-modified version of the house said that the [[bathroom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|2220482}} Prefabricated Bathroom, Richard Buckminster Fuller, Issued Nov. 5, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;
was a particular delight. The bathroom consisted of two connected stamped [[copper]] bubbles, built as four nesting pieces. The bottom piece is fully plated in tin/antimony alloy and the top half is painted. Each bubble had a drain.  No area had a radius of less than four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm), to aid cleaning. The [[commode]], shower, bathtub and sink were molded into the structural shell in one piece. One bubble contained a step-up ergonomic bathtub and shower, high enough to wash children without stooping, but just two steps (16 inches / 40&amp;nbsp;cm) up. The oval tub had the controls mounted on the inside left of the entrance to the oval tub. The other bubble was the bathroom proper with commode and sink. The ventilation for the bathroom was a large silent fan under the main sink, which kept odors away from people's noses. All lighting was totally enclosed.  To prevent fogging, the [[mirror]] faced into the medicine chest, which was ventilated by the fan. A plastic version of the bathroom was available intermittently until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/dymaxion-world/dymaxion-bathroom Dymaxion Bathroom]&lt;/ref&gt;

The large wrap-around windows and lightweight structures were popular with the children, who crawled on the windowsill, and twanged the bicycle-wheel-style main struts.&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the Dymaxion Houses include its supposed inflexible design which completely disregarded local site and architectural idiom, and its use of energy-intensive materials such as [[aluminium|aluminum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/aluminum Advanced Manufacturing Office: Aluminum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than low-energy materials, such as [[adobe]] or tile.  Fuller chose aluminium for its light weight, great strength, and long-term durability, arguably factors that compensate for the initial production cost.  Aluminum was also a logical choice if the homes were to be built in aircraft factories, which, since World War II had ended, had substantial excess capacity.

The [[Wichita House]] was a project Fuller accepted during  World War II as an attempt to produce cost-effective dwellings for everyone. The project continued to develop the technological concept of the Dymaxion House, now incorporating a round floor plan instead of a hexagonal one. The reactions to the prototype were extraordinarily positive; nevertheless it was not produced industrially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.design.ucla.edu/~djvmc/24/bucky/house.html |title=Dymaxion House |publisher=Users.design.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616063448/http://users.design.ucla.edu/~djvmc/24/bucky/house.html |archivedate=2012-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuller, a consummate perfectionist, felt he could improve the design and was dissatisfied with the prototype. He refused to begin production rather than allowing the "unfinished" design to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |title=Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center - IDEAS + INVENTIONS: Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountain College |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115004344/http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Como - Dome - Facade - Plinius the Elder.jpg|thumb|250px| Statue of Pliny the Younger on the façade of Cathedral of S. Maria Maggiore in Como]]
The '''''Epistulae''''' are  a series of personal missives by [[Pliny the Younger]] directed to his friends and associates. These letters are a unique testimony of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] administrative history and everyday life in the 1st century. The style is very different from that in the ''Panegyricus'', and some commentators maintain that Pliny initiated a new genre: the letter written for publication.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This genre offers a different type of record than the more usual [[history]]; one that dispenses with objectivity but is no less valuable for it. Especially noteworthy among the letters are two in which he describes the eruption of Mount [[Vesuvius]] in August 79 during which his uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] died (''Epistulae'' VI.16, VI.20), and one in which he asks the Emperor for instructions regarding official policy concerning [[Christians]] (''Epistulae'' X.96). 
The ''Epistulae'' are usually treated as two halves: those in Books 1 to 9, which Pliny prepared for publication, and those in Book 10, all of which were written to or by the Emperor [[Trajan]] during Pliny's governorship of [[Bithynia et Pontus|Bithynia-Pontus]]. This final book was, significantly, not intended for publication.
Other major literary figures of the late 1st century AD appear in the collection as friends or acquaintances of Pliny's, e. g. the poet [[Martial]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Epistulae'' III.21. Penguin Classics, London. Trans. [[Betty Radice]].&lt;/ref&gt; the historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Epistulae'' I.24, III.8, V.10, IX.34, X.94.&lt;/ref&gt; However, arguably the most famous literary figure to appear in Pliny's letters is his uncle. His nephew provides details of how his uncle worked tirelessly to finish his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'' (''Natural History'').&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Epistulae'' III.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Pliny the Younger was heir to his uncle's estate, he inherited his uncle's large library, and benefited from the acquisition.

== Books 1-9 ==
[[File:Ricostruzione del giardino della casa dei vetii di pompei (mostra al giardino di boboli, 2007) 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Reconstruction of the Roman garden of the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]]]]
As already mentioned above, highlights of these books include Pliny's description of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the death of his uncle and mentor, Pliny the Elder. The first letter (1.1), directed to [[Gaius Septicius Clarus]], is also notable for giving Pliny's reasons for collecting his letters. Those that give details of Pliny's life at his country [[Roman villa|villas]] are important documents in the [[History of gardening|history of garden design]]. They are the world's oldest sources of the information on how gardens were used in the ancient world and the considerations that went into their design.

The content of this section of the letters evolves over time. Pliny's career as a young man is very fully described in the earlier letters, which include tributes to notable figures such as [[Marcus Valerius Martialis]], Pliny's protégé (3.21). Advice is offered to friends, references are given, political support is discussed and Pliny comments on many other aspects of Roman life, using established [[rhetoric|literary style]]. However, by the last two books the subject matter is more contemplative.

Chronologically, it is suggested that Books 1 to 3 were written between 97 and 102, Books 4 to 7 were composed between 103 and 107 and Books 8 and 9 cover 108 and 109. These books were probably intermittently published between 99 and 109.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

=== Eruption of Mount Vesuvius ===
[[File:Johan Christian Claussen Dahl 001.jpg|right|thumb| Eruption of Vesuvius. Painting by Norwegian painter [[I.C. Dahl]] (1826)]]
In his letter Pliny relates the first warning of the eruption:

{{Cquote|My uncle was stationed at [[Misenum]], in active command of the fleet. On 24th August, in the early afternoon, my mother drew his attention to a cloud of unusual size and appearance. He had been out in the sun, had taken a cold bath, and lunched while lying down, and was then working at his books. He called for his shoes and climbed up to a place that would give him the best view of the phenomenon. It was not clear at that distance from which mountain the cloud was rising (it was afterwards known to be [[Vesuvius]]); its general appearance can best be expressed as being like a [[stone pine|pine-tree]], for it rose to a great height on a sort of trunk and then split off into branches, I imagine because it was thrust upwards by the first blast and then left unsupported as the pressure subsided, or else it was borne down by its own weight so that it spread out and gradually dispersed. Sometimes it looked white, sometimes blotched and dirty, according to the amount of soil and ashes it carried with it. My uncle's scholarly acumen saw at once that it was important enough for a closer inspection. Pliny, ''Epistulae'' VI.16.}}

Pliny then goes on to describe his uncle's failed attempt to study further the eruption and to save the lives of refugees, using the fleet under his command. Pliny's two letters regarding the eruption were written to the historian [[Tacitus]], a close friend, who had requested from Pliny a detailed account of his uncle's death for inclusion in his own historical work.

[[Vulcanologist]] call the type of eruption that Pliny described [[Plinian Eruption|"Plinian"]].

== Book 10 ==

{{Main|Pliny the Younger on Christians}}

The letters of Book 10 are addressed to or from the Emperor [[Trajan]] in their entirety, and it is generally assumed that we have received them verbatim. As such, they offer a unique insight into the administrative functions of a Roman [[province]] of the time, as well as the machinations of the Roman system of patronage and wider cultural mores of [[Rome]] itself. In addition, the corruption and apathy that occurred at various levels of the [[roman province|provincial system]] can be seen clearly. The letters also contain the earliest external account of Christian worship, and reasons for the execution of Christians.

The [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|letter regarding Christians]] deserves mention because its contents were, in the view of many historians, to become the standard policy toward Christians for the rest of the pagan era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hurtado | first=Larry W. | coauthors= | title=How on earth did Jesus become a god?: historical questions about earliest devotion to Jesus |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi5xIxgnNgcC&amp;pg=PA13| year=2005 | publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. | location=Grand Rapids, Mich.| isbn=0-8028-2861-2 | pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taken together, Pliny's letter and Trajan's response constituted a severe policy toward Christians.  Although Christians were not to be sought out, they were to be executed if brought before a magistrate by a reputable means of accusation (no anonymous charges were permitted) and they were sometimes given the opportunity to recant.&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, John Dominic, "The Birth of Christianity", Harper Collins, pages 4-6, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajan's replies to Pliny's queries and requests were also collected for publication, making the anthology even more valuable. The letters thus allow us a glimpse of the personalities of both Pliny and Trajan.

== Editions ==
The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Epistulae'', edited by L. Carbo and published in Venice in 1471, was based on one of the manuscripts in the nine-book tradition.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;L.D. Reynolds, "The Younger Pliny", in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), pp. 316-322&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1502, after five editions of Pliny's nine books had been published, Hieronymus Avantius of Verona brought out an incomplete and corrupt version of book 10, containing numerous errors and misspellings and omitting the first 26 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Canfield |first=Leon H. |date=2005 |title=The Early Persecutions of the Christians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr9xtakCRpsC&amp;pg=PA624 |location=Clark, New Jersey |publisher=The Lawbook Exchange |page=624 |isbn=9781584774815 |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete edition which included book 10 was prepared by [[Aldus Manutius]], who used a surviving 5th-century manuscript found at the abbey of Saint-Victor (six leaves of which survives as the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] manuscript M.462), and published in Venice in 1508.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt; The best modern edition of the ''Epistulae'' is considered to be Sir [[Roger Mynors]]' Oxford edition, published in 1963.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;

'''Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office''' ('''HMNAO'''), now part of the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]], was established in 1832 on the site of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory|Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] (ROG), where ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' had been published since 1767. HMNAO produces astronomical data for a wide range of users, such as astronomers, mariners, aviators, surveyors, the military, Police, lawyers, religious groups, architects, schools, diary and calendar manufacturers, photographers and film crews.

In 1937, it became part of ROG and moved with it, when it moved away from Greenwich (and was renamed the Royal Greenwich Observatory) first to [[Herstmonceux Castle]], near [[Hailsham]] in [[East Sussex]] in 1948, then to [[Cambridge]] in 1990. When the RGO closed in 1998 HMNAO was transferred to the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]], near [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] in [[Oxfordshire]].  In December 2006, HMNAO was transferred to the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]], which is based in [[Taunton]] in [[Somerset]].

The '''Hekatompedon''' or '''Hekatompedos''' ({{lang-grc|ἑκατόμπεδος}}, from {{lang|grc|ἑκατόν}}, "hundred", and πούς, "[[pous|foot]]"), also known as ''Ur-Parthenon'' and ''H–Architektur'',  was an ancient [[Greek temple]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] built from [[limestone]] in the Archaic period, and was placed in the position of the present [[Parthenon]].

==Etymology==
The name of the temple was found in inscriptions and means “100 feet long” (ca. 30 m), although its length reached 46 m.

==History==
The temple was built around 570–550 BC. It was demolished by the [[Ancient Athens|Athenians]] in 490 BC after the victory over the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] at [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] to build a larger temple known as the ''[[Older Parthenon]]''. The latter was destroyed in 480 BC by the returning Persians and finally replaced by the present [[Parthenon]]. The existence of the Hekatompedon is witnessed by historical documents. Its foundations have disappeared, but architectural and sculptural elements found in the southern part of the [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] wall of [[Acropolis]] have been assigned by scholars to this temple.

==Archaeology==
As with many other archaeological findings on the Acropolis, the initial descriptions of Hekatompedon in the late 19th century were based only on architectural and sculptural fragments. In that context, Hekatompedon was known as ''H-Architektur'' in descriptions and cataloguing, next to other buildings such as ''A–'', ''B–Architektur'' etc.&lt;ref name="korres"&gt;Manolis Korres, "[http://www.eie.gr/archaeologia/En/chapter_more_3.aspx#6 Topographic Issues of the Acropolis]", ''Archaeology of the City of Athens'' a site by the [[National Hellenic Research Foundation]]. Retrieved in August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of the temple as well as its presumed location have changed since the first descriptions by [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]]. Dörpfeld had assigned all fragments to the neighbouring [[Old Temple of Athena]] that stood between the still standing [[Erechtheum]] and Parthenon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Dörpfeld: ''Der alte Athenatempel auf der Akropolis''. In: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Athen''. Bd. 11, 1886, S. 337–51; Wilhelm Dörpfeld: ''Der alte Athenatempel auf der Akropolis II''. In: ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Athen''. Bd.  12, 1887, S. 25–61. 190–211; Wilhelm Dörpfeld: ''Das Hekatompedon in Athen''. In: ''Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts''. Bd. 34, 1919, S. 1–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Wiegand]] hypothesized in 1904 that ''H–Architektur'' was a non-''[[peripteros]]'' temple located on the site of the Old Temple of Athena, and was in fact an earlier stage of the Old Temple that was later expanded with a [[Peristasis (architecture)|peristasis]]. Moreover, he identified ''H–Architektur'' as the ''Hekatompedon'' mentioned in ancient inscriptions.&lt;ref name="korres"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Wiegand, ''Die archaische Poros-Architektur der Akropolis zu Athen'', German Academy of Sciences in Berlin, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1922 [[Ernst Buschor]] proposed that ''H–Architektur'' was actually located south, on the site of the still standing Parthenon and named it ''Ur-Parthenon'', German for "original Parthenon".&lt;ref name="korres"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Buschor, "Burglöwen", ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Athenische Abteilung'', Deutsches Archäologisches Institut / Abteilung Athen, 47.1922.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 [[Walter-Herwig Schuchhardt]]'s extensive research on the surviving fragments and sculptures proved that the pediments of the temple must have been larger than earlier presumed. As a result, he reconstructed a ''peripteros'' temple instead of the previous reconstructions that included a distyle or tristyle ''[[in antis]]'' temple.&lt;ref name="korres"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter-Herwig Schuchhardt, "Die Sima des alten Athenatempels der Akropolis", ''Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Athenische Abteilung'', 60–61, 1935–36, 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research by [[William Bell Dinsmoor]], Immo Beyer, and others, as well as historical correlations between the surviving fragments and the destruction of the Acropolis by the Persians in 480 BC have lead to the current hypothesis that Hekatompedon was a hexastyle peripteral doric temple with a 46-metre long [[crepidoma]] and that was located on the site of Parthenon.&lt;ref name="korres"/&gt;

One of the pediments (perhaps the West pediment) contained ''two lions tearing apart a bull'' in the centre, ''[[Herakles]] fights against [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]'' on the left and the Three-Bodied (Triple-Bodied) Daemon with the symbols of the three elements of nature in his hands on the right. The three bodies of the winged monster hold a wave, a flame and a bird and have intertwined snake tails, symbolizing the four natural elements, i.e. water, fire, air and earth, respectively. It represents either [[Nereus]] or [[Typhon (mythology)|Typhon]]. Overall the meaning of the whole pediment is mysterious. Some scholars believe that it means the dominance of the human wisdom over humidity: the lions are earth animals, whereas the bull represent humidity. In addition, both [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and [[Nereus]] were sea creatures defeated by [[Herakles]] on its way to the [[Hesperides|Hesperides garden]], which earned him immortality.

[[File:Lioness-hekatompedon.jpg|thumb|left|Lioness at the centre of the East pediment]]
The East pediment, also known as the Lioness pediment, contained in the centre ''two symmetrically placed lions killing a calf'' (only one has been recovered) and two ''snakes'' on the side corners. The meaning of this scene is again unknown. The lioness has both female (breast) and male (mane) details, probably arising from the lack of knowledge of the Greek artists on these animals, which no longer populated Greece in the 6th century BC.

[[File:Snakes-hekatompedon.jpg|thumb|left|Snakes at the right and left corners of the East pediment]]
Other surviving sculptures include four horses and two panthers carved in relief, both from [[metope (architecture)|metope]]s of the temple, and a very fragmentary gorgon from the central [[acroteryon]].

===Style===
[[File:002MA Friso.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the West pediment. The Three-bodied Daemon.]]
The style of the sculptures is typical of the early Archaic period. The overall narrative scenes of the pediments and metopes is half narrative, including human or semi-human figures, half animal, including animals placed in a symmetrical or repetitive fashion. This reminds of the illustrations of contemporary Greek pottery. Humans were characterized by the archaic smile. The human and animal bodies are carved with lack of confidence, compared to the sculptures of the temple of Athena Polias constructed in the Acropolis, half a century later.

'''''Historical Atlas of the World''''' is a [[historical atlas]] that contains 108 color maps showing religious boundaries, countries, cities, buildings army movements and expeditions.  It contains an index to place, peoples, historical and military events and explorers.  Covers the span from 3000 BC to ~1970 ([[Rhodesia]], not [[Zimbabwe]]; Pakistan, not [[Bangladesh]]; [[North Vietnam|North]] ''and'' [[South Vietnam]])

Broken into four sections:
* [[Ancient history|Ancient Times]] (3000 BC – 200 AD):  31 maps
* [[Middle Ages|The Middles Ages]] (200–1500): 24 maps
* [[Recent Times]] (1500–1900): 38 maps
* Twentieth Century (1900–1970): 15 maps

There is no [[Close reading|commentary]] on the maps, but nearly all maps have a thorough [[legend]].  Occasionally a map will have an unreferenced symbol.

Compact (0.5" x 4.75"x 7.75") and tightly bound.

Last known printing: 1981

'''Immigration''' is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum | first1 =  | last1 = |publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
{{see|History of human migration}}
[[File:Immigration Schild.jpg|thumb|Sign ''Immigration'' near the border between Mali and Mauritania; sponsored by EU]]
The term ''immigration'' was coined in the 17th century, referring to non-warlike population movements between the emerging [[nation state]]s. 

When people cross [[Border|national borders]] during their migration, they are called migrants or immigrants (from Latin: ''migrare'', wanderer) from the perspective of the country which they enter. From the perspective of the country which they leave, they are called emigrant or outmigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/outmigrant|title=outmigrant|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology]] designates immigration usually as [[Human migration|migration]] (as well as [[emigration]] accordingly outward migration).

==Statistics==

[[File:UN Stats.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|The global population of immigrants has grown since 1990 but has remained constant at around 3% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;UN, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{As of|2015}}, the number of international migrants has reached 244 million worldwide, which reflects a 41% increase since 2000. One third of the world's international migrants are living in just 20 countries. The largest number of international migrants live in the [[Immigration to the United States|United States]], with 19% of the world's total. [[Immigration to Germany|Germany]] and Russia host 12 million migrants each, taking the second and third place in countries with the most migrants worldwide. Saudi Arabia hosts 10 million migrants, followed by the [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (9 million) and the United Arab Emirates (8 million).&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/populationfacts/docs/MigrationPopFacts20154.pdf|title=Trends in international migration, 2015 | last1 =  | first1 = |date=December 2015|website=UN.org|publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Population Division|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2015, Asia added more international migrants than any other major area in the world, gaining 26 million. Europe added the second largest with about 20 million. In most parts of the world, migration occurs between countries that are located within the same major area.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

In 2015, the number of international migrants below the age of 20 reached 37 million, while 177 million are between the ages of 20 and 64. International migrants living in Africa were the youngest, with a median age of 29, followed by Asia (35 years), and Latin America/Caribbean (36 years), while migrants were older in Northern America (42 years), Europe (43 years), and Oceania (44 years).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Nearly half (43%) of all international migrants originate in Asia, and Europe was the birthplace of the second largest number of migrants (25%), followed by Latin America (15%). [[Indian diaspora|India]] has the largest diaspora in the world (16 million people), followed by [[Mexican diaspora|Mexico]] (12 million) and [[Russian diaspora|Russia]] (11 million).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

===2012 survey===
A 2012 survey by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] found that given the opportunity, 640 million adults would migrate to another country, with 23% of these would-be immigrant choosing the [[United States]] as their desired future residence, while 7% of respondents, representing 45 million people, would choose the [[United Kingdom]]. The other top desired destination countries (those where an estimated 69 million or more adults would like to go) were [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/153992/150-Million-Adults-Worldwide-Migrate.aspx |title=150 Million Adults Worldwide Would Migrate to the U.S |publisher=Gallup.com |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory of immigration distinguishes between push and pull factors.&lt;ref name="knaw"/&gt;

Push factors refer primarily to the motive for immigration from the country of origin. In the case of economic migration (usually labor migration), differentials in [[wage rate]]s are common. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value of wages in one's native country, he or she may choose to migrate, as long as the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic expansion of the US increased immigrant flow, and nearly 15% of the population was [[foreign born]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://immigrationlawnj.com/how-many-people-are-immigrants/|title = How Many People are Immigrants?|date = 4 July 2015|accessdate = 30 July 2015|website = Harlan York and Associates|publisher =  | last1 =  York | first1 =  Harlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making up a significant amount of the labor force.

As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; When the [[opportunity cost]] is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Escape from [[poverty]] (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push factor, and the availability of [[employment|jobs]] is the related pull factor. [[Natural disasters]] can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. Research shows that for middle-income countries, higher temperatures increase emigration rates to urban areas and to other countries. For low-income countries, higher temperatures reduce emigration.&lt;ref name="CattaneoPeri2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Migration Response to Increasing Temperatures  | first1 =  Cristina | last1 =  Cattaneo|first2 = Giovanni|last2 = Peri |year=2016 |journal=[[Journal of Development Economics]] |volume=122 |issue=C |pages=127–146 |doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.05.004 |hdl = 10419/130264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment: religious [[Missionary|missionaries]] and employees of [[transnational corporations]], international [[non-governmental organizations]], and the [[diplomatic service]] expect, by definition, to work "overseas". They are often referred to as "[[expatriates]]", and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those applying in the host country (for similar work).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Non-economic push factors include [[persecution]] (religious and otherwise), frequent abuse, [[bullying]], [[oppression]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[genocide]], risks to civilians during [[war]], and social marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=224241|title=The Earnings of Male Hispanic Immigrants in the United States | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = Barry|date=March 2000|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] Institute for the Study of Labor|type=Working paper|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kislev2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kislev | first1 = Elyakim|date=1 June 2014|title=The Effect of Minority/Majority Origins on Immigrants' Integration |journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=92|issue=4|pages=1457–1486|doi=10.1093/sf/sou016|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows; for instance, people may emigrate in order to escape a [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref name="Borjas2016"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Borjas | first1 = George J.|date=1 April 1982|title=The Earnings of Male Hispanic Immigrants in the United States |journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–353|doi=10.1177/001979398203500304|issn=0019-7939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some migration is for personal reasons, based on a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] (e.g. to be with family or a partner), such as in [[family reunification]] or [[transnational marriage]] (especially in the instance of a [[gender imbalance]]). Recent research has found gender, age, and cross-cultural differences in the ownership of the idea to immigrate.&lt;ref name="Rubin2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rubin|first1=Mark|title="It Wasn't My Idea to Come Here!": Young Women Lack Ownership of the Idea to Immigrate - Mark Rubin's Social Psychology Research|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date=July 2013|volume=37|issue=4|year=2013|pages=497–501|issn=01471767|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2013.02.001 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/-it-wasn-t-my-idea-to-come-here-young-women-lack-ownership-of-the-idea-to-immigrate |accessdate=3 October 2018 |ref=Rubin2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases, an individual may wish to immigrate to a new country in a form of transferred [[patriotism]]. Evasion of [[criminal justice]] (e.g., avoiding [[arrest]]) is a personal motivation. This type of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or find other loopholes to evade detection. For example, there have been reports of [[war criminals]] disguising themselves as victims of war or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/opinion/125664|title=EU asylum and war criminals: No place to hide | last1 = Haskell | first1 = Leslie|date=18 September 2014|website=EUobserver.com|publisher=EUobserver|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/refugees-in-germany-reporting-dozens-of-war-crimes/a-19179291|title=Refugees in Germany reporting dozens of war crimes | last1 = Knight | first1 = Ben|date=11 April 2016|website=DW.com|publisher=Deutsche Welle|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sweden-syrian-asylum-seeker-suspected-war-crimes-under-assad-regime-arrested-stockholm-1546149|title=Sweden: Syrian asylum seeker suspected of war crimes under Assad regime arrested in Stockholm | last1 = Porter | first1 = Tom|date=26 February 2016|website=International Business Times UK|publisher=International Business Times|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form or political form; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support network, and culture. They also need to liquidate their assets, and they incur the expense of moving. When they arrive in a new country, this is often with many uncertainties including finding work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/lack-of-network-hurting-migrant-workers-20120603-1zq3u.html|title=Lack of network hurting migrant workers | last1 = May | first1 = Julia|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; where to live, new laws, new cultural norms, language or accent issues, possible [[racism]], and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/the-7-biggest-challenges-facing-refugees-and-immig/|title=The 7 biggest challenges facing refugees and immigrants in the US | last1 = Nunez | first1 = Christina|date=12 December 2014|website=Global Citizen|publisher=Global Poverty Project|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Djajić2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Djajić | first1 = Slobodan|date=1 September 2013|title=Barriers to immigration and the dynamics of emigration |journal=Journal of Macroeconomics|volume=37|pages=41–52|doi=10.1016/j.jmacro.2013.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Čížov (Zaisa) - preserved part of Iron curtain.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Iron Curtain]] in Europe was designed as a means of [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|preventing emigration]]. "It is one of the ironies of post-war European history that, once the freedom to travel for Europeans living under communist regimes, which had long been demanded by the West, was finally granted in 1989/90, travel was very soon afterwards made much more difficult by the West itself, and new barriers were erected to replace the Iron Curtain."  —Anita Böcker&lt;ref&gt;Anita Böcker (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejOg0L5pbHUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Regulation of migration: international experiences''].

The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues, such as [[national security]] and [[terrorism]], especially in western Europe, with the presence of [[Islam]] as a new major religion. Those with security concerns cite the [[2005 French riots]] and point to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] as examples of the value conflicts arising from immigration of [[Muslims in Western Europe]]. Because of all these associations, immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euranetplus-inside.eu/migration-refugees-europe-waves-of-emotion/|title=Migration, refugees, Europe – waves of emotion | last1 = |date=7 May 2015|website=Euranet Plus inside|publisher=Euranet Plus Network|language=en-GB|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/global-immigration-germany-integration.html|title=Europe learns integration can become emotional | last1 = Nowicki | first1 = Dan|date=|website=AZCentral.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have suggested that some [[special interest group]]s [[Lobbying|lobby]] for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when impacting other groups. A 2010 European study suggested that "employers are more likely to be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers are more likely to be anti-immigration than employees."&lt;ref name="Tamura2010"/&gt; A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that "representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts."&lt;ref name="FacchiniSteinhardt2011"/&gt;

Another contributing factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants. The Chairman for the US Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform—which lobby for more permissive rules for immigrants, as well as special arrangements just for Irish people—has stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get—'as will every other ethnic group in the country.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="irishlobbyusa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nclr"/&gt;

Immigrants are motivated to leave their former countries of citizenship, or habitual residence, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of local access to [[resources]], a desire for economic [[prosperity]], to find or engage in paid work, to better their [[standard of living]], [[family reunification]], [[retirement]], [[Environmental migrant|climate or environmentally induced]] migration, [[exile]], escape from prejudice, conflict or natural disaster, or simply the wish to change one's [[quality of life]]. [[Commuting|Commuters]], [[Tourism|tourists]] and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration, [[Seasonal industry|seasonal labour]] immigration is sometimes included.

The term economic migrant refers to someone who has travelled from one region to another region for the purposes of seeking employment and an improvement in quality of life and access to resources. An economic migrant is distinct from someone who is a [[refugee]] fleeing persecution.

Many countries have immigration and visa restrictions that prohibit a person entering the country for the purposes of gaining work without a valid work visa. As a violation of a [[State (polity)|State's]] immigration laws a person who is declared to be an economic migrant can be refused entry into a country.

Some proponents of immigration argue that the freedom of movement both within and between countries is a basic human right, and that the restrictive immigration policies, typical of nation-states, violate this human right of freedom of movement.&lt;ref name="immigration"/&gt; Such arguments are common among anti-state ideologies like [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]].&lt;ref name=theanarchistlibrary&gt;{{cite web |title=Anarchism and Immigration |date=1 January 2005 |work=theanarchistlibrary |url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/scott-of-the-insurgency-culture-collective-anarchism-and-immigration }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As philosopher and [[Open border]]s activist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] has written, "Treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the opposite side of a national boundary, is hard to justify under any mainstream philosophical, religious or ethical theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethical Case for an Open Immigration Policy|publisher=Render Media|date=4 May 2009|url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://OpposingViews.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where immigration is permitted, it is typically selective. {{as of|2003}}, [[family reunification]] accounted for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every year.&lt;ref name="migrationinformation2"/&gt; Ethnic selection, such as the [[White Australia policy]], has generally disappeared, but priority is usually given to the educated, skilled, and wealthy. Less privileged individuals, including the mass of poor people in low-income countries, cannot avail themselves of the legal and protected immigration opportunities offered by wealthy states. This inequality has also been criticized as conflicting with the principle of [[equal opportunities]]. The fact that the door is closed for the unskilled, while at the same time many developed countries have a huge demand for unskilled labor, is a major factor in [[illegal immigration]]. The contradictory nature of this policy—which specifically disadvantages the unskilled immigrants while exploiting their labor—has also been criticized on ethical grounds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Immigration policies which selectively grant freedom of movement to targeted individuals are intended to produce a net economic gain for the host country. They can also mean net loss for a poor donor country through the loss of the educated minority—a "[[brain drain]]". This can exacerbate the [[Global justice|global inequality]] in [[standards of living]] that provided the motivation for the individual to migrate in the first place. One example of competition for skilled labour is active recruitment of [[health worker]]s from developing countries by developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewalrus.ca/poaching-foreign-doctors/|title=Poaching Foreign Doctors | last1 = Krotz | first1 = Larry|date=12 September 2012|website=The Walrus|publisher=The Walrus|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stilwell | first1 = Barbara|last2=Diallo|first2=Khassoum|last3=Zurn|first3=Pascal|last4=Vujicic|first4=Marko|last5=Adams|first5=Orvill|last6=Dal Poz|first6=Mario|date=2004|title=Migration of health-care workers from developing countries: strategic approaches to its management|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/8/595arabic.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=|issue=82|pages=595–600|doi=|pmid=|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may however also be a "brain gain" to emigration, as migration opportunities lead to greater investments in education in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Shrestha2017"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shrestha | first1 = Slesh A.|date=1 April 2016|title=No Man Left Behind: Effects of Emigration Prospects on Educational and Labour Outcomes of Non-migrants |journal=The Economic Journal|volume=127|issue=600|language=en|pages=495–521|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12306|issn=1468-0297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeineDocquier2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beine | first1 = Michel|last2=Docquier|first2=Fréderic|last3=Rapoport|first3=Hillel|date=1 April 2008|title=Brain Drain and Human Capital Formation in Developing Countries: Winners and Losers |journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=118|issue=528|pages=631–652|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2008.02135.x|issn=1468-0297|hdl=2078.1/5768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DinkelmanMariotti2016"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dinkelman | first1 = Taryn|last2=Mariotti|first2=Martine|date=2016|title=The Long Run Effects of Labor Migration on Human Capital Formation in Communities of Origin |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=1–35 |doi=10.1257/app.20150405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BatistaLacuesta2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Batista | first1 = Catia|last2=Lacuesta|first2=Aitor|last3=Vicente|first3=Pedro C.|date=1 January 2012|title=Testing the 'brain gain' hypothesis: Micro evidence from Cape Verde |journal=Journal of Development Economics |volume=97|issue=1|pages=32–45|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2011.01.005|hdl=10419/44193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries.&lt;ref name="di GiovanniLevchenko2015" /&gt;

==Assimilation==

=== United States ===
A 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'' found that within racial groups, most immigrants to the United States had fully assimilated within a span of 20 years.&lt;ref name="VillarrealTamborini2018" /&gt; Immigrants arriving in the United States after 1994 assimilate more rapidly than immigrants who arrived in previous periods.&lt;ref name="VillarrealTamborini2018" /&gt; Measuring assimilation can be difficult due to "ethnic attrition", which refers to when ancestors of migrants cease to self-identify with the nationality or ethnicity of their ancestors. This means that successful cases of assimilation will be underestimated. Research shows that ethnic attrition is sizable in Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups in the United States.&lt;ref name="DuncanTrejo2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duncan | first1 = Brian|last2=Trejo|first2=Stephen J|year=2011|title=Tracking Intergenerational Progress for Immigrant Groups: The Problem of Ethnic Attrition|journal=American Economic Review|volume=101|issue=3|pages=603–608|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlbaIslam2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alba | first1 = Richard|last2=Islam|first2=Tariqul|date=1 January 2009|title=The Case of the Disappearing Mexican Americans: An Ethnic-Identity Mystery|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|volume=28|issue=2|pages=109–121|doi=10.1007/s11113-008-9081-x|jstor=20616620}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking account of ethnic attrition, the assimilation rate of Hispanics in the United States improves significantly.&lt;ref name="DuncanTrejo2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuncanTrejo2016"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duncan | first1 = Brian|last2=Trejo|first2=Stephen|year=2017|title=The Complexity of Immigrant Generations: Implications for Assessing the Socioeconomic Integration of Hispanics and Asians|journal=ILR Review|volume=70|issue=5|pages=1146–1175|doi=10.1177/0019793916679613|pmid=28935997|pmc=5602570|citeseerx=10.1.1.403.8151}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 paper challenges the view that cultural differences are necessarily an obstacle to long-run economic performance of migrants.

Research suggests that bilingual schooling reduces barriers between speakers from two different communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cappellari  |first1=Lorenzo |last2=Di Paolo|first2=Antonio |title=Bilingual Schooling and Earnings: Evidence from a Language-in-Education Reform|journal=IZA Discussion Papers |date=October 2015 |issue=9431|url=http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=9431 |accessdate=22 March 2016|language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that a vicious cycle of bigotry and isolation could reduce assimilation and increase bigotry towards immigrants in the long-term. For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue "fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a vicious cycle that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims’ alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adida | first1 = Claire L.|last2=Laitin|first2=David D.|last3=Valfort|first3=Marie-Anne|date=2017-02-01|title=The Wrong Way to Stop Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-02-01/wrong-way-stop-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1XnDFa2nmdhSnJwSVRoSkJqYjQ/view|title=AdidaLaitinValfort2017_ForeignAffairs.pdf|newspaper=Google Docs|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study which examined [[Catalan nationalism]] examined the Catalan Government's policy towards the integration of immigrants during the start of the 1990s. At this time the Spanish region of Catalonia was experiencing a large influx in the number of immigrants from Northern Africa , Latin America and Asia.The Spanish government paid little attention to this influx of immigrants. However, Catalan politicians began discussing how the increase in immigrants would effect Catalan identity. Members of the Catalan parliament petitioned for a plan to integrate these immigrants into Catalan society. Crucially , the plan did not include policies regarding [[Naturalization|naturalisation]] , which were key immigration policies of the Spanish government.The plan of the Catalan parliament aimed to create a shared Catalan identity which included both the native Catalan population and immigrant communities. This meant that immigrants were encouraged to relate as part of the Catalan community but also encouraged to retain their own culture and traditions. In this way assimilation of immigrant cultures in Catalonia was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coversi |last2=et al. |date=2017|title=Despite the crisis: The resilience of intercultural nationalism in Catalonia|url=|journal=International Migration|volume= 55 |issue = 2|pages=53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Housing====
A 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of [[Housing discrimination (United States)|racial discrimination in the American housing market]].&lt;ref name="Rich2014"/&gt; Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties.&lt;ref name="Rich2014"/&gt; Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remained significant.&lt;ref name="Rich2014"/&gt; A 2003 study finds  "evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood ([[redlining]]). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas ([[Racial steering|steering]]); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination)."&lt;ref name="OndrichRoss2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ondrich | first1 = Jan|last2=Ross|first2=Stephen|last3=Yinger|first3=John|date=1 November 2003|title=Now You See It, Now You Don't: Why Do Real Estate Agents Withhold Available Houses from Black Customers? |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=85|issue=4|pages=854–873|doi=10.1162/003465303772815772|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor market====
Several meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the American labor market.&lt;ref name="Rich2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RiachRich2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZschirntRuedin2016"/&gt; A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests – tests where identical CVs for stereotypically black and white names were sent to employers – in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North-America.&lt;ref name="ZschirntRuedin2016"/&gt; These correspondence tests showed that equivalent minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates.&lt;ref name="ZschirntRuedin2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BertrandMullainathan2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bertrand | first1 = Marianne|last2=Mullainathan|first2=Sendhil|title=Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal?

==Impact on the sending country==
Remittances increase living standards in the country of origin. Remittances are a large share of the GDP of many developing countries.&lt;ref name="Ratha 2012 1–3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratha | first1 = Dilip|year=2012|title=Remittance flows in 2011|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1110315015165/MigrationandDevelopmentBrief18.pdf|journal=Migration and Development Brief –Migration and Remittances Unit, the World Bank|volume=18|pages=1–3|author2=Silwal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ratha 2012 1–3" /&gt; A study on remittances to Mexico found that remittances lead to a substantial increase in the availability of public services in Mexico, surpassing government spending in some localities.&lt;ref name="AdidaGirod2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adida | first1 = Claire L.|last2=Girod|first2=Desha M.|date=1 January 2011|title=Do Migrants Improve Their Hometowns?

Research finds that emigration and low migration barriers has net positive effects on human capital formation in the sending countries.&lt;ref name="Shrestha2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BeineDocquier2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DinkelmanMariotti2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BatistaLacuesta2012"/&gt; This means that there is a "brain gain" instead of a "brain drain" to emigration.

One study finds that sending countries benefit indirectly in the long-run on the emigration of skilled workers because those skilled workers are able to innovate more in developed countries, which the sending countries are able to benefit on as a positive [[externality]]. Greater emigration of skilled workers consequently leads to greater economic growth and welfare improvements in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~ruix/JMP_Xu.pdf |title=High-Skilled Migration and Global Innovation  | last1 = Xu  | first1 = Rui |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104235245/http://web.stanford.edu/~ruix/JMP_Xu.pdf |archivedate=4 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects of high-skill emigration remain largely unfounded.

Research suggests that emigration causes an increase in the wages of those who remain in the country of origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">The '''Indian Super League Golden Boot''' is an annual association football award presented to the leading goalscorer in the Indian Super League.

The award in 2014 was sponsored by '''[[Maruti Suzuki]]''' and the award was hence called Alto K10 Indian Super League Golden Boot.&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{cite news |title=HEROISL: EX-LEICESTER STRIKER HUME NAMED PLAYER OF THE ISL, ELANO LANDS GOLDEN BOOT |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/heroisl-ex-leicester-striker-hume-named-player-isl-elano-lands-golden-boot-4054435#.VJap7sAA |date=December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |publisher=Goal.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Super League was founded in 2014 and the league consisted of 8 teams representing different cities.

The first Indian Super League golden boot was won by [[Elano]] of [[Chennaiyin FC]] in 2014 after he finished as the top scorer with 8 goals.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite news |title=Elano wins Golden Boot for ISL exploits with Chennaiyin |url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/7083/isl/2014/12/20/7246022/elano-wins-golden-boot-for-isl-exploits-with-chennaiyin |date=December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |publisher=Goal.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Isham-Terry House''' is a [[historic house museum]] at 211 High Street in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].  Built about 1854, it was from 1896 home to members of the Isham family, who restored it in the early 20th century.  The family donated the property to [[Connecticut Landmarks]] in the 1970s, which now operates it has a museum, offering guided tours and facility event rentals.  The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Description and history==
The Isham-Terry House occupies a prominent and highly visible location just north of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania–Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] outside downtown Hartford, at the northwest corner of High and Walnut Streets, and adjacent to the city's police department headquarters.  It is a roughly cubical painted brick structure, two stories in height, with a low-pitch roof.  A three-story tower projecting from its southwest corner adds visual prominence.  The roof eaves are deep, with decorative Italianate brackets for support.  Windows are on the two main floors are set in rectangular openings, with narrow oblong windows in the attic level of the main block.  On the street-facing facades, the second-floor windows are topped by gabled or segmented-arch pediments with brackets on either side.  The first floor of the facade facining Walnut Street is sheltered by a porch supported by slender clustered columns, with round-arch openings that have carved woodwork in the spandrels, and a low spindled balustrade. A similar porch shelters the main entrance facing High Street, and balconies on the tower share similar features.  The building interior is well preserved, with lincrusta wall covering, ornate woodwork, and glass chandeliers.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|82004413}}|title=NRHP nomination for Isham-Terry House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was built sometime between the 1852 purchase of land by Ebenezer Roberts, and his listing as the building's first occupant in 1856.  Roberts was a directory of the Hartford National Bank, Travelers Insurance Company, and other local businesses.  Construction of this house contributed to the development of Asylum Hill as a desirable and fashionable neighborhood for the city's elites, although urban renewal has resulted in demolition of nearly all of the other similar houses that once lined High Street. The house was purchased in 1896 by Dr. Oliver Isham, a descendant of the locally prominent Isham and Terry families.  He lived here and operated a medical practice.  In the 1970s his surviving descendants gave the property to Connecticut Landmarks for preservation.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

[[File:Restout - Morpheus.jpg|thumb|English: Morpheus by Jean-Bernard Restout]]
'''Morpheus'''  ('Fashioner', derived from the {{lang-grc|μορφή}} meaning 'form, shape')&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; ''[[LSJ]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmorfh%2F s.v. μορφ-ή]&lt;/ref&gt; is a god associated with sleep and dreams. In Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' he is the son of Sleep, who appears in dreams in human form. From the [[medieval]] period, the name began to stand more generally for the god of dreams, or of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, s.v. Morpheus p. 968; Griffin, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ovid==
In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Morpheus is one of the thousand sons of [[Somnus]] (Sleep).&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;677].&lt;/ref&gt; His name derives from the Greek word for form (''μορφή''), and his function was to appear in dreams in human guise.  According to Ovid "no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;638].&lt;/ref&gt; Like other gods associated with sleep, Ovid makes Morpheus winged.&lt;ref&gt; Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; Griffin, p. 243; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.167.xml 11.652&amp;ndash;653].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovid called Morpheus and his brothers, the other sons of Somnus, the ''Somnia'' ("dream shapes"), saying that they appear in dreams "mimicking many forms".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.613].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid gives names to two more of these sons of Sleep. One called Icelos ('Like'), by the gods, but [[Phobetor]] ('Frightener') by men, "takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent", and [[Phantasos]] ('Fancy'), who "puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.638&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt;    

The three brothers names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripp calls these three figures "literary, not mythical concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; However Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Morpheus and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, pp. 179, 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Arts==
[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in his 1621 ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', refers to a depiction of Morpheus, saying "Philostratus paints [Morpheus] in a white and black coat, with a horn and ivory box full of dreams, of the same colours, to signify good and bad".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/acm8939.0001.001/330 p. 326].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carl Michael Bellman]]'s ''[[Fredmans Epistlar|Fredman's Epistle]]'' No. 72, "[[Glimmande nymf]]", Morpheus is invoked as the "god of sleep".&lt;ref&gt;Britten Austin, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Asian Art''' ({{lang-de|Museum für Asiatische Kunst}}) is located in the [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] neighborhood of the borough of {{lang|de|[[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]]}}, [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is one of the [[Berlin State Museums]] institutions and is funded by the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. It houses some 20,000 Asian artifacts, making it one of the largest museums of ancient [[Asian art]] in the world.&lt;ref name="SMB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/kalender/details.php?objID=13313&amp;lang=en&amp;typeId=10|title=Collection of South, Southeast and Central Asian Art in the Dahlem Museums|publisher=Staatliche Museen zu Berlin|accessdate=3 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213100320/http://www.smb.museum/smb/kalender/details.php?objID=13313&amp;lang=en&amp;typeId=10|archivedate=13 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located in the same building as the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]]. The museum houses important collections of Art houses of South, Southeast and Central Asian countries and art from the Indo-Asian cultural area, from the 4th millennium BC to the present. Its geographic reach covers regions in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], the [[Autonomous Region of Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], the Southeast Asian countries of [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and also the [[Indonesia|Indonesian Islands]] or archipelago.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/sammlungen/details.php?objectId=12904&amp;lang=en|title=Museum of Asian Art|accessdate=3 November 2012|publisher =SMB Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The collection originally belonged to the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] founded in 1873.&lt;ref name="Koloss1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koloss|first=Hans-Joachim|title=Art of Central Africa: Masterpieces from the Berlin Museum Für Völkerkunde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo7IDmR0sesC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=3 November 2012|year=1990|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-590-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1904 it was known as the "Indian Department". 
[[Image:Museum für Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 063.jpg|thumb|left|Uyghur Princes wearing Chinese-styled robes and headgear. Bezeklik, Cave 9, 9-12th century CE, wall painting, 62.4 x 59.5 cm.]]
On November 8, 1906, by government decree, [[Wilhelm von Bode]], director-general of the Royal Museums of Berlin, founded the collection of the Museum of East Asian Art in Berlin.&lt;ref name="SchwaigerGermany2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwaiger|first=Elizabeth|title=Museum of East Asian Art Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgZJAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2012|year=2001|publisher=Prestel|isbn=978-3-7913-2460-9|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's oldest museum of its kind, it was first located on Museum Island.

As a result of the four [[German Turfan expeditions]], from 1902 to 1914, the collection was expanded to include [[Central Asia]]. In 1924, the exhibition was moved into the building belonging to the Arts and Crafts Museum, which at that time was also home to the Museum of Pre- and Early History (since 1981, it has been known as Martin-Gropius-Bau). The Society for East Asian Art founded in 1926 has provided substantial support for the museum's work. Thanks to their consistent expansion until the Second World War, the collections were among the most important in the world.

During the Second World War, there were regrettable losses, partly due to damage to the museum building and partly to the removal of a large number of artifacts to Russia.&lt;ref name="SMB"/&gt; After the war, the Red Army took about 90 percent of the distributed collections to the Soviet Union as war booty. There they were taken to the Hermitage in St Petersburg where they have remained until today. Only a few pieces were returned to Berlin. The almost complete loss necessitated recreating the collection but this could only be achieved gradually. From 1952, it was the Pergamon Museum that exhibited East Asian Art. At the instigation of the first director, Herbert Härtel, the collections were presented as part of an independent "Indian Art Department", later called the "Museum of Indian Art" (from 1 January 1963 to 4 December 2006).&lt;ref name="SMB"/&gt;

After the Berlin Wall went up, it was decided in 1970 to build new exhibition premises in West Berlin in the Zehlendorf district. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, efforts were made to reorganize Berlin's museum scene. In 1992, the two separate collections were brought together in Dahlem. The Association of Friends of the Department, the Society of Indo-Asian Art Berlin eV, was founded in 1993. It publishes the annual ''Indo-Asiatische Zeitschrift'' ("Indo-Asian Journal"). In 2000, they were extended, forming until 2006 the Museum of East Asian Art, which now continues as the East Asian Art Collection at the Museum of Asian Art, since December 2006&lt;ref name="Brunhouse2008"/&gt;

==Collection==
The collection covers the art of all of [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], with special focus on sculpture (south and southeast Asia) and murals (central Asia). The artifacts date from the third millennium BC to the present day.&lt;ref name="Brunhouse2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunhouse|first=Jay|title=Maverick Guide to Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LylIwXu0xsC&amp;pg=PA358|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=1 March 2008|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-58980-301-5|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum, with an outstanding collection of some 20,000 artifacts, has example of stone sculptures, reliefs, bronze and terracotta works representative of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Much of its collection of Jain art and Hindu sculpture dates to the classic period or the Middle Ages, and the museum also contains reconstruction of Indian temples.&lt;ref name="SMB"/&gt; The East Asian Art Collection houses the largest and most important collection of Chinese, Korean and Japanese art in Germany.&lt;ref name="Brunhouse2008"/&gt; It consists of some 13,000 artefacts from all cultural periods, from the [[Neolithic]] to the present day. The three countries of the Asian subcontinent are first presented separately in their own departments. Their galleries converge on a central hall exhibiting the art of Buddhism, a common element in all three cultures. The Chinese Department has a large exhibition of porcelain, considerably enriched by Georg Weishaupt's collection, as well as [[lacquerware]]. Over 3,000-year-old bronzes, [[jade]]s and ceramics attest to the country's early civilization and culture. A porcelain cup from the [[Wanli Emperor]]'s time (1573–1620) during the [[Ming dynasty]] is of outstanding cultural and historical significance. In a separate room, a 17th-century traveling throne belonging to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] is exhibited.&lt;ref name="Schulte-PeeversGray2007"/&gt; Its unique rosewood screen has rich pearl inlays with decorations of gold and lacquerwork.

With selected examples its China-Japan gallery, the museum presents the art of writing, common to all areas of East Asian art. As many works of Chinese and Japanese writing and some of the old paintings are particularly sensitive to light, they are exhibited for periods of three months before being replaced. The same applies to many items of lacquerwork and textile art. However, as a result of ties with Japanese woodcuts and the museum's important graphic collection, new relationships and priorities constantly emerge. In the Japanese department, visitors are shown a Japanese tea room or Boki.&lt;ref name="Schulte-PeeversGray2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulte-Peevers|first1=Andrea|last2=Gray|first2=Jeremy|title=Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pOkQtBKiacC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=1 March 2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-988-7|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study collection offers interested museum visitors the opportunity to experience an in-depth insight into the collection. A central repository for the collections is being planned in Berlin Friedrichshagen.

==Services==
By appointment the Japanese tea ceremony can be observed. A reference library is open exclusively to experts. An interactive computer program and alternating short films complement the presentation. The courtyard, which can be reached from the basement, presents a stone copy of the east gate of the famous [[Stupa]] I from [[Sanchi]] in central India.

==Associations==
A tradition of close cooperation exists with the German Society for East Asian Art, one of the museum's two supporting associations. At an international level, the museum cooperates with various non-European art museums, as well as with the [[Museum Rietberg]] in Zürich and the [[Musée Guimet]] in Paris . In the scientific field, the South, Southeast and Central Asia Collection and the East Asian Art Collection are closely connected with the neighboring [[Free University of Berlin]]. For example, museum director Willibald Veit is also Professor of East Asian Art History at the University.&lt;ref name="KarlssonLuo2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karlsson|first1=Kim|last2=Luo|first2=Pin|title=Luo Ping: The Life, Career, and Art of an Eighteenth-Century Chinese Painter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QzcoeCezLcC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=3 November 2012|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03910-223-5|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger of the two museums has been done with a future expansion plans of the "Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz" and to establish the Humboldt-Forum on Schlossplatz in Berlin-Mitte, a new concept venue for unique European collections.&lt;ref name=Art/&gt;

{{Machine code}}

In [[computer science]], a '''NOP''', '''no-op''', or '''NOOP''' (pronounced "no op"; short for '''no operation''') is an [[assembly language]] instruction, [[programming language]] statement, or [[protocol (computing)|computer protocol]] command that does nothing.

== Machine set of directions ==
Some computer [[instruction set]]s include an instruction whose explicit purpose is to not change the state of any of the programmer-accessible [[Processor register|registers]], [[Process states|status flags]], or [[main memory|memory]]. It often takes a well-defined number of [[clock cycles]] to execute. In other instruction sets, a NOP can be simulated by executing an instruction having operands that cause the same effect; ''e.g.'', on the [[SPARC]] processor, the instruction &lt;code&gt;sethi 0, %g0&lt;/code&gt; is the recommended solution.

A NOP is most commonly used for timing purposes, to force [[Data structure alignment|memory alignment]], to prevent [[hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]s, to occupy a [[branch delay slot]], to render void an existing instruction such as a jump, or as a place-holder to be replaced by active instructions later on in program development (or to replace removed instructions when reorganizing would be problematic or time-consuming). In some cases, a NOP can have minor side effects; for example, on the [[Motorola 68000]] series of processors, the NOP opcode causes a synchronization of the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]].&lt;ref name=m68ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf|title=Motorola 68000 Programmer's Reference Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the NOPR instruction, the second value in the second byte is the register to branch on. If register 0 is chosen, no branch occurs regardless of the mask value. Thus, if either of the two values in the second byte is 0, the branch will not happen. 

In the case of the NOP instruction, the second value in the second byte is the "base" register of a combined base register, displacement register and offset address. If the base register is also 0, the branch is not taken regardless of the value of the displacement register or displacement address.

From a hardware design point of view, unmapped areas of a bus are often designed to return zeroes; since the [[NOP slide]] behavior is often desirable, it gives a bias to coding it with the all-zeroes opcode.

== Code ==
NOP is sometimes used as a description for the action performed by a function or a sequence of programming language statements if the function or code has no effect (it might also be called [[redundant code]]). A common [[compiler optimization]] is the [[Dead code elimination|detection and removal of this kind of code]]. Such code may be required by the grammar of the programming language, which does not allow a blank.

=== Ada ===
In [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; statement serves as a NOP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/05aarm/html/AA-5-1.html#S0134 Ada Reference Manual &amp;mdash; null statements]. "The execution of a null_statement has no effect."&lt;/ref&gt; As the syntax forbids that control statements or functions be empty, the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; statement must be used to specify that no action is required. (Thus, if the programmer forgets to write a sequence of statements, the program will fail to compile.)

=== C and derivatives ===
The second line below is an example of a single [[C (programming language)|C]] statement that ''behaves'' like a NOP. In practice, most [[compilers]] will not generate code for this statement:
   int i = 0;
   i+1;
This statement performs an addition and discards the result. Indeed, any statement without side effects (and that does not affect control flow, e.g., break, return) can be removed, as the result of the computation is discarded.

The simplest possible statement in C that behaves like a NOP is the so-called ''null statement'', which is just a semi-colon in a context requiring a statement. (A compiler is not required to generate a NOP instruction in this case; typically, no instructions whatsoever would be generated.)
   ;
Alternatively, an empty block (compound statement) may be used, and may be more legible:
   {}
In some cases, such as the body of a function, a block must be used, but this can be empty. In C, statements cannot be empty – simple statements must end with a ; (semicolon) while compound statements are enclosed in {} (braces), which does not itself need a following semicolon. Thus in contexts where a statement is grammatically required, some such null statement can be used.

The null statement is useless by itself, but it can have a syntactic use in a wider context, e.g., within the context of a loop:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  while (getchar() != '\n') {}
&lt;/source&gt;
alternatively,
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;

  while (getchar() != '\n')
      ;
&lt;/source&gt;
or more tersely:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;

  while (getchar() != '\n');
&lt;/source&gt;
(note that the last form may be confusing, and as such generates a warning with some compilers or compiler options, as semicolon usually indicates an end of function call instruction when placed after a round parenthesis on the end of line).

The above code continues calling the function ''getchar()'' until it returns a \n (newline) character, essentially fast-forwarding the current reading location of standard input to the beginning of next line.

=== [[Fortran]] ===
In Fortran, the &lt;code&gt;CONTINUE&lt;/code&gt; statement is used in some contexts such as the last statement in a DO loop, although it can be used anywhere, and does not have any functionality.

=== [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] ===
As with C, the ; used by itself can be used as a null statement. In fact, due to the specification of the language, in a BEGIN / END block, the semicolon is optional before the END statement, thus a semicolon used there is superfluous. 

Also, a block consisting of &lt;code&gt; BEGIN END;&lt;/code&gt; may be used as a placeholder to indicate no action, even if placed inside another BEGIN / END block.
=== Python ===
The [[Python programming language]] has a [[Python programming language#Statements and control flow|&lt;code&gt;pass&lt;/code&gt; statement]] which has no effect when executed and thus serves as a NOP. It is primarily used to ensure correct syntax due to Python's [[off-side rule|indentation-sensitive syntax]]; for example the syntax for definition of a [[class (computer programming)|class]] requires an indented block with the class logic, which has to be expressed as &lt;code&gt;pass&lt;/code&gt; when it should be empty.

=== jQuery ===
The [[jQuery]] library provides a function &lt;code&gt;jQuery.noop()&lt;/code&gt;, which does nothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noop/ jQuery.noop()] from jQuery API documentation&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Angular ===
The [[AngularJS|Angular]] framework provides [https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.noop angular.noop] function that performs no operations.

=== Shell Scripting (bash, zsh, etc) ===
The '&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;' [colon] character is a shell builtin that has similar effect to a "NOP" (a do-nothing operation). It's not technically an NOP, as it changes the special parameter $? (exit status of last command) to 0. It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin 'true', and its exit status is true (0).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide &gt; Chapter 3. Special Characters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;bash manpage &gt; SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;zsh manpage (zshbuiltins) &gt; SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lodash ===
The [[Lodash]] library provides a function &lt;code&gt;_.noop()&lt;/code&gt;, which returns undefined and does nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lodash.com/docs/#noop|title=Lodash Documentation|website=lodash.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NOP protocol commands ==
Many [[protocol (computing)|computer protocol]]s, such as [[telnet]], include a NOP command that a client can issue to request a response from the server without requesting any other actions. Such a command can be used to [[Keepalive|ensure the connection is still alive]] or that the server is responsive. A NOOP command is part of the following protocols (''this is a partial list''):
*[[telnet]]
*[[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]
*[[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]
*[[X Window core protocol|X11]]
*[[Post Office Protocol|POP3]]
*[[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]
*[[Finger protocol|finger]]
*[[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP4]]
*[[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]
*[[Character encoding]]: the [[null (Character)|null]] [[control character]]
Note that unlike the other protocols listed, the IMAP4 NOOP command has a specific purpose - it allows the server to send any pending notifications to the client.

While most [[telnet]] or [[FTP]] servers respond to a NOOP command with "OK" or "+OK", some programmers have added quirky responses to the client. For example, the &lt;code&gt;ftpd&lt;/code&gt; daemon of [[MINIX]] responds to NOOP with the message:&lt;ref name="minix_ftpd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~cop4600/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source.cgi/commands/ftpd/ftpd.c#L139|title=ftpd.c|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 [[List of FTP server return codes|200]] NOOP to you too!

== Cracking ==
NOPs are often involved when [[Software cracking|cracking]] software that checks for serial numbers, specific hardware or software requirements, presence or absence of hardware [[dongle]]s, etc. This is accomplished by altering [[Subroutine|functions and subroutines]] to bypass security checks and instead simply return the expected value being checked for. Because most of the instructions in the security check routine will be unused, these would be replaced with NOPs, thus removing the software's security functionality without attracting any attention.

== Security exploits ==
The NOP opcode can be used to form a [[NOP slide]], which allows code to execute when the exact value of the instruction pointer is indeterminate (e.g., when a buffer overflow causes a function's return address on the stack to be overwritten).

A '''negotiable instrument''' is a document guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, with the payer usually named on the document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a [[contract]], which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term can have different meanings, depending on what law is being applied and what country and context it is used in.

==Definition==
In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]] in the UK, [[Bills of Exchange Act 1908]] in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|boea1909148|Bills of Exchange Act 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]] in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius. The Bills of Exchange Act:
# defines a bill of exchange as:  'an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person, or to bearer.
# defines a cheque as: 'a bill of exchange drawn on (behalf of) a banker, which is payable on demand (by banker)'
# defines a promissory note as: 'an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to bearer.'

Additionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked 'not negotiable' or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.

== History ==
The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as ''praescriptiones'' in the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=    Caesar and Christ : a history of Roman civilization and of Christianity from their beginnings to A.D. 325|series=The story of civilization|volume=3|year=1944|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|page=749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,000-year-old Roman [[promissory note]]s have been found&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/ancient-rome-London-Londinum-Bloomberg-archaeology-Boudicca-archaeology/|title=Ancient Roman IOUs Found Beneath Bloomberg's New London HQ|date=2016-06-01|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3620788/The-City-s-IOU-2-000-year-old-letters-reveal-daily-life-trade-debts-Roman-London.html|title=Ancient letters reveal daily life, trade and debts in Roman London|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in [[China]], where special instruments called ''feitsyan'' were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UBDndXgNIYC&amp;pg=PA50 |last=Moshenskyi  |first=Sergii |title= History of the Weksel |publisher= Xlibris Corporation |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-4363-0693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued bank notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078|title=Templar Order|website=Religion Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57175151|title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order|last=1966-|first=Martin, Sean,|date=2004|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1560256451|edition= 1st Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-13th century, the [[Ilkhanid]] rulers of [[Persia]] printed the "cha" or "chap" which was used as paper money for limited usage for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the "cha" only at progressive discount.

Later, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange ("[[suftadja]]" or "[[softa]]") from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13–15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16–18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver [[Commodity money|specie]], in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Anderson (economist)|Adam Anderson]], [https://archive.org/stream/historicalchrono01ande#page/208/mode/2up An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce: from the earliest accounts to the present time. Containing, an history of the great commercial interests of the British empire...], Vol. I, p.209–210 (1764)&lt;/ref&gt; English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bill of Exchange|volume=3|pages=940-943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]].&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; Germanic [[Lombards]] documents may also have some elements of negotiability.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jacob J.

== Distinguished from other types of contracts ==
[[File:British Foreign Bill stamps on 1870 Oriental Bank Corporation Bill of Exchange.jpg|thumbnail|right|An 1870 Bill of Exchange payable in London with British ''Foreign Bill'' [[revenue stamp]]s attached.]]
A negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a [[contract]], albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite [[offer and acceptance]] and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a ''holder in due course'', the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a "[[bearer instrument]]", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid ''endorsement'' of the negotiable instrument.

The consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable [[statute of frauds]] as to that contract.

=== The holder in due course ===
The rights of a [[holder in due course]] of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:
* The rights to payment are not subject to [[Set-off (law)|set-off]], and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque)
* No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument "counts" as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. §3-602(b)]
* Transfer free of equities—the holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course)

Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery ([[order instrument]]s), or by delivery alone ([[bearer instrument]]s).

== Classes ==
Promissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments.

=== Promissory note ===
Although possibly non-negotiable, a [[promissory note]] may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the ''payee'', or at fixed or determinable future time, certain in money, to order or to bearer. (see Sec. 194){{clarify|date=August 2016}} The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument.

[[Bank notes]] are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India's [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]], "a Promissory Note is an writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Bill of exchange ===
A bill of exchange or "draft" is a written order by the ''[[wiktionary:drawer|drawer]]'' to the ''[[wiktionary:drawee|drawee]]'' to pay money to the ''[[wiktionary:payee|payee]]''. A common type of bill of exchange is the [[cheque]] (''check'' in [[American English]]), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.
[[File:Credit1.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Bill of exchange, 1933]]
A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.
A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The "holder in due course" may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.
In some cases a bill is marked "not negotiable"—see [[crossing of cheques]]. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.

== In the United States ==
{{Template:Globalize/English|section|date=September 2018}}
In the [[United States]], Articles 3 and 4 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|state law enactments]] of UCC §§ 3–104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a ''negotiable instrument'':

{{quote|'''§ 3–104. NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.
(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:
(1) is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;
(2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and
(3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain
(i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment,
(ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or
(iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.
(b) "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.
(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.
(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.'''}}

Thus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-104 |title=Uniform Commercial Code – Article 3 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following requirements must be met:
# The promise or order to pay must be unconditional;
# The payment must be a specific sum of money, although [[interest (finance)|interest]] may be added to the sum;
# The payment must be made on demand or at a definite time;
# The instrument must not require the person promising payment to perform any act other than paying the money specified;
# The instrument must be payable to bearer or to order.
The latter requirement is referred to as the "words of negotiability": a writing which does not contain the words "to the order of" (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in [[allonge]]) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a [[bank]]) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads "pay John Doe") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.

UCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformcommercialcode.uslegal.com/articles-of-the-ucc/#sthash.s8ZqcyK4.dpuf |title=Articles of the Uniform Commercial Code |publisher=Uniformcommercialcode.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation and endorsement {{anchor|endorsement}}===
Persons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by placing one's [[signature]] on the instrument ("endorsement"): if the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an ''endorsement''. There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-204 Article 3, Sections 204–206]:
*An endorsement which purports to transfer the instrument to a specified person is a ''special endorsement'' – for example, "Pay to the order of Amy";
*An endorsement by the payee or holder which does not contain any additional notation (thus purporting to make the instrument payable to bearer) is an ''endorsement in blank'' or ''[[blank endorsement]];''
*An endorsement which purports to require that the funds be applied in a certain manner (e.g. "{{visible anchor|for deposit only}}", "for collection") is a ''restrictive endorsement''; and,
*An endorsement purporting to disclaim retroactive liability is called a ''qualified endorsement'' (through the inscription of the words "without recourse" as part of the endorsement on the instrument or in [[allonge]] to the instrument).
*An endorsement purporting to add terms and conditions is called a ''conditional endorsement'' – for example, "Pay to the order of Amy, if she rakes my lawn next Thursday November 15th, 2007". The UCC states that these conditions may be disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm#s3-206 |title=Article 3, Sections 206(b) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument
#in [[good faith]];
#for [[Value (economics)|value]];
#without notice of any [[defense (legal)|defense]]s to payment,
the transferee is a ''[[holder in due course]]'' and can enforce the instrument ''without'' being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain ''real defenses''. These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument.
The ''holder-in-due-course rule'' is a ''rebuttable presumption'' that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State's law contemplate ''real defenses'' available to purported holders in due course.
The foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to [[lawsuit|litigation]] to recover on the instrument.

=== Usage ===
While bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of [[commercial paper]] with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.

Alternatively, an individual or company may write a [[cheque|check]] payable to "cash" or "bearer" and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash.

=== Exceptions ===
Under the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments:
* [[Bill of lading|Bills of lading]] and other documents of title, which are governed by Article 7 of the Code.  However, under [[admiralty law]], a bill of lading may either be a negotiable or 'order' bill of lading or a nonnegotiable or 'straight' bill of lading.
* [[Deed]]s and other documents conveying interests in real estate, although a [[mortgage law|mortgage]] may secure a promissory note which is governed by Article 3
* [[IOU (debt)|IOU]]s
* [[Letters of credit]], which are governed by Article 5 of the Code

== Modern relevance ==
Although often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned.&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;Mann RJ (1996). [http://www.columbia.edu/~mr2651/Data/SearchforNegotiability.pdf Searching for Negotiability in Payment and Credit Systems]. ''UCLA Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], when [[money]] and [[market liquidity|liquidity]] was relatively scarce.&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; The [[holder in due course]] rule has been limited by various statutes.&lt;ref name=Greenlee/&gt; Concerns have also been raised that the [[holder in due course]] rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.&lt;ref name=Greenlee&gt;Greenlee MB, Fitzpatrck IV TJ.

==Early life==
Bockwinkel was born to [[Warren Bockwinkel]] – himself a professional wrestler – and Helen (née Crnkovich) Bockwinkel in St. Louis, Missouri on December 6, 1934.&lt;ref name="slamw"/&gt; He attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] on a [[American football|football]] [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]], playing for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] until sustaining a knee injury that ended his football career and cost him his scholarship.&lt;ref name="WWEObituary"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/nick-bockwinkel-passes-away-28215026|title=WWE Hall of Famer Nick Bockwinkel passes away|accessdate=November 29, 2015|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoxObituary"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Fox Sports]]|url=http://www.foxsports.com/wwe/story/wrestling-great-nick-bockwinkel-dead-at-the-age-of-80-111515|title=Wrestling great Nick Bockwinkel dead at the age of 80|accessdate=November 15, 2015|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1955–1970)===
Bockwinkel was trained to wrestle by his father and [[Lou Thesz]], debuting in 1955.&lt;ref name="FoxObituary"/&gt;

When he was first breaking into the business, Bockwinkel served as the driver for [[Yukon Eric]], taking him to various cities throughout the Eastern and Northeastern United States. He later commented that the experience, "was so smart. [...] Lots of ways to learn about this business."&lt;ref name="Matysik"/&gt; After training to become a professional wrestler with his father [[Warren Bockwinkel|Warren]],&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; a regional star in the 1940s, and [[Lou Thesz]],&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; he spent the early years of his career as part of a tag team with his father. At the age of 16, he had his debut match against Thesz. He won his first major singles title in 1963, defeating Tony Borne for the [[NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship]]. He also held several singles and tag team titles in Hawaii and California.&lt;ref name=slamw/&gt;

It was during his time at [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] that Bockwinkel developed into a main event star. He had previously been a heroic character, but began a transition to being a villain during a feud with [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dory Funk, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; Funk, Jr. later referred to Bockwinkel as "One of the best wrestling challengers for the belt. [...] He was very technical, and put a lot of thought into his interviews, his talk, his work in the ring, his persona."&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

===American Wrestling Association (1970–1987)===
In 1970, Bockwinkel joined the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), where he formed a team with wrestler [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]] and manager [[Bobby Heenan]].&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; Together, they won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] [[AWA World Tag Team Championship#Title history|three times]], the first in 1972.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; They defended the belts against such opponents as [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]], [[Dick the Bruiser]], [[Billy Robinson]], and [[Verne Gagne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=355|title=Biographical Dictionary of Professional Wrestling|publisher=McFarland|first=Harris M.|last=Lentz III|year=2003|isbn=0786417544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team eventually broke up after Stevens attacked Heenan when the latter praised himself and failed to comment on Stevens during an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Minnesota's Golden Age of Wrestling: From Verne Gagne to the Road Warriors|page=114|first=George|last=Schire|year=2010|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|isbn=0873516206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bockwinkel also teamed with [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Dog Vachon|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/ResultsArchive/Wrestlers/vachon-maurice.html|work=SLAM!

Bockwinkel became known for his articulate wrestling interviews. "I used to use the four, five or six syllable words as best I could," he was quoted as saying in the book ''The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels''. "If I ran across one I didn't know, I had a little dictionary. I would have this little dictionary, with 70 or 80 words, that I would always be perusing. I had it with me all the time. Automatically, some of these words just starting coming to me in my interviews because I was familiar with them."&lt;ref name=slamw/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels|first=Greg|last=Oliver|pages=68–9|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1554902843|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Heenan still as his manager, Bockwinkel won the first of many [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]]s on November 8, 1975 at the age of 40, ending Verne Gagne's seven-year reign.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; As AWA Champion, Bockwinkel had feuds with Billy Robinson, Dick the Bruiser, The Crusher, Tito Santana, [[Maurice Vachon|Mad Dog Vachon]], [[Jerry Lawler]], [[Otto Wanz]], [[Masa Saito|Mr. Saito]], [[Jim Brunzell]], [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]], Verne Gagne and [[Hulk Hogan]]. Bockwinkel was involved in the first ever AWA versus [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) World Title Unification match, wrestling [[WWE Championship|WWWF Champion]], [[Bob Backlund]], to a double count-out, on March 25, 1979,&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=350|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Professional Wrestling|first=Tim|last=Hornbaker|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1550227416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bockwinkel's first reign lasted for 1716 days and ended on July 19, 1980 when he was defeated by Verne Gagne. Shortly after regaining the AWA World title, Gagne announced his retirement from professional wrestling, and the AWA Heavyweight Championship was awarded back to Bockwinkel on May 19, 1981.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Professional Wrestling Online Museum|first=Steve|last=Slagle|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/wrestlers/nickbockwinkel2.html|accessdate=November 15, 2015|title=Nick Bockwinkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move infuriated wrestling fans throughout the AWA,&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; and it solidified Bockwinkel as one of the most despised wrestlers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=87|date=March 1996|publisher=London Publishing Co.|journal=Pro Wrestling Illustrated|title=Achievement Awards: Past Winners|issn=1043-7576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the biggest controversy surrounding Bockwinkel and his title reign involved a series of matches with Hulk Hogan, whom Gagne signed after Hogan left the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=19|publisher=Capstone|year=2003|isbn=0736821406|title=Hulk Hogan: Pro Wrestler Terry Bollea|first=Angie Peterson|last=Kaelberer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1982, Hogan defeated Bockwinkel by pinfall in St. Paul, Minnesota to capture the AWA World Title, but AWA President Stanley Blackburn reversed the decision and returned the title to Bockwinkel, who went on to lose it to [[Otto Wanz]] and regain it with Heenan's help in the span of two months. Hogan, in the meantime, grew tired of the politics surrounding Bockwinkel and the world title and departed the AWA to return to the WWF, where he became a star and helped the company become a worldwide brand.

On February 22, 1984, [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] defeated Bockwinkel to capture the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match where Terry Funk was a guest referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary of Professional Wrestling, 2d ed|publisher=McFarland|first=Harris M.|last=Lentz III|page=43|year=2003 |isbn=0786403039}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an AWA card, Bockwinkel wrestled [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Champion]] [[Ric Flair]] for the NWA title on January 16, 1986 at the [[Winnipeg Arena]]; the bout ended in a double count out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=The History of WWE|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=Pro Wrestling USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bockwinkel last held the AWA World Championship in 1987, at the age of 52. He became popular in a feud against then-AWA champion Stan Hansen. When Hansen failed to appear for a title defense, Bockwinkel won the title by forfeit. Hansen had quit the AWA from that point. Months later he dropped the championship to another second generation wrestler, [[Curt Hennig]], at [[SuperClash#SuperClash 2|SuperClash]]. The match ended in controversial fashion due to interference by [[Larry Zbyszko]], who had handed a roll of coins to Hennig to use on Bockwinkel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=PWTorch.com|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_25499.shtml|title= Nostalgia Review: AWA Super Clash II; Bockwinkel vs Hennig; Blackwell vs. Zhukov; Midnight Rockers and more |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |date=May 4, 2008 |first=Brian |last=Hoops}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bockwinkel retired in 1987, ending a career that spanned four decades. In one of his final matches as an active competitor, he paid Zbyszko back for costing him the AWA World title by pinning him on an episode of ''AWA Championship Wrestling'' on [[ESPN]] after knocking him out with a roll of coins.

===Post-retirement (1987–2015)===
After departing AWA, Bockwinkel worked as a road agent for the World Wrestling Federation, also serving as a color commentator for occasional televised events. He was released in 1989 due to budget cuts. He returned to the ring in 1993 at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree: A Legends' Reunion]]. The card was promoted by [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) but featured veteran wrestlers from all over the country. Bockwinkel wrestled former NWA World Champion [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] to a time limit draw as part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Undercard|undercard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=PWTorch.com|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_25708.shtml|title= Nostalgia Review: WCW Slamboree 1993; Vader vs. Davey Boy Smith; Hollywood Blonds vs. Dos Hombres; Nick Bockwinkel vs. Dory Funk Jr. |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |date=May 26, 2008 |first=Brian|last=Hoops}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Bockwinkel became the on-screen commissioner of WCW. He was reunited on the program with Bobby Heenan but their former partnership in AWA was never mentioned.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt;

In 2000, he and [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] were the commissioners for a short-lived [[Shoot wrestling#Shoot-style|shoot style]] promotion, the Japan Pro Wrestling Association, but as the shoot-style market in [[Japan]] had been low since the collapse of [[UWF International]], the wrestlers on it moved to other promotions. Bockwinkel was the President of the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]] until stepping down in May 2014 due to health reasons.&lt;ref name=president/&gt;

On March 31, 2007, he was inducted in the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by his former manager Bobby Heenan.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt;

Bockwinkel made an appearance on WWE's ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' on March 29, 2010, as part of Legends lumberjack match between [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] and [[Ted DiBiase Jr.|Ted Dibiase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=PWTorch.com|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_40275.shtml|title=WWE Raw Results 3/29: Keller's live ongoing coverage of WrestleMania 26 fallout, Shawn Michaels's retirement and farewell|accessdate=November 15, 2015 |date=March 29, 2010 |first=Wade|last=Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Bockwinkel was known for his technical wrestling ability and in-ring psychology. [[Bob Backlund]] wrote in his autobiography that "Nick had a great head for the game, a wonderful sense of ring psychology, and an uncanny ability to use his intelligence and cockiness to get under the people's skin. He was a terrific representative for the AWA and was the key player in the success of the AWA for a long time."&lt;ref name=bob/&gt; Backlund goes on to say, "He was a very intelligent, well-spoken, and cocky heel, and his in-ring skills were right up there with the very best in the business."&lt;ref name=bob&gt;{{cite book|title=The All-American Kid: Lessons and Stories on Life from Wrestling Legend Bob Backlund|author=Backlund, Bob and Robert H. Miller|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''50 Greatest Professional Wrestlers of All Time: The Definitive Shoot'', author [[Larry Matysik]] lists Bockwinkel as number 18, writing "He was an athlete, he could wrestle, and his psychology was second to none."&lt;ref name="Matysik"&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Greatest Professional Wrestlers of All Time: The Definitive Shoot|author=Matysik, Larry|publisher=ECW Press|chapter=#18 Nick Bockwinkel|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he was also known for his calm, charismatic, articulate promos, which distinguished him from many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Meltzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slamw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legendary AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel Passes Away|url=http://pwinsider.com/article/97841/legendary-awa-champion-nick-bockwinkel-passes-away.html?p=1|work=SLAM! Wrestling|date=November 11, 2015|accessdate=November 11, 2015|first=Dave|last=Scherer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Chris Jericho]] based his new villainous wrestling persona on Bockwinkel. In his autobiography ''The Best in the World'' Jericho wrote, "The WWE had recently released an AWA retrospective DVD, and while watching it, I remembered how great a heel Bockwinkel was. He wore suits for all his interviews and used ten-dollar words that went over the average fans' heads, pissing them off markedly. Here was this pompous blowhard using the fancy talk and wearing the fancy suits, claiming to be the best because he was the World Champion, which was the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best In The World: At What I Have No Idea| last1=Jericho|first=Chris| last2=Fornatale|first2=Peter Thomas|publisher=Gotham|year=2014|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other television appearances==
In 1968, Bockwinkel appeared as a contestant on a prime-time version of the NBC game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', winning a Pontiac Firebird, a deluxe kitchen set, and $1300 in cash.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7fEGnm-_hA |title=Hollywood Squares with Nick Bockwinkel (July 5, 1968)  |publisher=YouTube |date=September 13, 2015 |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played Harry in the episode "[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series, season 2)|Savage Sunday]]" in the show ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; Bockwinkel also played a wrestler in an episode of the 1960s television series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt;

==Personal life==
On June 22, 1957, Bockwinkel married Susan Tranchitella, with whom he had two daughters: Johnna (born October 11, 1958) and Nikki (born April 30, 1961). The couple divorced in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California, County Marriages, 1850–1952 Transcription: Nicholas Warren Bockwinkel|publisher=FindMyPast.com|url=http://search.findmypast.com/record?id=r_22288109609%2f1|subscription=yes|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bockwinkel remarried in 1972 to Darlene Hampp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/8721/mnmar_0201-0161/10752407|title=Minnesota, Marriage Index, 1958-2001|subscription=yes|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the marriage lasting until his death.

In November 2007, Bockwinkel underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple bypass]] [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Greensboro Sports|url=http://www.greensborosports.com/2007/11/12/booker-t-puts-the-t-back-in-tna-nick-bockwinkel-hits-a-triple/|title=Booker T puts the "T" back in TNA, Nick Bockwinkel hits a triple|first=Andy|last=Durham|date=November 12, 2007|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he was elected President of the Cauliflower Alley Club, a non-profit organization. In 2013, Ric Flair told [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] on his podcast that Bockwinkel had Alzheimer's disease.  Bockwinkel's wife Darlene denied Flair's claim, but did acknowledge that he had health problems which she wanted to keep private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/misc-news/43755-report-nick-bockwinkel-not-suffering-from-alzheimer-s|title= Report: Nick Bockwinkel not suffering from Alzheimer's|work=WrestleView.com|author=Adam Martin|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Bockwinkel stepped down from his position as Cauliflower Alley Club president due to his declining health.  He was replaced by former wrestler [[B. Brian Blair]].&lt;ref name="president"&gt;{{cite web|title= Different kind of ‘Killer Bees’ at Cauliflower Alley |url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2015/04/15/22345831.html|work=SLAM!

==Death==
Bockwinkel died from undisclosed causes on the evening of November 14, 2015. His remains were cremated in Las Vegas and a [[memorial service|memorial]] [[Mass (Catholic Church)|mass]] was held at St. Joseph Croatian Catholic Church in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri on November 21, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a774113/wwe-hall-of-famer-nick-bockwinkel-dies-aged-80/|title=  WWE Hall of Famer and former AWA World Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwinkel dies aged 80|publisher=Digital Spy|author=Harry Fletcher|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIP: Nick Bockwinkel|url=http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/rip-nick-bockwinkel/|publisher=Caulifower Alley Club|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, his two children from his first marriage, two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10064">The {{nihongo|'''Okamoto Daihachi incident'''|岡本大八事件}} of 1612 refers to the exposure of the intrigues involving the [[kirishitan|Japanese Christian]] ''[[daimyō]]'' and retainers of the early [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in Japan. The conspiracy - motivated by the Christian daimyō [[Arima Harunobu]]'s desire to retake [[Arima clan|Arima]] lands in [[Hizen]] that were lost in the [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] wars - did much to shake the confidence that the Tokugawa regime placed on its Christian subjects, and was attributed as one of the reasons the Tokugawa eventually took an anti-Christian stance, which culminated in the persecution of Christians throughout the country.

==Background==
In 1543, during the wars of the [[Sengoku period]], the Portuguese made landing on Japan for the first time, and soon spread their guns and Christianity throughout Japan from [[Kyushu]]. Regional ''[[daimyō]]'', or feudal lords, were eager to trade with the Portuguese for their European [[arquebus]], while the Portuguese saw the Japanese as potential converts to the Christian religion, preferring to trade with those who converted. Trade and religion thus tied, many ''daimyo'' became Christian, such that at the eve of unification of Japan by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in 1600, as many as 14 ''daimyo'' at the time were baptised.{{sfn|Costa|2003|p=56}} Even when some of those Christian ''daimyo'' supported Ieyasu at the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]], many other Christian ''daimyo'' rallied around the heir of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. In any case, the question remained for the unifier of Japan where the Christian lords' loyalties ultimately lay.

[[Arima Harunobu]], the daimyo of [[Shimabara Domain|Hinoe Domain]], became one of the most important supporters of the Church in post-Sekigahara Japan as Tokugawa Ieyasu became ''[[shōgun]]'' and purged his enemies, like the influential Christian lord [[Konishi Yukinaga]]. In the first decade of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Arima Harunobu was able to keep his fief and was given the right to send [[red seal ships]] to trade overseas. In one of these voyages in 1608, the crew of a red seal ship belonging to Harunobu became involved in a deadly quarrel in [[Portuguese Macau]] after coming back from Cambodia to fetch a cargo of [[agarwood]] for Ieyasu, resulting in 50 Arima samurai being killed under the orders of the [[Captain-major]] [[André Pessoa]].{{sfn|Boxer|1948|p=53}} The same captain-major came to Nagasaki on the ''[[Nossa Senhora da Graça incident|Nossa Senhora da Graça]]'' to trade in 1609, and Arima Harunobu took this opportunity to seek permission from Tokugawa Ieyasu to seek revenge for his dead men. Ieyasu acceded - although the Portuguese controlled much of the [[Nanban trade]], Ieyasu sought to decouple the close relationship between that trade and Christianity. Arima Harunobu thereupon took a flotilla of 1,200 men to attack Pessoa in Nagasaki, and after a three-day engagement, the ''Nossa Senhora da Graça'' sank in an explosion bringing Pessoa down with it on January 6, 1610. However, this victory for Harunobu soon led to his downfall.

==Intrigues==
For Arima's part in sinking the ''Nossa Senhora da Graça'', Ieyasu not only rewarded Arima Harunobu with a prized sword, but also presented his granddaughter Kunihime (国姫) as wife for Harunobu's son [[Arima Naozumi|Naozumi]]. This proved to be problematic for the Arima, as Naozumi had followed Christianity like his father and had married a Christian girl. Naozumi eventually repudiated his legitimate wife in favour of Kunihime, showing that, rather than standing by his faith and family, Naozumi opted to not risk offending Ieyasu.{{sfn|Pacheco|1971|p=78}}

Harunobu apparently felt that his efforts during the ''Nossa Senhora da Graça'' incident warranted further rewards — namely the return of the territories [[Isahaya]] and Kōjiro (神代) in [[Hizen Province]] that the Arima lost during the [[Sengoku period]].{{sfn|Ribeiro|2006|p=59}} To this end, Harunobu bribed Okamoto Daihachi (岡本大八, [[baptismal name]] Paulo), a Christian aide to the ''[[rōjū]]'' [[Honda Masazumi]], who advised Ieyasu on affairs concerning the redistribution of fiefs. However, Okamoto took the money and did not follow through; instead, he strung Harunobu on by forging documents promising to reward Arima with the territories, then claiming that the reward had been revoked due to the interference of the [[Nagasaki bugyo|Governor of Nagasaki]] [[Hasegawa Fujihiro]].{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=488}} Harunobu, after seeking further assistance from a Jesuit priest on this matter to no avail,{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}} brought the issue directly to Ieyasu in 1612, bringing Okamoto's scam to light.{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=488}} At this juncture, Naozumi turned against his father and told Ieyasu of Harunobu's underhanded dealings with Okamoto.{{sfn|Pacheco|1971|p=79}}{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}}

That the investiture of fiefs, a matter that defines the feudal relations of the Tokugawa shogunate, could be bought and sold was deeply troubling to Tokugawa Ieyasu.{{sfn|Elisonas|1991|p=366}} He sentenced Okamoto Daihachi to [[death by burning]] for forging shōgunal documents, but not before Daihachi had a chance to reveal that Arima Harunobu had conspired to kill Hasegawa Fujihiro. As the important port city of Nagasaki was the governed directly by the shogunate, this conspiracy was seen as an affront to Tokugawa rule.{{sfn|Elisonas|1991|p=3367}} For this and his bribery, Harunobu was exiled to [[Kai Province]] in late 1612, and was ordered to commit suicide by ''[[seppuku]]'' the next year. However, Harunobu refused on grounds of his faith, and instead had his head cut off.{{sfn|Pacheco|1971|p=78}} Naozumi was allowed to inherit his father's fief for his part in denouncing Harunobu.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}}

==Aftermath==
The fact that the perpetrators of this episode of corruption, conspiracy, forgery, and attempted murder were both Christians was not lost on Ieyasu. The retired shōgun was further incensed to hear that Christian followers had gathered at Okamoto's execution to offer prayers and sing hymns, cementing in his mind that the creed encouraged insubordination against the shogunate.{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=498}} Ieyasu later referenced this incident along with other executions of Christian criminals in 1614:

{{quote|If they see a condemned fellow, they run to him with joy, bow to him, and do him reverence. This they say is the essence of their belief. If this is not an evil law, what is it? They truly are the enemies of the Gods and of Buddha.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=318}}}}

In the same year as the Daihachi incident was uncovered, Ieyasu evicted the Christian servants of his household and forbade his vassals from following Christianity or risk having their revenues withheld. On January 27, 1614, the prohibition was extended to everyone regardless of class or origin, including all missionaries without exception.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=317}} This order was unevenly followed by Ieyasu's vassals, as domains that were predominantly Christian or sufficiently far from the central did not interfere with their Christian subjects up to 1623.{{sfn|Murdoch|Yamagata|1903|p=498}} However, in [[Shimabara Domain]] (formerly the Hinoe Domain), Arima Naozumi [[apostatized]] and pursued a campaign of persecution of Christians, killing even his two half-brothers, aged 8 and 6.{{sfn|Boxer|1951|p=315}} He was transferred to [[Nobeoka, Miyazaki|Nobeoka]] in [[Hyūga Province]] in mid-1614, leaving behind a restive Christian population that would instigate the [[Shimabara Rebellion]].{{sfn|Elisonas|1991|p=367}}

The '''Petit chien à bélière''' - small binded dog - or '''Pendeloque au chien de Suse''' - dog pendant of [[Susa]] is a [[pendant]] in the form of a dog. The pendant was discovered in the ruins of the village of [[Uruk]] and dates to around 3300 BCE - 3100 BCE The term ''bélière'' is a reference to the ring bound to the dog.

== Description ==
The pendant is a small object - only 1.5 cm long. It is one of the first examples of metalsmithing at the end of the [[4th millennium BC|4th millennium BCE]]. It represents a synthesis of all the metallurgical techniques known in the region of Susa during the era of Uruk. It provides interesting information about one of the two known dog breeds in the Susan plain.&lt;ref name="louvre"&gt;{{cite web|author=Agnès Benoit|title=Pendeloque en forme de chien|url=https://www.louvre.fr/oeuvre-notices/pendeloque-en-forme-de-chien|work=www.louvre.fr|accessdate=2018-11-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this era, metallurgical techniques used a process where ore was melted to extract the metal and the metal was then poured into molds often at temperatures greater than 800°C.&lt;ref name="louvre" /&gt;

The fabrication techniques include [[Lost-wax casting|cire perdue casting]] for the large part of the body and "hot drawing" of the ears and tail, with additional material for the back of the dog.&lt;ref name="louvre" /&gt;

The connection of the ring with the main body cannot be made with a simple binding, for there is a risk of melting the main body. In what is one of the first examples of the use of [[brazing]] in history, a mixture of copper and gold is used without the need for an elevated temperature.&lt;ref name="louvre" /&gt;

The dog is not representative of the elegant [[Sloughi|Arab greyhounds]] seen on ceramic vases discovered in the cities of Suse I, but is a domesticated rustic breed which was adapted for herding sheep.&lt;ref name="louvre" /&gt;

== History ==
The pendant was discovered with the finds of [[Roland de Mecquenem (archaeologist)|R. de Mecquenem]] during the excavation of the city of Uruk in 1939.&lt;ref name=louvre/&gt;

There are other sculptures of this type:

{{Expert needed|law|date=September 2013}}In [[law]] as practiced in countries that follow the English models, a '''pleading''' is a formal written statement of a party's claims or defenses to another party's claims in a [[civil action]]. The parties' pleadings in a case define the issues to be adjudicated in the action.

The [[Civil Procedure Rules]] (CPR) govern [[Pleading (England and Wales)|pleading in England and Wales]]. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] govern [[Pleading (United States)|pleading in United States federal courts]]. Each state in the United States has its own statutes and rules that govern pleading in the courts of that state.

==Examples==

In the United States, a ''[[complaint]]'' is the first pleading filed by a [[plaintiff]] which initiates a lawsuit. A complaint sets forth the relevant [[allegations of fact]] that give rise to one or more legal [[causes of action]] along with a [[prayer for relief]] and sometimes a statement of damages claimed (an [[ad quod damnum]] clause).  In some situations, a complaint is called a ''petition'', in which case the party filing it is called the [[petitioner]] and the other party is the [[respondent]].  In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a ''petition'' or a ''bill of complaint in chancery''.

In England and Wales, the first pleading is a Claim Form, issued under either Part 7 or Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which sets out the nature of the action and the relief sought, and may give brief particulars of the claim.  The Claimant also has the option, under Practice Direction 7A.61 to serve Particulars of Claim (a document setting out the allegations which found the cause of action) within 14 days of issue of the Claim Form.

When used in civil proceedings in England and Wales, the term "complaint" refers to the mechanism by which civil proceedings are instituted in the magistrates' court &lt;ref&gt;s.51 Magistrates Court Act 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and may be either written or oral.

A ''[[demurrer]]'' is a pleading (usually filed by a [[defendant]]) which objects to the legal sufficiency of the opponent's pleading (usually a complaint) and demands that the court rule immediately about whether the pleading is legally adequate before the party must plead on the merits in response.  Since demurrer procedure required an immediate ruling like a motion, many common law jurisdictions therefore went to a narrower understanding of pleadings as framing the issues in a case but not being motions in and of themselves, and replaced the demurrer with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or the application to strike out particulars of claim.

An ''[[answer (law)|answer]]'' is a pleading filed by a defendant which admits or denies the specific allegations set forth in a complaint and constitutes a [[general appearance]] by a defendant.  In England and Wales, the equivalent pleading is called a Defence.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, 15.2&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[defendant]] may also file a [[cross-complaint]] against another defendant named by the plaintiff, and may also file a ''third-party complaint'' bring other parties into a case by the process of [[impleader]].

A [[defendant]] may file a ''counter-claim'' to raise a cause of action to defend, reduce or set off the claim of the [[plaintiff]].

==Systems==

===Common law===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Common law pleading was the system of  [[civil procedure]] used in England, which early on developed a strong emphasis on the [[form of action]] rather than the [[cause of action]] (as a result of the [[Provisions of Oxford]], which severely limited the evolution of the common law writ system). The emphasis was on procedure over substance.

[[Law]] and [[equity (law)|equity]] evolved as separate judicial systems, each with its own procedures and remedies. Because the types of claims eligible for consideration was capped early during the development of the English legal system, claims that might have been acceptable to the courts' evolving sense of justice often did not match up perfectly with any of the established forms of action. Lawyers had to engage in great ingenuity to shoehorn their clients' claims into existing forms of action.  The result was that at common law, pleadings were stuffed full of awkward [[legal fiction]]s that had little to do with the actual "real-world" facts of the case.  The placeholder name [[John Doe]] (still commonly used in American pleading to name unknown parties) is a remnant of this period.

In its final form in the 19th century, common law pleading was terribly complex and slow by modern standards. The parties would normally go through several rounds of pleadings before the parties were deemed to have clearly stated their controversy, so that the case was "at issue" and could proceed to trial.  A case would begin with a complaint in which the plaintiff alleged the facts entitling him to relief, then the defendant would file any one of a variety of pleas as an answer, followed by a replication from the plaintiff, a rejoinder from the defendant, a surrejoinder from the plaintiff, a rebutter from the defendant, and a surrebutter from the plaintiff.  At each stage, a party could file a demurrer to the other's pleading (essentially a request that the court immediately rule on whether the pleading was legally adequate before they had to file a pleading in response) or simply file another pleading in response.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=John |authorlink=John Baker (legal historian) |date= January 2002 |title=An Introduction to English Legal History |edition=4 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=76–79 |isbn=978-0-406-93053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a plea could be dilatory or peremptory. There were three kinds of dilatory plea: to the jurisdiction, in suspension, or in abatement. The first challenged the court's jurisdiction, the second asked the court to stay the action, and the third asked the court to dismiss the action without prejudice to the other side's right to bring the claims in another action or another court. A peremptory plea had only one kind: a plea in bar. A party making a plea in bar could either traverse the other side's pleading (i.e., deny all or some of the facts pleaded) or confess and avoid it (i.e., admit the facts pleaded but plead new ones that would dispel their effect). A traverse could be general (deny everything) or specific.  Either side could plead imparlance in order to get more time to plead on the merits. Once the case was at issue, the defendant could reopen the pleadings in order to plead a newly discovered defense (and start the whole sequence again) by filing a plea puis darrein.

The result of all this complexity was that to ascertain what was "at issue" in a case, a stranger to the case (i.e., such as a newly appointed judge) would have to sift through a huge pile of pleadings to figure out what had happened to the original averments of the complaint and whether there was anything left to be actually adjudicated by the court.

===Code===
'''Code pleading''' was first introduced in 1850 in [[New York (state)|New York]] and in 1872 in [[California]], and eventually spread to 22 other states.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Code pleading sought to abolish the distinction between law and equity.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''[[Hurwitz v. Hurwitz]]'', 78 U.S. App. D.C. 66, 136 F.2d 796, 799 (1943)&lt;/ref&gt; It unified civil procedure for all types of actions as much as possible.  The focus shifted from pleading the right form of action (that is, the right procedure) to pleading the right cause of action (that is, a substantive right to be enforced by the law).  Under code pleading, the required elements of each action are supposed to be set out in carefully codified statutes.

Code pleading stripped out most of the legal fictions that had encrusted common law pleading by requiring parties to plead "ultimate facts."  This means that to plead a cause of action, the pleader has to plead each element and also allege specific facts which, if proven with evidence at trial, would constitute proof of that element.  Failure to provide such detail could lead to dismissal of the case if the defendant successfully [[Demurrer|demurred]] to the complaint on the basis that it merely stated "legal conclusions" or "evidentiary facts."

Code pleading also drastically shortened the pleading process.  Most of the old common law pleadings were abolished.  From now on, a case required only a complaint and an answer, with an optional cross-complaint and cross-answer, and with the demurrer kept as the standard attack on improper pleadings.  Instead of piling layers and layers of pleadings and averments on top of each other, a pleading that was attacked by demurrer would either be completely superseded by an amended pleading or would proceed immediately "at issue" as to the validly pleaded parts.  This meant that to determine what the parties were currently  fighting about, a stranger to a case would no longer have to read the entire case file from scratch, but could (in theory) look ''only'' at the most recent version of the complaint filed by the plaintiff, the defendant's most recent answer to that complaint, and any court orders on demurrers to either pleading.

Code pleading was criticized because many lawyers felt that it was too difficult to fully research all the facts needed to bring a complaint ''before'' one had even initiated the action, and thus meritorious plaintiffs could not bring their complaints in time before the [[statute of limitations]] expired. Code pleading has also been criticized as promoting "hypertechnical reading of legal papers".&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Uni Oil, Inc.]]'', 710 F.2d 1078, 1080-81 n.1 (5th Cir. 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notice===
{{details|Pleading (United States)}}

'''Notice pleading''' is the dominant form of pleading used in the [[United States]] today. In 1938, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] were adopted to govern civil procedure in [[United States federal courts]]. One goal of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] was to relax the strict rules of code pleading. However, each state also has its own rules of civil procedure, which may require different, looser, or stricter rules in [[State court (United States)|state court]].

===Fact===

[[Louisiana]], a state that derives its legal tradition from the Spanish and French (as opposed to [[England|English]] [[common law]]), employs a system of fact pleading wherein it is only necessary to plead the facts that give rise to a cause of action. It is not necessary even for the petitioner to identify the cause of action being pleaded. Mere conclusory allegations such as "the defendant was negligent" are not, by themselves, sufficient to sustain a cause of action.

Other states are also fact-pleading jurisdictions. [[Illinois]], for example, requires that a complaint "must assert a legally recognized cause of action and it must plead facts which bring the particular case within that cause of action."&lt;ref&gt;Teter v. Clemens, 112 Ill. 2d 252 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative pleading}}
In '''[[alternative pleading]],''' [[legal fiction]] is employed to permit a party to argue two [[mutually exclusive]] possibilities, for example, submitting an injury complaint alleging that the harm to the plaintiff caused by the defendant was so outrageous that it must have either been intended as a malicious attack or, if not, must have been due to gross negligence.

== Linguistic ==

=== "pleaded" vs "pled" ===
The use of "pleaded" versus "pled" as the past tense version of "pleading" has been a subject of controversy among many of those that practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/gpsolo/resources/solosez/popular_threads_2010.html|title=Popular Threads 2010 {{!}} Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pleaded" is more common in Australian publications, while "pled" is more common in American, British, and Canadian publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grammarist.com/usage/pleaded-pled/|title=Pleaded vs. pled – Grammarist|website=grammarist.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 search of the [[Westlaw|Westlaw legal database]], "pled" is used in a narrow majority of cases over "pleaded".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/grammer-pole-of-the-weak-pleaded-v-pled/|title=Grammer Pole of the Weak: Pleaded v.

[[File:Pournelle chart color.gif|thumb|350px|The Pournelle chart]]
The '''Pournelle chart''', developed by [[Jerry Pournelle]] in his 1963 political science Ph.D. dissertation, is a two-dimensional coordinate system which can be used to distinguish [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]]. It is similar to the [[political compass]] and the [[Nolan Chart]] in that it is a two-dimensional chart, but the axes of the Pournelle chart are different from those of other systems. The two axes are as follows:
* The x-axis, "Attitude toward the State" (labeled [[statism]]), refers to a [[political philosophy]]'s attitude toward the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[centralized government]]. The farthest right is "state worship" and the farthest left represents the state as the "ultimate evil", preferring [[individual freedom]].
* The y-axis, "Attitude toward planned social progress" (labeled [[rationalism]]), refers to the extent which a political philosophy is compatible with the idea that [[Social issue|social problems]] can be solved by the use of [[reason]]. The top indicates complete confidence in planned [[social progress]] and the bottom represents [[skepticism]] of such methods, often considering them as naively [[utopia]]n. Those at the top of the axis would tend to discard a traditional custom if they do not understand what purpose it serves (considering it antiquated and probably useless), while those at the bottom would tend to keep the custom (considering it time-tested and probably useful).

Pournelle arranged [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], in the upper right-hand quadrant of high state control and high rationalism. [[Conservatism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]] are placed in the lower right hand quadrant of high state control and low rationalism. Classical [[Anarchism|anarchists]] are in the lower left hand corner of low state control and low rationalism. [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]] (including [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]) and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]] are placed in the upper left-hand corner of low state control and high rationalism. Each diagonal axis contains natural political allies.

In '''''S v Chabedi''''' (2005), during a criminal trial Chabedi's [[Lawyer|attorney]] had allegedly failed to consult properly with Chabedi, and had failed to recall certain state [[witness]]es, when it became apparent that they could answer questions relating to material issues.

On [[appeal]], the court raised the question of whether the appellant had received a [[Right to a fair trial|fair trial]].

The court held that it was the duty of the attorney, in the proper performance of his mandate to defend the appellant, to have recalled the witnesses in order to do justice to his client's defense.

The attorney's failure to do so brought into question his competency to conduct the appellant's defense.

Accepting that the appellant had not been defended properly, the question was whether it had amounted to a fatal irregularity which vitiated the proceedings.

The court held the right of an accused person to be properly defended is inextricably linked to the accused's rights to a fair trial and to legal representation.

The court held that the attorney clearly failed to appreciate the import of the evidence and the effect it might have had on the complainant's version and other evidence.

Therefore the conviction was set aside and the matter [[Remand (court procedure)|remitted]] to another [[magistrate]].

In view of the findings made regarding the competency of the attorney who conducted his defence at the trial, the interests of justice required that another legal representative be appointed to represent the appellant at the further trial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2089">'''Sigmund Samuel''' (October 24, 1868 – 1962) was a [[Toronto]] born son of industrialist [[Lewis Samuel]] (1827–1887) and continued to run his father's steel business.

Samuel was born in 1868 to [[Lewis Samuel|Lewis]] and Kate Samuel in Toronto.&lt;ref name=DCB&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Samuel, Lewis |first=Stephen A. |last=Speisman |volume=11 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/samuel_lewis_11E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father founded [[M &amp; L Samuel Company]] in 1856,&lt;ref name=DCB/&gt; that later grew to become an importer and distributor of steel products in Canada (now as [[Samuel, Sons &amp; Con Limited]] of [[Cooksville, Ontario]] (now in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.uwo.ca/programs/companyinformationcanada/ccc-samuel.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211159/http://www.lib.uwo.ca/programs/companyinformationcanada/ccc-samuel.htm |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel became involved in the business following the death of his father in 1887.
Samuel was an important member of the [[Holy Blossom Congregation]], which his father was a member of.

Samuel married Leah May Mandelson, who bore several children (Kathleen Samuel b. 1899, Lewis Samuel II b. 1900, Norman Mandelson Samuel b. 1902 and Florence May Samuel b. 1907).

Later in life Samuel made donations to cultural (the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]'s Signmund Samuel Building) and educational (the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Gerstein Science Information Centre|Sigmund Samuel Library]]) interests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shelflives.ca/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=3170&amp;CLSN_3092=13016229143092c3fa3e52fe5f4a4e1a&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel died in Toronto in 1962.

[[File:Sudley House Liverpool 2.jpg|thumb|South facade of Sudley House]]
'''Sudley House''' is a historic house in [[Aigburth]], [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. Built in 1824 and much modified in the 1880s, it is now a museum and art gallery which contains the collection of [[George Holt (merchant)|George Holt]], a shipping-line owner and former resident, in its original setting. It includes work by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Edwin Landseer]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]].

The house was bequeathed to the city of Liverpool by Holt's daughter, [[Emma Georgina Holt]], in 1944 and is now managed by [[National Museums Liverpool]].

==History==

===Structure===
Sudley, as it was originally known, was completed in 1824 on land formerly owned by the [[Banastre Tarleton|Tarleton family]]&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Maybrick A to Z |first=Christopher J. M. |last=Jones |publisher=Countyvise Ltd |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-90682-300-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l9Ku1QSvFg0C&amp;pg=PA59 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a two-storey [[ashlar]] house&lt;ref name="pevsner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pevsner Architectural Guides: Buildings of England: Lancashire: Liverpool and the Southwest |first1=Richard |last1=Pollard |first2=Nikolaus |last2=Pevsner |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner |first3=Joseph |last3=Sharples |edition=Reprinted, revised |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-30010-910-8 |pages=444–445 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Dl_ghLUNVGsC&amp;pg=PA444}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Nicholas Robinson (mayor)|Nicholas Robinson]], a [[corn merchant]] who was [[Lord Mayor of Liverpool]] in 1828-1829. Robinson paid £4500 for the land.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sudley House: History |publisher=National Museums Liverpool |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/sudley/history/the-history-of-sudley-house.aspx |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.liverpoolcityhalls.co.uk/media/1093/former-mayors-and-lord-mayors.pdf |title=List of Lord Mayors of Liverpool |publisher=Liverpool City Halls |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Robinson in 1854, the house passed to his two daughters, who died in 1883.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The house and estate, comprising just under {{convert|30|acre|ha}}, was put up for sale in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |work=Liverpool Mail |date=5 June 1880 |page=12 |title=Advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the home of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] shipping-line owner and merchant George Holt in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Holt family |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/sudley/history/the-holt-family.aspx |publisher=National Museums Liverpool |accessdate=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Pevsner]]'' says that the original design was probably by [[John Whiteside Casson]] and was modified by [[James Rhind]] when Holt purchased it.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pevsner"/&gt; However, National Museums Liverpool say that the original architect is unknown, although there are features that suggest it may have been [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The structural modifications, which involved moving the main entrance from the east facade to that of the north and also adding an office wing on the west, have significantly affected the interior. The original staircase with [[Doric order|Doric]] fluted columns, above which is a dome and glazed [[oculus]], became exposed and, according to ''Pevsner'', this has left the surrounding internal features as "a bit of a mess". The new two-storey wing added two bays to the five that already existed on the south side, as well as a parapeted [[prospect tower]] to its rear.&lt;ref name="pevsner"/&gt;

===Art and life===
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - An Angel Playing a Flageolet.jpg|thumb|''An Angel Playing a Flageolet'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], in the collection of Sudley House]]

George Holt was an art collector whose collection derived mainly from purchases from dealers and at exhibitions rather than from commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pre-Raphaelites: Beauty and Rebellion |first1=Christopher |last1=Newall |first2=Ann |last2=Bukantas |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-78138-303-2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wInADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most significant purchases, which remain in the house today, were J. M. W. Turner's ''Rosenau'', depicting [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]'s home in Germany, and Gainborough's ''Viscountess Folkestone''. Also among the collection are paintings by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]], Edwin Landseer, John Everett Millais, Joshua Reynolds, [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain: A Discerning Traveller's Companion |first=David |last=Kemp |publisher=Dundurn |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-77070-070-3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jYdEyVnQn4C&amp;pg=PA321 |page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sudley House |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/sudley/index.aspx |publisher=National Museums Liverpool |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Melly]], the [[jazz]] singer, critic and [[art historian]], who was related to the Holt family, has described aspects of life at Sudley House during his various childhood visits in the 1930s, when it was owned by George Holt's only child, Emma Georgina Holt. According to him, her father, who died in 1896, had left an estate valued at over £600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Owning Up: The Trilogy |first=George |last=Melly |authorlink=George Melly |publisher=Penguin UK |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-14102-554-4 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xLqSEqR-eC4C&amp;pg=PT159 |pages=159–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal]]: The Mortimer-Percy Volume |author=The Marquis of Ruvigny and Ranieval |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Heritage Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-78841-872-3 |page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uOHHuwI8tD4C&amp;pg=PA59 59]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house and the art collection, which is described by [[ArtUK]] as being "the only British collection of its kind still in its original setting", were bequeathed to the city in 1944 by Emma Holt and is now managed by National Museums Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sudley House |publisher=ArtUK |url=http://artuk.org/visit/venues/sudley-house-5295 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refurbishment==
Sudley House closed for two years for a £1 million refurbishment, re-opening on 26 May 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This included redecorating in the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] style of George Holt's era and also significantly modifying the first floor, where three new attractions were incorporated as follows:

* Two childhood rooms: how Victorian children learned and played. Exhibits include a huge Victorian dolls' house, educational toys, fashion dolls and pots used at mealtimes by rich and poor children.
* Costume room: regularly changing displays of historic clothing. One such exhibition showed a small part of the vast collection of [[Emily Tinne]] and her children, which is held by National Museums Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Sweet Life |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/sudley/exhibitions/tinne/ |publisher=National Museums Liveroool |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A gallery for temporary exhibitions

''Pevsner'' says that those modifications create an architectural "tension" between showing the house as a house and as a museum.&lt;ref name="pevsner"/&gt; The ground floor library now includes a display about the Holt family. This includes an introductory film, family portraits and a model of the steamer ''Verdi'', which belonged to the [[Lamport and Holt]] shipping company that George Holt had co-founded in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sudley House: Library |publisher=National Museums Liverpool |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/sudley/collections/library/index.aspx |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Sheet 23: Lamport and Holt |publisher=Liverpool Museums: Maritime Archives and Library |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/sheet/23 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry''''' is an 18th-century English-language encyclopaedia, holding a summary of information on agriculture and in all its branches. It was written by member of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] under the pseudonym a Society of Gentlemen, and first issued in 1756&lt;ref name="GEF 1930"&gt;Fussell, George Edwin. "Eighteenth Century Agricultural Dictionaries." ''Historical Research'' 7.21 (1930): 144–148.&lt;/ref&gt; and published in weekly numbers until 1768.&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"&gt;[[Tobias George Smollett]].

Marshall, 1768. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
''The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry'' is an 18th-century dictionary, which dealt with all branches of agriculture. It contained various contemporary methods of cultivating and improving land; of breeding, managing, and fattening cattle; of curing the various diseases etc. The whole was ranged in alphabetical order, and every thing, relating to the fame subject was contained in one article. It was supplemented with a Gardener's Kalendar for the use of farmers and others, which contained accounts of the work necessary to be done every month in the year, and accounts for the nursery and kitchen gardens.

''The Complete Farmer'' was written by anonymous writers, which used the pseudonym a "Society of Gentlemen,"&lt;ref&gt;"Books printed for T. Lowndes" in: William Bathoe, Fanny Seymour (fict. name.) ''The history of Fanny Seymour [by W. Bathoe].'' 1769. p.273.&lt;/ref&gt; only revealing that they were members of the [[Society for the Encouragement of Arts]], the later Royal Society of Arts. The content was based on the insides of the foremost authorities, which were listed as "[[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Michel Lullin de Chateauvieux]], [[Marquis de Turbilly]], [[Hugh Plat]], [[John Evelyn]], [[John Worlidge]], [[John Mortimer (agriculturalist)|John Mortimer]], [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], Ellis, [[Philip Miller]], [[Thomas Hale (agriculturist)|Thomas Hale]], Edward Lisle, Roque, [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]], [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]]."&lt;ref&gt;Listing in the subtitle of ''The Complete Farmer's'' second edition, 1768&lt;/ref&gt; This work was first issued in 1756,&lt;ref name="GEF 1930"/&gt; and published in weekly numbers until 1768. The second enlarged and improved edition of the work was published shortly after the weekly publishing of first edition was finished to supply the demands of the public.&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"/&gt; The third edition was published in 1877, the fourth in 1793, and the last fifth edition in two volumes in 1807.

According to Fussell (1930) ''The Complete Farmer'' was one of seven similar dictionaries published during the 18th century, of which the ''Dictionarium rusticum, urbanicum &amp; botanicum,''&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Nathan, and John Worlidge. ''Dictionarium Rusticum, Urbanicum &amp; Botanicum: Or, A Dictionary of Husbandry, Gardening, Trade, Commerce, and All Sorts of Country-affairs.'' J. and J. Knapton, A. Bettesworth, 1726.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1726, was the first. These dictionaries were the first of its kind in the British history only proceeded by 17th-century ''Dictionarium Rusticum'', which was published as supplement to Worlidge's ''Systema Agriculturae'' in 1669.&lt;ref name="GEF 1930"/&gt; There general works were intended to assist in the management of their estates. Other 18th-century general works of this kind, where Hall's ''A Compleat Body of Husbandry'', Lisle's ''Observations in Husbandry'', Mill's ''A New System of Practical Husbandry'', and [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s ''Horse-Hoeing Husbandry.''&lt;ref&gt;''The South Carolina Historical Magazine'', Vol. 91. South Carolina Historical Society, 1990. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Husbandry ===
The preface of ''The Complete Farmer'' commands [[husbandry]] ahead of all human arts, which had "its birth with the world". It starts with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;HUSBANDRY is, with great justice, placed at the head of human arts, as having a very great advantage over all others, both with regard to antiquity and usefulness. It had its birth with the world, and has always been the genuine source of solid wealth, and real treasures; for it will furnish a people with everything necessary to render life happy and desirable, form the principal revenues of the state, and even supply the defect of all others, when they happen to fail.&lt;ref name="TCF 1767 TTP"&gt;''The Complete Farmer'', 1767. Section "TO THE PUBLIC"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[definition]] of husbandry can be found in the lemma on husbandry, which also appeared in Temple Henry Croker et al. (1764) ''The complete dictionary of arts and sciences,'':&lt;ref&gt;Temple Henry Croker, Thomas Williams, Samuel Clark ''The complete dictionary of arts and sciences.'' Printed for the authors, 1764. p. HUR-HUS&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;HUSBANDRY, the business or employment of a farmer, or person who [[Agriculture|cultivate]]s land, Bzc.&lt;br/&gt;Husbandry is divided into two kinds, and distinguished by the old and new. early times ; and the latter that introduced by the ingenious [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Mr. Tull]], and often called the horse-hoeing husbandry....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The lemma on husbandry continues with a section on preparing the ground and the need of [[plowing]], which also appeared in [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] (1763) ''A New and Complete System of Practical Husbandry,''&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffiths. ''The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal'', Volume 32. 1765. p. 401 (June 1765)&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Experience shews, that land, though ever so well tilled in the autumn, when wheat for example, is sown, hardens and soddens in the winter; its particles, beaten down by heavy rains, and funk by their own own weight, approach each other daily more and more ; the roots of the plants cultivated have consequently less and less room to extend themselves in quest of their necessary food ; and the interstices in the earth become of course so few and close, that they are not able to pierce through them; whilst weeds spring up, and rob them of their nourishment. By this means the earth, reduced to nearly the fame condition as if it had not been ploughed at all, is unable to assist the plants sown in it in the spring, when they ought to shoot with the greatest vigour. They consequently then stand most of all in need of the [[plough]], to destroy the weeds, to lay fresh earth to their roots in the room of that earth which they have exhausted, to break the particles of the ground anew, so as to enable their roots to spread, in order to their gathering an ample provision of food, which then does them the greatest service.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Farmer'', 1767. p. HOV-HUS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The lemma continues over more than 100 paragraphs, extensively citing from multiple sources, presenting several systems of [[crop rotation]], and other accounts. According to [[Tobias George Smollett|Smollett]] (1768) the whole article on husbandry gave a "very full and accurate comparison..., from a variety of authors, between the profits arising from the different methods of cultivation, according to the precepts of the old and new husbandry."&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"/&gt;

=== On the history of agricultural science ===
The lemma on "Agriculture" gave an account on the origin and historical development of agriculture and [[Agricultural science|agricultural writings]]. The origin of this art and science is synchronized with the Bible, and reads:
[[File:The complete Farmer, page AGR.jpg|thumb|''The complete Farmer'', page AGR]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;This art claims the precedency of all others in point of antiquity, it having been the sole employment of our first parents in the delightful [[garden of Eden]].&lt;br&gt;[[Adam]] instructed his children in this necessary art, both by precepts and example; and we are told by the sacred historian, that [[Cain]] applied himself to husbandry, while Abel led the life of a shepherd, and contented himself with feeding his flocks.&lt;br&gt;After the deluge the descendants of [[Noah]] carried with them the art of husbandry, and established it in the various countries where they settled. It was, however, very simple in these early ages, and its advances towards perfection slow and almost imperceptible.&lt;br&gt;[[Abraham]], and the rest of the patriarchs, who had no fixed residence, applied themselves to a pastoral life, ennobling, by their example, a profession, which has now for many ages lost its original dignity, from its being practised only by the meaner sort of people. But as soon as their descendants were fixed in Palestine, they all became husbandmen, from the chief of the tribe of Judah, to the lowest branch of the family of [[Benjamin]] : birth at that time made no distinction, and agriculture was considered as a very honourable employment.&lt;ref name="TCF 1767 AGR"&gt;The Complete Farmer, 1767. p. AGR-AGR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the agriculture and agricultural writings in [[Ancient Greece]] it summarized:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Classical Athens|Athenians]], who were the first that received any tincture of politeness, taught the use of corn to the rest of the Greeks they also taught them the manner of cultivating the ground, and preparing it for the seed. The Greeks soon perceived that bread was more wholesome, and its taste more delicate than acorns and accordingly thanked the gods for such an unexpected and beneficial present. After this the Athenian kings thinking it more glorious to govern a small state wisely, than to aggrandize themselves by foreign conquests, withdrew their subjects from war, and employed them solely in; cultivating the earth. This constant application carried agriculture to a considerable degree of perfection, and soon reduced it into an art.&lt;br&gt;Hesiod, who is generally thought to have been contemporary with Homer, was the first among the Greeks who wrote on this subject. He calls his poem, " Works and Days;" because agriculture requires exact observations of times and seasons.&lt;br&gt;The other eminent Greek writers upon agriculture, are Democritus of Abdera, Socraticus, Xenophon, Tarentinus, Architas, Aristotle, and Theophrastus, from whom the art received considerable improvements; as also from Hieron, Epicharmus, Philomctor, and Attalus.&lt;ref name="TCF 1767 AGR"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Via the old Romans and its decline in the Middle Ages, agriculture arose from its dormant state in the Renaissance, "when Crescenzio published an excellent performance on agriculture at Florence. He was soon followed by several of his countrymen, among whom Tatti, Stefano, Agustino Gallo, Sansovino, Lauro, and Tarello, deserve particular honour."&lt;ref name="TCF 1767 AGR"/&gt; This further evolved in Britain, The Flemings, France, Ireland etc. until its state of that time.

== Reception ==
One of the first reviews of this work by [[Tobias George Smollett]] (1768) gave the following summary of the specific topics of ''The Complete Farmer'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole is ranged in alphabetical order, and every thing, relating to the fame subject is contained in one article. Thus the reader will find under the articles Wheat, [[Barley]], [[Rye]], Pease, [[Beans]], [[Turnips]], etc. the whole method of cultivation, and the various improvements that have been made with regard to each respectively.

Under the article [[Husbandry]], a very full and accurate comparison is given, from a variety of authors, between the profits arising from the different methods of cultivation, according to the precepts of the old and new husbandry. Nor is this treatise confined to the different species of grain and vegetables cultivated in almost every part of the kingdom – those that are more uncommon, and confined as it were to particular districts, are also considered in a very full and ample manner ; such as [[Hemp]], [[Flax]], [[Hops]], Madder, Maize, [[Potatoes]], [[Saffron]], Teazle, or Fuller's Thistle, Weld, or Dyer's Weed, etc.&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And also:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have also here accounts of the advantages of cultivating [[Brassica oleracea|Bore-cole]], [[Cabbages]], [[Carrots]], [[Parsnips]], etc. for feeding cattle together with the best methods of cultivation. The new species of grass in that time introduced are here described, and the best methods of cultivating them fully explained ; such as [[Bird-grass]], [[Black-grass]], [[Timothy-grass]], etc. Under the articles Farm, Common, [[Hay]], Inclosing, [[Mowing]], [[Ploughing]], [[Seed]], [[Sowing]], [[Threshing]], etc. the reader will find very useful instructions and observations, many of which are perhaps no where else to be found. Besides the common machines used in the practice of husbandry, we have here ample descriptions and accurate drawings of Mr. Hewitt's new [[Hoe (tool)#horse-hoe|Horse-hoe]], Mr. Comber's Cutting-box, Mr. Clarke's Draining-plough, Mr. Ogden's Fallow-cleansing Machine, Mr. Randall's Spiky Roller, etc. etc. Under the article [[Bee]], the authors have given a very full account of that laborious and useful insect, together with all the improvements that have been made with regard to the management of Bees, and the methods of taking the wax and honey without destroying them, according to the practice off White; Thorley, and Wildman.&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor is the theory of agriculture wholly omitted : the book is indeed chiefly intended to facilitate the practice of husbandry, and introduce the various improvements that have been lately made in that useful and necessary art; but it should at the fame time be remembered, that every method of practice is founded on reason or theory; arid accordingly the authors have explained, under the articles Air, [[Atmosphere]], Food of Plants, [[Husbandry]], [[Leaves]], Sap, Vegetation, Water, etc. the operations of nature, and laid down a theory, which cannot fail of being agreeable to the curious reader.&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smollett (1768) ended his review with the words: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We had almost forgot to mention, that under the article [[Surveying]], the authors have given a compendious treatise of that useful art, in so plain and easy a manner that any person of a very moderate capacity, though a stranger to the method of measuring land, may soon be able to survey, plan, and protract any farm or parcel of land, without any other assistance. From the above account of this work, the reader will be able to form some idea of its use, at a time when the study of agriculture is pursued with great assiduity in every part of Europe.&lt;ref name = "TGS 1768"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In those days ''The Complete Farmer'' was widely read,&lt;ref&gt;Bang, B. "The etiology of epizootic abortion." ''Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics'' 10 (1897): 125-IN2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was used as reference up until the early 19th century. For example, Samuel Deane's ''The New-England Farmer'' from 1822 used about a dozen citations from that work.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Deane. ''The New-England Farmer: Or, Georgical Dictionary. Containing a Compendious Account of the Ways and Methods in which the Important Art of Husbandry, in All Its Various Branches, Is, Or May Be, Practised, to the Greatest Advantage, in this Country.'' Wells and Lilly, 1822. p. 75-485 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=jIdDdm05KNwC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22complete+farmer%22 online])&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface of the first edition of ''The Encyclopedia of Agriculture'', [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1825) ranked ''The Complete Farmer'' among the foremost publications on rural matters of the early 19th century. According to Loudon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The subject of Agriculture admits of two grand divisions; the improvement and general management of landed property, which may be termed Territorial Economy; and the cultivation and treatment of its more useful animal and vegetable productions, which is called [[Husbandry]], or Agriculture in a more limited sense of the term."&lt;ref name="JC 1825"&gt;John Claudius Loudon (1825) ''An Encyclopædia of Agriculture.'' Volume 1. p. iii: Preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Complete Farmer'' embraced both of these departments. Loudon describes this work as "copious to an excess, containing an immense mass of matter, new and old, good and bad." He is however clear in his judgement "As a dictionary of Husbandry, it was the best of its kind at the time of its publication: but the rapid progress of Agriculture since its date, renders it at the present time quite an obsolete work."&lt;ref name="JC 1825"/&gt;

'''''The Merck Manuals''''' are medical references published by the American pharmaceutical company [[Merck &amp; Co.]] (known as MSD outside the United States), that cover a wide range of medical topics, including disorders, tests, diagnoses, and drugs. The manuals have been published since 1899, when Merck &amp; Co. was still a subsidiary of the German company [[Merck Group|Merck]].

These manuals were originally developed in book form, but have been updated and converted to digital formats, including websites and mobile apps. Digital versions also include audio, 3D models, and animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= White SM |title= Merck Manuals Information Online &amp;lt;http://www.merck.com/mmhe&amp;gt;  |journal= J Consum Health Internet |year=2009 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=66–76 |doi=10.1080/15398280802674883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Merck Manual, ''Merck's Manual of the Materia Medica'' (1899), was a small reference book that became widely used: by the 1980s it had become the world's best-selling medical text. Since then, several manuals have been produced, and are regularly updated. The titles include:&lt;ref name=mm2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://merckmanuals.com/home/about/about_the_merck_manual_home_health_handbookonline_version/committed_to_providing_medical_information_merck_and_the_merck_manuals.html |title= Committed to providing medical information: Merck and The Merck Manuals |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |publisher=Merck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]'', commonly called ''The Merck Manual''. This is the descendant of the 1899 book. 
* ''The Merck Manual—Home Health Handbook'' is a consumer edition, introduced in 1997. 
* ''The Merck Manual of Patient Symptoms'' was a small printed reference summary of symptoms intended for medical students, physician assistants, and the like.

The Manuals for human health were converted to a web format in 2015 and are hosted on MerckManuals.com in the US and Canada, and MSDManuals.com throughout the rest of the world. The sites includes two versions tailored for consumers and health care professionals. The Manuals are available online in 10 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-merck-co-idUSKBN0OW2RW20150616 |title= Merck Manuals health guides go digital, and free, in global push |year=2015 |accessdate=2017-03-24 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manuals for animal health were converted to a web format in 2002 and are hosted on MerckVetManual.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/merck-veterinary-manual-goes-online |title= Merck Veterinary Manual goes online |year=2002 |accessdate=2017-03-24 |publisher=dvm360 Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center''' in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] is a museum operated by the [[government of Alabama]], showcasing [[rocket]]s, achievements, and artifacts of the U.S. space program.  Sometimes billed as "Earth's largest space museum", astronaut [[Owen Garriott]] described the place as, "a great way to learn about space in a town that has embraced the space program from the very beginning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-09-09/living/17261489_1_space-camp-space-flights-space-training |title=Space Camp, Dogwoods And 'cue In Huntsville, Ala. |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 9, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |author=Villano, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bon-voyage.co.uk/destinations/huntsville_alabama_holidays |title=Huntsville Holidays |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened in 1970, just after the [[Apollo 12|second manned mission to the lunar surface]], the center not only showcases [[Apollo Program]] hardware but also houses interactive science exhibits, [[Space Shuttle]] and [[United States Army|Army]] rocketry and aircraft.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; With more than 1,500 permanent rocketry and space exploration artifacts, as well as many rotating rocketry and space-related exhibits, the center occupies land carved out of [[Redstone Arsenal]] adjacent to [[Huntsville Botanical Garden]] at exit 15 on [[Interstate 565]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huntsville.about.com/cs/attractions/a/spacecamp.htm|title=In the Beginning: US Space &amp; Rocket Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075012/http://huntsville.about.com/cs/attractions/a/spacecamp.htm|archivedate=July 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center offers bus tours of nearby [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name="busBack"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2012/08/us_space_rocket_centers_bus_to_1.html | title=U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center's bus tours to Marshall Space Flight Center are a popular attraction | publisher=The Huntsville Times | work=al.com | date=August 8, 2012 | accessdate=October 12, 2012 | author=Accardi, Marian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two camp programs offer visitors the opportunity to stay on the grounds and learn more about their respective subject matter. [[United States Space Camp|U.S. Space Camp]] gives an in-depth exposure to the space program through participant use of simulators, lectures, and training exercises.  Similarly, [[Aviation Challenge]] offers a taste of military fighter pilot training including simulations, lectures, and survival exercises.

[[File:USSRC Rocket Park.JPG|thumb|right|Some of the rockets in the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center. From left to right: [[Saturn I]], [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter IRBM]], [[Juno II]], [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Mercury-Redstone]], [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]], and [[Jupiter-C]] ]]

The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center has one of the most extensive collections of space artifacts and displays more than 1500 pieces. Displays include rockets, engines, spacecraft, simulators, and hands-on exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clui.org/ludb/site/us-space-and-rocket-center |title=U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center |publisher=Center for Land Use Interpretation |work=Land Use Database |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heroic"/&gt;

The Space &amp; Rocket Center introduces visitors to U.S. rocketry efforts from its predecessor at [[V-1 flying bomb facilities|Peenemünde]] with the German [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 flying bomb]], through a progression of U.S. military rockets up to the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] rocket family civilian rockets, and on to the [[Space Shuttle]].   The [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle]], the only Saturn V of the three on display to have been brought together outside a museum, is displayed overhead in a new building designed specifically for the rocket.  The [[Space Shuttle Pathfinder|Space Shuttle ''Pathfinder'']] was the first Space Shuttle — a mockup made of steel and wood to test facilities for handling the vehicle — and it now sits atop an [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] with [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] attached.

The center showcases significant military rockets, including representatives of the [[Project Nike]] series, which formed the first ballistic missile defense, [[MIM-23 Hawk]] surface-to-air missile, [[Hermes (missile program)|Hermes]], an early surface-to-surface missile, [[MGR-1 Honest John]] and [[MGM-5 Corporal|Corporal]] nuclear missiles and [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot]], first used in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991.

The rocketry collection includes numerous engines, as well.  In addition to the authentic engines mounted on rockets on display, the museum has unmounted engines on display, including two [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1s]], the type of gigantic engine that produced {{convert|1500000|lbf|N}} to push [[Saturn V]]s off the launch pad, [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine that powered second and third stages of the Saturn V, and both Descent and Ascent Propulsion System (DPS/APS) engines for the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].  Engines from the V-2 engine to [[NERVA]] to the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] are on display as well.&lt;ref name="heroic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heroicrelics.org/ussrc/index.html |title=U. S. Space &amp; Rocket Center |work=heroicrelics.org |author=Jetzer, Mike |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apollo program]] gets full coverage in the Davidson Center for Space Exploration with artifacts outlining Apollo missions.  Astronauts crossed the [[service structure]]'s red walkway to the White Room, both on display, and climbed in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] atop a Saturn V which was their cabin for the trip to the moon and back. [[Apollo 16]]'s command module is on display.  The [[Saturn V Instrument Unit]] controlled five F-1 engines in the first stage of the rocket as it lifted off the pad.  Several exhibits relate the complexity and magnitude of that phase of the journey.  They took a [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (mockup on display) to the lunar surface where they collected [[moon rock]]s such as the [[Apollo 12]] specimen at the museum.  Later moon trips took a [[Lunar Rover]] (displayed beside the LM).  The first few moon trips ended at a [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] ([[Apollo 12]]'s is on display) where astronauts stayed to ensure containment of any moon bugs after that mission.&lt;ref name="noGala"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/01/us_space_and_rocket_center_can.html |title=U.S. Space and Rocket Center cancels gala, focusing on Space Camp registrations and budget challenges |publisher=Huntsville Times |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |author=Kessner, Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mqf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacecamp.com/webmail/newsletter0907/ |title=Space Camp Newsletter: Mobile Quarantine Facility |date=September 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo 16 capsule.JPG|thumb|right|[[Apollo 16]] capsule is on display, with the recovery parachute hanging above it.]]
A restored engineering mock-up of [[Skylab]] is also on display, showing the Apollo project's post-lunar efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://photos.al.com/huntsville-times/2013/01/skylab_moves_into_saturn_v_hal_27.html | title=Skylab moves into Saturn V Hall | publisher=al.com | date=January 25, 2013 | accessdate=July 6, 2014 | author=Schultz, Eric | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230102/http://photos.al.com/huntsville-times/2013/01/skylab_moves_into_saturn_v_hal_27.html | archive-date=July 14, 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/01/post_1045.html | title=Skylab engineering mockup moves into Saturn V Hall at Space and Rocket Center after 10 years outdoors | publisher=al.com | date=January 29, 2013 | accessdate=July 6, 2014 | author=Emmett, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various simulators help visitors understand the spaceflight experience.  [[Space Shot (ride)|Space Shot]] lets the rider experience launch-like 4 [[standard gravity|gs]] and 2–3 seconds of weightlessness.  G-Force Accelerator offers 3 gs of acceleration for an extended period by means of a centrifuge.  Several other simulators entertain and educate visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.about.com/cs/nasa/p/ussrcvisit.htm |title=Visiting the US Space &amp; Rocket Center |publisher=about.com |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |author=Greene, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exhibits offer a hands-on understanding of concepts related to rocketry or space travel.  A [[bell jar]] demonstrates the reason for using a rocket instead of a propeller in the  vacuum of space.  A [[wind tunnel]] offers visitors the opportunity to manipulate a model to see how forces change with its orientation, and The Mind of Saturn exhibit demonstrates gyroscopic force (necessary for rocket navigation).  An Apollo trainer offers visitors the opportunity to climb in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/08/nasa_administrator_charles_bol_4.html |title=NASA Administrator Charles Bolden to speak at event at U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center |publisher=The Huntsville Times |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gemini Mission Simulator.JPG|thumb|left|Gemini astronauts trained in this capsule.]]
Some simulators on exhibit were used for astronaut training.  A [[Project Mercury]] simulator shows the cramped conditions endured by the first Americans in space.  A [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] simulator shows visitors the accommodations when two people flew together to space for the first U.S. missions involving [[Extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]] and [[space rendezvous]].&lt;ref name="heroic"/&gt;

Exhibits also cover the future of space flight.  Two [[Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle|Orion CEV]] exhibits show the next NASA spacecraft, and a  [[Bigelow Aerospace]] commercial habitat model details a space tourism effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/08/us_space_rocket_center_opens_e.html |title= U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center opens exhibit with model of commercial space habitat module |publisher= Huntsville Times |date= August 27, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two play areas offer places indoors and out for children to release some energy.  The outdoor play area offers a miniature (and slower) Space Shot ride along with slides and tunnels, all under a canopy.  The indoor area fosters imaginative play about a trip to Mars with a space ship and some cartoon "aliens".

The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center is also the resting place of [[Miss Baker]], a [[squirrel monkey]] who flew on a suborbital test flight of the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] rocket on May 28, 1959.  Baker lived in a facility at the Center from 1971 until she died of kidney failure in November 1984.&lt;ref name="USSRC20"&gt;{{cite book |title=20th Anniversary U.S. Space and Rocket Center |date=March 17, 1990 |publisher=USSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus tours===
[[File:Redstone Test Stand with USSRC tour bus.JPG|thumb|A tour bus waits as tourists inspect the Redstone Test Stand on a 2012 tour of Marshall Space Flight Center.]]

The Space &amp; Rocket Center offers bus tours of [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].  The tour offers views of all four [[National Historic Landmark]]s at the center including a stop at the landmark [[Redstone Test Stand]], where [[Alan Shepard]]'s [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone Rocket]] was tested prior to launch.&lt;ref name   = "HAERtxt47-48"&gt;{{Citation

===Traveling exhibits===
In the summer of 2010, the Space and Rocket Center began hosting traveling exhibits.  The first was [[Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination]] with other exhibits planned. The [[United States Space Camp]] hosted at the facility has provided themed camps in conjunction with the exhibits, including a Jedi Experience camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=STAR WARS: Where Science Meets Imagination (Press Materials)|url=http://www.spacecamp.com/news/node/1902|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=May 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711055207/http://www.spacecamp.com/news/node/1902|archive-date=July 11, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Alabama Space and Rocket Center Initial Museum Floor.jpg|thumb|left|Visitors to the new museum saw Mercury and [[Apollo 6]] capsules, lunar rovers and lander concepts, and more.]]

The idea for the museum was first proposed by Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]], who led the efforts of the United States to land the first man on the moon.&lt;ref name="moniquegerman87"&gt;{{cite book |last=Laney |first=Monique |date=2015 |title=German Rocketeers in the Heart of Dixie: Making Sense of the Nazi Past During the Civil Rights Era  |location=New Haven and London |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=87 |isbn=978-0-300-19803-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the museum were underway in 1960 with an economic feasibility study for the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Feasibility of a Proposed Space Science Exhibit in Huntsville, Alabama |publisher=Southern California Laboratories of Stanford Research Institute |author=Kopp, William T. |year=1960 |location=Pasadena, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Braun, understanding the dominance of [[American football|football]] in the Alabama culture, persuaded rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] coaches [[Bear Bryant]] and [[Shug Jordan]] to appear in a television commercial supporting a $1.9 million statewide bond referendum to finance museum construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/us/31huntsville.html |title=When the Germans, and Rockets, Came to Town |work=New York Times |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |author=Dewan, Shaila}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The referendum passed on November 30, 1965, and a donation of land from the [[United States Army|Army's]] [[Redstone Arsenal]] provided a location on which to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Madison County Election Returns |work=The Huntsville Times |date=December 1, 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aero.com/museums/us_space_and_rocket/wmuusr01.htm |title=United States Space and Rocket Center |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123120602/http://www.aero.com/museums/us_space_and_rocket/wmuusr01.htm |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alabama Space and Rocket Center Rocket Garden 1970.jpg|thumb|On display immediately were the lunar landscape with lunar lander mockup, and a wide variety of hardware from [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command]], [[NASA]], and aerospace companies, including a helicopter, and the rocket garden.&lt;ref name="SaturnVTunnel"/&gt;]]

To help draw tourists from far afield, the center needed a crown jewel. The Huntsville Times reported, Center director "Edward O. Buckbee is the type of guy with the tenacity to 'arrange' for this planet's largest, most complex mechanical beast to become a part of the Alabama Space and Rocket Center at Huntsville. / Pulling off the coup – getting a Saturn 5 moon rocket here which cost 90 times the center itself – was 'a little difficult,' admits Buckbee in a galloping understatement."&lt;ref name="wonder"&gt;{{cite news |title=A World Wonder in our Midst |work=The Huntsville Times |date=September 24, 1972 |author=Casebolt, Barry |pages=B-1+}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buckbee worked with von Braun to see that the [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle]] would be delivered to the site as it was on June 28, 1969.  The Saturn I which stands erect at the museum was delivered the same day.&lt;ref name="Siebel690630"&gt;{{Citation |author=von Braun, Wernher |editor1-last=Buckbee |editor1-first=Ed |title=The Rocket Man: Wernher von Braun: The Man Who Took America to the Moon: His Weekly Notes: 1961–1969 |url=http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum9/HTML/001778.html |format=DVD |year=2010 |publisher=Steward &amp; Wise Music Publishing |isbn=978-1-935001-27-0 |page=NOTES 6–30–69 SIEBEL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial plans called for visitors to walk through the Saturn V.&lt;ref name="SaturnVTunnel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PforAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=usYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=space-science&amp;pg=764%2C3938375 |title=Alabama Space Science Center |work=Times Daily |date=February 23, 1969 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center opened in 1970.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rocketcenter.com/overview |title=History and Overview |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center |access-date=May 7, 2017 |quote=The U.S. Army donated land, and the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center® opened its doors in 1970.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Space &amp; Rocket Center was a "major sponsor" of the United States pavilion at the [[1982 World's Fair]], providing exhibits on space and energy as well as equipment and operations for the [[IMAX]] theater at the fair.  At the time, the Space &amp; Rocket Center also served as the Alabama Energy Information Center.&lt;ref name="WorldsFair"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IkZBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-6gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=rocket-center%20omnimax&amp;pg=5490%2C5842962 |title=Space, Rocket Unit Will Be At The Fair |work=Harlan Daily Enterprise |date=April 23, 1982 |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |pages=8B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spacedome IMAX theater at the museum opened December 19, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24029664/alabama_opens_new_spacedome_movie/ |title=Alabama Opens New Spacedome Movie Theater |last=Dunnavant |first=Bob |date=1982-12-20 |website=Newspapers.com |publisher=The Tennesseean |language=en |publication-place=Nashville, Tennessee |access-date=2018-09-25| via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Wing plunged the Center into debt as its executive director from 1998 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waff.com/Global/story.asp?S=4766836 |title=Mike Wing, former CEO of Space and Rocket Center, arrested |publisher=WAFF TV |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wing oversaw construction of a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica to be finished at by the 30th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, July 1999.  It serves as a towering landmark in Huntsville, and cost the center $8.6 million of borrowed money.  The Huntsville Times estimated interest costs at $10 million.  Wing also sought to create a program for [[fifth grade]] students in Alabama and elsewhere to attend Space Camp at no cost to them.  Anonymous corporate pledges that Wing promised would fund the $800 per student never arrived. Wing prolonged the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission's investigation into the pledges by writing bogus personal checks and having the center record them as received.  The program ultimately cost the center $7.5 million.  Wing was pressured to resign, and several members of the governing Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission were ousted from that board as a result of the debacle.&lt;ref name="Tuscaloosa"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=90ogAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WKYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mike-wing&amp;pg=6905%2C5593713 |title=Saturn V Replica Not Paid For Yet |work=Tuscaloosa News |date=July 17, 2001 |agency=AP |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hDwdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LqYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mike-wing&amp;pg=3058%2C2996528 |title=Audit Sparks Probe of Center Spending |work=Tuscaloosa News |date=May 14, 2001 |agency=AP |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |location=Montgomery, AL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of Wing's term as director, the center was $26 million in debt.&lt;ref name="moreLayoffs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/09/us_space_and_rocket_center_lay.html |title=U.S. Space and Rocket Center lays off 5, cuts 7 to part-time to save $500,000 (updated) |publisher=Huntsville Times |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |author=Haskins, Shelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tackle"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ByUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZaYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=wing%20space%20camp%20fifth%20graders&amp;pg=4513%2C1883747 |title=New CEO Ready to Tackle Space Camp's Problems |work=Tuscaloosa News |date=February 11, 2000 |agency=AP |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |location=Huntsville}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2MEfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gdgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=wing%20space%20camp%20fifth%20graders%20anonymous&amp;pg=6262%2C2735916 |title=St. Clair Fifth-Graders get Free Space Camp |work=Gadsden Times |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |author=Lowry, Suzy |location=Asheville}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state sued Wing for $7.5 million over the Space Camp fraud.

The expenditures would shape more than the next decade for the center.  The new board of directors included Larry Capps who was selected to head the museum on February 9, 2000 after Wing.&lt;ref name="tackle"/&gt;  He reduced the debt to $16 million while also building the Davidson Center for Space Exploration and moving the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle into its custom-built facility.&lt;ref name="moreLayoffs"/&gt;  Capps was director through his retirement in 2010.&lt;ref name="BarnhartStart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/12/new_space_rocket_center_ceo_ba.html |title=New Space &amp; Rocket Center CEO Barnhart described as ideal choice |publisher=Huntsville Times |date=December 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |author=Lawson, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Deborah Barnhart, who headed Space Camp from 1986-1990, was selected to run the museum in 2010.&lt;ref name="BarnhartStart"/&gt;  She has since brought Orion and other post-Shuttle training apparatus to Space Camp and retired the center's line of credit, reducing interest expenditures.

Huntsville architect David Crowe designed the initial building with {{convert|22000|sqft|sqm}} of exhibit space.&lt;ref name="SaturnVTunnel"/&gt; An Omnimax (now called [[IMAX]] Dome) theater was installed prior to February 28, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/633086172.html?dids=633086172:633086172&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+28%2C+1984&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Museum+shoots+for+the+stars+to+bring+space+down+to+earth&amp;pqatl=google |title=Museum Shoots for the Stars to Bring Space Down to Earth |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 24, 1984 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie [[SpaceCamp]] preceded droves more campers (5,000 in 1986 to 11,000 in 1987), for whom facilities were expanded again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Space Camp Expected to draw 9,000 |work=The Huntsville Times |date=February 4, 1987 |author=Burkey, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HabPlans"&gt;{{cite news |title=Space Camp Plans Futuristic Dorms: Space Station Inspired $3.65 Million Design |work=The Huntsville Times |date=August 14, 1987 |author=Burkey, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1969, Huntsville residents could point to the [[Saturn I]] rocket at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center as a distant landmark (located a few miles from the city center).&lt;ref name="Siebel690630"/&gt;  In 1999, a full-scale model of the [[Saturn V]] rocket was erected, standing nearly twice as tall as the Saturn I.&lt;ref name="Tuscaloosa"/&gt;

Since 1979, a Saturn IB rocket owned by the museum stands at the Alabama Welcome Center in [[Ardmore, Alabama|Ardmore]] "as a reminder to visitors of Alabama's role in the space program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Space and Rocket Plans Summer Celebration | work=The Huntsville Times | date=May 6, 1979 | author=Dooling, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest addition to the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center is the Davidson Center for Space Exploration, named after Dr. Julian Davidson, founder of Davidson Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidson-tech.com/company.php Davidson Technologies Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830054023/http://www.davidson-tech.com/company.php |date=August 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|68000|sqft|sqm}}&lt;ref name="CappsRetiring"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.decaturdaily.com/stories/Space-museum-CEO-retiring,66476?content_source==========stories==1332&amp;category_id=&amp;search_filter=&amp;event_mode=&amp;event_ts_from=&amp;list_type=&amp;order_by=&amp;order_sort=&amp;content_class=&amp;sub_type=stories&amp;town_id= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405032256/http://www.decaturdaily.com/stories/Space-museum-CEO-retiring,66476?content_source==========stories==1332&amp;category_id=&amp;search_filter=&amp;event_mode=&amp;event_ts_from=&amp;list_type=&amp;order_by=&amp;order_sort=&amp;content_class=&amp;sub_type=stories&amp;town_id= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 5, 2012 |title=Space museum CEO retiring |work=Decatur Daily |date=August 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 3, 2011 |author=Huggins, Paul |location=Huntsville }}&lt;/ref&gt; building opened January 31, 2008.  The Davidson Center was designed to house the [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle]] (listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]) and many other space exploration exhibits. The vehicle is elevated above the floor surface with separated stages and engines exposed, so visitors have the opportunity to walk underneath the rocket.  The Davidson Center also features a 3D movie theater in addition to the [[IMAX]] theater in the original museum.

When the Davidson Center opened in 2008, the museum's ticket center and entrance was relocated to the Davidson Center, so it is now the first exhibit museum visitors experience. This, however, necessitated that visitors enter the original museum through the rear doors, causing it to be viewed out of its original sequence.

==Governance==

'''''Uigwe''''' ({{ko-hhrm|의궤|儀軌}}) is the generic name given to a vast collection of approximately 3,895 books recording in detail the royal rituals and ceremonies of the [[Joseon dynasty]] of [[Korea]]. There is no generally agreed English translation; some scholars suggest "book of state rites",&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/archives_of_asian_art/v058/58.yi.html "Yi Song-mi Note 2"]&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Glossary of Korean Studies'' from the Korea Foundation suggests "manual of the state event" or "rubrica for a state ceremony." The expression "Royal Protocols" (of the Joseon Dynasty) is widely used.

The collection of Uigwe, was inscribed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uigwe: The Royal Protocols of the Joseon Dynasty|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-9/uigwe-the-royal-protocols-of-the-joseon-dynasty/#c191886|work=Memory of the World Programme|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Combining text and detailed illustrations, each Uigwe preserves the records of the Superintendency (''dogam''), set up temporarily to plan and carry out special state rites. These rites included investitures, coronations, weddings, banquets, the painting of royal portraits, funerals and ancestral rites. Each Uigwe, some in several volumes with several copies, was written either by hand but more often printed using [[woodblocks]] for the History Archive copies. Most of the Uigwe, had one exclusive edition for the king, distinguished by silk covers, high quality paper, binding, superior handwriting and overall presentation, was intended to serve as the royal viewing copy. The silk covers used exclusively for the king were made of quality silk, had superior patterns often of clouds, and usually had red decorations around its borderline. Four to nine other copied version for scholars were kept for each of the four state archives, which for most of the Joseon period were located on Mount Jeongjoksan on [[Ganghwa-do|Ganghwa-do Island]]; Mount Jeoksang in [[Muju-gun|Muju-gun County]], [[Jeollabuk-do|Jeollabuk-do Province]]; [[Odaesan|Mount Odaesan]] in [[Gangwon (historical province)|Gangwon-do Province]] and [[Taebaeksan|Mount Taebaeksan]] in [[Yeongwol-gun|Yeongwol-gun County]]. The Uigwe for funerals and weddings includes large and detailed images of processions, often involving thousands of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/archives_of_asian_art/v058/58.yi.html |title=Euigwe and the Documentation of Joseon Court Ritual Life |publisher=[[Archives of Asian Art]] |language=Korean |date=2009-11-14 |author=Yi Sŏng-mi |issn=1944-6497 |year=2008 |volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Looting and repatriation==

===1866: French troops===
In 1782, the Outer [[Gyujanggak library]] (known as Oe-Gyujang-gak) was built in the ancient royal palace on [[Ganghwa-do|Ganghwa-do Island]] to accommodate an overflow of books from the main [[Gyujanggak library]] at [[Changdeokgung Palace]] in [[Seoul]], where the royal viewing copies were kept, and most of the viewing copies were transferred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1782 Kyujanggak Annex installed in Ganghwado|url=http://e-kyujanggak.snu.ac.kr/kiks/main.do?m=01z04|work=History|publisher=Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, after the execution of a number of French Catholic missionaries in Korea, a French expeditionary force came from China to seek explanations, resulting in the [[French campaign against Korea (1866)|French campaign against Korea]]. Unable to gain access to the authorities, the troops attacked Ganghwa-do Island and seized the royal books, along with a vast amount of silverware and other royal artifacts. The books were kept at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris soon after their arrival in France. They were largely forgotten until Korean scholar, Park Byeong-sen, discovered them in 1975, whilst working there as a librarian.

Following the discovery, the return was officially requested in 1992. In 1993, then-French President [[François Mitterrand]] returned one copy during a visit to Seoul to sell its high-speed [[TGV]] train technology; with the promised to return the remaining collection. The Korean Government tried to retrieve the royal documents through a permanent lease, since French law prohibits national assets to be transferred abroad. In 2010, a Seoul-based civic group spearhead the return but the request to exclude illegally obtained property from its list of national assets was rejected by a Paris court.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon Mee-yoo [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/01/117_59739.html "NGO to Demand Return of Royal Texts From France"] ''Korea Times''. 26 January 2010. Retrieved 2012-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of long disputes and negotiations, an agreement was made by [[Lee Myung-bak|President Lee Myung-bak]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy|President Nicolas Sarkozy]] at the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit]] to return the documents on a five-year renewable loan basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/11/13/2010111300290.html "Korea, France Clinch Deal on Return of Royal Archive"] ''Chosun Ilbo'' 13 November 2010. Retrieved 2012-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; From April to June 2011, 297 volumes with 191 different Uigwes, were shipped back in four separate installments.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Claire [http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110612000269 "Ancient Korean royal books welcomed back home"] ''Korea Herald''. 6 December 2011. Retrieved 2012-04-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===1922: Japanese Occupation Period===
In 1922, during the [[Korea under Japanese rule]], many volumes of books including 167 of Uigwe, along with some 1,000 other relics, stored at the royal [[Gyujanggak library]] at [[Changdeokgung Palace]] and history archive in the Buddhist temple at [[Odaesan|Mount Odaesan]] were transferred to the [[University of Tokyo]]. They were stored at the [[University of Tokyo]]. Hence were not included in the list of artifacts to be returned compiled in 1965, when the two countries signed a treaty which normalized diplomatic ties.&lt;ref name="loot"/&gt;

In November 2008, Seoul City Council passed a resolution urging Japan to return the uigwe. The looted collection is believed to have included [[Empress Myeongseong]]'s state funeral protocol, that lasted for about two years following her murder by Japanese assassins in [[Gyeongbokgung Palace]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seoul Seeks Return of Assets from Japan|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/11/05/2008110561001.html|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Chosun Ilbo|date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, then-Japanese Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] announced the return of the Uigwe to mark the centenary of [[Japanese annexation of Korea]].&lt;ref name="japan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Looted Korean Texts Return Home from Japan|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/12/06/2011120601333.html|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Chosun Ilbo|date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in October 2011, Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] returned five copies during his visit to Seoul in a bid to improve relations. The copies chronicled the royal rituals of [[King Gojong of Joseon|King Gojong]] and [[King Sunjong of Joseon|King Sunjong]], the last two emperors of Joseon dynasty and [[Korean Empire]] before Korea was annexed in 1910. This was followed, after a 16-month process, by the return of 1,200 volumes including 150 Uigwe in December 2011.&lt;ref name="loot"&gt;Lee, Claire [http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20111206000810 "Looted Korean royal texts return home"] ''Korea Herald''. 6 December 2011. Retrieved 2012-04-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection and exhibition==
The Uigwe that remained in Korea were preserved and housed in the [[Gyujanggak library]] at [[Seoul National University]], and as part of the [[Jangseogak]] collection at [[Academy of Korean Studies]]. Gyujanggak library has the largest collection, with 2,940 volumes with 546 different Uigwe; while the latter has 490 volumes with 287 different Uigwe.

===National Museum of Korea===
The 297 copies of the Uigwes that were returned from France, are housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]], where a special exhibition, ''The Return of the Oegyujanggak Uigwe from France: Records of the State Rites of the Joseon Dynasty'', was held from 19 July to 18 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Return of the Oegyujanggak Uigwe from France: Records of the State Rites of the Joseon Dynasty|url=http://www.museum.go.kr/program/show/showDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002002002&amp;searchSelect=A.SHOWKOR&amp;showCategory1Con=SC1&amp;showCategory2Con=SC1_1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;langCodeCon=LC2&amp;showID=4620|work=Special Exhibitions|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, ahead of the exhibition, the Museum showcased five of the copies to the media. They were 
selected for their historical significance and to demonstrate the wide range of activities recorded in different kinds of Uigwe. They were:
* Uigwe for a Royal Feast (1630)
* Uigwe for the Ceremony of Offering Honorable Names to Queen Jangryeol (1686)
* Uigwe for the State Funeral of Queen Jangryeol (1688)
* Uigwe for the Funeral of Uiso, the Eldest Grandson of the King (1752)
* Uigwe for the Construction of the West Palace (1831)

The Uigwe for a Royal Feast is the oldest copy that was looted by the French. It recorded the royal feast held by [[King Injo]] of Joseon in March 1630, wishing for longevity and good health for Queen Dowager Inmok. It is also one of the few "copied" versions as most of them are reportedly original editions that were exclusively printed for the king. The museum stated that three of the five shown do not have any surviving copied versions. Also a couple of silk covers of other volumes were displayed separately as [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] removed 286 of them for restoration in the 1970s. Which were returned along with the 297 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=Museum shows royal books returned from France|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/entertainment/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110704000753|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Korea Herald|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Palace Museum of Korea===
The copies that were returned by Japan are housed at the [[National Palace Museum of Korea]] with a special exhibition from 27 December 2011 to 5 February 2012.&lt;ref name="japan"/&gt;

==Media==
To mark the return of the stolen Uigwe on 2011 by French Government, a special episode of [[Running Man (TV series)|Running Man]] (Episode 48) was aired. In this episode, the Running Man members have to find 'the sleeping Uigwe' that was stored in the underground section. [[Song Ji-hyo]] won this episode.

Nine]], who had broken into [[Dow Chemical Company]], vandalized office furniture and equipment, and spilled about a bloodlike substance, were not entitled to a new trial on the basis of the judge's failing to allow a [[jury nullification]] [[jury instruction]]. The Appeals Court ruled, by a 2-1 vote:

{{quote|The fact that there is widespread existence of the jury's prerogative, and approval of its existence as a "necessary counter to casehardened judges and arbitrary prosecutors," does not establish as an imperative that the jury must be informed by the judge of that power. On the contrary, it is pragmatically useful to structure instructions in such wise that the jury must feel strongly about the values involved in the case, so strongly that it must itself identify the case as establishing a call of high conscience, and must independently initiate and undertake an act in contravention of the established instructions. This requirement of independent jury conception confines the happening of the lawless jury to the occasional instance that does not violate, and viewed as an exception may even enhance, the over-all normative effect of the rule of law. An explicit instruction to a jury conveys an implied approval that runs the risk of degrading the legal structure requisite for true freedom, for an ordered liberty that protects against anarchy as well as tyranny.}}

Nonetheless, the defendants were given a new trial on the grounds that they had been denied their right of [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|self-representation]].&lt;ref name="Dougherty"/&gt; The Circuit Judges' assumption that jurors know about their nullification prerogative has since been brought into question by other [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=David C.

After all, juries can nullify, but they know this fact only on a ''[[sotto voce]]'' level."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Effect of Jury Nullification Instruction on Verdicts and Jury Functioning in Criminal Trials|author=Irwin A.

The '''Villa of the Papyri''' ({{lang-it|Villa dei Papiri}}, also known as ''Villa dei Pisoni'') is named after its unique library of ''papyri'' (or scrolls), but is also one of the most luxurious houses in all of [[Herculaneum]] and in the Roman world.&lt;ref name="Amedeo"&gt;[[Amedeo Maiuri|Maiuri, Amedeo]]. ''Herculaneum and the Villa of the Papyri.'' Italy (1974): 35-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its luxury is shown by its exquisite architecture and by the very large number of outstanding works of art discovered, including frescoes, bronzes and marble sculpture&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/villa-of-the-papyri&lt;/ref&gt; which constitute the largest collection of Greek and Roman sculptures ever discovered in a single context.&lt;ref&gt;The Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum: Life and Afterlife of a Sculpture Collection,  Carol C. Mattusch (Los Angeles, California,  2005, {{ISBN|0892367229}} p 359&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in the current ''[[comune]]'' of [[Ercolano]], southern [[Italy]]. It was situated on the ancient coastline below the volcano [[Vesuvius]] with nothing to obstruct the view of the sea. It was perhaps owned by [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law, [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Hornblower, Simon and Antony Spawforth. ''Oxford Classical Dictionary''. 3rd ed. New York (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25106956|title=Unlocking the scrolls of Herculaneum|year=2013|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barker 1908 suggested [[Philodemus]] was owner of the Villa of the Papyri Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/buriedherculaneu00barkuoft#page/82/mode/2up|title=Buried Herculaneum|author=Ethel Ross Barker|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 79, the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] covered all of Herculaneum with some 30 m of [[volcanic ash]]. Herculaneum was first excavated in the years between 1750 and 1765 by [[Karl Weber (archaeologist)|Karl Weber]] by means of underground tunnels. The villa's name derives from the discovery of its [[library]], the only surviving [[library]] from the Graeco-Roman world that exists in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/magazine/interviews/files/476891.asp#informations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030232207/http://www.napoleon.org/en/magazine/interviews/files/476891.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained over 1,800 [[papyrus]] scrolls, now carbonised by the heat of the eruption, the "[[Herculaneum papyri]]".&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Webermap.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Plan of Villa drawn by Weber showing the ancient structures and the tunnels that were made in order to recover the works of art.&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;]] --&gt;

Most of the villa is still underground, but parts have been cleared of volcanic deposits. Many of the finds are displayed in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. The [[Getty Villa]] is a reproduction of the Villa of the Papyri.

==Layout==
[[File:Herculaneum, past, present and future (1908) (14596218878).jpg|thumb|900px|Ground plan showing location of tunnels (in brown)]]
[[File:Satiro ebbro, da villa dei papiri, peristilio rettangolare, 01.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of a drunken satyr from the Villa.]]
[[File:6018 - Eschine - Napoli.jpg|thumb|left| Statue of [[Aeschines]] from the Villa. Displayed at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples]].]]
Sited a few hundred metres from the nearest house in [[Herculaneum]], the villa's front stretched for more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} along the coastline of the [[Gulf of Naples]]. It was surrounded by a garden closed off by [[portico]]es, but with an ample stretch of gardens, vineyards and woods down to a small harbour.

It has recently been ascertained that the height of the main floor in antiquity was no less than {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level, and the villa had four architectural levels underneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.&lt;ref name="herculaneum.ox.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone&lt;/ref&gt;

The villa's layout is faithful to, but enlarges upon, the architectural scheme of suburban villas in the country around Pompeii. The [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.

The first [[peristyle]] had 10 columns on each side and a swimming pool in the centre. In this enclosure were found the bronze herma of [[Doryphorus]], a replica of [[Polykleitos]]' athlete, and the herma of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.&lt;ref name="apollonius"&gt;Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The large second [[peristyle]] could be reached by passing through a large [[tablinum]] in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;

[[File:Danzatrici o danaidi, da villa dei papiri, peristilio quadrato.JPG|thumb|Statue of dancers from the peristyle.]]
The living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;

The grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, [[herma]]e and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;

==Works of art==
The luxury of the villa is evidenced not only by the many works of art, but especially by the large number of rare bronze statues found there, all masterpieces. The villa housed a collection of at least 80 sculptures of magnificent quality,&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/villa-of-the-papyri/catalogue-of-sculptures&lt;/ref&gt; many now conserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt; Among them is the bronze ''[[Seated Hermes]]'', found at the villa in 1758. Around the bowl of the atrium [[impluvium]] were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting [[Satyrs]] pouring water from a pitcher and [[Amorini]] pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;

Five statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the [[Dorians|Doric]] [[peplos]] sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also [[hydrophorai]] drawing water from a fountain.

==Epicureanism and the library==
{{details|Herculaneum papyri}}
The owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean [[Philodemus of Gàdara]], although his conclusion is not certain.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Erlend D. MacGillivray, "The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society", ''The Ancient World'' XLIII (2012) 151–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of [[Epicurus]] studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

[[Image:Papyri.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Papyrus recovered from Villa of the Papyri.&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;]]
At the time of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a [[pyroclastic flow]]; the eruption eventually deposited some 20–25&amp;nbsp;m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the [[scroll]]s but preserving them – the only surviving library of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] – as the ash hardened to form [[tuff]].&lt;ref name="Amedeo" /&gt;

==Excavation==
The Bourbon excavations were halted in 1765 due to complaints from the residents living above. The exact location of the villa was then lost for two centuries.&lt;ref name="herculaneum.ox.ac.uk"/&gt; In the 1980s work on re-discovering the villa began by studying 18th century documentation on entrances to the tunnels and in 1986 the breakthrough was made through an ancient well. The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the Bourbon robbers were still remarkable in quantity and quality.

Excavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa&lt;ref name="herculaneum.ox.ac.uk"/&gt; with frescoes in situ. These were found along the southwest-facing terrace of about 4 metres height. The first row of rooms lying below the arcade was eveidenced by a series of rectangular openings along the façade.

Limited excavations recommenced at the site in 2007 to preserve the remains when beautifully carved parts of wood and ivory furniture were discovered. Since then limited public access became available.

As of 2012, there are still 2,800&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}} left to be excavated of the villa. The remainder of the site has not been excavated because the Italian government is preferring [[Archaeological site|conservation]] to excavation, and protecting what has already been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;See [[conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Woodley Packard]], who has funded conservation work at Herculaneum through his [[Packard Humanities Institute]], has said that he is likely to be able to fund excavation of the Villa of the Papyri when the authorities agree to it; but no work will be permitted on the site until the completion of a feasibility report, which has been in preparation for some years. The first part of the report emerged in 2008 but included no timetable or cost projections, since the decision for further excavation is a political one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/docs/FeasibilityStudy.pdf Feasibility Study]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics involve excavation under inhabited areas in addition to unspecified but reported&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24096948-25132,00.html In search of Western civilisation's lost classics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229025208/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24096948-25132,00.html |date=2008-12-29 }}'', ''[[The Australian]]'', August 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; references to mafia involvement.

Using &lt;!--http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/investigations/esu101/esu101page07.cfm--&gt;[[multi-spectral imaging]], a technique developed in the early 1990s, it is possible to read the burned papyri. With multi-spectral imaging, many pictures of the illegible papyri are taken using different filters in the [[infrared]] or in the [[ultraviolet]] range, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the blackened papyrus surface.

Non-destructive [[CT scans]] will, it is hoped, provide breakthroughs in reading the fragile unopened scrolls without destroying them in the process. Encouraging results along this line of research have been obtained, which use [[Phase-contrast X-ray imaging]].

According to authors, "this pioneering research opens up new prospects not only for the many papyri still unopened, but also for others that have not yet been discovered, perhaps including a second library of Latin papyri at a lower, as yet unexcavated level of the Villa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mocella |first=Vito |display-authors=etal |date=2015 |title=Revealing letters in rolled Herculaneum papyri by X-ray phase-contrast imaging |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150120/ncomms6895/pdf/ncomms6895.pdf |journal=Nature Communications |publisher= |volume=6 |issue= |pages=5 |doi=10.1038/ncomms6895 |pmc= |pmid= | name-list-format=vanc|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E5895M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==J. Paul Getty Museum==
[[File:Escipión africano.JPG|thumb|200px|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]
In 1970, oil billionaire [[J. Paul Getty]] engaged the architectural firm of Langdon and Wilson to create a replica of the Villa dei Papiri to serve as an art museum based on his collection of antiquities. 

Based on Weber's plans published in [[Le Antichità di Ercolano|''Le Antichità di Ercolano'']], the museum was built on Getty's Malibu ranch in 1972-74. Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg and the curator of Getty's antiquities, [[Jiří Frel]], worked closely with Getty and the architects to insure the accuracy of the museum building's design .  

Since the Villa dei Papiri was unexcavated, Neuerburg based many of the villa's architectural and landscaping details on elements from other ancient Roman houses in the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae.&lt;ref name="getty"&gt;''The Getty''. 2005. J. Paul Getty Museum. 11 May 2007 http://www.getty.edu/visit/see_do/architecture.html.&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the mosaic fountain in the museum's garden peristyle replicates the one in the Nymphaeum of the House of the Large Fountain at Pompeii). 

In 1997, the Getty Museum was relocated to the [[Getty Center]]. The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived [[Getty Villa]], as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum's antiquities and as a center for the study of ancient art.

==In modern literature==
Several scenes in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' bestselling novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat [[Pedius Cascus]] and his wife [[Rectina]]. ([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his Letters.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library&amp;nbsp;– which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.

==Work of art==
===Sculpture from the Villa===
According to the 1908 publication ''Buried Herculaneum'' by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic Apollo, Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (?

[[Image:Konfederacja Warszawska.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Original act of the Warsaw Confederation]]
The '''Warsaw Confederation''', signed on 28 January 1573 by the Polish national assembly (''sejm konwokacyjny'') in [[Warsaw]], was the first European act granting [[religious freedom]]s. It was an important development in the [[history of Poland]] and [[history of Lithuania|Lithuania]] that extended religious tolerance to nobility and free persons within the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Daniel, The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386–1795, Seattle and London: University of Washington Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered the formal beginning of religious freedom in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Although it did not prevent all conflict based on religion, it did make the Commonwealth a much safer and more tolerant place than most of contemporaneous Europe, especially during the subsequent [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Zamojski]], "The Polish Way". New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Religious tolerance]] in Poland had had a long tradition (e.g. [[Statute of Kalisz]]) and had been ''[[de facto]]'' policy in the reign of the recently deceased [[monarch|King]] [[Sigismund II of Poland|Sigismund II]]. However, the articles signed by the [[Confederation]] gave official sanction to earlier custom. In that sense, they may be considered either the beginning or the peak of Polish tolerance.

Following the childless death of the last king of the [[Jagiellon]] [[dynasty]], Polish and Lithuanian nobles ([[szlachta]]) gathered at [[Warsaw]] to prevent any [[separatist]]s from acting and to maintain the existing legal order. For that the citizens had to unconditionally abide the decisions made by the body; and the confederation was a potent declaration that the two former states are still closely linked.

In January the nobles signed a document in which representatives of all the major religions pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. A new political system was arising, aided by the confederation which contributed to its stability. Religious tolerance was an important factor in a multiethnic and multi-religious state, as the territories of the Commonwealth were inhabited by many generations of people from different ethnic backgrounds (Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenian, Germans and Jews) and of different denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish and even Muslim). "This country became what [[Stanislaus Hosius|Cardinal Hozjusz]] called “a place of shelter for heretics”. It was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-confederation-of-warsaw-of-28th-of-january-1573-religious-tolerance-guaranteed/&lt;/ref&gt;

This act was not imposed by a government or by consequences of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the 1572 French [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such an act in Poland.

The people most involved in preparing the articles were [[Mikołaj Sienicki]] (leader of the "[[execution movement]]"), [[Jan Firlej]] and [[Jan Zborowski]]. Their efforts were opposed by many dignitaries of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

They were opposed by most of the Catholic priests: [[Franciszek Krasiński]] was the only bishop who signed them ([[Szymon Starowolski]] claimed he did so under the "threat of the sword"), and the future legal acts containing the articles of the Confederation were signed by bishops with the stipulation: "''excepto articulo confoederationis.''" Another bishop, [[Wawrzyniec Goślicki]], was [[excommunicated]] for signing the [[acts of the Sejm of 1587]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

The articles of the Warsaw Confederation were later incorporated into the [[Henrician Articles]], and thus became [[constitution of Poland|constitutional provisions]] alongside the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'' also instituted in 1573.

==Importance==
Late-16th-century Poland stood between the Orthodox [[Muscovy]] in the East, the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire]] to the South, and Western Europe, torn between [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], to the North and West. Its religious tolerance made it a welcome refuge for those escaping religious persecution elsewhere; in the words of Cardinal [[Stanislaus Hosius]], it became “a place of shelter for heretics”. The confederation legalized the previously unwritten customs of religious tolerance.

There is debate as to whether [[religious freedom]] was intended only for the nobility or also for the peasants and others; most{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} historians favor the latter interpretation.

In 2003, the text of the Warsaw Confederation was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-confederation-of-warsaw-of-28th-of-january-1573-religious-tolerance-guaranteed/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4350">'''''WorldBench''''' is a Windows [[Benchmark_(computing)#Microsoft_Windows_benchmarks|benchmark]]
tool offered by PC World Labs since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/03/09/pentium.1gig.idg/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The PC World Test Center uses this same tool every month to test contenders for PC World's Top Desktop PCs and Top Notebook PCs charts. WorldBench is also used in conjunction with other tests to evaluate Top Graphics Boards, Top Hard Drives, and other product categories.

The PC World Test Center is currently on WorldBench 6,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/172974/pc_worlds_worldbench_6_behind_the_scenes.html&lt;/ref&gt; which specializes in tests for the 32 and 64-bit platforms of the [[Windows]] Operating System from [[Windows XP]] on. Ongoing beta testing for a power-consumption analysis tool that will be incorporated into the next version of WorldBench, along with several other new additions, is currently taking place in the PCWorld Lab.

WorldBench is no longer available to the public, and the test suite is now exclusively used by the PCWorld Lab in their benchmarks.

==How It Works==
[[File:WorldBench6.png|thumb|right|an example of a computer showing results]]WorldBench uses popular desktop applications to perform realistic tasks, making it easier to accurately gauge how fast a computer runs applications routinely used, rather than just listing abstract measures of individual components. The application-based tests tell exactly what is needed—how fast the computer runs real applications. WorldBench installs special versions of each application tested, enabling the automated test scripts to perform every test. It also ensures that the software configuration and version are identical for every computer evaluated. The setup program installs the user interface, testing scripts, and all documents necessary to complete the tasks. It also unpacks and installs each application as needed during testing.

Once a test is completed, the program removes the unpacked application from the hard drive.

For security reasons, none of the test applications can be installed from the WorldBench CD.

When a test is started from WorldBench, the benchmark manager begins running the test script. This script is a series of commands—menu requests, keystrokes, and mouse clicks—that cause the application to step through typical tasks. For example, in Microsoft Office, the script starts by unpacking the version of Office embedded on the WorldBench CD. Then it opens the included test documents, copies and pastes text, changes the documents’ formatting, checks spelling, and undertakes other tasks that are likely to be performed using Office. When Office has finished all the steps in the script, the benchmark closes Office.

The following process is the testing sequence supported by each test:
* Setup system files needed by each application.
* Run system tools such as defragmenter.
* Unpack the application files and update the Registry.
* Clear idle tasks and flush file buffers
* Run the script that launches the application and performs the test.
* Restart the system.
* Remove the application files.
* Unpack the next application, and so on.

After each test, the computer is shut down and restarted to release all memory and ready the system for the next test. The computer is also restarted after the initial system setup and final clean-up processes, which prepare it for testing and restore it to its original state.

Worldbench is no longer being sold, and support for existing customers ends mid-2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/misc/worldbench/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
