==Early life and education==
Alaa Mubarak was born in Cairo to [[Suzanne Mubarak]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]], who became [[President of Egypt]] in 1981, ousted in 2011. However, controversy sparked whether the two sons were called by their British names " Alan and Jimmy".&lt;ref name=aj&gt;(28 June 2012) [http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/2012/06/2012620124818367927.html The Family] Al Jazeera English)&lt;/ref&gt;
Alaa attended [[St. George's College, Cairo]] and graduated from the [[American University in Cairo]].&lt;ref name="BBC Arabic"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of President Mubarak's Grandson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/arabic/middle_east_news/newsid_8056000/8056723.stm |publisher=[[BBC Arabic]]|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=19 May 2009|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
Mubarak has kept a much lower profile than his younger brother, [[Gamal Mubarak|Gamal]], and was not involved in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45534138|title=Egypt ex-President Mubarak's sons arrested|date=2018-09-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he was arrested together with his father and brother, and he and his brother were released in October 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc12"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court orders release of Hosni Mubarak's sons|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34504422|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=BBC|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU had imposed sanctions on father and sons, and froze all assets that Mubarak disclosed.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/08/mossack-fonseca-law-firm-hide-money-panama-papers | title=Mossack Fonseca: inside the firm that helps the super-rich hide their money | work=The Guardian | date=8 April 2016 | accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Alaa was arrested along with his brother Gamal, accused of manipulating the stock market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Mubarak is married to Heddy Rasekh, and they have had two sons, Muhammad and Omar. Muhammad died on 18 May 2009, aged 12. It was announced that he had suffered a 'severe health crisis', a brain haemorrhage. He was checked into the Maadi Military Hospital for a couple of hours before being flown to Paris to no avail. His body was returned and buried in Cairo.&lt;ref name="BBC Arabic"/&gt;

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Arbitration''', a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR), is a way to resolve disputes outside the [[court]]s. The dispute will be decided by one or more persons (the "arbitrators", "arbiters" or "[[arbitral tribunal]]"), which renders the "[[arbitration award]]". An arbitration award is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |page=324 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration is often used for the resolution of [[Commercial law|commercial]] disputes, particularly in the context of [[International commerce|international commercial transactions]].  In certain countries such as the United States, arbitration is also frequently employed in consumer and employment matters, where arbitration may be mandated by the terms of employment or commercial contracts and may include a waiver of the right to bring a [[class action]] claim. Mandatory consumer and employment arbitration should be distinguished from consensual arbitration, particularly commercial arbitration.

Arbitration can be either voluntary or mandatory (although mandatory arbitration can only come from a statute or from a contract that one party imposes on the other, in which the parties agree to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration, without necessarily knowing, specifically, what disputes will ever occur) and can be either binding or [[Non-binding arbitration|non-binding]]. Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision cannot be imposed on the parties. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise, the (non-binding) arbiter remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of damages payable. By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration.

Arbitration is a proceeding in which a dispute is resolved by an impartial adjudicator whose decision the parties to the dispute have agreed, or legislation has decreed, will be final and binding. There are limited rights of review and appeal of arbitration awards. Arbitration is not the same as: [[Litigation|judicial proceedings]] (although in some jurisdictions, court proceedings are sometimes referred as arbitrations&lt;ref name="Judicial"&gt;In the [[United Kingdom]], small claims in the [[county court]] are dealt with by a procedure called "small claims arbitration", although the proceedings are held in front of a district judge, paid for by the state. In [[Russia]], the courts dealing with commercial disputes are referred to as the [[Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation]], although it is not an arbitral tribunal in the true sense of the word.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR)&lt;ref&gt;Although all attempts to determine disputes outside of the courts are "alternative dispute resolution" in the literal sense, ADR in the technical legal sense, is the process whereby an attempt is made to reach a common middle ground through an independent mediator as a basis for a binding settlement. In direct contrast, arbitration is an adversarial process to determine a winner and a loser in relation to the rights and wrongs of a dispute.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[expert determination]], [[mediation]] (a form of settlement [[QRG_on_Arbitration,_Conciliation_and_Mediation#Negotiation|negotiation]] facilitated by a neutral third party).

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Parties often seek to resolve disputes through arbitration because of a number of perceived potential advantages over judicial proceedings. Companies often require arbitration with their customers, but prefer the advantages of courts in disputes with competitors:&lt;ref name="ltn"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Hernández |first=Gabrielle Orum |date=2017-10-09 |title=Can Arbitration Solve Tech Sector's Litigation Cost Concerns |url=http://www.legaltechnews.com/id=1202799945603/Can-Arbitration-Solve-Tech-Sectors-Litigation-Cost-Concerns?mcode=0&amp;curindex=0&amp;curpage=ALL |journal=Legaltech News |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}
*In contrast to litigation, where one cannot "choose the judge",&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/the-supreme-courts-retired-but-hardly-retiring-ian-binnie/article2397731/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=The Supreme Court's retired, but hardly retiring, Ian Binnie | date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; arbitration allows the parties to choose their own tribunal. This is especially useful when the subject matter of the dispute is highly technical: arbitrators with an appropriate degree of expertise (for example, quantity surveying expertise, in the case of a construction dispute, or expertise in commercial property law, in the case of a real estate dispute&lt;ref&gt;See for example the arbitration service offered by Falcon Chambers, the specialist property barristers chambers - www.falcon-chambersarbitration.com.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be chosen. 
*Arbitration is often faster than litigation in court.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt;
*Arbitral proceedings and an arbitral award are generally non-public, and can be made confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trans-lex.org/970500|title=Principle XIII.5.1 - Confidentiality - Trans-Lex.org|first=Prof. Dr. Klaus Peter Berger, LL.M., University of|last=Cologne|website=www.trans-lex.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In arbitral proceedings the language of arbitration may be chosen, whereas in judicial proceedings the official language of the country of the competent court will be automatically applied.
*Because of the provisions of the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]], arbitration awards are generally easier to enforce in other nations than court verdicts.
*In most legal systems there are very limited avenues for appeal of an arbitral award, which is sometimes an advantage because it limits the duration of the dispute and any associated liability.

Some of the disadvantages include:
*Arbitration agreements are sometimes contained in ancillary agreements, or in small print in other agreements, and consumers and employees often do not know in advance that they have agreed to mandatory binding pre-dispute arbitration by purchasing a product or taking a job.
*If the arbitration is mandatory and binding, the parties waive their rights to access the courts and to have a judge or jury decide the case.
*If the arbitrator or the arbitration forum depends on the corporation for repeat business, there may be an inherent incentive to rule against the consumer or employee
*There are very limited avenues for appeal, which means that an erroneous decision cannot be easily overturned.
*Although usually thought to be speedier, when there are multiple arbitrators on the panel, juggling their schedules for hearing dates in long cases can lead to delays.
*In some legal systems, arbitration awards have fewer enforcement options than judgments; although in the United States arbitration awards are enforced in the same manner as court judgments and have the same effect.
*Arbitrators are generally unable to enforce interlocutory measures against a party, making it easier for a party to take steps to avoid enforcement of member or a small group of members in arbitration due to increasing legal fees, without explaining to the members the adverse consequences of an unfavorable ruling.
*[[Discovery (law)|Discovery]] may be more limited in arbitration or entirely nonexistent.
*The potential to generate billings by attorneys may be less than pursuing the dispute through trial.
*Unlike court judgments, arbitration awards themselves are not directly enforceable.  A party seeking to enforce an arbitration award must resort to judicial remedies, called an action to "confirm" an award.

==Arbitrability==

By their nature, the subject matter of some disputes is not capable of arbitration. In general, two groups of legal procedures cannot be subjected to arbitration:
* Procedures which necessarily lead to a determination which the parties to the dispute may not enter into an agreement upon:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. [http://www.trans-lex.org/600550#head-10 Section 1030 subsection 1 of the German ''Zivilprozessordnung''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|268|2011|litigants=Larkden Pty Limited v Lloyd Energy Systems Pty Limited |date=1 April 2011 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some court procedures lead to judgments which bind all members of the general public, or public authorities in their capacity as such, or third parties, or which are being conducted in the public interest. For example, until the 1980s, antitrust matters were not arbitrable in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.]]'', 473 U.S. 614 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Matters relating to [[criminal law|crimes]], [[legal status|status]] and [[family law]] are generally not considered to be arbitrable, as the power of the parties to enter into an agreement upon these matters is at least restricted. However, most other disputes that involve private rights between two parties can be resolved using arbitration. In some disputes, parts of claims may be arbitrable and other parts not. For example, in a dispute over [[patent infringement]], a determination of whether a patent has been infringed could be adjudicated upon by an arbitration tribunal, but the validity of a patent could not: As patents are subject to a system of public registration, an arbitral panel would have no power to order the relevant body to rectify any patent registration based upon its determination.
* Some legal orders exclude or restrict the possibility of arbitration for reasons of the protection of weaker members of the public, e.g. consumers. ''Examples'': German law excludes disputes over the rental of living space from any form of arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-lex.org/600550#head-10 Section 1030 subsection 2 ''Zivilprozessordnung'']&lt;/ref&gt; while arbitration agreements with consumers are only considered valid if they are signed by either party,&lt;ref&gt;To be correct: certain form, as defined by statute, of an electronic signature using a chip card and a PIN code is also sufficient&lt;/ref&gt; and if the signed document does not bear any other content than the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trans-lex.org/600550#head-11 Section 1031 subesction 5 of the ''Zivilprozessordnung'']. The restriction does not apply to notarized agreements, as it is presumed that the notary public will have well informed the consumer about the content and its implications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitration agreement==
{{See also|Arbitration clause}}

Arbitration agreements are generally divided into two types:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* Agreements which provide that, if a dispute should arise, it will be resolved by arbitration. These will generally be normal [[contract]]s, but they contain an [[arbitration clause]]
* Agreements which are signed after a dispute has arisen, agreeing that the dispute should be resolved by arbitration (sometimes called a "submission agreement")
The former is the far more prevalent type of arbitration agreement. Sometimes, legal significance attaches to the type of arbitration agreement. For example, in certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (not including England and Wales), it is possible to provide that each party should bear their own costs in a conventional arbitration clause, but not in a submission agreement.

In keeping with the informality of the arbitration process, the law is generally keen to uphold the validity of arbitration clauses even when they lack the normal formal language associated with legal contracts. Clauses which have been upheld include:
* "arbitration in London - English law to apply"&lt;ref&gt;''Swiss Bank Corporation v Novrissiysk Shipping'' [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 202&lt;/ref&gt;
* "suitable arbitration clause"&lt;ref&gt;''Hobbs Padgett &amp; Co v J C Kirkland'' (1969) 113 SJ 832&lt;/ref&gt;
* "arbitration, if any, by ICC Rules in London"&lt;ref&gt;''Mangistaumunaigaz Oil Production v United Kingdom World Trade'' [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 617&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have also upheld clauses which specify resolution of disputes other than in accordance with a specific legal system. These include provision indicating:
* That the arbitrators "must not necessarily judge according to the strict law but as a general rule ought chiefly to consider the principles of practical business"&lt;ref&gt;''Norske Atlas Insurance Co v London General Insurance Co'' (1927) 28 Lloyds List Rep 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* "internationally accepted principles of law governing contractual relations"&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsche Schachtbau v R'As al-Khaimah National Oil Co'' [1990] 1 AC 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreements to refer disputes to arbitration generally have a special status in the eyes of the law. For example, in disputes on a contract, a common defence is to [[pleading|plead]] the contract is [[void (law)|void]] and thus any claim based upon it fails. It follows that if a party successfully claims that a contract is void, then each clause contained within the contract, including the arbitration clause, would be void. However, in most countries, the courts have accepted that:
# A contract can only be declared void by a court or other tribunal; and
# If the contract (valid or otherwise) contains an arbitration clause, then the proper forum to determine whether the contract is void or not, is the arbitration tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;For example, under English law see ''Heyman v Darwins Ltd.'' [1942] AC 356&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, either position is potentially unfair; if a person is made to sign a contract under [[duress]], and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Conversely a court may be persuaded that the arbitration agreement itself is void having been signed under duress. However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to go to court to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.

== Comparative law ==
Nations regulate arbitration through a variety of laws. The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (as is the case in Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (as is the case in England and Jordan&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Hammouri, Dima A. Khleifat, and Qais A. Mahafzah, ''Arbitration and Mediation in the Southern Mediterranean Countries: Jordan'', Kluwer Law International, Wolters Kluwer - Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 1, January 2007, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.

=== United States ===
{{Main article|Arbitration in the United States}}
The [[Federal Arbitration Act]] (FAA) of 1925 established a [[public policy]] in favor of arbitration. For the first six decades of its existence, courts did not allow arbitration for "federal statutory claims" through a [[Bright-line rule|bright-line]] "nonarbitrability" doctrine, but in the 1980s the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and began to use the act to require arbitration if included in the contract for federal statutory claims.&lt;ref name=Horton2012/&gt; Although some legal scholars believe that it was originally intended to apply to federal courts only, courts now routinely require arbitration due to the FAA regardless of state statutes or public policy [[unconscionability]] determinations by state courts.&lt;ref name=Horton2012&gt;Horton D. (2012). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2158882 Federal Arbitration Act Preemption, Purposivism, and State Public Policy]. Forthcoming in ''Georgetown Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[consumer law]], [[standard form contract]]s often include mandatory predispute [[arbitration clause]]s which require [[consumer arbitration]]. Under these agreements the consumer may waive their right to a [[lawsuit]] and a [[class action]]. In 2011, one of these clauses was upheld in ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]''.&lt;ref name=Horton2012/&gt;

Several arbitration organizations exist, including the [[American Arbitration Association]] and [[JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)|JAMS]].  The [[National Arbitration Forum]] also conducts arbitrations, but it no longer conducts consumer arbitrations pursuant to a consent decree entered into in 2009 because of evidence that it had been biased toward, and had incentives that favored, credit card companies over cardholders.  The AAA was also asked to exit the business.,&lt;ref name=berner&gt;{{cite web|last=Berner|first=Robert|title=Big Arbitration Firm Pulls Out of Credit Card Business|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investing/wall_street_news_blog/archives/2009/07/big_arbitration.html|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not done so.

== International ==

===History===
The United States and Great Britain were pioneers in the use of arbitration to resolve their differences. It was first used in the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795, and played a major role in the [[Alabama Claims]] case of 1872 whereby major tensions regarding British support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War were resolved.  At the First International Conference of American States in 1890, a plan for systematic arbitration was developed, but not accepted. The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Peace Conference]] of 1899, saw the major world powers agreed to a system of arbitration and the creation of a Permanent Court of Arbitration.  President [[William Howard Taft]] was a major advocate. One important use came in the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Britain in 1910.  In 1911 the United States signed arbitration treaties with France and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Campbell, "Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911," ''Journal of American History'' (1966) 53#2 pp: 279-298 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894200 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Jentleson and Thomas G Paterson, eds. ''Encyclopedia of U.S. Foreign Relations''  (1997) 1: pp 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration was widely discussed among diplomats and elites in the 1890-1914 era.  [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895|The 1895 dispute between the United States and Britain over Venezuela]] was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. The [[Olney-Pauncefote Treaty]] of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that required arbitration of major disputes.  The treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson M. Blake, "The Olney-Pauncefote Treaty of 1897," ''American Historical Review,'' (1945) 50#2 pp. 228-243 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1842352 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American Secretary of State [[William Jennings Bryan]] (1913&amp;ndash;1915) worked energetically to promote international arbitration agreements, but his efforts were frustrated by the outbreak of World War I. Bryan negotiated 28 treaties that promised arbitration of disputes before war broke out between the signatory countries and the United States. He made several attempts to negotiate a treaty with Germany, but ultimately was never able to succeed. The agreements, known officially as "Treaties for the Advancement of Peace," set up procedures for conciliation rather than for arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Genevieve Forbes Herrick|author2=John Origen Herrick|title=The Life of William Jennings Bryan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB3Xx4tSqsgC&amp;pg=PA280|origyear=1925|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arbitration treaties were negotiated after the war, but attracted much less attention than the negotiation mechanism created by the [[League of Nations]].

===International agreements===
By far the most important international instrument on arbitration law{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} is the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]], usually simply referred to as the "New York Convention".  Virtually every significant commercial country is a signatory, and only a [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards#States which are not party to the Convention|handful of countries are not parties to the New York Convention]].

Some other relevant international instruments are:
*The Geneva Protocol of 1923
*The Geneva Convention of 1927 [http://interarb.com/vl/g_co1927]
*The European Convention of 1961
*The Washington Convention of 1965 (governing settlement of international investment disputes)
*The [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|Washington Convention]] (ICSID) of 1996 for investment arbitration
*The [[UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration]] of 1985, (revised in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordero-Moss|first=Giuditta|authorlink=Giuditta Cordero-Moss |date=2014|title=International Commercial Contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [http://www.trans-lex.org/705501 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules] (providing a set of rules for an ad hoc arbitration)

===International enforcement===

It is often easier to enforce arbitration awards in a foreign country than court judgments.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]], an award issued in a contracting state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. Only foreign arbitration awards are enforced pursuant to the New York Convention. An arbitral decision is foreign where the award was made in a state other than the state of recognition or where foreign procedural law was used.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the 1958 New York Convention&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these disputes are settled with no public record of their existence as the loser complies voluntarily,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Argen|first = Robert|date = 2015-01-01|title = Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|ssrn = 2393188|location = Rochester, NY|publisher = Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in 2014 UNCITRAL promulgated a rule for public disclosure of investor-state disputes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Virtually [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards#List of parties to the Convention (as of February 2002)|every significant commercial country in the world]] is a party to the Convention while relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments their courts. Additionally, the awards not limited to damages. Whereas typically only monetary judgments by national courts are enforceable in the cross-border context, it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an enforceable order for [[specific performance]] in an arbitration proceeding under the New York Convention.

Article V of the New York Convention provides an exhaustive list of grounds on which enforcement can be challenged. These are generally narrowly construed to uphold the pro-enforcement bias of the Convention.

==== Government disputes ====
Certain international conventions exist in relation to the enforcement of awards against states.
* The Washington Convention 1965 relates to settlement of investment disputes between states and citizens of other countries. The Convention created the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (or ICSID). Compared to other arbitration institutions, relatively few awards have been rendered under ICSID.&lt;ref&gt;Tupman, "Case Studies in the Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes" (1986) 35 ICLQ 813&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Algiers Declaration of 1981 established the [[Iran-US Claims Tribunal]] to adjudicate claims of American corporations and individuals in relation to expropriated property during the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. The tribunal has not been a notable success, and has even been held by an English court to be [[void (law)|void]] under its own governing law.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallal v Bank Mellat'' [1986] 1 QB 441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitral tribunal==

{{Main article|Arbitral tribunal}}

The arbitrators which determine the outcome of the dispute are called the arbitral tribunal. The composition of the arbitral tribunal can vary enormously, with either a sole arbitrator sitting, two or more arbitrators, with or without a chairman or umpire, and various other combinations. In most jurisdictions, an arbitrator enjoys immunity from liability for anything done or omitted whilst acting as arbitrator unless the arbitrator acts in [[bad faith]].

Arbitrations are usually divided into two types: ''ad hoc'' arbitrations and administered arbitrations.

In ''ad hoc'' arbitrations, the arbitral tribunals are appointed by the parties or by an appointing authority chosen by the parties. After the tribunal has been formed, the appointing authority will normally have no other role and the arbitration will be managed by the tribunal.

In administered arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by a professional arbitration institution providing arbitration services, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration|LCIA]] in [[London]], or the [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]] in [[Paris]], or the [[American Arbitration Association]] in the United States. Normally the arbitration institution also will be the appointing authority. Arbitration institutions tend to have their own rules and procedures, and may be more formal. They also tend to be more expensive, and, for procedural reasons, slower.&lt;ref&gt;For example, all arbitral awards issued by the ICC have to be reviewed internally before being handed down, which helps certainty and improves the quality of awards, but leads to delay and expense.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duties of the tribunal===

The duties of a tribunal will be determined by a combination of the provisions of the arbitration agreement and by the procedural laws which apply in the seat of the arbitration. The extent to which the laws of the seat of the arbitration permit "party autonomy" (the ability of the parties to set out their own procedures and regulations) determines the interplay between the two.

However, in almost all countries the tribunal owes several non-derogable duties. These will normally be:
* to act fairly and impartially between the parties, and to allow each party a reasonable opportunity to put their case and to deal with the case of their opponent (sometimes shortened to: complying with the rules of "[[natural justice]]"); and
* to adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, so as to provide a fair means for resolution of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[England]] these are codified in section 33 of the Arbitration Act 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitral awards==
{{Main article|Arbitration award}}

Although arbitration awards are characteristically an award of [[damages]] against a party, in many jurisdictions tribunals have a range of remedies that can form a part of the award. These may include:
# payment of a sum of money (conventional damages)
# the making of a "[[declaration (law)|declaration]]" as to any matter to be determined in the proceedings
# in some{{Which|date=June 2010}} jurisdictions, the tribunal may have the same power as a court to:
## order a party to do or refrain from doing something ("[[injunction|injunctive relief]]")
## to order [[specific performance]] of a [[contract]]
## to order the [[rectification (law)|rectification]], setting aside or cancellation of a [[deed]] or other document.
# In other jurisdictions, however, unless the parties have expressly granted the arbitrators the right to decide such matters, the tribunal's powers may be limited to deciding whether a party is entitled to damages. It may not have the legal authority to order injunctive relief, issue a declaration, or rectify a contract, such powers being reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts.

===Challenge===
Generally speaking, by their nature, arbitration proceedings tend not to be subject to appeal, in the ordinary sense of the word. However, in most countries, the court maintains a supervisory role to set aside awards in extreme cases, such as [[fraud]] or in the case of some serious legal irregularity on the part of the tribunal. Only domestic arbitral awards are subject to set aside procedure.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In [[Arbitration in the United States of America|American arbitration law]] there exists a small but significant body of case law which deals with the power of the courts to intervene where the decision of an arbitrator is in fundamental disaccord with the applicable principles of law or the contract.&lt;ref&gt;The expression appears in the majority judgment in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''Wilko v Swan'' 346 US 427 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this body of case law has been called into question by recent decisions of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately there is little agreement amongst the different American judgments and textbooks as to whether such a separate doctrine exists at all, or the circumstances in which it would apply. There does not appear to be any recorded judicial decision in which it has been applied. However, conceptually, to the extent it exists, the doctrine would be an important derogation from the general principle that awards are not subject to review by the courts.

===Costs===
The overall costs of arbitration can be estimated on the websites of international arbitration institutions, such as that of the ICC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/arbitration-and-adr/arbitration/cost-and-payment/cost-calculator/|title=Cost calculator - ICC - International Chamber of Commerce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the website of the SIAC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siac.org.sg/index.php?option=com_siaccalculator&amp;view=siaccalculator&amp;Itemid=102|title=Singapore International Arbitration Centre|website=www.siac.org.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the website of the International Arbitration Attorney Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-arbitration-attorney.com/|title=International Arbitration - International Arbitration Information|website=International Arbitration Attorney Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall cost of administrative and arbitrator fees is, on average, less than 20% of the total cost of international arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.international-arbitration-attorney.com/full-international-arbitration-cost-calculators/|title=Full Arbitration Cost Calculators|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many legal systems - both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] - it is normal practice for the courts to award [[Law of costs|legal costs]] against a losing party, with the winner becoming entitled to recover an approximation of what it spent in pursuing its claim (or in defense of a claim). The [[United States]] is a notable exception to this rule, as except for certain extreme cases, a prevailing party in a US legal proceeding does not become entitled to recoup its legal fees from the losing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the courts, arbitral tribunals generally have the same power to award costs in relation to the determination of the dispute. In [[international arbitration]] as well as domestic arbitrations governed by the laws of countries in which courts may award costs against a losing party, the arbitral tribunal will also determine the portion of the arbitrators' fees that the losing party is required to bear.

==Nomenclature==
As methods of dispute resolution, arbitration procedure can be varied to suit the needs of the parties. Certain specific "types" of arbitration procedure have developed, particularly in North America.

* '''Judicial Arbitration''' is, usually, not arbitration at all, but merely a court process which refers to itself as arbitration, such as small claims arbitration before the [[County Court]]s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Judicial" /&gt;
* '''[[Online dispute resolution|Online Arbitration]]''' is, a form of arbitration that occurs exclusively online. There is currently an assumption that online arbitration is admissible under the New York Convention and the E-Commerce Directive, but this has not been legally verified.&lt;ref&gt;R. Morek "The Regulatory Framework for Online Dispute Resolution: A Critical View" (2006) 38 Tol. L. Rev. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Since arbitration is based on a contractual agreement between the parties, an online process without a regulatory framework may generate a significant number of challenges from consumers and other weaker parties if due process cannot be assured.
* '''High-Low Arbitration''', or '''Bracketed Arbitration''', is an arbitration wherein the parties to the dispute agree in advance the limits within which the arbitral tribunal must render its award. It is only generally useful where liability is not in dispute, and the only issue between the party is the amount of compensation. If the award is lower than the agreed minimum, then the defendant only need pay the lower limit; if the award is higher than the agreed maximum, the claimant will receive the upper limit. If the award falls within the agreed range, then the parties are bound by the actual award amount. Practice varies as to whether the figures may or may not be revealed to the tribunal, or whether the tribunal is even advised of the parties' agreement.
* '''Binding Arbitration''' is a form of arbitration where the decision by the arbitrator is legally binding and enforceable, similar to a court order.
* '''[[Non-binding arbitration|Non-Binding Arbitration]]''' is a process which is conducted as if it were a conventional arbitration, except that the award issued by the tribunal is not binding on the parties, and they retain their rights to bring a claim before the courts or other arbitration tribunal; the award is in the form of an independent assessment of the merits of the case, designated to facilitate an out-of-court [[settlement (law)|settlement]]. State law may automatically make a non-binding arbitration binding, if, for example, the non-binding arbitration is court-ordered, and no party requests a trial ''de novo'' (as if the arbitration had not been held).&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Section 44.103, Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pendulum arbitration|Pendulum Arbitration]]''' refers to a determination in [[industrial dispute]]s where an arbitrator has to resolve a claim between a [[trade union]] and management by making a determination of which of the two sides has the more reasonable position. The arbitrator must choose only between the two options, and cannot split the difference or select an alternative position. It was initiated in Chile in 1979. This form of arbitration has been increasingly seen in resolving international tax disputes, especially in the context of deciding on the Transfer Pricing margins.  This form of arbitration is also known (particularly in the United States) as '''Baseball Arbitration'''. It takes its name from a practice which arose in relation to [[Major League Baseball transactions#Free agency and salary arbitration|salary arbitration]] in [[Major League Baseball]].
* '''Night Baseball Arbitration''' is a variation of baseball arbitration where the figures are not revealed to the arbitration tribunal. The arbitrator will determinate the quantum of the claim in the usual way, and the parties agree to accept and be bound by the figure which is closest to the tribunal's award.

Such forms of "Last Offer Arbitration" can also be combined with mediation to create MEDALOA hybrid processes (Mediation followed by Last Offer Arbitration).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altenburger.ch/uploads/tx_altenburger/jl_2007_The_Interaction_Between_Arbitration_and_Mediation.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== England ===
Arbitration in its common law form developed in England; in the Middle Ages, tribunals such as the Courts of the Boroughs, of the Fair and of the Staple arose as the Royal Courts were not designed for trade disputes, and trade with foreigners was otherwise unenforceable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10224-0_2|title=The History, Importance and Modern Use of Arbitration|last=Noussia|first=Dr Kyriaki|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642102233|pages=11–17|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10224-0_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century, common law courts developed contract law and the Admiralty court became accessible for disputes with foreign merchants, broadening the venues for trade disputes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Courts became suspicious of arbitration; for example, in ''Kill v. Hollister'' (1746), an English court ruled that the arbitration agreement could 'oust' courts of law and equity of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Merchants, however, retained provisions to settle disputes among themselves, but tension between the arbitration proceedings and courts eventually resulted in the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 which provided for the appointment of arbitrators and umpires, allowed courts to 'stay proceedings' when a disputant filed a suit despite an agreement to arbitrate, and provided a process for arbitrators to submit questions to a court.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Later, the Arbitration Act 1889 was passed, followed by other Arbitration Acts in 1950, 1975, 1979 and [[Arbitration Act 1996|1996]]. [[Arbitration Act 1979]] in particular limited judicial review for arbitration awards.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Arbitration was common in the early United States, with George Washington serving as an arbiter on an occasion.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The United States had a notable difference from England, however, in that unlike England, its courts generally did not enforce [[Executory contract|executory agreements]] (binding predispute agreements) to arbitrate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260387685_State_regulation_of_arbitration_proceedings_judicial_review_of_Arbitration_Awards_by_State_Courts|title=State regulation of arbitration proceedings: judicial review of Arbitration Awards by State Courts|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that prior to an award, a claimant could sue in court even if they had contractually agreed to settle disputes by arbitration. After the award, courts reviewed the judgment, but generally deferred to the arbitration,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; although the practice was not consistent.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228208161_Judicial_Enforcement_of_Pre-Dispute_Arbitration_Agreements_Back_to_the_Future|title=Judicial Enforcement of Pre-Dispute Arbitration Agreements: Back to the Future|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of enforcement of predispose agreements led to the [[Federal Arbitration Act of 1925]],&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; with New York leading with a state law enforcing predispose agreements.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In 1921, the [[American Bar Association]] drafted the [[Federal Arbitration Act]] based on the New York law, which was passed in 1925 with minor changes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In the next decade, the [[American Arbitration Association]] promoted rules and facilitated arbitrations through appointments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7424">'''Bankruptcy tourism''' is the phenomenon whereby residents of one country move to another jurisdiction in order to declare a [[personal bankruptcy]] there, before returning to their original country of residence. This is done in order facilitate bankruptcy in a new jurisdiction where the insolvency laws are deemed to be more favourable. It is most prevalent in Europe where [[European Union law|EU laws]] allow the free movement of residents to other [[Eurozone]] countries. Once in the new jurisdiction a person seeking bankruptcy must establish their [[Bankruptcy in the Republic of Ireland#Centre of main interests|Centre of Main Interests]] there in order to qualify as a resident and, therefore, petition for a successful bankruptcy.

The issue of bankruptcy tourism has gained notoriety in the [[Republic of Ireland]] due to the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|recession]] and property crash there resulting in high levels of debt and personal insolvencies. However, the phenomenon first emerged in the UK in 2009 when it was reported that German and Austrian nationals were moving to [[Kent]] in order to take advantage of bankruptcy laws in England and Wales, whilst residing close to Eurostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harry Wallop|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/6219396/Tunbridge-Wells-the-debt-capital-of-Europe.html|title=Tunbridge Wells the 'debt capital of Europe'|newspaper=Telegraph|date=22 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a discussion of how the English courts have sought to tackle the phenomenon of bankruptcy tourism see: http://abg-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bankruptcy-Tourism-Article-June-2014.pdf

Bankruptcy tourism is now more synonymous with the [[Republic of Ireland]] where it has become a high profile issue with one UK-based insolvency solicitor, [[Steve Thatcher]], claiming recently that he had recently written off €1bn in Irish debt for his Irish clients in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Henry McDonald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/27/irish-dodge-debts-uk-bankruptcy-tourism |title=Irish dodge debts through UK 'bankruptcy tourism' &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67zYhKAHz?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/27/irish-dodge-debts-uk-bankruptcy-tourism |archivedate=28 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of Irish debt being written off in the UK has prompted the government there to seek to have EU law amended in order to make it harder for Irish residents to move to the UK and take advantage of more lenient bankruptcy laws there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Walsh|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/shatter-bid-to-stop-bankruptcy-tourism-224025.html|title=Shatter bid to stop ‘bankruptcy tourism’|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where bankruptcy lasts for a period of twelve months (but salary instalments can required for up to three years)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef1189en.pdf|title = Household debt advisory services in the European Union|last = Eurofound|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to twelve years in [[Bankruptcy in the Republic of Ireland|the Republic of Ireland]]. Though Thatcher dismisses the validity of the term 'bankruptcy tourism' and instead calls it 'bankruptcy emigration' as he says people have to emigrate to the UK in order to go bankrupt with the majority of his clients remaining in the UK once their bankruptcy is complete.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/bankruptcy-in-britain-still-an-option-for-irish-1.956758 {{dead link|date=May 2014}}{{Dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, Ireland has reduced the duration of its insolvency procedures, and since 2016 has a 1-year bankruptcy procedure as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html|title = Personal insolvency in Ireland|last = Citizens Information|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, access to such procedures may still be restricted due to barriers such as requirement to pay for legal procedures, limited size of the debt, or if one already went through a procedure before. Still, England and Wales have among the shortest and most accessible procedures in the EU,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and continues attracting bankruptcy tourism in particular among over-indebted people with assets.

==Notable Irish Bankrupts in the UK==
The most prominent cases of alleged bankruptcy tourism are perhaps those of David Drumm former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank[52] and property developer John Fleming. Fleming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Bielenberg|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/bankrupt-builder-who-owed-1bn-back-living-in-his-former-home-28815457.html|title=Bankrupt builder who owed €1bn back living in his former home|newspaper=Independent.ie|date=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had personally guaranteed much of the €1 billion debt of Tivway and associated companies in Ireland, was discharged from bankruptcy in the UK on 10 November 2011, the anniversary of the date on which he was declared bankrupt there.

Other well known figures who have moved from the [[Republic of Ireland]] to the [[UK]] in order to go bankrupt are as follows:
* [[Shane Filan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anne-Marie Walsh|url=http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/bankrupt-westlife-star-filan-keeps-38400-wedding-ring-28958249.html|title=Bankrupt Westlife star Filan keeps €38,400 wedding ring|newspaper=Independent.ie|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-IPO===
The company went public through an IPO on May 19, 1992.&lt;ref name="ourHist"/&gt;

The Taxus Stent was approved in 2003 in Europe and other countries and approved in the United States by the FDA in March 2004. It was the second drug-eluting stent approved in the United States.&lt;ref name="taxusAp"/&gt;

In April 2004 the company announced that it had exercised an exclusive option to acquire [[Precision Vascular Systems, Inc.]], as part of a series of agreements between Boston Scientific and Precision Vascular in 2002 - for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonscientific.com/news-releases?item=58711|title=News Releases - Boston Scientific|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June Boston acquired [[Advanced Bionics Corporation]] for $740 million in cash, plus earn out payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonscientific.com/news-releases?item=58598|title=News Releases - Boston Scientific|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December Boston completed its acquisition of [[Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc.]] for $120 million payable in Boston Scientific stock, plus the possibility of future contingent payments.

==Lawsuits==
===Johnson &amp; Johnson lawsuits===
Beginning in 2003, Boston Scientific and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] were involved in a series of litigations involving patents covering [[heart stent]] medical devices. Both parties claimed that the other had infringed upon their patents. The litigation was settled once Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716&amp;nbsp;million to Johnson &amp; Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73&amp;nbsp;billion in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704107204575039430685168478 Boston Scientific to Pay J&amp;J $1.73B to Settle Stent Patent Disputes], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in November 2014 that [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] would have another chance for payback after a multibillion-dollar trial was set for 20 November 2014. A [[New York (state)|New York]] federal court judge would hear the case without a jury to decide whether Boston Scientific should be held liable for the contract breach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/19/us-johnson-johnson-boston-scient-trial-idUSKCN0J30CS20141119 J&amp;J seeks over $5 billion in damages from Boston Scientific at trial]. [[Reuters]], 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transvaginal mesh===
Boston Scientific is one of several manufacturers of a medical device called transvaginal mesh, a type of [[surgical mesh]] used to treat [[pelvic organ prolapse]].  In 2015, Boston Scientific announced it would pay $119 million to 2,970 lawsuit plaintiffs, who had been injured by the mesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boston Scientific ordered to pay $100 million in transvaginal mesh trial |date=May 28, 2015 |author=Jessica Dye |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boston-scientific-mesh-verdict/boston-scientific-ordered-to-pay-100-million-in-transvaginal-mesh-trial-idUSKBN0OD27L20150528 |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, May 13, 2018, [[60 Minutes]] broadcast a story suggesting that Boston Scientific used counterfeit [[Marlex|Marlex polypropylene]] resin to manufacture their mesh product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gynecological mesh: The medical device that has 100,000 women suing, A common surgical implant has generated the largest multi-district litigation since asbestos. 60 Minutes reports on one of the device's manufacturers, Boston Scientific, now facing 48,000 lawsuits |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=May 13, 2018 |author=Scott Pelley |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-scientific-gynecological-mesh-the-medical-device-that-has-100000-women-suing/ |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boston Scientific responded by saying the broadcast was "irresponsible and misleading,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our perspective on the "60 Minutes" report on transvaginal mesh |publisher=Boston Scientific |author=Dave Pierce, Executive Vice President, MedSurg, Boston Scientific, President, Urology and Pelvic Health |url=http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/medical-specialties/female-pelvic-medicine/perspective-on-60-minutes-vaginal-mesh-report.html |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing a 2017 [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) report stating that although they found variability in the polypropylene resin, "these differences do not present new safety or effectiveness concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 19, 2017 |title=Urogynecologic Surgical Mesh Implants |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/UroGynSurgicalMesh/default.htm |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayo Clinic has described the advantages and risks associated with the use of transvaginal mesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Get the facts about transvaginal mesh complications, Concerned about transvaginal mesh complications associated with treatments for pelvic floor disorders?

==Restatement==
On Nov 3,1998, Boston Scientific restated its financial results for 1997, as well as its quarterly results for the first three quarters of 1998, due to the occurrence of business irregularities in the operations of its Japanese subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Boston+Scientific+Addresses+Japan+Business+Irregularities.-a053164699| title=Boston Scientific Addresses Japan Business Irregularities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants''' ('''CICA''') was incorporated by an Act of the Parliament of Canada in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Stephen Bernhut |title = Setting the standard  | url = http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2002/may/features/camagazine23639.aspx | publisher = CA Magazine | date = May 2002 | accessdate = 6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later became known as the ''Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Act''.&lt;ref&gt;SC 1902, c. 58, as amended by SC 1951, c. 89 and SC 1990, c. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The CICA developed and supported accounting, auditing and assurance standards for organizations in Canada, developed and delivered education programs, and issued the [[professional designation]] of [[Chartered Accountant]]. The CICA was a founding member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] and the [[Global Accounting Alliance]].

In 2014, CICA merged with Canada's two other major accounting designations to form the [[Chartered Professional Accountant|Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada]].&lt;ref name="mcfarland"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadian-accountants-merge-under-cpa-designation/article19299464/ |title=Canadian accountants merge under CPA designation |first=Janet |last=McFarland |newspaper=The Globe &amp; Mail |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

* 1902 – The Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants (DACA) is incorporated by Private Act of the Parliament of Canada. (SC 1902, c. 58)
* 1934 – The Canada Companies Act is amended to provide for the involvement of the DACA in setting standards for accounting policies.
* 1938 – All provinces agree that membership should be determined by a [[Uniform Evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The UFE |url = http://www.cica.ca/becoming-a-ca/the-ufe/ |accessdate = 18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1951 – DACA changes its name to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. (SC 1951, c. 89)
* 1954 – Students in all provinces in Canada are writing the same examination.
* 1968 – The CICA releases the ''CICA Handbook'', which codifies [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Canada)|Canadian GAAP]].
* 1972 – The [[Canadian Securities Administrators]] rule that provincial securities commissions must consider the ''CICA Handbook'' as the basis for Canadian GAAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Instrument 52–107 ''Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards'' and its Companion Policy |url = http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/SecuritiesLaw_rule_20101210_52-107-cp_consolidated.htm |accessdate = 7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1975 – The ''CICA Handbook'' is incorporated by reference into the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] for specifying the basis of Canadian GAAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Canada Business Corporations Regulations, s. 70 |url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-512/page-13.html#h-31 |accessdate = 7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1990 – Act of incorporation is updated to reflect the current mandate and powers. (SC 1990, c. 52)
* 2008 – The CICA announces that Canadian GAAP will converge with [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] for publicly accountable enterprises, effective with reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Financial Reporting Standards |url = http://www.acsbcanada.org/international-activities/ifrs/item48766.aspx |accessdate = 7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004 - The CICA begins merger talks with [[CMA Canada]], but talks do not go beyond the exploratory stage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* 2011 - Merger talks are renewed, this time including [[Certified General Accountants Association of Canada|CGA Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Your source for CA-CMA-CGA Merger Information |url = http://cpacanada.ca/ |accessdate = 6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create a new national accounting body. Over the next three years member organizations in all provinces agree to merge, forming [[Chartered Professional Accountant|Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada]].&lt;ref name="mcfarland" /&gt;

==Qualification as a member==
CAs are admitted to the profession through their Provincial Institutes/Ordre. These bodies are responsible for establishing and administering the qualification process, admission criteria and performance standards within their jurisdictions.

Pre-qualification education is delivered regionally through one of four systems across Canada:

|- valign="top"
! scope="row" align="left"| British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the territories
| [http://www.casb.com/ CA School of Business]
|}

The CICA's role – in concert with all provinces, territories – is to develop and maintain consistent, uniform standards for the profession's qualification process. These standards ensure the portability of the CA designation across Canada and internationally through various mutual recognition agreements.

Admission to the CA profession requires:

* A university degree.
* Specified university courses or the equivalent.
* Completion of a professional pre-qualification program as noted above.
* Prescribed practical experience with approved training offices, which are set in place in accredited CA firms, offices of provincial or national Auditors General, and selected corporations and government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CA Training Offices | url = http://www.catrainingoffice.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A passing grade in the [[Uniform Evaluation]].

==Foreign trained accountants==
The CICA itself does not admit members and students; its membership is derived from membership in one of the 10 provincial and two territorial institutes of chartered accountants and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda]].   The institutes are empowered by local laws to regulate and govern the chartered accountancy profession within their jurisdictions. Individuals holding foreign accountancy designations who want to become a Canadian Chartered Accountant must apply to the institute in the jurisdiction where they live or intend to live.

The CICA works in partnership with and on behalf of the institutes to:

* Assess the qualification processes of foreign accounting bodies to determine the extent to which they are equivalent to the Canadian process
* Negotiate Mutual Recognition Agreements with accounting bodies whose qualification processes are substantially equivalent;
* Determine the additional education, evaluation and experience requirements for members of reviewed accounting bodies not deemed substantially equivalent.

Credentials of foreign-trained accountants are assessed according to the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = International Qualifications Appraisal Board  | url = http://www.cica.ca/become-a-ca/internationally-trained-accountants/international-qualifications-appraisal-board/index.aspx | accessdate = 7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==

Computhink Incorporated was founded in 1994 near Chicago, Illinois. The company originally sold a high security identification card production and management software program called IDtel. In their first year, Computhink sold one hundred IDtel systems to the United Nations for $1 million and became their sole ID tag provider. After the success with IDtel, Computhink created their first image viewing and management software program, The Paperless Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Nicole|title=Computhink Introduces A New Concept With The Innovative Product, The Paperless Office; New Product Is Considered An Office Information Manager.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Computhink+Introduces+A+New+Concept+With+The+Innovative+Product,+The...-a019100192|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|publisher=the free library|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995. This was the first 32-bit software package designed for personal, single user, image viewer and image management use. Originally sold as a single user system, The Paperless Office was later developed to be used as a multiple user system.

By 1996, Computhink had operating offices in Chicago, London, Kuwait, South Africa, and Moscow with 85 total employees and consultants, and annual revenue exceeded $15 million. The single-user product was phased out, and network versions for small businesses were created and offered. As customer needs changed, Computhink moved from image management to document management. The reseller channel was developed in the United States and Internationally.

Between 1998 and 1999, The Paperless Office and IDtel were sold in 29 countries, across six continents. At this time, Computhink purchased Whetstone Technologies, the primary partner of Novell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computhink Works with Novell To Provide an Extensive Suite of Integrated Imaging and Document Management Facilities for GroupWise|url=http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/gwmag/assets/computhink_imaging_press_release.pdf|website=www.novell.com|publisher=Novell|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to further expand their market presence. The Paperless Office was re-developed in Java and launched as ViewWise, the first ever server-based image-enabling product in the industry. In 2000, ViewWise became Novell’s preferred imaging partner, and Computhink decided to forego any involvement with the Whetstone Technologies products.

The network for domestic and international resellers was updated and broadened in 2006. Computhink became qualified as a Microsoft Front Runner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britton|first1=Lauren|title=Computhink Becomes a Microsoft ''Front Runner'' With Its ViewWise Document Management Software|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060501005864/en/Computhink-Microsoft-Front-Runner-ViewWise-Document-Management|website=www.businesswire.com|publisher=business wire|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing them to release solutions alongside Microsoft’s product line. By 2008, Computhink had begun incorporating partnerships and connections with Kodak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kontaktujte nás|title=KODAK Capture Pro Software Adds Output Module for Scanning Data into COMPUTHINK VIEWWISE Document Management Software|url=http://graphics.kodak.com/cz/cs/about_gcg/news/2010/100811b.htm|website=graphics.kodak.com|publisher=Eastman Kodak Company|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canon, and other third party viewers that complemented document management software. Computhink reached Tier III for the United Nations.

In 2013, the staff at Computhink realized that since 2006, the market’s needs and interests had shifted from document management to content management. Despite consistent updates and enhancements of ViewWise, the company decided to take the next step. The product was rebranded to Contentverse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHICAGO: Enterprise Content Management Company Computhink Announces Product Rebranding to Contentverse|url=http://www.veooz.com/news/20069Z.html|website=www.veooz.com|publisher=Heraldonline|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the eighth version of the software. In 2014, version 8.1 of Contentverse was released.

The '''Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau''' is a [[Small and medium enterprises|medium-sized]] [[furniture|furniture-manufacturing]] business in the [[Hellerau]] district of the German city of [[Dresden]]. The company archives are deemed a valuable cultural asset and were provided with legal protection.
[[File:Dresden-HellerauDW.jpg|thumbnail|Original Hellerau workshops]]

==Company history==

The workshops were founded October 1, 1898&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Something to Celebrate|url=http://www.dwh.de/en/aktuell/details/article/something-to-celebrate/|website=www.dwh.de/|publisher=Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau GmbH|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Karl Schmidt-Hellerau]] (1873-1948) under the name '''Dresdner Werkstätten für Handwerkskunst Schmidt und Engelbrecht''', or Schmidt and Engelbrecht Dresdner workshops for craftsmanship. His partner 
In 1898-1899 Karl Schmidt-Hellerau and Johann Vincenz Cissarz developed a closet using plywood panels. They continued developing the technique of using plywood. In 1941 they received a patent for thermally tempered wood.

In 1907, Karl Schmidt-Hellerau established an industrial technical school and training workshops. Its first head was Joseph August Lux.

The cornerstone of a new factory was laid in 1909 in what is today Dresden-Hellerau at the same time as work began on the  [[Garden city movement|garden city]] of [[Hellerau]]. Following the commissioning of the new production hall, the company moved there in 1910. At the time the firm occupied 450 employees.

Despite the severe global economic crisis in 1929, the years of National Socialism and the devastation of the Second World War and the socialist planned economy in the [[GDR]], the company has endured. In 1967 the workshops began mass production of the Möbelprogramm Deutsche Werkstätten (MDW), a modular system developed by Rudolf Horn which remained in production for 24 years. Starting in 1970 Hellerau was the main plant of the [[Volkseigener Betrieb]] Möbelkombinat Hellerau, an industrial grouping of furniture producers of East Germany.

Following [[German reunification|reunification]] in 1991, the company was transformed into a [[GmbH]] in [[1992 in Germany|1992]] and privatized by the [[Treuhandanstalt|Treuhand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.dwh.de/en/mythos/chronology/|website=www.dwh.de|publisher=Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau GmbH|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then employed 80 people, with a focus on fulfilling public sector procurement.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0902-0120, Leipzig, Messe, Möbelausstellung.jpg|thumbnail|DWH wall units displayed at the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]], 1974]]
At the beginning of the 21st century, Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau employed over 200 people worldwide, with foreign subsidiaries and sales representatives in England and France.

==Social Commitment==
During his years in England, Karl Schmidt-Hellerau became familiar with the idea of the [[Garden city movement|garden city]]. In reaction to the conditions of worker's housing in [[Dresden]], he decided together with other people, among them Friedrich Naumann, to build [[Germany]]'s first garden city. This was accomplished in 1909.

'''Eliza James''' (30 September 1855– 26 September 1927) was an English [[watercress]] grower and entrepreneur, known as the Watercress Queen of Covent Garden. Her watercress business was the largest watercress company of the time in Europe.

== Life ==
She was born Eliza Currall, in Birmingham on 30 September 1855. She began selling watercress to help support her family following the suicide of her father. Aged sixteen, she was under detention as a female juvenile offender at the Warwickshire Reformatory for Girls in Coventry, which taught offenders a trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-109511|title=Fleet [née Currall; former married name Griffiths], Eliza [known as Eliza James] (1855–1927), watercress grower and entrepreneur|last=Morrin|first=Jean|date=2018-07-12|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.109511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1877, she moved to London.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On 28 May 1877 she married William Arthur Griffiths, a mariner, in Liverpool and they had four daughters and three sons. They lived in Coventry, Birmingham and Liverpool before settling in Sheffield as fruit and vegetable sellers. By 1986, she owned a fruit and commission agency business at Castlefolds Market in Sheffield. 

Her husband was an alcoholic, and on three occasions stabbed her. He threatened to murder her when she attempted to take divorce proceedings against him, and he was imprisoned in 1897. She was granted a divorce by [[decree nisi]] in April of that year, while William was in [[HM Prison Wakefield|Wakefield gaol]]. In her divorce petition, she argued that from the start of her marriage she had maintained her children with her own resources. It was rescinded on the basis of adultery, as she had lived with another man, James Fleet, a meat salesman at Sheffield market, in Glasgow after the divorce nisi, which she mistakenly believed had legally ended her marriage. She married Fleet in 1902, describing herself as a widow, and the couple lived in London and were sellers at [[Covent Garden]] market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1912 she visited the United States of America with her daughter, travelling out on the ocean liner the Carmania and returning on the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=NOTABLE VISITOR ELUDED US.|last=|first=|date=18 February 1912|work=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vitacress, watercress production - geograph.org.uk - 880633.jpg|alt=watercress beds|thumb|Vitacress watercress beds in [[St Mary Bourne]]]]
Because of her success as an entrepreneur and grower, she was known as the Watercress Queen. She was a successful businesswoman in a male-dominated environment, and in 1908 was trading in her own right as a saleswoman of watercress and salad. She diversified her trade, and began supplying, in addition to markets, restaurants, hotels and shops, and gained an almost monopoly of London's watercress market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coventgarden.london/whats-on/eliza-james-watercress-covent-garden|title=The Green Queen {{!}} Covent Garden London|website=www.coventgarden.london|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She founded her company James &amp; Son and from 1908 invested in watercress beds in Hampshire and Surrey, in [[Hurstbourne Priors]] and [[St Mary Bourne]] on the [[Bourne Rivulet|Bourne rivulet]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She leased six acres of watercress beds from the [[Earl of Portsmouth]] in 1908, and again in 1917, this time a further nine acres. Her business suffered from the extensive drought of 1921, for which she had to sink [[Artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] for irrigation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Erskine Henry Bronson''' (September 12, 1844 &amp;ndash; October 19, 1920) was an [[Americans|American]]-born Canadian businessman and political figure. He represented the riding of [[Ottawa (Ontario provincial electoral district)|Ottawa]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1886 to 1898.

He was born in [[Bolton, New York]] in 1844, the son of [[Henry Franklin Bronson]], and came to [[Bytown]] with his family in 1853. Bronson was educated in [[Ottawa]] at the [[Lisgar Collegiate Institute|District Grammar School]] and [[New York City]]. &lt;ref&gt; Lisgar Alumni Association. A History of the Ottawa Collegiate Institute, 1843-1903. 1904. p226.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a partner in the Bronsons and Weston Lumber Company in 1867 and took control of the company when his father died in 1889.

Bronson was president of the Ottawa Power Company, Limited. This resulted from his efforts to diversify the family business.  The power house and power plant at [[Chaudière Falls]] which were erected in 1900 following the [[1900 Hull–Ottawa fire]] were owned by this company.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=22&amp;dat=19201101&amp;id=JRI7AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jCoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=380,21873260&lt;/ref&gt;  Bronson also was responsible for the 1891 construction of Generating Station No. 2 at the falls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4360&lt;/ref&gt;  He, with Gordon B.

'''FOB''', "Free On Board", is a term in [[international commercial law]] specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the [[Incoterms]] standard published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. FOB is only used in non-containerized sea freight or inland waterway transport. As with all Incoterms, FOB does not define the point at which ownership of the goods is transferred.

The term FOB is also used in modern domestic shipping within the United States to describe the point at which a seller is no longer responsible for shipping cost.

Ownership of a cargo is independent from Incoterms. In international trade, ownership of the cargo is defined by the bill of lading or waybill.

==Incoterms==
{{Further|Incoterms}}

Under the [[Incoterms|Incoterms 2010]] standard published by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], FOB is only used in sea freight and stands for "Free On Board". The term is always used in conjunction with a port of loading.&lt;ref name="iccfobpreamble"&gt;{{cite web

Indicating "FOB ''port''{{-"}} means that the seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment, plus loading costs. The buyer pays the cost of [[cargo|marine freight]] transport, [[insurance]], unloading, and transportation from the arrival port to the final destination. The passing of risks occurs when the goods are loaded on board at the port of shipment. For example, "FOB Vancouver" indicates that the seller will pay for transportation of the goods to the port of [[Vancouver]], and the cost of loading the goods on to the cargo ship (this includes inland haulage, customs clearance, origin documentation charges, [[demurrage]] if any, origin port handling charges, in this case Vancouver). The buyer pays for all costs beyond that point, including unloading. Responsibility for the goods is with the seller until the goods are loaded on board the ship. Once the cargo is on board, the buyer assumes the risk.

The use of "FOB" originated in the days of [[sailing ship]]s. When the ICC first wrote their guidelines for the use of the term in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:''Only the most enthusiastic lawyer could watch with satisfaction the spectacle of liabilities shifting uneasily as the cargo sways at the end of a derrick across a notional perpendicular projecting from the ship's rail.''

In the modern era of [[containerization]], the term "ship's rail" is somewhat archaic for trade purposes, as with a sealed shipping container there is no way of establishing when damage occurred after the container has been sealed. The standards have noted this. Incoterms 1990 stated,
:''When the ship's rail serves no practical purpose, such as in the case of roll-on/roll-off or container traffic, the [[Free Carrier|FCA]] term is more appropriate to use.''
Incoterms 2000 adopted the wording,
:''If the parties do not intend to deliver the goods across the ship's rail, the FCA term should be used.''&lt;ref name=iccfobpreamble/&gt;
The phrase ''passing the ship's rail'' is no longer in use, having been dropped from the FOB Incoterm in the 2010 revision.

Due to potential confusion with domestic North American usage of "FOB", it is recommended that the use of Incoterms be explicitly specified, along with the edition of the standard.&lt;ref name="iccfaq"&gt;{{cite web

==North America==
In North America, FOB is written into a sales agreement to determine where the liability responsibility for the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. FOB stands for "Free On Board" or so there is no line item payment by the buyer for the cost of getting the goods onto the transport. There are two possibilities: "FOB origin", or "FOB destination". "FOB origin" means the transfer occurs as soon as the goods are safely on board the transport. "FOB destination" means the transfer occurs the moment the goods are removed from the transport at the destination. "FOB origin" (also sometimes phrased as "FOB shipping" or "FOB shipping point") indicates that the sale is considered complete at the seller's shipping dock, and thus the buyer of the goods is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport. With "FOB destination", the sale is complete at the buyer's doorstep and the seller is responsible for freight costs and liability during transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingcoach.com/terms/F/fob-shipping-point.html |title=FOB shipping point definition |publisher=AccountingCoach.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-319|title=§ 2-319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms.|first=LII|last=Staff|date=20 November 2012|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two terms have a specific meaning in commercial law and cannot be altered. But the FOB terms do not need to be used, and often are not. In this case the specific terms of the agreement can vary widely, in particular which party, buyer or seller, pays for the loading costs and shipment costs, and/or where responsibility for the goods is transferred. The last distinction is important for determining [[legal liability|liability]] or [[risk of loss]] for goods lost or damaged in transit from the seller to the buyer.&lt;ref name=ucc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title=What is the significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination?|
url=http://blog.accountingcoach.com/fob-shipping-point-fob-destination/|
publisher=AccountingCoach, LLC|
date=2006-07-12|
accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a person in [[Miami]] purchasing equipment from a manufacturer in [[Chicago]] could receive a price quote of "$5000 FOB Chicago", which would indicate that the buyer would be responsible for the shipping from Chicago to Miami. If the same seller issued a price quote of "$5000 FOB Miami", then the seller would cover shipping to the buyer's location.

[[International trade|International]] shipments typically use [[#Incoterms|"FOB" as defined by the Incoterms standards]], where it always stands for "Free On Board". Domestic shipments within the United States or Canada often use a different meaning, specific to North America, which is inconsistent with the Incoterms standards.

North American FOB usage corresponds to [[Incoterms]] approximately as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! North America
! Incoterms
|-
| FOB shipping point '''''or''''' FOB shipping point, freight collect
| [[Free Carrier|FCA]] shipping point
|-
| FOB shipping point, freight prepaid
| [[Carriage Paid To|CPT]] destination
|-
| FOB destination '''''or''''' FOB destination, freight prepaid
| [[Delivered at Place|DAP]] destination
|}

A related but separate term "CAP" ("customer-arranged pickup") is used to denote that the buyer will arrange a carrier of their choice to pick the goods up at the seller's premises, and the liability for any damage or loss belongs to the buyer.

Although FOB has long been stated as "''''F'''reight '''O'''n '''B'''oard'" in sales contract terminology, this should be avoided as it does not precisely conform to the meaning of the acronym as specified in the [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]].&lt;ref name=ucc/&gt;

Sometimes FOB is used in sales to retain commission by the outside sales representative. It is unclear where this originated.

== Accounting and auditing (FOB) ==
[[File:Container ship loading-700px.jpg|thumbnail|Container ship loading]]

In the past, the FOB point determined when title transferred for goods. For example, at year- and period-end goods in transit under "FOB destination" ([[#North America|North American usage]]) appear on the seller's balance sheet but not in the buyer's balance sheet, as the risk and rewards of ownership change to the buyer at the "destination" port.

It is much easier to determine when title transfers by referring to the agreed upon terms and conditions of the transaction; typically, title passes with risk of loss. The transfer of title may occur at a different time (or event) than the FOB shipping term. The transfer of title is the element of revenue that determines who owns the goods and the applicable value.

Import fees when they reach the border of one country to enter the other country under the conditions of FOB destination are due at the customs port of the destination country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are FOB Shipping Terms?|url=http://simplestudies.com/what-are-fob-shipping-terms.html|
publisher=Simplestudies LLC|date=2010-02-24|accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[e-commerce]], most commercial electronic transactions occur under the terms of "FOB shipping point" or "[[Free Carrier|FCA]] shipping point".

== "Freight On Board" ==
Some sources claim that FOB stands for "Freight On Board". This is not the case. The term "Freight On Board" is not mentioned in any version of [[Incoterms]], and is not defined by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the USA.&lt;ref name="UCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-319|title=§ 2-319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms.|first=LII|last=Staff|date=20 November 2012|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to that, it has been found in the US court system that "Freight On Board" is not a recognized industry term.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;[http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/SlipOpinions/Slip_op00/00-53.pdf United States Court of International Trade, Quinn v. United States and United States Secretary of the Treasury], May 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term "Freight On Board" in contracts is therefore very likely to cause confusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">'''Fernão Gomes''' (15th century) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] merchant and explorer from [[Lisbon]], the son of Tristão Gomes de Brito (?).

In 1469, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] granted him the [[monopoly]] of trade in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. Besides the payment of an annual rent of 200,000 [[Portuguese real|''reais'']], Gomes was to explore 100 [[league (unit)|league]]s of the coast of [[Africa]] per year, for five years (later the agreement would be extended for another year).&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; He also received a monopoly of trade in [[Aframomum melegueta|guinea pepper]] for another yearly payment of 100,000 ''reais''.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thornr.demon.co.uk/kchrist/discpde.html| title = Descobrimentos após o Príncipe Henrique | accessdate = 2006-12-24| last = Thorn| first = Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Then called "[[Malagueta pepper|malagueta]]", it was a popular substitute for [[black pepper]].)

Gomes employed explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], [[Lopo Gonçalves]], [[Fernão do Pó]] and [[Pedro de Sintra]], He exceeded the requirements of his grant: his expeditions reached the Cape of Santa Catarina, already in the Southern Hemisphere, and also the islands of the Gulf of Guinea.

In 1471 they reached [[Elmina]] (meaning "the Mine"),&lt;ref name="marinha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinha.pt/extra/revista/ra_fev1999/pag21.html |title=O Contrato de Fernão Gomes |accessdate=2006-12-24 |last=Semedo |first=J, de Matos |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020748/http://www.marinha.pt/extra/revista/ra_fev1999/pag21.html |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they found a thriving [[alluvial]] [[gold]] trade. With the substantial revenues he got, especially the trade of his warehouse in Mina, he became known as "'''Fernão Gomes da Mina'''" in 1474.&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilks,Ivor.

With his profits from African trade, Fernão Gomes assisted the Portuguese king in the conquests of [[Conquest of Asilah|Asilah]], [[Alcácer Ceguer]], and [[Tangier]] in Morocco, where he was knighted. Later, in 1478, gathering honors and with an enormous influence on the economy of the kingdom, he was appointed to the royal council.

Given the large profits, in 1482 new King [[John II of Portugal]] ordered a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] to be built in Elmina, to manage the local gold industry: [[Elmina Castle]].&lt;ref name="ghana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanatourism.gov.gh/regions/highlight_detail.asp?id=&amp;rdid=116# |title=Elmina Castle |accessdate=2006-12-24 |publisher=Government of Ghana |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009012322/http://www.ghanatourism.gov.gh/regions/highlight_detail.asp?id=&amp;rdid=116 |archivedate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomes married Catarina Leme, an illegitimate child of the [[Flemish people|Flemish]]-Portuguese merchant Martim Leme. Martin Leme was the son of Martin Lems and his noble Portuguese wife Joana Barroso.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz Gonzaga da Silva Leme, ''Genealogia Paulistana'', Volume II, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children.

A '''fluidized bed reactor''' ('''FBR''') is a type of [[Chemical reactor|reactor]] device that can be used to carry out a variety of [[Phase (matter)|multiphase]] chemical reactions. In this type of reactor, a [[fluid]] (gas or liquid) is passed through a solid [[granular material]] (usually a [[catalyst]] possibly shaped as tiny spheres) at high enough [[velocity|velocities]] to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid. This process, known as [[fluidization]], imparts many important advantages to the FBR. As a result, the fluidized bed reactor is now used in many industrial applications.

[[Image:Fluidized Bed Reactor Graphic.svg|right|300px|thumb|Basic diagram of a fluidized bed reactor]]

==Basic principles==
The solid substrate (the catalytic material upon which chemical species react) material in the fluidized bed reactor is typically supported by a [[porous]] plate, known as a distributor.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;Howard, J. R. (1989). ''Fluidized Bed Technology: Principles and Applications.'' New York, NY: Adam Higler.&lt;/ref&gt; The fluid is then forced through the distributor up through the solid material. At lower fluid velocities, the solids remain in place as the fluid passes through the voids in the material. This is known as a [[packed bed]] reactor. As the fluid velocity is increased, the reactor will reach a stage where the force of the fluid on the solids is enough to balance the weight of the solid material. This stage is known as incipient fluidization and occurs at this minimum fluidization velocity. Once this minimum velocity is surpassed, the contents of the reactor bed begin to expand and swirl around much like an agitated tank or boiling pot of water. The reactor is now a fluidized bed. Depending on the operating conditions and properties of solid phase various flow regimes can be observed in this reactor.

==History and current uses==
Fluidized bed reactors are a relatively new tool in the chemical engineering field. The first fluidized bed gas generator was developed by Fritz Winkler in Germany in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Tavoulareas, S. (1991.) Fluidized-Bed Combustion Technology. **Annual Reviews Inc.** 16, 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first United States fluidized bed reactors used in the petroleum industry was the Catalytic Cracking Unit, created in Baton Rouge, LA in 1942 by the [[Standard Oil Company]] of New Jersey (now [[ExxonMobil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First Commercial Fluid Bed Reactor | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/fluidbedreactor.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This FBR and the many to follow were developed for the oil and petrochemical industries. Here [[catalysts]] were used to reduce petroleum to simpler compounds through a process known as [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]. The invention of this technology made it possible to significantly increase the production of various fuels in the United States.&lt;ref name="third"&gt;Thornhill, D. [http://faculty.washington.edu/finlayso/Fluidized_Bed/ The Fluidized Bed Reactor Page]. Retrieved February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Today fluidized bed reactors are still used to produce gasoline and other fuels, along with many other chemicals. Many industrially produced [[polymers]] are made using FBR technology, such as [[rubber]], [[vinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene]], [[styrenes]], and [[polypropylene]].&lt;ref name="Technology Economics Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/411008|title= Polypropylene Production via Gas Phase Process, Technology Economics Program|publisher=by Intratec, {{ISBN|978-0-615-66694-5}}, Q3 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various utilities also use FBR's for [[coal gasification]], nuclear power plants, and water and waste treatment settings. Used in these applications, fluidized bed reactors allow for a cleaner, more efficient process than previous standard reactor technologies.&lt;ref name="third"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The increase in fluidized bed reactor use in today's industrial world is largely due to the inherent advantages of the technology.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Trambouze, P., &amp; Euzen, J. (2004). ''Chemical Reactors: From Design to Operation.'' (R. Bononno, Trans.). Paris: Editions Technip.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Uniform Particle Mixing:''' Due to the intrinsic fluid-like behavior of the solid material, fluidized beds do not experience poor mixing as in packed beds. This complete mixing allows for a uniform product that can often be hard to achieve in other reactor designs. The elimination of radial and axial concentration [[gradients]] also allows for better fluid-solid contact, which is essential for reaction efficiency and quality.
* '''Uniform Temperature Gradients:''' Many chemical reactions require the addition or removal of heat. Local hot or cold spots within the reaction bed, often a problem in packed beds, are avoided in a fluidized situation such as an FBR. In other reactor types, these local temperature differences, especially hotspots, can result in product degradation. Thus FBRs are well suited to [[exothermic]] reactions. Researchers have also learned that the bed-to-surface [[heat transfer]] coefficients for FBRs are high.
* '''Ability to Operate Reactor in Continuous State:''' The fluidized bed nature of these reactors allows for the ability to continuously withdraw product and introduce new reactants into the reaction vessel. Operating at a [[Continuous production|continuous process]] state allows manufacturers to produce their various products more efficiently due to the removal of startup conditions in [[Batch reactor|batch processes]].

==Disadvantages==
As in any design, the fluidized bed reactor does have it draw-backs, which any reactor designer must take into consideration.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
* '''Increased Reactor Vessel Size:''' Because of the expansion of the bed materials in the reactor, a larger vessel is often required than that for a packed bed reactor. This larger vessel means that more must be spent on initial capital costs.
* '''Pumping Requirements and Pressure Drop:''' The requirement for the fluid to suspend the solid material necessitates that a higher fluid velocity is attained in the reactor. In order to achieve this, more pumping power and thus higher energy costs are needed. In addition, the [[pressure drop]] associated with deep beds also requires additional pumping power.
* '''Particle Entrainment:''' The high gas velocities present in this style of reactor often result in fine particles becoming [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrained]] in the fluid. These captured particles are then carried out of the reactor with the fluid, where they must be separated. This can be a very difficult and expensive problem to address depending on the design and function of the reactor. This may often continue to be a problem even with other entrainment reducing technologies.
* '''Lack of Current Understanding:''' Current understanding of the actual behavior of the materials in a fluidized bed is rather limited. It is very difficult to predict and calculate the complex mass and heat flows within the bed. Due to this lack of understanding, a [[pilot plant]] for new processes is required. Even with pilot plants, the scale-up can be very difficult and may not reflect what was experienced in the pilot trial.
* '''Erosion of Internal Components:''' The fluid-like behavior of the fine solid particles within the bed eventually results in the wear of the reactor vessel. This can require expensive maintenance and upkeep for the reaction vessel and pipes.
* '''Pressure Loss Scenarios:''' If fluidization pressure is suddenly lost, the surface area of the bed may be suddenly reduced.  This can either be an inconvenience (e.g. making bed restart difficult), or may have more serious implications, such as runaway reactions (e.g. for exothermic reactions in which heat transfer is suddenly restricted).

==Current research and trends==
Due to the advantages of fluidized bed reactors, a large amount of research is devoted to this technology. Most current research aims to quantify and explain the behavior of the phase interactions in the bed. Specific research topics include particle size distributions, various transfer coefficients, phase interactions, velocity and pressure effects, and computer modeling.&lt;ref name="fifth"&gt;Arastoopour, H. (Ed.). (1998). ''Fluidization and Fluid Particle Systems: Recent Research and Development.'' New York, NY: American Institute of Chemical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this research is to produce more accurate models of the inner movements and phenomena of the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbasi|first=Mohammad Reza|last2=Shamiri|first2=Ahmad|last3=Hussain|first3=M.A.|title=Dynamic modeling and Molecular Weight Distribution of ethylene copolymerization in an industrial gas-phase Fluidized-Bed Reactor|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921883116300978|journal=Advanced Powder Technology|volume=27|issue=4|pages=1526–1538|doi=10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will enable chemical engineers to design better, more efficient reactors that may effectively deal with the current disadvantages of the technology and expand the range of FBR use.

'''Gas blending''' is the process of mixing [[gas]]es for a specific purpose where the composition of the resulting mixture is specified and controlled.
A wide range of applications include scientific and industrial processes, food production and storage and breathing gases.

Gas mixtures are usually specified in terms of [[Mole fraction|molar gas fraction]] (which is closely approximated by [[volumetric gas fraction]] for many [[permanent gas]]es): by percentage, parts per thousand or parts per million. Volumetric gas fraction converts trivially to partial pressure ratio, following [[Dalton's law of partial pressures]]. Partial pressure blending at constant temperature is computationally simple, and [[pressure measurement]] is relatively inexpensive, but maintaining constant temperature during pressure changes requires significant delays for temperature equalization. Blending by [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] is unaffected by temperature variation during the process, but requires accurate measurement of mass or weight, and calculation of constituent masses from the specified molar ratio. Both partial pressure and mass fraction blending are used in practice.

==Applications==
===Shielding gases for welding===
{{main|Shielding gas}}
[[File:A Kosovan blacksmith demonstrates the tungsten inert gas welding process on a piece of metal at a welding and machine shop at Bagram Airfield in Parwan province, Afghanistan, Aug. 14, 2013 130814-A-YW808-020.jpg|thumb|Tungsten inert gas welding]]
Shielding gases are inert or semi-inert gases used in gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding to protect the weld area from oxygen and water vapour, which can reduce the quality of the weld or make the welding more difficult.

[[Gas metal arc welding]] (GMAW), or metal inert gas (MIG) welding, is a process that uses a continuous wire feed as a consumable electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. &lt;ref name="LE5.43"&gt;Lincoln Electric, p. 5.4-3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (GTAW), or tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable [[tungsten]] electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material.&lt;ref name="Weman31"&gt;Weman, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modified Atmosphere Packaging in the food industry ===
{{main|Modified atmosphere/modified humidity packaging}}
Modified atmosphere packaging is a technology used to preserve the quality of fresh produce so that it can be sold to markets far away from where it is grown, extend the marketing period, and help reduce food waste within the [[cold chain]]. The gas composition used to pack food products depends on the product. A high [[oxygen]] content helps to retain the red colour of meat, while low oxygen reduces mould growth in bread and vegetables.&lt;ref name="applications" /&gt;

===Gas mixtures for brewing===
*[[Sparging (chemistry)|Sparging]]: An inert gas such as nitrogen is bubbled through the wine, which removes the dissolved oxygen. Carbon dioxide is also removed and to ensure that an appropriate amount of carbon dioxide remains, a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide may be used for the sparging gas.&lt;ref name=applications&gt;http://www.gasmixing.com/Gas-mixing-applications.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
*Purging and blanketing: The removal of oxygen from the headspace above the wine in a container by flushing with a similar gas mixture to that used for sparging is called purging, and if it is left there it is called blanketing or inerting.&lt;ref name="applications" /&gt;

===Breathing gas mixtures for diving===
{{see also|Gas blending for scuba diving}}
[[File:Gas blending equipment.JPG|thumb|Partial pressure gas blending equipment for scuba diving]]
A [[breathing gas]] is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. The essential component for any breathing gas is a [[partial pressure]] of [[oxygen]] of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 bar at the [[ambient pressure]]. The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the gas is an anaesthetic mixture. Some of the oxygen in the breathing gas is consumed by the metabolic processes, and the inert components are unchanged, and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration, and are therefore also known as diluent gases.

====Scuba diving====
[[Gas blending for scuba diving]] is the filling of [[diving cylinders]] with non-air breathing gases such as [[nitrox]], [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] and [[heliox]]. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall safety of the planned dive, by reducing the risk of [[decompression sickness]] and/or [[nitrogen narcosis]], and may improve [[Work of breathing|ease of breathing]].

====Surface supplied and saturation diving====
Gas blending for [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]] and [[saturation diving]] may include the filling of bulk [[Gas cylinder|storage cylinders]] and [[bailout cylinder]]s with breathing gases, but it also involves the mixing of breathing gases at lower pressure which are supplied directly to the diver or to the [[Saturation diving#Life support systems|hyperbaric life-support system]]. Part of the operation of the life-support system is the replenishment of oxygen used by the occupants, and removal of the carbon dioxide waste product by the gas conditioning unit. This entails monitoring of the composition of the chamber gas and periodic addition of oxygen to the chamber gas at the internal pressure of the chamber.

The gas mixing unit is part of the life support equipment of a saturation system, along with other components which may include bulk gas storage, compressors, helium recovey unit, bell and diver hot water supply, gas conditioning unit and emergency power supply&lt;ref name="P D Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bevan, John|title=The Professional Divers's Handbook|edition=second|year=2005|publisher=Submex Ltd|location=5 Nepean Close, Alverstoke, GOSPORT, Hampshire PO12 2BH |isbn= 978-0950824260|page=242|chapter=Section 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical gas mixtures===
[[File:Latex-free project 111.jpg|thumb|Anesthetic machine]]
The [[anesthetic machine]] is used to blend breathing gas for patients under anesthesia during surgery. The gas mixing and delivery system lets the anesthetist control oxygen fraction, nitrous oxide concentration and the concentration of volatile anesthetic agents.&lt;ref name="Anesthetic Machine"&gt;The Anaesthetic Machine - Gas mixing systems http://www.anaesthesia.med.usyd.edu.au/resources/lectures/gas_supplies_clt/gasmixing.html &lt;/ref&gt;
The machine is usually supplied with oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from low pressure lines and high pressure reserve cylinders, and the metered gas is mixed at ambient pressure, after which additional anesthetic agents may be added by a vaporizer, and the gas may be humidified. Air is used as a diluent to decrease oxygen concentration. In special cases other gases may also be added to the mixture. These may include carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), used to stimulate respiration, and helium (He) to reduce resistance to flow or to enhance heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;The biomedical engineering handbook. 2nd edition edited by Joseph D. Bronzino. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2000 
https://books.google.com/books?id=6bK84ZHFuW4C&amp;pg=SA84-PA2&amp;lpg=SA84-PA2&amp;dq=Anesthetic+Gas+blending&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_aYjACYME3&amp;sig=C-iBO52-lWzNlMWuIeT7Cjp05LA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pvj4U8fOI6fZ0QWFlYGgCQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anesthetic%20Gas%20blending&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas mixing systems may be mechanical, using conventional rotameter banks, or electronic, using proportional solenoids or pulsed injectors, and control may be manual or automatic.&lt;ref name="Anesthetic Machine" /&gt;

===Chemical production processes===
Providing reactive gaseous materials for chemical production processes in the required ratio

===Controlled atmosphere manufacture and storage===
Protective gas mixtures may be used to exclude air or other gases from the surface of sensitive materials during processing.
Examples include melting of reactive metals such as magnesium, and heat treatment of steels.

===Customized gas mixtures for analytical applications===
'''[[Calibration gas]]es:''' 
*Span gases are used for testing and calibrating gas detection equipment by exposing the sensor to a known concentration of a contaminant. The gases are used as a reference point to ensure correct readings after calibration and have very accurate composition, with a content of the gas to be detected close to the set value for the detector. 
*Zero gas is normally a gas free of the component to be measured, and as similar as practicable to the composition of the gas to be monitored, used to calibrate the zero point of the sensor. 

Calibration gas mixtures are generally produced in batches by gravimetric or volumetric methods.

The gravimetric method uses sensitive and accurately calibrated scales to weigh the amounts of gases added into the cylinder. Precise measurement is required as inaccuracy or impurities can result in incorrect calibration. The container for calibration gas must be as close to perfectly clean as practicable. The cylinders may be cleaned by purging with high purity nitrogen, the vacuumed. For particularly critical mixtures the cylinder may be heated while being vacuumed to facilitate removal of any impurities adhering to the walls.&lt;ref name="Span gases"&gt;Staff, Wilhelmsen Ships Service: "Span gases" http://www.wilhelmsen.com/services/maritime/companies/buss/BUSS_Pressroom/Documents/Span%20Gases.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

After filling, the gas mixture must be thoroughly mixed to ensure that all components are evenly distributed throughout the container to prevent possible variations on composition within the container. This is commonly done by rolling the container horizontally for 2 to 4 hours.&lt;ref name="Span gases"/&gt;

==Methods==
Several methods are available for gas blending. These may be distinguished as batch methods and continuous processes.

===Batch methods===
Batch gas blending requires the appropriate amounts of the constituent gases to be measured and mixed together until the mixture is homogenous. The amounts are based on the mole (or molar) fractions, but measured either by volume or by mass. Volume measurement may be done indirectly by partial pressure, as the gases are often sequentially decanted into the same container for mixing, and therefore occupy the same volume. Weight measurement is generally used as a proxy for mass measurement as acceleration can usually be considered constant.

The mole fraction is also called the amount fraction, and is the number of molecules of a constituent divided by the total number of all molecules in the mixture. For example, a 50% oxygen, 50% helium mixture will contain approximately the same number of molecules of oxygen and helium.  As both oxygen and helium approximate ideal gases at pressures below 200&amp;nbsp; bar, each will occupy the same volume at the same pressure and temperature, so they can be measured by volume at the same pressure, then mixed, or by partial pressure when decanted into the same container. 

The mass fraction can be calculated from the molar fraction by multiplying the molar fraction by the [[molecular mass]] for each constituent, to find a constituent mass, and comparing it to the summed masses of all the constituents. The actual mass of each constituent needed for a mixture is calculated by multiplying the mass fraction by the desired mass of the mixture.

====Partial pressure blending====
Also known as volumetric blending. This must be done at constant temperature for best accuracy, though it is possible to compensate for temperature changes in proportion to the accuracy of the temperature measured before and after each gas is added to the mixture.

Partial pressure blending is commonly used for breathing gases for diving. The accuracy required for this application can be achieved by using a pressure gauge which reads accurately to 0.5&amp;nbsp;bar, and allowing the temperature to equilibrate after each gas is added.

====Mass fraction blending====
Also known as gravimetric blending. This is relatively unaffected by temperature, and accuracy depends on the accuracy of mass measurement of the constituents.

Mass fraction blending is used where great accuracy of the mixture is critical, such as in calibration gases. The method is not suited to moving platforms where the accelerations can cause inaccurate measurement, and therefore is unsuitable for mixing diving gases on vessels.

===Continuous processes===
====Additive====
[[File:Nitrox blending station P8026593.JPG|thumb|Nitrox blending station using continuous flow blending before compression]]
[[File:Nirox mixing tube P8046744.JPG|thumb|Nitrox blending tube for mixing oxygen into the intake air for a compressor]]
*Constant flow blending – a controlled flow of the constituent gases is mixed to form the product. Blending may occur at ambient pressure or at a pressure setting above ambient but lower than supply gas pressures.
**Constant mass flow supply: Precision mass flow controllers are used to control the flow rate of each gas for blending. Mass flow meters may be installed on the outputs of the mass flow controllers to monitor the output. The gases may be passed through a static mixer to ensure homogenous output.
Continuous gas blending is used for some surface supplied diving applications, and for many chemical processes using reactive gas mixtures, particularly where there may be a need to alter the mixture during the operation or process.

====Subtractive====
These processes start with a mixture of gases, usually air, and reduce the concentration of one or more of the constituents. These processes can be used for the production of [[Nitrox]] for scuba diving and deoxygenated air for blanketing purposes.
*[[Pressure swing adsorption]] – Selective adsorption of gas on a medium which is reversible and proportional to pressure. Gas is loaded onto the medium during the high pressure phase and is released during the low pressure phase.
*[[Membrane gas separation]] – Gas is forced through a semi-permeable membrane by a pressure difference. Some of the constituent gases pass through the membrane more easily than the others, and the output from the low pressure side is enriched with the gases which pass through more easily. Gases which are slower to pass through the membrane accumulate on the high pressure side and are continuously discharged to retain a steady concentration. The process may be repeated in several stages to increase concentrations.

The agency did work for the Helmsley Hotel group, and was hired — and fired — by hotelier [[Leona Helmsley]] on four separate occasions. Beber had to file suit on three occasions to get paid. In one of the firm's first meetings with Helmsley, Beber's conversation was interrupted by a call Mrs. Helmsley took from a hotel guest who had been dissatisfied with a noisy air conditioning unit, and they spoke about Helmsley's frustration with the inadequate quality of the towels the hotel provided.&lt;ref&gt;Kanner, Bernice.

Accessed September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Beber used the conversation as the impetus to develop a campaign for Helmsley that featured her as "Queen of the Palace", carefully watching over every detail at the Harley Hotel in [[Manhattan]].

Accessed September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Helmsley fired Beber  four different times: once,  in order to handle advertising internally; again after Beber added [[Donald Trump]] as a client; next, when she blamed Beber's ad campaign for raising her profile leading to her tax evasion conviction; finally, when Helmsley found out that a man to whom Beber had introduced her (and in whom Helmsley had been romantically interested) turned out to be gay.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; After one {{which|date=December 2010}} of the firings, Helmsley told an interviewer that "You could say I gave her the royal flush".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; When the firm was rehired after Helmsley's income tax evasion conviction, Beber developed the slogan "Say what you will, she runs a helluva hotel."&lt;ref name=SunSentinel/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1874">[[File:Leontief.png|thumbnail|right|Two input Leontief Production Function with [[isoquants]]]]

In [[economics]], the '''Leontief production function''' or '''fixed proportions production function''' is a [[production function]] that implies the [[factors of production]] will be used in fixed (technologically pre-determined) proportions, as there is no [[substitute good|substitutability]] between factors. It was named after [[Wassily Leontief]] and represents a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of the [[constant elasticity of substitution]] production function.

For the simple case of a good that is produced with two inputs, the function is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;q = \text{Min}\left(\frac{z_1}{a},\frac{z_2}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is the quantity of output produced, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the utilised quantities of input 1 and input 2 respectively, and ''a'' and ''b'' are technologically determined constants.

==Example==

Suppose that the intermediate goods "tires" and "steering wheels" are used in the production of automobiles (for simplicity of the example, to the exclusion of anything else). Then in the above formula ''q'' refers to the number of automobiles produced, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the number of tires used, and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the number of steering wheels used. Assuming each car is produced with 4 tires and 1 steering wheel, the Leontief production function is

:Number of cars = Min{¼  times the number of tires, 1 times the number of steering wheels}.

==Facility==
The multi-purpose facility contains an exhibition mall for art, crafts and boat shows, a family picnic and playground area, and an earthen "bowl" with a performance pavilion which has a capacity of 10,000 persons and is home to many annual events, including The [[Jacksonville Jazz Festival]], [[World of Nations Celebration]], Spring Music Festival, Freedom, Fanfare &amp; Fireworks on July 4, [[Planetfest]] and many more. The [[Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra]] occasionally performs there, as have many nationally known entertainers.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;&lt;ref name=SCENE&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Park|url=http://www.makeascenedowntown.com/Metropolitan-Park.aspx|publisher=Office of Special Events|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary facility is a {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} reversible stage with seating for 3,000 under the large canopy. There is a [[green room]], production office and dressing rooms for performers. The park has full boat docking facilities with 78 boat slips.  
There are 6 covered picnic shelters and 43 picnic tables, 3 permanent restroom facilities and water fountains, a children's play area, grills, benches &amp; bicycle racks, and security lighting for night use.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;&lt;ref name=SCENE /&gt;

==History==
The park is located on what was once a landfill, purchased in May, 1972 for $1 million by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. 
The present park size is the result of several additions since the initial acquisition in 1972.&lt;ref name=HISTORY&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Park History|url=http://www.coj.net/departments/recreation-and-community-services/recreation-and-community-programming/parks/metropolitan-park.aspx|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development funding was provided by the City of Jacksonville, the State of Florida-Department of Natural Resources, and public broadcasting station [[WJCT (TV)]]. The project was planned to be completed in two phases. The first phase included an exhibition mall, family picnic area, playgrounds, and the Performance Pavilion. Florida Governor [[Bob Graham]] attended the groundbreaking for the first phase, begun on December 8, 1982 by Mayor [[Jake Godbold]]. Work on Phase 1 was completed in 1984 at a cost of $1 million. Metropolitan Park was the winner of the 1986 ''Governor's Design Award''.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;

Phase 2, which included paved walkways, lighting, landscaping, parking, and the entrance, cost another $1 million. Mayor [[Tommy Hazouri]] began the enhancements on May 10, 1990 and construction lasted several months.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;
The [[Catherine Street Fire Museum]] was moved to Metro Park property in 1993 but did not open to the public until 2001.

On November 15, 2008, 40 citizens from Jacksonville were joined by [[landscape architect]]s and professional [[urban planner]]s in a [[Charrette]], a community visioning exercise for the future direction of Metropolitan Park. JaxPride, a nonprofit citizen coalition, sponsored the workshop, and the process was used previously on the ''Hemming Park'' to ''[[Hemming Plaza]]'' transition and several others. The director of the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission told the participants how his agency viewed the park and afterwards, [[John Peyton (U.S. politician)|Mayor John Peyton]] shared his thoughts:&lt;ref name=ACTION&gt;{{cite news|last=Marbut|first=Max|title=Creating an action plan for the future of Metropolitan Park|url=http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=51278&amp;text=Charrette&amp;type=oneormoreofthesewords|work=November 20, 2008|publisher=Jax Daily Record|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not proud of the quality of this City-owned facility. What we currently have is a grade-A space with grade-D facilities. There's more chain-link fence in that park than anywhere in Jacksonville. People in Seattle would give their right arm to have a riverfront park. I'm going to do everything in my power in the next 31 months until I leave office to make Metropolitan Park a better place for all of us.&lt;ref name=ACTION /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The City of Jacksonville contracted with consulting firm [[HDR, Inc.]] to submit a preliminary ''Metropolitan Park Improvement Project'' Master Plan to the City by the end of January, 2009. HDR staff collected hundreds of pages of suggestions, comments, sketches, drawings and ideas from the charrette to review and use in the plan.&lt;ref name=ACTION /&gt;

[[Image:KidsKampusLogo.png|left|150px]]
Community leaders created the ''Metropolitan Park Kids Kampus Task Force'' in the 1990s to provide input for a new children's play area with physical, intellectual and social benefits. Educators were utilized to design structures and activities that allow children to be curious, explore and manipulate their physical environment.&lt;ref name=PARK&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids Kampus|url=http://jacksonvillesnorthside.info/wordpress/downloadfiles/32202parks.pdf|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=11 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Construction began on '''Kids Kampus''' March 8, 2000, and the 10-acre facility, located beside Metro Park, opened March 6, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coj.net/Departments/Recreation+and+Community+Services/Recreation+and+Community+Programming/Recreation+Activities/Kids+Kampus/default.htm |title=City of Jacksonville website: Kids Kampus |access-date=2008-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024014944/http://coj.net/Departments/Recreation+and+Community+Services/Recreation+and+Community+Programming/Recreation+Activities/Kids+Kampus/default.htm |archive-date=2007-10-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The park included a soccer field with bleachers, 10 Picnic shelters and individual picnic tables, grills, playground equipment, benches, bike racks, security lighting and a restroom. The largest attraction was a bicycle/tricycle driving range, modeled after downtown Jacksonville, including street signs, traffic signals and buildings.&lt;ref name=PARK /&gt;&lt;ref name=FUN&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids Kampus - Jacksonville|url=http://www.north-florida-family-fun-guide.com/kids-kampus.html|publisher=North Florida Family Fun Guide|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;       
The seasonal water park at Kids Kampus featured "Three Friends", a boat-shaped structure with water cannons and a slide; and "Bayou, Bogs &amp; Frogs" for children under six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Devon|title=Kids Kampus|url=http://jacksonville.about.com/od/thingstodo/tp/Top-Ways-to-Cool-Down-in-Jax.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614140225/http://jacksonville.about.com/od/thingstodo/tp/Top-Ways-to-Cool-Down-in-Jax.htm|archive-date=14 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2010, JaxParks announced that the Splash Water Park at Kids Kampus would not open for 2010 due to impending demolition as part of Metropolitan Park renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JaxParks Announces Changes to Kids Kampus|url=http://www.coj.net/departments/central-operations/public-information/headlines/jaxparks-announces-changes-to-kids-kampus.aspx|work=May 5, 2010|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That announcement did not explicitly state that Kids Kampus would not return, but the Metro Jacksonville website noted that the Metropolitan Park Concept Plan included a small "Children's Discovery" area and the "Green" where the Kids Kampus was previously located.&lt;ref name=VANISH&gt;{{cite news|title=Kids Kampus Vanishes|url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2011-sep-kids-kampus-vanishes|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 9, 2011, all traces of Kids Kampus had been removed and the area is now a grassy field.&lt;ref name="VANISH"/&gt;

A meeting was held in January, 2010 between Mayor Peyton and several city councilmen to discuss progress on three major downtown improvement projects, including redevelopment of Metropolitan Park. Legislation was filed to fund these three projects with a price tag of $23 million. $8.2 million was allocated to phase one of the Metropolitan Park redevelopment which included replacing the Kidz Kampus children's play area with better water features and access to the Fire Museum; removing fencing and other barriers to river access; and creating a 4-acre public lawn for a wide array of activities, and to include more picnic pavilions and shade trees.&lt;ref name=KEY&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayor and City Council Members Discuss Implementation of Key Downtown Projects|url=http://www.coj.net/departments/central-operations/public-information/headlines/mayor-and-city-council-members-discuss-implementat.aspx|work=January 8, 2010|publisher=City of Jacksonville|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor Pitches Downtown Parks Overhaul|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/Mayor-Pitches-Downtown-Parks-Overhaul/-/475880/2020776/-/22hr2xz/-/index.html|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=News4Jax|date=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2010 the city council passed the three bills without debate, providing final approval for all three projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Tia|title=Jacksonville council OKs downtown projects|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-02-09/story/jacksonville_council_oks_downtown_projects|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cordúa was born in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]] and later moved to Houston, Texas. He graduated with a degree in [[Economic]]s and [[Finance]] from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="AMC"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Michael Cordua |url=http://www.cordua.com/cordua.cfm?a=cms,c,30,5,29 |work=Cordua.com |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817055151/http://www.cordua.com/cordua.cfm?a=cms%2Cc%2C30%2C5%2C29 |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordúa worked for a Houston shipping firm until it was liquidated in the late 1980s. After arriving in Houston, Cordúa taught himself to cook, he has said  "The whole reason I got into cooking was because I missed the foods from home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Chef: Michael Cordua |url=http://www.squaremeals.org/vgn/tda/files/2348/8688_Healthy_Helpings.pdf |work=SquareMeals.org |pages=9 |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009161541/http://www.squaremeals.org/vgn/tda/files/2348/8688_Healthy_Helpings.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named honorary consul of Nicaragua in Houston in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Johnny |last=Cajina |title=Nicas discuten Cafta en Houston |url=http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2004/agosto/08/nacionales/nacionales-20040808-05.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717011826/http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2004/agosto/08/nacionales/nacionales-20040808-05.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-17 |work=La Prensa |accessdate=2007-10-21 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordúa married  his Nicaraguan sweetheart Lucia in 1980 and has 4 children David, Michelle, Elisa, and Cristina.&lt;ref name="HC"/&gt;

==Career==
Cordúa, with inspiration from his uncle's restaurant in Managua and despite having no previous experience in the restaurant business, opened his first 130-seat restaurant, ''Churrascos'', on August 8, 1988.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt; Churrascos was an upscale South American-style restaurant. Four months in, Cordúa was ready to give up due to the restaurant losing money. Many critics, such as the [[New York Times]], praised the new restaurant and in 1989 Churrascos was listed in [[Esquire magazine]]'s "Best New Restaurants in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ron |last=Ruggles |title=Americas' fare unites 'continental' divide - international cuisine |url=http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n42_v27/ai_14567673 |work=Nation's Restaurant News |pages=1 |accessdate=2007-10-21 |year=1993 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Smith, a banker from First National Bank, decided to help him expand after eating at his restaurant. Cordúa took the help and opened a second Churrascos near the downtown Houston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claire | last=Poole |title=Pass the Chimichurri - Michael Cordua, owner of Churrascos talks of rising popularity of "Nuevo Latino" cuisine | year=1993 |url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BEK/is_11_7/ai_56899206/pg_1 | work =Latin Trade | pages = 1| accessdate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second 175-seat Churrascos was opened in 1990 and emphasized a Central American [[churrasco]] that made up half of its sales. In 1997 Cordúa opened a third Churrascos in [[Chicago]]. It received great reviews from [[critics]], however, after 8 months it closed down when Cordúas partner backed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claire | last=Poole |title=Pass the Chimichurri - Michael Cordua, owner of Churrascos talks of rising popularity of "Nuevo Latino" cuisine | year=1993 |url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BEK/is_11_7/ai_56899206/pg_2 | work =Latin Trade | pages = 2 | accessdate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cordúa went on to open 3 other [[restaurant]]s; Américas in 1993, Amazón Grill in 1999 (2 locations) and Artista in 2002, all of which have received various awards.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt; Cordúa opened another location for his Américas restaurant in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cordúa Wins Big at 14th Annual Houston Culinary Awards |url=http://www.thewoodlandscvb.com/news/_2010/10-October/October14americas.asp |publisher=The Woodlands Convention and Visitors Bureau |accessdate=22 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222201444/http://thewoodlandscvb.com/news/_2010/10-October/October14americas.asp |archivedate=22 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and also owns a [[catering]] company, Cordúa  catering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best New Chefs (1994): Michael Cordua |url =http://www.foodandwine.com/bestnewchefs/?year=1994&amp;chef=5C80EAAE-32FF-41CE-972B9B30E9487B37 | work =Food and Wine | accessdate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Cordúa and his restaurants have received much recognition and many awards throughout the years. He was named by [[Food &amp; Wine]] as one of America's ''"Top Ten Chefs"'' and is received the Robert Mondavi Award for Culinary Excellence in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chef Michael Cordua |url=http://www.txbeef.org/chef.php3?993744620 |work=TxBeef.org |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018085327/http://txbeef.org/chef.php3?993744620 |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Cordua |url=http://www.texaswineandfood.org/participant_details.php?pid=1181&amp;ptid=6 |work=Texas Wine and Foods |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304021657/http://www.texaswineandfood.org/participant_details.php?pid=1181&amp;ptid=6 |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His restaurant, Churrascos, was named Best South American Restaurant by the [[Houston Press]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7443">'''Rustomjee Jivanji Ghorkhodu''' (1861 – 14 November 1924), commonly known as '''Parsee Rustomjee''', and by various orthographic variations including '''Parsi Rustomji''' and affectionately referred to as '''Kakaji''',&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuDYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP233|title=Gandhiji in South Africa|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|isbn=978-81-8430-528-9|pages=233–|author=M.K. Gandhi|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Indian South Africans|Indian-South African]] philanthropist and businessman, well known for his close mentorship, guidance and financial sponsorship of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during [[Mahatma Gandhi#Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)|his time in South Africa]] from 1893–1914.

Rustomjee was the largest South African contributor to the [[satyagraha]] (non-violent resistance). His various philanthropic deeds include establishing the Indian hospital in Durban; the M. K. Gandhi Library and Parsee Rustomjee Hall; Parsee Rustomjee Orphanage; M. K. Gandhi Tamil School; an orphanage connected with the Mosque at Umgeni; an Indian orphanage of the Roman Catholic Church; and part of the cost of a Methodist day school. He also supported several projects of Gandhi in India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is a [[primary school]] in [[Merebank, KwaZulu-Natal]] bearing his name.

== Early life ==
Rustomjee was born in India in 1861 to an Orthodox [[Parsi]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] family. His surname Ghorkhodu translates from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/Conversion_in_Zorastrianism_A_Myth_exploded.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 'grave-digger' indicating it was potentially the profession of an ancestor which is surprising due to [[Tower of Silence|Zoroastrian funerary customs]] which explicitly forbid burial practices. It has also been proposed that his ancestral surname Ghorkhodu is allegorical, owing to Parsi humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W-f3sgEACAAJ&amp;dq=argument+for+acceptance+kersey&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3afc1IXcAhVICcAKHcDCDsgQ6AEIKzAB|title=The Argument for Acceptance in Zoroastrianism|last=Antia|first=Kersey H.|date=2012-09-03|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781466363335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustomjee arrived in [[Durban]] aged seventeen. Initially he worked for an [[aerated water]] company but later became an influential businessmen and political leader.

== Later life and relations with Gandhi ==
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Rustomjee soon became close associates soon after Gandhi's arrival in 1893. On August 22, 1894 he co-founded the [[Natal Indian Congress]] (NIC) as a Vice-President. Meetings of the NIC were often held at his shop on Field Street, sometimes amongst sacks of grain and bottles of pickle.&lt;ref name="Gandhi before India"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gandhi before India|last=|first=|date=16 March 2015|publisher=Vintage Books|year=|isbn=978-0-385-53230-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi and his young family were given shelter at Rustomjee's house on January 13, 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandhi-manibhavan.org/gandhicomesalive/comesalive_associates_southafrica.htm#Rustomjee,%20Parsee|title=Gandhiji's Associates in South Africa|website=www.gandhi-manibhavan.org|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a mob of Europeans attacked Gandhi. Rustomjee and his property were threatened by the mob but he was unrelenting in his support for Gandhi.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/rustomjee-jiwanji-ghorkhodu|title=Rustomjee Jiwanji Ghorkhodu|last=sahoboss|date=2013-01-22|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Shapurji Randeria, Dawad Mahomed, N. C. Anglia and others he tested his domiciliary rights in Transvaal in August 1908. He crossed into the Transvaal by rail to protest the [[Racialization|racialist]] Immigration Restriction acts including the [[Transvaal Asiatic Registration Act]]. He was arrested on the 27th of August and ordered to leave the colony,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but recorded the border and was sentenced to three months of hard labour.

Rustomjee described himself in the Court at [[Volksrust]] as a general merchant in Natal, where he was a considerable property owner with large business interests throughout [[South Africa]]. He also considered himself to have vested rights as a pre-war resident of the Transvaal. Unusually for a South African-Indian he was a Parliamentary voter registered in Natal. He said he initially arrived in the Transvaal in 1893 and owned three properties there which had been expropriated by the Johannesburg municipality in 1904. His financial affairs in the Transvaal had then been conducted by Gandhi. Owing to his Parsi ethnicity he was exempt from the registration certificates required by the Dutch government and he had been exempted from the necessity of taking a registration certificate under the Dutch government.

On 11 February 1909, he was sentenced to sixth months of hard labour for refusing to give his thumbprints and sentenced again on 11 August 1909, to six months of hard labour.

Gandhi visited him in prison in December 1909 and gravely reported that Rustomjee health was weakening. He walked about with an eye-shade, his sight being affected, he complained of side ache and constitutional disease. In prison Rustomjee lost over seventy lbs. Rustomjee visited Durban in February 1910 to recuperate from his illness. He was greeted by some five hundred people at Durban station and more as he returned home. At his premises on Field Street, he gave a rousing speech arguing the honour of India was threatened.

Despite his stay in Transvaal prisons, Rustomjee insisted on joining a group of resisters from the [[Phoenix Settlement]] (to which he had been a major financial benefactor). This included [[Kasturba Gandhi]], who had started the third phase of the [[satyagraha]] on 15 September 1913. The fifteen satyagrahis crossed the border at Transvaal  and were sentenced on 23 September to three months with hard labour.

Rustomjee suffered great persecution during his imprisonment at the Pietermaritzburg jail. He was deprived of his Zoroastrian girdle ([[kushti]]) and undershirt ([[sedreh]]). Rustomjee went on a [[hunger strike]] until these were restored back to his possession. He was eventually given back his girdle and undershirt after protests in both India and South Africa. Rustomjee was also moved to Durban prison where he was assaulted twice by 'native' warders.

In total he served 18 months in prison during the satyagraha, all with hard labour, at the prisons in Volksrust, [[Heidelberg, Gauteng|Heidelberg]], [[Diepkloof]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Pietermaritzburg]] and [[Durban]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25754">'''Public Service Motivation''' ('''PSM''') is an attribute of government and non-governmental organization ([[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]) employment that explains why individuals have a desire to serve the public and link their personal actions with the overall public interest. Understanding the theory and practice of PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for more financially lucrative careers in the private sector.

== Common Models  ==
=== How Public Service Motivation (PSM) is Used  ===
PSM helps employees get the most out of their job experience and is rapidly evolving to work towards employee goals and company needs effectively. Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as how those that do work in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team’s success and productivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GOTTFREDSON|first1=R. K |title=How to get YOUR TEAMS to work |journal=Industrial Management|date=2015 |volume=57 |issue=4 |page=28 in pages 25–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards.

=== Perry’s Public Service Motivation Scale ===
Public Service Motivation serves to provide the general public with an idea of what motivates individuals to choose career paths within the public sector as opposed to the private. Previous research emphasized that PSM was influenced by various social and political factors that ultimately drive employees to take an interest in the public sector. The history and concept of public service motivation has been studied by authors who contributed to the understanding of the practice itself such as Perry and Wise who coined the term PSM in 1990, and other political figures such as Woodrow Wilson who founded the field of Public Administration. Perry and Wise stated that PSM is often influenced by various social, political, and institutional factors and failure on the organization's part to recognize the motivation of its employees could lead to the discouragement of such individuals from the public sector.

=== Mission Valence ===
Mission Valence can be viewed as an employee’s perception of the attractiveness or salience of an organization’s purpose or social contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=dd80fc18-7fce-4698-aeb3-a60b2afd4d8b%40sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4105|title = Pulling the Levers: Transformational Leadership, Public Service Motivation, and Mission Valence|last = Wright, Bradley E., Moynihan, Donald P., Pandey, Sanjay K.|date = March–April 2012|journal = Public Administration Review. Vol. 72 Issue 2, P206-215. 10p. 1 Diagram, 1 Chart.|volume = 72|issue = 2|pages = 206–215|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02496.x|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission Valence is a concept formulated by Rainey and Steinbauer in 1999 that serves to provide a better understanding of what compels an employee to uphold and achieve goals within their organization. Mission Valence enhances the satisfaction that an individual experiences or anticipates to receive from advancing the organizational mission, and in turn, it has the "potential to influence the ability of the organization to recruit, retain, and motivate its employees."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ultimately, linking the organization’s mission to the values and characteristics of the employee can increase the potential effects of PSM as members of the organization become committed to its success. Rainey and Steinbauer attribute mission valence to enhancing the satisfaction of an employee when the organization’s mission or goal is achieved thus giving the employer the ability to motivate his or her employees and seek their retention. With the desire to help others, public employees are more likely to seek employment within a public organization because the particular mission of that organization often aligns with their own personal values. Previous studies enhance the notion that leadership along with effective management can increase employee mission valence through its ability to promote public service motivation.

=== Transformational Leadership ===
{{Main|Transformational leadership}}
Transformational leadership moves away from a traditional management perspective that is based on self-interest and the exchanging of rewards for positive performance, and instead proposes the ideology of value based leadership to inspire and thus motivate employees. Although value based leadership is not new to the scope of public management, it is important to understand the evolution of how employers communicate the vision of the organization’s purpose to their employees. Transformational leadership can motivate employees by appealing to their ideals and moral values, which in turn leads to a more effective and meaningful work environment. Transformational leaders create shared organizational value through "inspirational communication, ongoing practices, setting meaningful goals and designating significant work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=97a0cead-a156-46fe-91ed-29d496d045a5%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4105|title = Transformational Leadership and Public Service Motivation: Driving Individual and Organizational Performance |last = Paarlberg Laurie E, Lavigna, Bob |date = September–October 2010|journal = Public Administration Review. Vol. 70 Issue 5, P710-718. 9p. 1 Chart|volume = 70 |issue = 5 |pages = 710–718 |doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02199.x|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paarlberg and Lavigna exclaim that linking transformational leadership and public service motivation to human resource management strategies will not radically improve the outcome of the workplace, but rather steadily transform management practices to garner the best organizational outcome to better motivate public sector employees.

=== The Role of Organizations in Promoting PSM ===
The impact of organizational institutions can either have a positive or negative ramifications on the motivational attitude of employees. According to Perry and Wise, whose theories contributed to the understanding of the ongoing relationship between one's overall motivation and the public interest, provided the widely accepted definition of PSM as an individual’s "predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ddcb9dec-7de2-4c7e-81a6-b93e2e097e66%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title = The Role of Organizations in Fostering Public Service Motivation|last = Moynihan, Donald P., Pandey, Sanjay K.|date = January–February 2007|journal = Public Administration Review, 1/1/2007, Vol. 67, Issue 1, P. 40-53|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, organizations have the duty and responsibility to foster an environment that allows employees to feel as if they are able to contribute to the general welfare of the public and can achieve their goals. Various scholars and researchers emphasize the role of organizations as an important aspect of PSM and indicate several factors that face employees on a regular basis that could either promote or hinder PSM. Perry and Wise specify those factors of an organization that influence PSM to include culture within an organization which can negatively be associated with PSM as hierarchical cultures tend to emphasize rule-based control of employees and bureaucratic personality,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; employees that experience red tape who often are characterized with lower levels of PSM as red tape includes rules regulations, and procedures that remain in force and entail a compliance burden, but do not advance the legitimate purposes the rules were intended to serve.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Employees who had a lower level of job satisfaction were reported as more willing to tolerate red tape as opposed to those employees characterized with higher levels of PSM who were frustrated with the limitations of such constrictions. Educational level of organizational members reportedly had a positive relationship on the overall level of PSM of the individual. Wright, Pandey, and Moynihan emphasize that it is vital that organizational leaders understand the various factors that affect PSM in order help employees achieve their goals within the organization and provide for a better work environment.

=== Fields ===
Early authors in the field of public administration described differences between public and private employees and concerns over motivating public sector employees.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Perry|first=James L. |author2=Hondeghem, Annie |year=2008 |chapter=Editors' Introduction |editor=Perry, James L. |editor2=Hondeghem, Annie |title=Motivation in public management: The call of public service |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=2 |isbn=978-0-19-923403-5 }} citing de Tocqueville, Alexis (1856) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t3kw6j47x;view=1up;seq=7 ''L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution''] and Weber, Max (1922) [https://archive.org/details/wirtschaftundges00webeuoft/ ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft''].&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Van Riper described the issue in his 1952 history of the U.S. [[civil service]] system.&lt;ref name="Riper1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul P.

=== Formulation ===
The concept of Public Service Motivation was formalized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by authors like Buchanan, Mosher, Perry, Porter, and Rainey;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce|title=Red-Tape and the Service Ethic Some Unexpected Differences Between Public and Private Managers|journal=Administration &amp; Society|year=1975|volume=6|issue=4|pages=423–444|doi=10.1177/009539977500600403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mosher1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosher|first=Frederick C.|title=Democracy and the Public Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=psT07f8bcxUC|accessdate=14 December 2012|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-503018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=James L.|author2=Porter, Lyman W.  |title=Factors Affecting the Context for Motivation in Public Organizations|journal=The Academy of Management Review|date=January 1982|volume=7|issue=1 |pages=89–98|jstor=257252 |doi=10.5465/AMR.1982.4285475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rainey|first=H.G.|title=Reward Preferences among Public and Private Managers: In Search of the Service Ethic|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|year=1982|volume=16|issue=4|pages=288–302|doi=10.1177/027507408201600402}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term was officially coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Perry, James L.  |author2=Wise, Lois Recascino |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=The motivational bases of public service |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=50|issue=3|pages=367–373 |jstor=976618|url=http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/mark.wattier/Perry1990.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304181115/http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/mark.wattier/Perry1990.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |doi=10.2307/976618}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Perry and Wise in 1990.&lt;ref name="Kelman"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kelman, Steve|date=April 2015|title=The Lectern: How do we get public servants who want to serve the public?|work=FCW: The Business of Federal Technology |publisher=1105 Public Sector Media Group|url=http://fcw.com/Blogs/Lectern/2015/04/Kelman-PSM.aspx |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Xys37BEw |archivedate=21 April 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vandenabeele, Wouter |year=2007 |title=Toward a public administration theory of public service motivation: An institutional approach |journal=Public Management Review |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=545–556 |doi=10.1080/14719030701726697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Perry, James L. |author2=Hondeghem, Anne |author3=Wise, Lois Recascino  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Revisiting the Motivational Bases of Public Service: Twenty Years of Research and an Agenda for the Future |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=681–690 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02196.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, PSM has gained international prominence from various scholars and  researchers.&lt;ref name="Kettl2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald F.

Studies by Homberg, McCarthy, and Tabvuma attribute PSM to the positive impact on job satisfaction in the public sector because public employment helps satisfy individuals’ pro-social needs.&lt;ref&gt;Homberg, F., McCarthy, D. and Tabvuma, V. (2015), A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between Public Service Motivation and Job Satisfaction. Public Administration Review, 75: 711–722 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12423/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Previous authors that are familiar with motivational factors associated with the public sector suggests that many employees tend to characterize themselves with pro-social identities such as caring and compassionate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An integrative analytical framework for understanding the effects of autonomous and controlled motivation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915001579|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–15|volume = 84|series = Theory and Measurement in Personality and Individual Differences|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2015.02.034|first = Jennifer|last = Brunet|first2 = Katie E.|last2 = Gunnell|first3 = Patrick|last3 = Gaudreau|first4 = Catherine M.|last4 = Sabiston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of motivational theory and management emphasize that individuals will go above and beyond to be viewed as "moral" or good by their peers and fellow employees, so finding pro-social ways to motivate individuals can be beneficial.

Crewson argued that a responsive and cost-effective government should acknowledge that a failure to properly understand the motivations of public employees may have undesirable short term effects such as low job performance which may lead to long term effects such as the permanent displacement of the public service ethic.&lt;ref name="Crewson1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Philip E. Crewson |year=1997|title=Public Service Motivation: Building Empirical Evidence of Incidence and Effect |journal= Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=499–518, page 500 |url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/499.short |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenblatt noted that there is a surprising link between PSM and motivation. After closely observing employees in the public section, material indicated that when PSM encourages individuals it can spark innovation. When employees are rewarded for previous accomplishments in the workplace, they are motivated to do even more, although that motivation is not necessarily coming from a genuine place and instead comes from the desire to receive more rewards. Rosenblatt reaffirms the notion that individuals aren't to concern themselves with what their driving force for may be, whether they are making accomplishments because they want to be innovative or because they want to receive a bonus, the ends will ultimately justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The use of innovation awards in the public sector: individual and organizational perspectives|last = Rosenblatt|first = Michael|date = 2011|journal = Innovation : Management, Policy, &amp; Practice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Matei and Cornea considered that although intrinsic, PSM is influenced by a variety of external factors such as social, political, institutional etc. and, in time, those factors can have an effect and lead to a change in the initial PSM of the individual that was present at the beginning of the position. Such factors demonstrate that if the external factors that act on the public servant are negative, PSM will influence the behavior of the individual for a period of time that is smaller than the professional career of that individual. If the extrinsic factors are positive, PSM can influence the behavior of the public servant throughout their entire career. Matei and Cornea concluded that during this period of time, when PSM influences the activity of the individual, the public servant is led by a certain “lyricism of public service", and connected to their job by “administrative romanticism" with the ultimate desire to serve their community, state, nation etc.&lt;ref name="Matei"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Matei, L.  |author2=Cornea, I. Catalin  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013 |title=Organizational context and factors affecting public service motivation |journal=International Journal of Academic Research (IJAR) |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=44–48, page 47 |doi=10.7813/2075-4124.2013/5-2/B.6  |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/92948957/organizational-context-factors-affecting-public-service-motivation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann also conducted a study among non profit employees and came to the conclusion that although there is a dichotomy within the public and private sectors, if an employee is working for a non profit organization he or she would be satisfied regardless of PSM or not. The reason behind this behavior is because employees who work for non profits already have a passion for the work that they do. According to Mann's study, even if these individuals didn't receive compensation, they would return to work the next day and work just as hard because they have intrinsic motivation that doesn't need to be externalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A motive to serve: Public service motivation in human resource management and the role of PSM in the nonprofit sector|last = Mann|first = Gregory|date = Oct 9, 2015|journal = Public Personnel Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and Alternatives ==
=== Leadership Practices ===
The agency's mission, goals, and objectives can help improve employee performance and motivation. Many employees who hold jobs within the public sector and non-profit organizations do not receive large salaries. It is important for an organization to motivate its employees and align their values and characteristics with the mission and values of the agency rather than subject employees to a stressful and hostile work environment motivated by financial gain. Leadership practices should emphasize to employees the importance of motivation and involvement which can ultimately help the agency or organization in the hiring and retention process if they are aware of the motives of their employees.

=== Surface Acting ===
Studies performed by various researchers attribute an individual's motivation with the individual level of stress and job dissatisfaction. These factors can lead to surface acting which is characterized by adjusting observable emotional expressions to mask true feelings, pretending to feel a desired emotion, and faking emotional displays. It is hard to evaluate the motivation of each individual working in the public sector when they exhibit a false persona. Representing an agency or organization in the public sector often requires one to display and act in a certain behavior and attitude. This behavior often leads to surface acting.

=== Emotional Labor ===
Situational factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the duration of such interactions, career fields, customer hostility, and organizational expectations can all contribute to one's [[emotional labor]]. Emotional labor is the act of behaving or displaying specific emotions and behaviors within one's job profession. Employees are constantly under the influence of interactions between other employees and customers. Many citizens expect a certain level of satisfaction from each level of government which often burdens the employee with an immense amount of pressure to fulfill those expectations and who in turn will often face backlash and harsh criticism when citizens feel they are not satisfied.

=== Employment Relationship ===
If an employee finds themselves in a hostile, stressful work environment this can deter motivation and counteract productivity which can ultimately effect the individuals  goals, expectations, and disrupt the balance of the workplace. Motivation stems from an individuals desire to satisfy the needs for automaton, direct communication between employees, and asocial inclusions. Having an open approach in the workplace can help new less experienced employees feel a sense of involvement and value which an ultimately increase their motivation to succeed and continue with the organization and vie for its success. As generational changes continue to occur and public sector employees rotate between positions, it is vital to understand how employment relationships can be improved in order to increase public service motivation. Nonprofit employees are becoming more similar to public employees based on motivational aspects such as intrinsic rewards.

'''Richard Lee''' (1726–1795), known most commonly as ''"Squire"'', was a prominent [[Virginia Colony|Virginian colonist]], and [[United States|American]] [[politician]], who was active in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Family==

He was born at "Lee Hall" in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]], the third of seven children born to [[Henry Lee I]] (1691–1747) and Mary Bland (1704–1764). Through his father's brother, Thomas 1690-1750, he was the first cousin of [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] hero's Henry Lee and "Light Horse Harry" Lee both signers of the Declaration of Independence.

In 1786, at the age of 60, he married 17-year-old Sarah Bland "Sally" Poythress (1768 – 24 May 1828), a daughter of Peter Poythress (1715–1785) of "Branchester" and Elizabeth Bland (1733–1792). The couple had 5 children;

#Richard Lee II (1788–1790)
#Mary Lee (12 February 1790 – 1848)
#Lettice Lee (1792–1827)
#a son who died in infancy (c. 1793)
#Richardia (b. 1795)

Great uncle of Robert E Lee

After his death, Sally married secondly Willoughby Newton and was the mother of [[Willoughby Newton]].

==Career==

Squire served in the [[Virginia]] [[House of Burgesses]], as a representative from [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland]], for the years 1757–58, 1762, 1769, 1772, &amp; 1774. The House of Burgesses became the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1776, due to the outbreak of the war, and Richard served there during the years 1777, 1780, 1784–87, 1790 &amp; 1793.

He was a delegate to the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Constitutional Convention]] of 1775–76, which drafted the 1776 version of the [[Constitution of Virginia]]. He later served as [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]] and was a [[United States Navy|Naval]] [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] for the Port of [[South Potomac River|Potomac]].

'''Sir Robert James Kerridge''' (30 October 1901 &amp;ndash; 26 April 1979) was a New Zealand businessman, cinema proprietor, film distributor, tourism promoter and entrepreneur. He was born in [[Christchurch]], [[North Canterbury]], [[New Zealand]] on 30 October 1901. He developed a theatre chain that owned or controlled 133 cinemas, the biggest exhibition chain in New Zealand or Australia. In 1946 Kerridge sold 50 per cent of his cinema chain to the [[J. Arthur Rank Organisation]] of London, netting the vendors almost £1 million, and a [[Rolls Royce]] car for Kerridge. The chain was renamed '''Kerridge Odeon'''.&lt;ref name="DNZB Kerridge"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Robert James Kerridge|first= L. R.|last= Shelton|id=4k10|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
Search analytics data can be collected in several ways. Search engines provide access to their own data with services such as Google Analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/|title=Analytics Tools &amp; Solutions for Your Business - Google Analytics|website=marketingplatform.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Trends and Google Insights. Third party services must collect their data from [[ISP]]'s, [[phoning home]] software, or from [[web scraping|scraping]] search engines. Getting traffic statistics from ISP's and phone homes provides for broader reporting of [[web traffic]] in addition to search analytics. Services that perform keyword monitoring only scrape a limited set of search results depending on their clients' needs. Services providing reverse search however, must scrape a large set of keywords from the search engines, usually in the millions, to find the keywords that everyone is using.

Since search results, especially advertisements, differ depending on where you are searching from, data collection methods have to account for geographic location. Keyword monitors do this more easily since they typically know what location their client is targeting. However, to get an exhaustive reverse search, several locations need to be scraped for the same keyword.

==Accuracy==
Search analytics accuracy depends on service being used, data collection method, and data freshness. Google releases its own data, but only in an aggregated way and often without assigning absolute values such as number of visitors to its graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html |title=About Google Trends&amp;nbsp;– Google Trends |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[internet service provider|ISP]] logs and phone home methods are accurate for the population they sample, so sample size and [[demographics]] must be adequate to accurately represent the larger population. Scraping results can be highly accurate, especially when looking at the non-paid, [[organic search|organic]] search results. Paid results, from [[Google Adwords]] for example, are often different for the same search depending on the time, geographic location, and history of searches from a particular computer. This means that scraping advertisers can be hit or miss.

==Market conditions==
Taking a look at Google Insights to gauge the popularity of these services shows that compared to searches for the term [[Adwords]] (Google's popular search ad system), use of search analytics services is still very low, around 1-25% as of Oct. 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=adwords%2Cgoogle%20trends%2Cspyfu%2Ckeyword%20spy%2Cgoogle%20insights&amp;cmpt=q |title=Google Trends |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could point to a large opportunity for the users and makers of search analytics given that services have existed since 2004 with several new services being started since.

==Calculations==
:Sessions with Search = The number of sessions that used your site's search function at least once.
:Percentage of sessions that used internal search = Sessions with Search / Total Sessions.
:Total Unique Searches = The total number of times your site search was used. This excludes multiple searches on the same keyword during the same session.
:Results Pageviews / Search = Pageviews of search result pages / Total Unique Searches.
:Search Exits = The number of searches made immediately before leaving the site.
:Percentage of Search Exits = Search Exits / Total Unique Searches
:Search Refinements = The number of times a user searched again immediately after performing a search.
:Percentage Search Refinements = The percentage of searches that resulted in a search refinement. Calculated as Search Refinements / Pageviews of search result pages.
:Time after Search = The amount of time users spend on your site after performing a search. This is calculated as Sum of all search_duration across all searches / (search_transitions + 1)
:Search Depth = The number of pages viewed after performing a search. This is calculated as Sum of all search_depth across all searches / (search_transitions + 1) &lt;ref&gt;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032321?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

simPRO was founded in 2002, after electrical business owner Steve Bradshaw approached [[software engineering]] student Vaughan McKillop about creating a website for his growing electrical contracting business&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simprogroup.com/about-us|title=The simPRO Software Story {{!}} simPRO US|website=www.simprogroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When Vaughn explained to Steve that his strengths lay in writing software rather than web design, Steve quickly realised he could build something big to help his business&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Using the web-based [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]] languages that Vaughan knew well, the two men began to create simPRO's first iteration&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

Initially they focused on making digital job lists, and then moved on to building a scheduling tool that could allocate time and [[technicians]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. As Vaughan and Steve continued to expand on the software's capability and functionality, they realised that the tool they had created could not only help Steve's business, but many others&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

The company first started trading as Acorn Software and Service Management Pty Ltd in 2003, then changed its name is simPRO Software in 2011 and simPRO in 2017&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Management ==

'''''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit''''' is a 1956 American [[drama]] film based on the [[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (novel)|1955 novel of the same name]] by [[Sloan Wilson]]. The film focuses on Tom Rath, a young [[World War II]] veteran trying to balance his marriage and family life with the demands of a new job while dealing with the aftereffects of his war service. The film stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Rath and [[Jennifer Jones]] as his wife, with [[Fredric March]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Keenan Wynn]] and [[Marisa Pavan]] in supporting roles. It was entered at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3644/year/1956.html|title=Festival de Cannes: The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit|accessdate=2009-02-04|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ten years after the end of [[World War II]], Tom Rath ([[Gregory Peck]]) is living in suburban [[Connecticut]] with his wife Betsy ([[Jennifer Jones]]) and three children; he's having difficulty supporting his family on his salary writing for a [[nonprofit organization]]. Tom is also dealing with [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters, involving men that he killed (including, by accident, his best friend), and a young Italian girl named Maria ([[Marisa Pavan]]), with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time. Before he left Maria for the final time to go back into battle, Tom was told that she was pregnant and was going to keep the baby. He would never see her or the child again.

When an expected inheritance from Tom's recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable mansion, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job. Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter, Tom applies for an opening in public relations at television network UBC. Asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process, he refuses. Hired nonetheless, he helps network president Ralph Hopkins ([[Fredric March]]) launch a national [[mental health]] campaign. Hopkins is powerful and highly respected, but unbeknownst to his employees, his [[workaholic]] habits have caused him to be estranged from his wife and his rebellious daughter, who soon elopes with an unsuitable man.

Tom is initially supervised by Bill Ogden ([[Henry Daniell]]), a [[micromanager]] and office politician who rejects Tom's drafts of an important Hopkins speech intended to launch the campaign, substituting his own draft consisting of what Ogden thinks Hopkins wants to hear. Tom plans to play along and accept Ogden's draft but, coaxed by Betsy, presents his original ideas to Hopkins instead. Hopkins, who has just received the unwelcome news of his daughter's [[elopement]], is receptive to Tom's criticism and thinks Tom resembles his own late son, who refused to accept an [[officer's commission]] in World War II and was subsequently killed in action as an enlisted man. Hopkins now regrets having ignored his family and advises Tom not to make the same mistake.

Betsy abruptly sells the family's modest dwelling and moves them into Tom's late grandmother's mansion, "Dragonwyck," only to find that Edward ([[Joseph Sweeney (actor)|Joseph Sweeney]]), the old woman's longtime caretaker, is claiming that Tom's grandmother had bequeathed him the estate. Judge Bernstein ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) intercedes and presents evidence that suggests that not only did Edward forge the bequest letter, but he also padded his bills, thus depleting the estate and accumulating a large fortune in the town's bank that he could not otherwise explain. The Raths are able to keep the house.

At his new job, Tom runs into elevator operator Caesar ([[Keenan Wynn]]), a [[sergeant]] with whom he'd served in [[Italy]]. Caesar is married to Maria's cousin and tells Tom that Maria and her son by Tom are desperate for money in their still war-ravaged country. Tom has kept his affair and child a secret from Betsy, but he now decides to tell her, remembering her admonition to be honest at all times. Betsy reacts angrily and speeds away recklessly in her car. They reconcile at the local police station. Tom and Betsy go to Judge Bernstein to set up a trust fund for Tom's son in Italy. That night, Hopkins calls to ask Tom to accompany him on a trip to California in support of the new campaign. Tom declines, saying he just wants to "work 9 to 5 and spend the rest of the time with my family," a decision Hopkins respectfully accepts.

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews of the film were somewhat mixed. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared it "a mature, fascinating and often quite tender and touching film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=April 13, 1956 |title=Screen: Mature, Tender and Touching: |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |location= |publisher= |page=21 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "often seems episodic and it's over-long," finding Johnson's direction "uneven" and holding him "responsible for the fact that the picture so determinedly misses the point of the book which made the flannel suit a symbol rather than just a garment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=April 4, 1956 |title=The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location= |publisher= |page=6 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called it "one of the most absorbing pictures of the year," with "exceptionally fine" acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=March 31, 1956 |title='The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit' with Gregory Peck, Jennifer Jones and Fredric March |url= |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |location= |publisher= |page=50 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' thought the film was too long and suggested that the flashbacks should have been trimmed, concluding that "if it were an old-fashioned serial, I'm sure we might have been able to tolerate it. In one massive dose, though, it's just too damned much, and I think you'd be better off taking a tranquilizer pill than going through all this for the sake of escaping the world and its woes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarten |first=John |date=April 21, 1956 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |location= |publisher= |pages=75–76 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote: "As a sociological document, a particular view of the contemporary American middle-class scene, the film is uneasily fascinating. Otherwise, this is a characteristic best-seller adaptation, over-long, over-loaded with 'production values', padded out with flashbacks to the war years, and efficiently impersonal in its approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=July 1956 |title=Man in the Grey Flannel Suit |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |location= |volume=23 |issue=270 |publisher= |page=86 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, like the novel on which it was based, became hugely popular. Historian Robert Schultz argues that the film and the novel are cultural representations of what [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] had described in 1955 as a "crisis in the western world", "collectivism colliding with individualism," the collective demands of corporate organizations against traditional roles of spouse and parent.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, ''Soured on the System: Disaffected Men in Twentieth-Century American Film'' (McFarland, 2012), 37-43; Stevenson, "A Purpose for Modern Woman," ''Woman's Home Companion'' (September 1955): 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; That increased corporate organization of society, Schultz notes, reduced white-collar workers' (represented by Tom Rath and the other gray-suited "yes men") control over what they did and how they did it as they adapted to the "organized system" described and critiqued by contemporary social critics such as Paul Goodman, C. Wright Mills, and William H. Whyte, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Soured on the System, 48-50, 53-54, 64-69, 71-72; Goodman, Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System (Random House, 1960); Mills, White Collar: The American Middle Classes (Oxford, 1951); Whyte, The Organization Man (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vanderbilt family''' is an American family of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] origin who gained prominence during the [[Gilded Age]]. Their success began with the shipping and railroad empires of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], and the family expanded into various other areas of industry and philanthropy. Cornelius Vanderbilt's descendants went on to build grand mansions on [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]], luxurious "summer cottages" in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the palatial [[Biltmore House]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], and [[Vanderbilt houses|various other opulent homes]].

The Vanderbilts were once the wealthiest family in America. Cornelius Vanderbilt was the [[List of richest Americans in history|richest American]] until his death in 1877. After that, his son William acquired his father's fortune, and was the richest American until his death in 1885. The Vanderbilts' prominence lasted until the mid-20th century, when the family's 10 great [[Fifth Avenue]] mansions were torn down, and most other [[Vanderbilt houses]] were sold or turned into museums in what has been referred to as the "Fall of the House of Vanderbilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/books/more-money-than-anyone-else.html|work=The New York Times| title= Review of ''Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt''|date=September 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt |last=Vanderbilt |first=Arthur T., II |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989 |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-688-07279-8 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branches of the family are found on the [[United States East Coast]]. Contemporary descendants include fashion designer [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], her youngest son, journalist [[Anderson Cooper]], actor [[Timothy Olyphant]], musician [[John P. Hammond]] and screenwriter [[James Vanderbilt]].

== History ==

[[File:Vanderbilt Mansion - IMG 7939.JPG|thumb|right|[[Frederick William Vanderbilt]]'s home, now known as the [[Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site]].]]

The progenitor of the Vanderbilt family was Jan Aertszoon or Aertson (1620–1705), a Dutch farmer from the village of [[De Bilt]] in [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]], who emigrated to the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] as an [[indentured servant]] to the [[Wolphert Gerretse|Van Kouwenhoven family]] in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Kelly MacDowell. ''Commodore Vanderbilt and his family: a biographical account of the Descendants of Cornelius and Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt''. 1989. University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb40EosBr90C&amp;pg=PT70&amp;dq "American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America"], Colin Woodard. Penguin, Sep 29, 2011. Retrieved 13 may 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Jan's village name was added to the Dutch "Van" (from) to create "Van der Bilt", which evolved into Vanderbilt when the English took control of [[New Amsterdam]] (now [[Manhattan]]). The family is associated with the Dutch [[Nederland's Patriciaat|patrician]] Van der Bilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://194.171.109.12/download/cbg_patriciaat_lijst.pdf |title=List of Dutch patrician families in the Nederland's Patriciaat 1910-2007/2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His great-great-great-grandson [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] began the prominence of the family, the fourth of nine children born to a [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]] family of modest means. Through his paternal great-great grandmother Abigail Southard, he descends from [[Republic of Salé]] President [[Jan Janszoon]] and his son [[Anthony Janszoon van Salee]]. They were among the earliest arrivals to 17th century [[New Amsterdam]]. In a number of documents dating back to this period, Anthony is described as tawny or mulatto,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3qSTNdp1t0C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq "Origins of the Black Atlantic"], Laurent Dubois, Julius S. Scott. Routledge, Jan 11, 2013. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; as his mother was of [[Berbers|Berber]] origin from [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] in the [[Kingdom of Murcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/vansallees.html |title=The Van Salee Family|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate= March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/2013JanAndAnthonyJansenPublic "Jan Jansen van Haarlem and Anthony Jansen van Salee"], Brian A. Smith. Washington D.C. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelius Vanderbilt left school at age 11 and went on to build a [[Merchant navy|shipping]] and [[railroad]] empire that, during the 19th century, would make him one of the wealthiest men in the world. Starting with a single boat, he grew his fleet until he was competing with [[Robert Fulton]] for dominance of the New York waterways, his energy and eagerness earning him the nickname "Commodore", then the highest rank in the United States Navy. Fulton's company had established a monopoly on trade in and out of [[New York Harbor]]. Vanderbilt, based in New Jersey at the time, flouted the law, steaming in and out of the harbor under a flag that read, "New Jersey Must Be Free!" He also hired the attorney [[Daniel Webster]] to argue his case before the [[United States Supreme Court]]; Vanderbilt won, thereby establishing an early precedent for America's first laws of [[interstate commerce]].

The Vanderbilt family lived on Staten Island until the mid-1800s, when the Commodore built a house on Washington Place (in what is now [[Greenwich Village]]). Although he always occupied a relatively modest home, members of his family would use their wealth to build magnificent [[Vanderbilt houses|mansions]]. Shortly before his death in 1877, Vanderbilt donated [[US dollar|US$]]1 million for the establishment of [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].

The Commodore left the majority of his enormous fortune to his eldest son, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]]. William Henry, who outlived his father by just eight years, increased the profitability of his father's holdings, increased the reach of the [[New York Central Railroad]], and doubled the Vanderbilt wealth. He built the first of what would become many grand Vanderbilt mansions on [[Fifth Avenue]], at 640 Fifth Avenue. William Henry appointed his first son, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]], as the next "Head of House".

Cornelius II built the largest private home in New York, at 1 West [[58th Street (Manhattan)|58th Street]], containing approximately 154 rooms, designed by [[George B. Post]]. He also built [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Cornelius II's brother, [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]], also featured prominently in the family's affairs. He also built a magnificent home on Fifth Avenue and would become one of the great architectural patrons of the [[Gilded Age]], hiring the architects for (the third, and surviving) [[Grand Central Terminal]]. He also built [[Marble House]] at 596 Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island.

[[George Washington Vanderbilt II]], [[William Henry Vanderbilt]]'s youngest son, built [[Biltmore Estate|Biltmore]], in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].

While some of Cornelius Vanderbilt's descendants gained fame in business, others achieved prominence in other ways, e.g.:
* [[Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt]] (1877–1915), was a passenger on the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] and died when it sank.  
*Alfred's son [[Alfred G. Vanderbilt II|Alfred Jr.]] became a noted horse breeder and racing elder. 
*[[Harold Stirling Vanderbilt]] (1884–1970) gained fame as a sportsman. He invented the [[Contract bridge|contract form of bridge]] and won the most coveted prize in yacht racing, the [[America's Cup]], on three occasions. 
*Harold's brother [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II|William Kissam "Willie K" Vanderbilt II]] launched the [[Vanderbilt Cup]] for [[auto racing]].  
*[[William Henry Vanderbilt III]] was Governor of Rhode Island. 
*[[Gloria Vanderbilt]] is a noted artist, designer and author.
*Gloria's son, [[Anderson Cooper]], is a Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and television producer and personality.
*[[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] was a sculptor, art patron and collector, and founder of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]

In 1855, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt donated 45 [[acre]]s (~182,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of property to the [[Moravian Church]] and cemetery at [[New Dorp]] on [[Staten Island, New York]]. Later, his son [[William Henry Vanderbilt]] donated a further four acres (16,000&amp;nbsp;m²). The Vanderbilt [[Mausoleum]] was designed in 1885 by [[architect]] [[Richard Morris Hunt]] and landscaped by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].

== Family connection (chronological listing) ==
''The following list includes etiquette guru [[Amy Vanderbilt]] (1908–1974), although it is believed she descended from either an uncle or brother of Cornelius Vanderbilt and is therefore not a descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

==Biography==
Born on 1 March 1802, Vilhelmína Lever was the daughter of Hans Vilhelms Lever, a merchant, and his wife Þuríður Sigfúsdóttir. She married Thord Daníelsson but obtained a divorce in 1824, becoming the first woman in Iceland to apply for a divorce.&lt;ref name=mbl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1151373/|title=Jafnréttisáfanga minnst|publisher=''Morgunblaðið''date=19 June 2007|accessdate=17 February 2018 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bought a plot of land in Akureyri in 1834, built a small house and opened a shop in 1835.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;  After spending a few years in Krossanes, she returned to Akureyri in 1852 to run a shop combined with a restaurant. In 1861, she opened a restaurant in the Oddeyri district of Akureyri. She ran it for years, gaining the nickname "Vertshús-Mína" or Tavern-Mina.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;

New regulations in Danish stated that the town council could be elected by "alle fuldmyndige Mænd" (all men who have reached their majority) who had lived in the town for two years and paid municipal dues. Assuming "mænd" meant all people (as in Icelandic) and not just men, Vilhelmína voted in the municipal elections in both 1863 and 1866.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbl/&gt;

Later Vilhelmína lived in Nonnahús (Nonni's House), Akureyri's oldest house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonni.is/?m=page&amp;f=viewPage&amp;id=15|title=Saga hússins|publisher=Nonnahús Akureyri|accessdate=17 February 2018 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Akureyri on 19 June 1879.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6489">[[File:Army Voucher.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|This British Army Forces Voucher, issued to soldiers in Germany following [[World War II]], may be used only in canteens or other specified transactions.]]
A '''voucher''' is a bond of the redeemable transaction type which is worth a certain [[money|monetary value]] and which may be spent only for specific reasons or on specific goods. Examples include [[house|housing]], [[travel]], and [[food]] vouchers. The term voucher is also a synonym for [[receipt]] and is often used to refer to receipts used as [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of, for example, the declaration that a service has been performed or that an expenditure has been made.Voucher is a tourist guide for using services with a guarantee of payment by the agency.

The term is also commonly used for [[school vouchers]], which are somewhat different.

==In tourism==
Vouchers are used in the [[tourism]] sector primarily as proof of a named customer's right to take a service at a specific time and place. Service providers collect them to return to the tour operator or [[travel agent]] that has sent that customer, to prove they have given the service. So, the life of a voucher is as below:

# Customer receives vouchers from tour operator or travel agent for the services purchased
# Customer goes to vacation site and forwards the voucher to related provider and asks for the service to be provided
# Provider sends collected vouchers to the agent or operator that sends customers from time to time, and asks for payment for those services
# Uncollected vouchers do not deserve payment

This approach is most suitable for free individual tourist activities where pre-allocation for services are not necessary, feasible or applicable. It was customary before the information era when communication was limited and expensive, but now has been given quite a different role by [[B2C]] applications. When a reservation is made through the internet, customers are often provided a voucher through email or a web site that can be printed. Providers customarily require this voucher be presented prior to providing the service.

==Account voucher==
A voucher is an accounting document representing an ''internal intent'' to make a payment to an ''external entity'', such as a vendor or service provider. A voucher is produced usually after receiving a vendor [[invoice]], after the invoice is successfully matched to a [[purchase order]]. A voucher will contain detailed information regarding the payee, the monetary amount of the payment, a description of the transaction, and more. In [[accounts payable]] systems, a process called a "payment run" is executed to generate payments corresponding to the unpaid vouchers. These payments can then be released or held at the discretion of an accounts payable supervisor or the company [[comptroller|controller]].

The term can also be used with reference to [[accounts receivable]], where it is also a document representing intent to make an adjustment to an account, and for the [[general ledger]] where there is need to adjust the accounts within that ledger; in that case it is referred to as a journal voucher.

Any documentary evidence supporting the entries recorded in the books of accounts, establishing the arithmetic accuracy of the transaction, may also be referred to as a voucher&amp;mdash;for example, a bill, invoice, [[receipt]], salary and wages sheet, [[memorandum of association]], [[counterfoil]] of [[Deposit slip|paying-in slip]], counterfoil of [[cheque book]], or [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]].

==Mobile phones==
A voucher is a recharge number sold to a customer to recharge their [[SIM card]] with money and to extend the card's availability period. Vouchers are typically sold at retail outlets, such as phone stores run by the mobile operator or by distributors, grocery stores, and gas stations.

Vouchers are the prevalent form of recharge for prepaid mobile phones in many countries such as Italy and Spain where well over 90% of consumers use vouchers, and the UK where over 60% buy vouchers at retail.&lt;ref name="Northstream"&gt;Time to Top-Up the Prepaid User Experience: How an effective top-up strategy can improve operator performance metrics and accelerate mobile payments. Northstream White Paper, June 2009 http://northstream.se/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Prepaid_Whitepaper_Jun_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries such as the United States, Ireland, and many Nordic countries, there is a growing trend of customers using Card Not Present recharge options such as online payments, or by using their mobile handsets to call the operator and recharge with a representative (CSR) or through their IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system.&lt;ref name="Northstream" /&gt; A growing number of prepaid mobile operators such as [[Meteor (mobile network)|Meteor]] in Ireland and [[T-Mobile]] USA are offering the option to send an SMS (text to pay), or use handset applications such as WAP or BREW technology.&lt;ref name="Northstream" /&gt;

==Internet==
A voucher can also be used online in the form of an e-voucher. These types of vouchers can be entered when shopping online and the relevant vouchers value added to your order. It can take the form of any code. Many companies have opted to use voucher codes for the last few years but with a massive incline in use towards late 2008 and early 2009. There are many Internet websites devoted to promoting these deals and vouchers online, as well as Facebook groups offering items such as student discounts and 2-for-1 restaurant voucher deals. Many companies have started their business around coupons. It comes under [[affiliate marketing]]. 

There are a small number of sites that use a disreputable method of click to reveal method for dropping cookies on the consumer's computer, which has led to the introduction of guidelines for voucher use in Internet marketing.

Most video game special editions come with a voucher for exclusive content in-game. Also, pre-ordering games at certain shops may entitle the purchaser to vouchers to content only available if you pre-order at that store.
