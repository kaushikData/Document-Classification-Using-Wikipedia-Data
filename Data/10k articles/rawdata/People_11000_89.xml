The Bergmans have won two [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Awards for Best Original Song]] and have been inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

==Biography and career==
Alan Bergman was born to [[Jewish]] parents in [[Brooklyn, New York]], in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/music/53345/happily-married-and-a-relationship-streisand|title=Happily married, and in a relationship with Streisand|last=Nathan|first=John|date=August 18, 2011|website=www.thejc.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and earned his master's degree in music at [[UCLA]]. Marilyn Bergman was born in 1929, coincidentally at the same Brooklyn hospital where Alan had been born four years earlier, and studied music at [[The High School of Music &amp; Art]] in New York before studying psychology and English at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Bergman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanandmarilynbergman.com/biography.htm|title=Alan and Marilyn Bergman biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Alan and Marilyn Bergman|access-date=|work=Alan and Marilyn Bergman biography|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529212220/http://www.alanandmarilynbergman.com/biography.htm|archive-date=2014-05-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan worked as a [[television director]] and songwriter at Philadelphia's [[WCAU-TV]] in the early 1950s. [[Johnny Mercer]] encouraged Alan to move to Los Angeles and become a professional songwriter.&lt;ref name='SongHOFn'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/alanbergman|title=Alan Bergman|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|date=|website=vervemusic.com|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222051344/http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/alanbergman|archive-date=2013-12-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the geographical proximity of their upbringing in New York, the Bergmans did not meet until they had both moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. Marilyn had moved to California and was friends with songwriter [[Bob Russell (songwriter)|Bob Russell]] and his wife, Anna, and later described "drif[ing] into songwriting really by accident because I had a fall and broke my shoulder and couldn't play piano so I started writing lyrics". Marilyn also felt that she lacked the discipline or talent required to become a concert pianist. The Bergmans had both become collaborators with composer [[Lew Spence]], and only met when Spence suggested they all work together. The Bergmans married in 1958, and have a daughter, Julie Bergman Sender, who works as an independent film producer.&lt;ref name='SongHOFn'&gt;{{cite web|title=Songwriters Hall of Fame - Johnny Mercer Award|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/ceremony/entry/C3109/5070|work=Songwriters Hall of Fame|publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmSong02&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2002/09/marilyn-bergman-drifted-into-songwriting-continues-to-write-and-touch-people-with-her-songs/|author=Vernell Hackett|title=Marilyn Bergman: 'Drifted' Into Songwriting|date=September 1, 2002|work=American Songwriter|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Spence the Bergmans wrote the lyrics for the title tracks for [[Dean Martin]]'s 1958 album ''[[Sleep Warm]]'' and [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1960 album ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]''.&lt;ref name="Mann2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=William J.

In 1964 the Bergmans wrote lyrics to their first [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''[[Something More!]]'', to music by [[Sammy Fain]].&lt;ref name='IBDBSomething'&gt;{{cite web|title=Something More!|url=http://www.ibdb.com/Show/View/8165|work=Internet Broadway Database - Something More!|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bergmans wrote lyrics for "[[In the Heat of the Night (Ray Charles song)|In the Heat of the Night]]" with music by [[Quincy Jones]] for the 1967 film [[In the Heat of the Night (film)|of the same name]], which has been described as their "breakthrough".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alan-marilyn-bergman-mn0000623009|title=Alan and Marilyn Bergman|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=|work=Allmusic biography|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would later work with Jones on [[Michael Jackson]]'s soundtrack album for ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (album)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), for which they wrote the lyrics for "Someone In the Dark", and the 2007 [[Ennio Morricone]] tribute album ''[[We All Love Ennio Morricone]]'' for which they wrote lyrics to "I Knew I Loved You", which was sung by [[Celine Dion]].&lt;ref name="AllmusicEnnio"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=we-all-love-ennio-morricone-mw0000775591label=We All Love Ennio Morricone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bergmans' long relationship with the French composer [[Michel Legrand]] began in the late 1960s. The couple wrote English lyrics for Legrand's song "[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]" featured in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968), which won them their first [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[41st Academy Awards]] in 1969. The Bergmans and Legrand were subsequently nominated for the Best Original Song award in the following two years for "[[What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?]]" from ''[[The Happy Ending]]'' (1969) and "Pieces of Dreams" [[Pieces of Dreams (film)|from the 1970 film of the same name]]. The couple's minor work with Legrand in this period included "Listen to the Sea" from ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968) and "Nobody Knows" and "[[Sweet Gingerbread Man]]" from ''[[The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart]]'' (1970).&lt;ref name="Inc.1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|date=13 July 1968|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=74–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legrand would also feature eight of the Bergman's lyrics on [[Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand|his 1972 album with Sarah Vaughan]].&lt;ref name="AllmusicSarah"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=with-michel-legrand-mw0000271518|label=Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 at the [[55th Academy Awards]], the Bergmans' work on "[[How Do You Keep the Music Playing?]]" composed by Legrand for the film ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' would be nominated for the Best Original Song award. The 55th Academy Awards was also significant as the Bergmans became the first songwriters ever to have written three of the five nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song, being nominated for "[[It Might Be You]]" from ''[[Tootsie]]'' (composed by [[Dave Grusin]]), and "If We Were in Love" from ''Yes, Giorgio'' (composed by [[John Williams]]), in addition to "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?". At the subsequent Academy Awards, their work with Legrand on the 1983 film ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' won them the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation Score]], with the songs "[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]" and "[[The Way He Makes Me Feel]]" from the film also being nominated for the Best Original Song award.

The Bergmans were also co-writers of "An American Reunion", the opening ceremony of the inaugural festivities at Washington D.C.'s [[Lincoln Memorial]] that marked [[Bill Clinton]]'s first term as [[President of the United States]] in January 1993.&lt;ref name='SongHOFn'/&gt; In the late 1990s the Bergmans received their most recent nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for "Moonlight" (composed by [[John Williams]]) for the 1995 film ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'', and "Love Is Where You Are" (music by [[Mark Isham]]) for the 1999 film ''[[At First Sight (1999 film)|At First Sight]]''. 1999 was the same year that the Bergmans received their most recent [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics]] for "A Time to Dream"" (music by Hamisch) for the AFI's ''AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies Special''.

The [[Kennedy Center]] commissioned the Bergmans to write a [[song cycle]] in 2001, they chose to collaborate with the composer [[Cy Coleman]]. The resulting work, ''Portraits in Jazz: A Gallery of Songs'' was performed on May 17, 2002.&lt;ref name=AmSong02/&gt;
The Bergmans wrote the lyrics to [[Billy Goldenberg]]'s television musical ''[[Queen of the Stardust Ballroom]]'' which won the couple their third [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics|Primetime Emmy Award Outstanding Achievement in Special Musical Material]], it was later the couple's second Broadway show, ''[[Ballroom (musical)|Ballroom]]'', which opened in 1978.&lt;ref name='IBDBBall'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballroom!|url=http://www.ibdb.com/Production/View/3907|work=Internet Broadway Database - Ballroom|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Alan Bergman released his first album as a vocalist, ''[[Lyrically, Alan Bergman]]'', featuring lyrics written by him and his wife and arranged by [[Alan Broadbent]] and Jeremy Lubbock.&lt;ref name="AllmusicLyrically"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=lyrically-alan-bergman-mw0000778172|label=Lyrically, Alan Bergman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the album for [[Allmusic]], John Bush praised Bergman's "excellent interpretive skills" and Christopher Loundon in the ''[[JazzTimes]]'' described Bergman's voice as a "...revelation, suggesting both the wise, elder Sinatra and the astutely mellow Fred Astaire, with a touch of the offbeat dreaminess of Chet Baker."&lt;ref name=JTOct15&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/19275-lyrically-alan-bergman-alan-bergman|author=Christopher Loundon|title=Jazz Albums: Lyrically, Alan Bergman|date=October 2007|work=[[Jazz Times]]|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bergmans have had a long professional relationship with the singer and actress [[Barbra Streisand]]. In addition to their work on the films ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' and ''[[The Way We Were]]'', in which Streisand starred, the Bergmans wrote Streisand's "One Voice" concert which was released [[One Voice (Barbra Streisand album)|as a live album in 1987]]. Marilyn also served as the executive producer of the "One Voice" concert. The Bergmans' song "Ordinary Miracles" from [[Barbra Streisand in Concert|Streisand's 1994 concert tour and HBO special]] won the couple their third Emmy Award, with the couple's script for the tour also being nominated for a CableACE Award. The Bergmans received their fifth Emmy nomination for the song "On the Way to Becoming Me" (music by Marvin Hamlisch) from the AFI tribute to Streisand.&lt;ref name='Bergman'/&gt; The Bergmans have also served as board members of Streisand's charitable foundation.&lt;ref name="Santopietro2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Santopietro|title=The Importance of Being Barbra: The Brilliant, Tumultuous Career of Barbra Streisand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksbcMitrPJwC&amp;pg=PA176|date=1 April 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4299-0853-5|pages=176–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streisand's 2011 album ''[[What Matters Most]]'' was recorded in tribute to the Bergmans, and featured ten songs by the couple that she had not previously recorded.&lt;ref name="AllmusicWhatMatters"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=what-matters-most-barbra-streisand-sings-the-lyrics-of-alan-and-marilyn-bergman-mw0002181703|label=What Matters Most}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, The Bergman's collaborated with playwright [[Josh Ravetch]] in 2017 on [[Chasing Mem'ries: A Different Kind of Musical]]. The play opened to rave reviews as a world premiere at The Geffen Playhouse and was the recipient of the Edgerton New Play Award. The play starred [[Tyne Daly]], [[Robert Forster]] and [[Scott Kradolfer]]. In the play, there were both classic Bergman songs and new songs written for the play that married in seamlessly with Ravetch's text. The songs became the inner-monologues of the characters in an unusual and touching way. It was one of the best received plays in the history of The Geffen Playhouse.

==Awards and honors==

The couple were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1980 and subsequently received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Hall of Fame in 1997.&lt;ref name='SongHOFn'/&gt; The Bergmans were awarded honorary [[doctorate]]s by the [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1995, they also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[National Academy of Songwriters]] that year.

'''Amit Jethwa''' (also '''Amit Jethava''') (1975 – 20 July 2010) was an Indian environmentalist and social worker, active in the [[Gir Forest]] area near [[Junagadh]], Gujarat.  He had filed several court cases against illegal mining in the protected area, naming, [[Dinu Solanki]] as one of the respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/rti-activist-shot-dead-near-hc/649665/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009161112/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/rti-activist-shot-dead-near-hc/649665/ |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July 2010 he was shot dead by two assailants on a motorbike.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;  On 6 September, Dinu Solanki's nephew Shiva Solanki has been arrested for allegedly having ordered gun-for-hire Pachan Shiva and one other to commit the killing.&lt;ref&gt;http://ibnlive.in.com/news/jethwa-murder-case-bjp-mps-nephew-arrested/130440-37-64.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sept 2012, the [[Gujarat High Court]], severely criticized investigations by the Gujarat police who had "given a clean chit"&lt;ref name=zee/&gt; to Solanki, despite arresting his nephew; the court ordered the [[Central Bureau of Investigations]] (CBI) to take up the case.&lt;ref&gt;

In November 2013, CBI arrested BJP MP Dinu Solanki in connection with having ordered the murder.&lt;ref name=zee/&gt;

==Career==
As the president of the Gir Nature Youth Club at [[Khambha, Gujarat|Khambha]], Amit Jethwa had been active in fighting against encroachment of forests and poaching.  He was also instrumental in the five-year jail term of [[Bollywood]] actor [[Salman Khan]] for shooting an endangered [[Chinkara]] deer, a case that concluded after being pursued by activists for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-04-12/ahmedabad/27811046_1_forest-officials-bollywood-actor-salman-khan-wildlife-activists | work=The Times of India | title=Notices to forest official in Salman case | date=12 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also highlighted the use of a Chinkara deer in a scene in the movie ''[[Lagaan]]'' and opposed a [[Bhuj]] court decision which stayed an inquiry against the actor-director [[Aamir Khan]].

He campaigned vigorously against corruption among officers of the [[Indian Forest Service]], and opposed [[S. R. Bommai v. Union of India#Malafide exercise of Article 356|malafide]] application of article 356 of the.&lt;ref name=toi-ahm/&gt; In 2007, he drew attention to the mysterious deaths of lions in [[Gir Forest National Park|Gir Forest]] including three that were shot within a few hundred meters of the Babariya forest guard outpost. Claiming that "Such a thing cannot be possible without support of some forest officials", Jethwa sought the suspension of an IFS officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frienvis.nic.in/NewDigest/mar-apr-2007.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122103158/http://www.frienvis.nic.in/NewDigest/mar-apr-2007.htm |archivedate=22 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident ultimately led to the uncovering of a large lion poaching gang.  He later campaigned against shifting of lions to the [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh. His efforts were often blocked by forest officials by charging him with offenses such as photographing a dead lion and trespassing.&lt;ref name=toi-ahm/&gt;

In 2007, Jethwa contested the state assembly elections, but lost.

In 2008, Jethwa pursued the [[Right to Information Act]] for addressing grievances, and conducted workshops on the procedure to file requests under RTI to prevent corrupt practices and other mal-administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article526677.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Father of murdered RTI activist alleges BJP MP's involvement | date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Jethwa had filed a PIL petition questioning the state government's "inaction" over the appointment of a Lokayukta. The high court directed the government to appoint a Lokayukta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2718/stories/20100910271800400.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008000609/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2718/stories/20100910271800400.htm |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jethwa had spearheaded the campaign against rising case pendency in the Gujarat Information Commission (GIC) due to lack of commissioners. It was on his petition that the HC directed the state government to complete the appointments within a stipulated time. He again came to the rescue of thousands of RTI users by filing a writ petition in the HC and made the government accept Indian Postal Order (IPO) as one of the modes of payment to deposit fees while filing of RTI applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOIA/2010/07/21&amp;PageLabel=1&amp;EntityId=Ar00102&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;GZ=T&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations against illegal mining lobby===
Since 2008, Jethwa had filed six requests under the [[Right to Information Act]], probing the activities of an illegal mining lobby operating in the protected forest area just outside the [[Gir Forest National Park]].&lt;ref name=ndtv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/rti-activist-killed-for-campaign-against-bjp-mp-says-family-38770|title=RTI activist killed for campaign against BJP MP, says family|access-date=2016-09-10|date=2010-07-21|first1=Rohit|last1=Bhan|publisher=[[NDTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Jethwa was badly beaten up by goons, allegedly from Solanki's party.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/106181/India/murdered-rti-activists-kin-allege-foul-play.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2010, he filed a [[Public interest litigation]] in the Gujarat High Court, citing evidence found, and naming local BJP politician [[Dinu Solanki]] and several relatives, for involvement in the illegal mining in the Gir Forest.&lt;ref name=ndtv/&gt; He sought directives from the court for stopping power supply to all such mining centers.

In June 2010, a raid was conducted by the police and geology departments, and a number of mining equipment were seized.&lt;ref name=deshg&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://deshgujarat.com/2010/07/20/amit-jethwa-was-a-force-rare-in-this-time-his-murder-is-shocking/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723160556/http://deshgujarat.com/2010/07/20/amit-jethwa-was-a-force-rare-in-this-time-his-murder-is-shocking/ |archive-date=23 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the equipment was subsequently stolen back.  Dinu Bhai was issued a show-cause notice for imposing a
penalty of RS 4.1&amp;nbsp;million on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/node/1622 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919203219/http://www.downtoearth.org.in/node/1622 |archivedate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since BJP was the ruling party in the state, he appealed that the matter be investigated by an independent [[ombudsman]] or [[Lokayukta]], a constitutional position that had been lying vacant in Gujarat since 2003.  He had recently moved court to seek a judicial order to the state government to fill this post.&lt;ref name=ht&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/BJP-MP-behind-murder-RTI-activists-family/Article1-575531.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723155237/http://www.hindustantimes.com/BJP-MP-behind-murder-RTI-activists-family/Article1-575531.aspx |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination===
On 20 July, shortly after the case against Solanki was filed, Jethwa had gone to meet his lawyer near the Gujarat High court in [[Ahmedabad]].  As he was leaving the Satyamev complex, two assailants on a motorcycle shot him at close range with a country-made pistol.    Despite being injured, he apparently tried to detain the assailants.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; Though they were able to get away, he was able to grab a [[kurta]] (longshirt) worn by one of the murderers; this had a laundry tag leading to Junagadh.&lt;ref name=toi-ahm&gt;http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOIA/2010/07/22&amp;PageLabel=2&amp;EntityId=Ar00200&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;GZ=T&lt;/ref&gt;  A police car was parked outside the court, and two policemen came out on hearing the single gunshot but failed to pursue the criminals, who escaped on foot.&lt;ref name=toi-ahm/&gt;

Jethwa's family has alleged that he was under constant threat from Dinu Solanki for interfering with the powerful and illegal mining lobby in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]].  At one point Solanki threatened him in front of a large gathering at a meeting in [[Kodinar]], the area Solanki hails from.  Jethwa had recently filed an affidavit at the Kodinar police station seeking protection and stating that he would be killed by Solanki. His father recently received a threatening phone call from Dinu Solanki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-21/ahmedabad/28306023_1_illegal-mining-dinu-solanki-bjp-mp | work=The Times of India | title=BJP MP behind whistleblower's murder | date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of civil bodies and NGOs held a vigil in Ahmedabad on 21 July, seeking an independent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOIA/2010/07/22&amp;PageLabel=2&amp;EntityId=Ar00208&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;GZ=T&lt;/ref&gt;

===BJP MP Dinu Solanki arrested===
During investigations, the police arrested constable Bahadursinh Wadher and then Pachan Silva, who was allegedly one of the hired killers.  Later, on 6 September 2010, they arrested Shiva Solanki, nephew of [[Dinu Solanki]], as the main accused in the case. According to police sources,Shiva had asked constable Bahadursinh to get Amit Jethawa eliminated. "Bahadur then planned the crime and executed it with the help of sharpshooters Shailesh Pandya and Pachan Shiva."&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Express]] [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bjp-mp-dinu-solankis-nephew-held-in-murder-of-green-activist/678374/ BJP MP Dinu Solanki's nephew held in murder of green activist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the murder occurring within months of Jethwa's case naming Dinu Solanki, and also the arrest of his nephew, investigations by Gujarat Police crime branch had ruled out any role
for Solanki himself.&lt;ref name=zee&gt;{{cite news

 | date =         5 November 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the [[Gujarat High Court]] heard an appeal in this matter by Amit Jethwa's father, and severely criticised
the investigations by the Gujarat Police.  The court commented that the investigations had been "far from fair, independent, bona fide or prompt.", 
and that Shiva Solanki and Dinu were living in the same joint family, and had very likely had some interactions.

quote: "It has come on record that Shiva Solanki and DB (Dinu Bogha Solanki) were
living together in a joint family and no investigator could have been easily
satisfied with the statements that they did not interact in respect of the
conspiracy," the court had said.
&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar cases, the Gujarat Police under the [[Narendra Modi]] government has been widely criticised for being extraordinarily politicised.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Ann Naddodsdóttir''' ({{lang-non|Ann Naddoðsdōttir}}, 900s) was possibly a daughter of [[Naddoddr]], the [[Viking]] attributed with the discovery of [[Iceland]].

Her name may appear on a gravestone.

Outside the cemetery of a church in [[Bressay]] on [[Shetland]], there was in 1864 found a stone slab from the early 10th century with [[Christian]] crosses and decorations appearing on the front and backfaces. These of [[Scandinavia]]n origins.

It also has various lettering carved along the edges in the [[ogham]] alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/1279/bressay-cullingsburgh  Cross Slab (Early Medieval), Ogham Inscribed Stone (Early Medieval)] at canmore.org.uk, last accessed on Nov 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Celtic historian [[Katherine Forsyth]] from [[Harvard University]] managed in 1996 to decipher the text as part of her Ph.D. dissertation.&lt;ref name="forsyth"&gt;Katherine S.

==Descendant theory==
Forsyth says&lt;ref name="forsyth"/&gt; that this Ann Naddodsdóttir was a Faroese Viking. The son Beinir Dróinsson (MacDroan) who raised the grave might be identical to [[Beinir Sigmundsson]] who according to [[Færeyinga saga]] was the brother of [[Brestir Sigmundsson]] who together ruled their own half of the Faroe Islands. They both died in 970. Brestir's son [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] apparently introduced Christianity to the Faroe Islands in 999. If this is true Sigmundur was of Christian faith already at birth.

'''Arash Parsania''' (born 4 April 1972), since 1991 known as '''ARASH''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/gnd/134753070 German National Library catalogue], artist information&lt;/ref&gt; is an Iranian-German composer of electronic, dance and orchestral music.{{Infobox musical artist|background = non_vocal_instrumentalist|birth_name = Arash Parsania|origin = [[Teheran]], [[Iran]]|instrument = Piano, Synthesizers, Samplers, Keyboards|years_active = 1988 - present|image = |website = http://ARASHworld.net|occupation = Composer, Musician, Producer, Arranger|name = ARASH|genre = [[electronic music|Electronic]], [[Dance Music|dance]], [[orchestral]], [[Classical Music|classical]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[New-age music|New Age]]|birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1972|4|4|df=yes}}|landscape = yes|image_size = 250|alt = ARASH in Munich, 2010}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
ARASH was born on April 4, 1972, in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. After spending a couple of years with his family in [[Paris]], [[France]], he returned to [[Iran]] when he was 7 years old, just a few months before the start of the [[Iranian revolution]]. ARASH went to the elementary and middle school in Iran before relocating to Germany at the age of 14. Despite his very strong interest in music, playing and listening to music was not allowed in the Islamic Republic, so ARASH only began playing music for the first time in Germany at the age of 16.

===Professional musical career===
Since 1988 [[electronic musical instrument]]s play the most important role in ARASH’s music. Three years later, in 1991, after having started gaining experience with [[electronic musical instrument]]s, ARASH released his first [[studio album]] ''Corpus Pineale''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyforce.de/html/body_media.html Album Reviews]  Corpus Pineale (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyforce.de/html/body_cp_haz_big.html Interview] on Corpus Pineale (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikzirkus-magazin.de/dateien/Pages/Schwingungen/radio/1993.html Radio Playlist] Schwingungen, Electronic Music for Dance (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundscapes.us/thoughtradio/playlists/2009/090110.html Radio Playlist] The AM/FM Show (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

ARASH is one of the first Iranian [[composer]]s of pure [[electronic music]] (maybe he is the very first, but there is no concrete information available yet).

1994 ARASH released a CD ''ARASH - The Compilation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memi.com/musiczone/musicbase/musiker.php3?id=3 MEMI Musicbase] Album Listing, a selection of his unreleased work until this time, mainly pure [[electronic music]]&lt;/ref&gt;

1998 ARASH released a single "Freeze" and published the next compilation album of his previously unreleased music ''Dance Traxx 1992-1998'' containing electronic instrumental and vocal based [[dance music]]. One year after releasing other Dance titles "!s Back" and "Control Me", in the year 2000 ARASH got back to his roots and released another single track "Synphonic", which was a mixture of [[Orchestral]], Electronic, and modern [[Techno Music]].

2010, after a longer break, ARASH released a new studio album ''Yearning'', the first album after ''Corpus Pineale''.

2015, five years later, ARASH has released a new studio album ''Creation''. The album consists of seven parts, from "The First Tablet" through "The Seventh Tablet", which brings the worlds of [[Orchestral]] and [[Electronic Music]] together.

In the [[Matter of Britain]], '''Sir Bedivere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|d|ᵻ|v|ɪər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|d|ᵻ|v|ɪər}}; {{lang-cy|Bedwyr}}; {{lang-fr|Bédoier}}, also spelt '''Bedevere''') is the [[Knight of the Round Table]] of [[King Arthur]] who returns [[Excalibur]] to the [[Lady of the Lake]]. He serves as Arthur's [[marshal]] and is frequently associated with [[Sir Kay]]. [[Sir Lucan]] is his brother and [[Griflet|Sir Griflet]] is his cousin.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
Bedivere is one of the earliest characters to be associated with the [[Matter of Britain]], appearing in a number of early Welsh texts in which he is named as '''Bedwyr Bedrydant''' ("Bedwyr of the Perfect Sinews"), a handsome, one-handed knight under Arthur's command. His father is given as Pedrawd or Bedrawd, and his children as Amhren and Eneuawg, both members of Arthur's court.

One of the earliest direct references to Bedwyr can be found in the 10th-century poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa Gur]]'' which recounts the exploits of a number of Arthur's knights, including Bedwyr, Cei and [[Manawydan]]. Of Bedwyr, the narrative says:

:They fell by the hundred
:before Bedwyr of the Perfect-Sinew.
:On the shores of Tryfrwyd
:fighting with [[Gwrgi Garwlwyd|Garwlwyd]]
:furious was his nature
:with sword and shield.&lt;ref name="Pa Gur"&gt;[http://www.markadderley.net/arthur/welsh-arthur/pagur.html ''Pa Gur''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723202344/http://www.markadderley.net/arthur/welsh-arthur/pagur.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 9th-century version of ''[[Englynion y Beddau]]'' ("The Stanzas of the Graves") gives Bedwyr's final resting place on [[Tryfan]].&lt;ref name="Pa Gur"/&gt; In the c.110 [[hagiography]] of [[Cadoc]], Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cei ([[Sir Kay|Kay]]) in dealing with King [[Gwynllyw]] of [[Gwynllwg]]'s abduction of [[Gwladys]] from her father's court in [[Brycheiniog]]. A possible  allusion to Bedwyr could be found in the reference to ''Bedwyr's well'' in the 9th-century ''Marwnad Cadwallon ap Cadfan''. The [[Welsh Triads]] name Bedwyr as "Battle-Diademed", and a superior to [[Tristan|Drystan]], [[Hueil mab Caw]] and even Cei.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, Rachel. ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein''.&lt;/ref&gt; A catchphrase often quipped by Cei, "by the hand of my friend" is likely a reference to Bedwyr's disability.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Sioned. ''The Mabinogion''. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedwyr is a prominent character in the tale of ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', in which he appears at the head of Arthur's court list with his friend Cei and is described as the handsomest man in the world (save for Arthur and Drych fab Cibddar), and the wielder of a magic lance. He is called upon to accompany [[Culhwch]] on his quest to win [[Olwen]]'s hand in marriage, and is the first knight to strike the giant [[Ysbaddaden]] with the poisoned spear meant for Culhwch. He goes on to assist Culhwch in completing the impossible tasks given to him by Ysbaddaden; he helps Cei and [[Goreu fab Custennin]] kill Wrnach the Giant, rescues [[Mabon ap Modron]] from his imprisonment, retrieves the hairs of Dillus the Bearded, captures the cauldron of Diwrnach during Arthur's attack on Ireland and takes part in the hunting of [[Twrch Trwyth]] with Arthur's dog Cavall at his side. The tale ends with the completion of the tasks, the humiliation and murder of Ysbaddaden, and the marriage of Culhwch and Olwen.

==Geoffrey of Monmouth and later tradition==
He is one of Arthur's loyal allies in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', and maintains this position in much later Arthurian literature. He helps Arthur and Kay fight the Giant of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], and joins Arthur in his war against [[Lucius Tiberius|Emperor Lucius of Rome]].

[[File:Sir Bedivere put King Arthur gently into the barge.png|thumb|[[William Henry Margetson]]'s illustration for ''Legends of King Arthur and His Knights'' by Janet MacDonald (1914): "Sir Bedivere put King Arthur gently into the barge."]]

In several English versions of Arthur's death, including [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', the ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'' and the ''[[Stanzaic Morte Arthur]]'', Bedivere and Arthur are among the few survivors of the [[Battle of Camlann]]. After the battle, at the request of the mortally wounded king, Bedivere throws [[Excalibur]] back to the [[Lady of the Lake]]. However, he does this only after twice thinking the sword too valuable to Britain to throw into the water. When he reports that nothing in particular happened, King Arthur admonishes him, for Arthur knows that the mystical sword would create some supernatural event.  Finally, Sir Bedivere casts the sword into the water, at which a hand arises and catches the sword mid-air, then sinks into the waters.  Arthur is thus assured that the sword has been returned.

Upon the death of Arthur, Bedivere enters a [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]], where he spends the remainder of his life (the same hermitage, led by the [[Mordred]]-ousted [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Bishop of Canterbury]], that Lancelot and some of his kindred knights will resort to in their own penitence). It is implied that both King Arthur and Queen [[Guinevere]] lie beside each other in or near this hermitage.

==Modern fiction==
Bedivere is depicted by modern authors such as [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], [[Gillian Bradshaw]], [[John M. Ford]] and [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], where he is given [[Lancelot]]'s traditional role as Guinevere's lover, Lancelot having been added to the cycle too late to seem historical. 

*Bedivere appears as main character in the novel ''Grailblazers'' by [[Tom Holt]].
*Though he plays a minor part in [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', many of his legendary deeds (such as throwing Excalibur into the lake; or in Cornwell's story, the sea) are carried out instead by the protagonist, [[Saint Derfel|Derfel Cadarn]].
*He appears in [[Philip Reeve]]'s ''[[Here Lies Arthur]]'', as Bedwyr, and befriends the main character, Gwyna/Gwyn. He is Arthur's half-sister's younger son, the older being Medrawt ([[Mordred]]). He is murdered by Arthur, for betrayal with Arthur's wife, [[Gwenhwyfar]] (Guinevere), in a similar role to the later Lancelot. This causes a family rift with Medrawt, who takes revenge by raising an army, and attacking Arthur, killing him, and taking the city of [[Aquae Sulis]] (ruled by Arthur) for himself.
*Bedivere appears in the video game and visual novel ''[[Fate/stay night]]'' from ''[[Type Moon]]'' in an epilogue. He also appears in the mobile game ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'' as a character summonable by the protagonist.
*In [[John Boorman]]'s 1981 film [[Excalibur (film)|''Excalibur'']], [[Percival]] replaces Bedivere as the knight that returns the sword to the Lady of the Lake.

{{O.K. Corral}}
'''Billy Claiborne''' (October 21, 1860 – November 14, 1882), was an American [[outlaw]] [[Cochise County Cowboys|Cowboy]], drover, miner, and [[gunfighter]] in the [[American Old West]]. He killed James Hickey in a confrontation in a saloon, but it was ruled self-defense. He was present at the beginning of the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], but was unarmed and ran from the shootout. Only a year later, while drunk, he confronted gunfighter [[Franklin Leslie|"Buckskin" Frank Leslie]] and was killed.

== Life in Texas and Arizona ==

William Floyd Claiborne was born in [[Yazoo County, Mississippi]]. As a young man he worked as a cowhand and [[remuda]] rider for [[John Horton Slaughter|John Slaughter]] and helped him drive cattle from Texas to the Arizona Territory in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nashville Franklin Leslie ("Buckskin Frank")|url=http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/pistoleer/gunfighter06.html|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tombstone, he worked on the amalgamator at mines in [[Charleston, Arizona|Charleston]], and as a slag cart driver at the Neptune Mining Company [[smelter]] in [[Hereford, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=eppinga&gt;{{cite web|url= http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2013/05/14/arizonas-billy-the-kid/ |title=Arizona's 'Billy the Kid' |first1=Jane |last1=Eppinga |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters |last=O' Neal |first=Bill |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=|isbn=978-0-8061-2335-6 |page= |pages=60–61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KLrfdOrI78C&amp;lpg=PA71|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marks"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paula Mitchell Marks |title=And Die in the West: the Story of the O.K.

=== Kills James Hickey ===

On October 1, 1881, Claiborne got into an argument with James Hickey in the Queen's Saloon in Charleston. Hickey had been drinking for three days. Harry Queen, the saloon owner and eyewitness reported on the event:

{{quote|I was present when James Hickey was killed. Hickey was standing close to the table where a game of cards was being plaid (sic) in my saloon. He turned to walk out at the same time this young fellow they called The Kid was coming into the saloon. When he saw Hickey he turned to walk out. Hickey said at that time he would like to see any Prick Eating Son of a Bitch stand in front of them. The Kid turned around and said don't follow me, you have been following me long enough and I won't stand it any longer. If you follow me any longer I will kill you. The Kid drew his pistol, raised it, and fires. Hickey turn (sic) partly around after the report of the pistol and fell on his face and left side. After The Kid told Hickey not to follow him any longer Hickey continued to advance.&lt;ref name=todd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Tom|title=Tom's Tombstone Travels: Billy Claiborne |url=http://www.tomtoddbooks.com/Documents/Billy%20Claiborne.pdf |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Claiborne shot Hickey in the cheek below his left eye, killing him instantly. Over a month later, on November 26, the trial was convened, but only four jurors showed up. The next court day, three jurors did not show up. When all of the jurors finally showed up, they asked the judge if they could convict on [[second degree murder]]. When the judge said no, they said they could not agree on a verdict and the judge declared a [[mistrial]]. A second trial was set for May 11, 1882, but most of the defense attorneys did not appear. A new trial date was set on May 15 but not enough jurors could be found. Hickey was not well-liked and when a jury was finally convened, Billy was found not guilty and set free.&lt;ref name=eppinga/&gt;&lt;ref name=todd/&gt;

In 1881, after [[William Bonney|William "Billy the Kid" Bonney]] was killed, Claiborne demanded that others call him "Billy the Kid". He reportedly killed one to three men who refused.&lt;ref name="legends"/&gt; Claiborne was a heavy drinker and hothead. He became friends with [[Ike Clanton|Ike]] and [[Billy Clanton]], and with [[Tom McLaury|Tom]] and [[Frank McLaury]].

=== Gunfight at the O.K. Corral ===
{{main|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral}}

On the morning of October 26, [[Ike Clanton]] was carrying his [[rifle]] and [[single-action revolver|revolver]] in violation of a [[Cochise County Cowboys#Weapon ordinance|city ordinance]]. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street and Virgil [[pistol whip|buffaloed]] him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace. Wallace wasn't in the courthouse, and Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace.&lt;ref name=wyatttestimony/&gt;

Wyatt spotted Tom McLaury outside the courthouse and thought he was armed. Wyatt confronted McLaury, demanding to know, "Are you heeled or not?", but McLaury denied it. Wyatt later testified that he saw a [[revolver]] in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants.&lt;ref name="Bauertestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/bauertestimony.html |title=Testimony of A.

Corral Trial}} From Turner, Alford (Ed.), ''The O. K. Corral Inquest'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; As an unpaid [[deputy sheriff|deputy]] town [[marshal]], assisting his brother and Town Marshal Virgil Earp, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his [[revolver]] from his coat pocket and [[pistol whip|buffaloed]] Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street.

At around 1:30–2:00 pm, Ike's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They stopped at the saloon in the Grand Hotel on Allen Street. Claiborne told them about their brothers' beatings at the hands of the Earp brothers within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom and Ike. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.&lt;ref name=lubet&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Lubet | first1=Steven | title=Murder in Tombstone: the Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp |year=2004 | publisher=Yale University Press | location=New Haven, CT | isbn=978-0-300-11527-7 | page=288 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuqp1zVGnzQC&amp;pg=PA38 |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Gary L. | title = Doc Holliday: The Life and Legend | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley, J | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-470-12822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|544|date=November 2012}}{{rp|190|date=November 2012}}

Frank and Billy found Ike and Tom. They went to Spangenberg's gun shop, where Frank and Billy purchased ammunition. Ike wanted to buy a gun, but seeing the bandage on Ike's head, the proprietor refused. The McLaurys left to collect some money due them for cattle they had sold. Claiborne and Billy Clanton went to get Clanton's horse. They met the others a few minutes later at the O.K. Corral. Witnesses overheard them threatening the Earps.&lt;ref name="iketestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/clantontestimony.html|title=Testimony of Ike Clanton in the Preliminary Hearing in the Earp-Holliday Case|accessdate=February 6, 2011|year=2005|editor-first=Douglas|editor-last=Linder|work=Famous Trials: The O.

K. Corral Inquest'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street, were threatening the Earps, and were armed. He decided he had to act. Meanwhile, [[Cochise County]] [[Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]], a friend to the Cowboys,&lt;ref name=epitaph1226&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021939/1881-12-26/ed-1/seq-1/ |title=Opinions of the Press |publisher=Tombstone Epitaph|volume=2 |location=Tombstone, Arizona |date=December 26, 1881 |issue=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; had heard of the trouble and he immediately went looking for the Cowboys.

In Hafford's Saloon, Behan found City Marshal Virgil Earp, who asked Behan to help him disarm the Cowboys. Instead, Behan offered to talk to the Clantons and McLaurys on his own to see if they would give up their arms. Behan left and Virgil waited several minutes when local furniture dealer John Fonck told Virgil that the Cowboys were on Fremont St. Virgil said he did not want to interfere if they were on their way out of town, but if they were armed while in town he would have to arrest them. Fonck responded, "Why, they're all down on Fremont Street now."&lt;ref name=tefertiller&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tefertiller|first1=Casey|last2=Morey|first2=Jeff|title=O.K. Corral: A Gunfight Shrouded in Mystery|url=http://www.historynet.com/ok-corral|website=HistoryNet.com|accessdate=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm the Earps and Holliday found Frank and Tom McLaury and Ike and Billy Clanton gathered near the front of an empty lot off Fremont street, next to C.S. Fly's Boarding House and Photography Studio. Behan said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would only give up his guns after City [[Marshal]] Virgil Earp and his brothers were disarmed.&lt;ref name="behantestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/behantestimony.html|title=Testimony of John Behan in the Preliminary Hearing in the Earp-Holliday Case|accessdate=February 7, 2011|editor-first=Douglas|editor-last=Linder|year=2005|work=Famous Trials: The O.

The Earps and Holliday walked north on Fourth Street and then west, down the south side west of Fremont Street, looking for the Cowboys. They passed the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral and then Bauer's butcher shop.&lt;ref name="wyatttestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/wearptestimony.html|title=Testimony of Wyatt S.

Sheriff Behan saw the Earps and Holliday approaching. He left the Cowboys and went to the lawmen, though he looked nervously backward several times.

Wyatt testified afterward that he saw "Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly's photograph gallery. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wes Fuller&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west."&lt;ref name="wyatttestimony"/&gt; Wes Fuller was towards the back of the lot.&lt;ref name="wyatttestimony"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/gunfight-at-the-ok-corral-did-tom-mclaury-have-a-gun.htm| title=Gunfight at the O.K.

== Later life ==

When the Rev. Endicott Peabody announced he would preach a sermon in Charleston in early February, 1882, against alcoholism, Claiborne wrote warning him to stay away from the subject. Peabody replied that he would preach on any subject he chose at any time and heard no more from the bullying Claiborne.
[[File:BuckskinFrankLeslie.jpg|thumb|Frank Leslie killed Claiborne in what was ruled self-defense.]]
After running from the O.K. Corral shoot out, Claiborne's reputation fell. He testified at the [[O.K. Corral hearing and aftermath|O.K. Corral Spicer hearing]], and then left [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] for several months. He went to Globe and got a job in the mines. He told a friend that he was "working double shifts to get enough money to go to Tombstone and kill Frank Leslie." Billy blamed Leslie for killing his friend [[Johnny Ringo]]. Bill return to Tombstone on November 14, 1882.&lt;ref name=correa/&gt;

=== Killed by Buckskin Leslie ===

[[Franklin Leslie|"Buckskin" Frank Leslie]] was tending bar at the Oriental Saloon on November 14, 1882 when Claiborne, who was very drunk, began using insulting and abusive language. Leslie asked Claiborne to leave, but Claiborne continued his foul and abusive speech. Leslie later testified,

{{quote|I was talking with some friends in the Oriental Saloon when Claiborne pushed his way in among us and began using very insulting language. I took him to one side and said, "Billy, don't interfere, those people are friends among themselves and are not talking about politics at all, and don't want you about." He appeared quite put out and used rather bad and certainly very nasty language towards me. I told him there was no use of his fighting with me, that there was no occasion for it, and leaving him I joined my friends. He came back again and began using exceedingly abusive language, when I took him by the collar of his coat and led him away, telling him not to get mad, that it was for his own good, that if he acted in that manner he was liable to get in trouble. He pushed away from me, using very hard language, and as he started away from me, shook a finger at me and said, "That's all right, Leslie, I'll get even on you," and went out of the saloon.&lt;ref name=correa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tom|first1=Correa|title=The Tombstone Epitaph, Leslie's Luck |url=http://www.americancowboychronicles.com/2015/10/the-tombstone-epitaph-leslies-luck.html|accessdate=February 27, 2016 |publisher=Tombstone Epitaph |date=November 18, 1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epitaph111982&gt;''Tombstone Epitaph'', Saturday, November 18, 1882&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within a few minutes, two men told Leslie there was a man waiting outside to shoot him. When Leslie stepped outside, he saw "a foot of rifle barrel protruding from the end of the fruit stand." He told Claiborne "Don't shoot, I don't want you to kill me, nor do I want to have to shoot you."&lt;ref name=correa/&gt; but Claiborne, still drunk, raised his rifle and fired the weapon, missing Leslie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5130">'''Christopher Tarnovsky''' (born 20 April 1971, [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an [[integrated circuit]] [[reverse engineering]] specialist or [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] who has come to public attention.&lt;ref name="Neil Chenoweth"&gt;Chenoweth N. [https://books.google.com/books?id=v_btAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Christopher+Tarnovsky&amp;dq=Christopher+Tarnovsky&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqWYT4OvFs2k4ASkyY3FBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA ''Rupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Media Wizard.''] Crown Business 12 November 2002. p. 353. {{ISBN|978-0609610381}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career==
Tarnovsky has a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;ref name="Zetter 2008"/&gt; In the 1990s, Tarnovsky was a soldier in the [[United States]] army in the field of intelligence, security and cryptography.&lt;ref name="Zetter 2008"/&gt; In 2013, Tarnovsky was vice president of semiconductor services at IOActive, a security company in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot D. [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/519201/tamper-proof-chips-with-some-work-might-give-up-their-secrets/ ''“Tamper-Proof” Chips, with Some Work, Might Give Up Their Secrets.''] MIT Technology Review 11 September 2013. Accessed 30 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal action ==
In 2001, [[DirecTV]], a client of [[NDS Group|NDS]], a company majority owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[Newscorp]], demanded Tarnovsky be kept away from their systems. Plaintiffs DirecTV, Dish Network and Nagrastar alleged Tarnovsky was hacking the protections they placed on their [[set-top box]] smart cards which were used to lock transmission from customers who defaulted.&lt;ref name="Zetter 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cash in News"&gt;Chenoweth N. [http://afr.com/p/national/cash_in_news_budget_for_police_informants_3cXq07JsdSNAfZgQp4sWVO ''Cash in News budget for police informants.''] The Australian Financial Review. 4 April 2012.

Accessed 29 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997 to 2007, Tarnovsky worked for [[NDS Group|NDS]] developing copy protection technology.&lt;ref name="Zetter 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everett"&gt;Everett D. [http://www.smartcard.co.uk/articles/Whatthesiliconmanufacturerhasputtogetherletnomanputasunder.php ''What the silicon manufacturer has put together let no man put asunder.''] Smartcard.co.uk March 2010. Accessed 29 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Canal+|Canal Plus]], a [[France|French]] premium [[cable television]] commenced a civil action against NDS and Tarnovsky. Tarnovsky was alleged to have extracted the source code of a [[Mediaguard|SECA]] card and then on 26 March 1999 [[upload]]ed it to a [[file sharing]] website.&lt;ref name=Chenoweth&gt;Chenoweth N. [http://afr.com/p/business/marketing_media/murdoch_inside_job_sZrtO3tNzsy2TD1Z3TpNvJ ''Murdoch's inside job.''] [[The Australian Financial Review]]. 31 March 2012. Accessed 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A jury later largely cleared NDS and Tarnovsky.&lt;ref name="Zetter 2008"&gt;Zetter K.

Accessed 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Tarnovsky was dismissed from NDS for copyright infringement while in their employ. Tarnovsky denies this accusation.&lt;ref name="Zetter 2008"/&gt;

== Acts of hacking ==
In 2008, Tarnovsky broke into a [[Trusted Platform Module]], a type of chip used in the [[Xbox 360]] for example.&lt;ref name="Everett"/&gt; Tarnovsky required nine months of study to discover the main contents of the module.&lt;ref name=Tilborg&gt;Van Tilborg H.

In 2010, at a [[Black Hat]] [[Washington, District of Columbia|Washington DC]] conference, Tarnovsky described how he had used acid, an [[electron microscope]] and small conductive needles to hack the [[Infineon]] SLE66 CL PE chip.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens T.

'''Christy Dignam''' is the lead singer of the popular Irish rock band [[Aslan (band)|Aslan]].  His career of over twenty-five years has been characterised by numerous successes on the Irish charts as well as recurring problems with drug addiction and recovery.

==Early life==
Born at Holles Street Hospital in [[Dublin]] on 23 May 1960, Dignam grew up in the North Dublin suburb of [[Finglas]]. He studied the classical art of [[bel canto]] singing with teacher Frank Merriman at the Bel Canto House School of Singing in Dublin. At the age of six, he was [[rape|raped]] by a neighbour. This continued to occur over a three-year period until, at the age of nine, Dignam sought help from his best friend's brother, a man in his twenties. During the meeting with his best friend's brother, Dignam explained his situation and he was then raped by this man as well. Dignam later suggested his drug addiction may have resulted from the [[psychological trauma]] caused by these events.&lt;ref name="pride"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dromey |first=Paul |title=The Pride of Lions |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=29 May 2001 |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2001/05/29/story4175.asp |accessdate=11 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030415030651/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2001/05/29/story4175.asp |archivedate=15 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Dignam formed an early version of Aslan called Meelah XVIII. Meelah XVIII created a recording for ''[[The Dave Fanning Show]]'' on [[2FM]] in 1980. The Meelah XVIII songs "Toy Soldier" and "Meelah Pt. 2" were included on the Aslan triple CD, The "Rarities" disc from "The Platinum Collection". Meelah XVIII musicians were Christy Dignam, Tony Talbot, Mick McKenna, Joe Jewell, and Gerry Conlon.

As Aslan singles "This Is", "Please Don't Stop", "Loving Me Lately", "Pretty Thing" and "Feel No Shame" became popular, Dignam's relationship with his bandmates was becoming strained due to his problems with heroin addiction. On Wednesday 7 September 1988, ''[[Irish Daily Star|The Star]]'' newspaper ran with the headline "ASLAN: IT'S THE END", informing the public of Dignam's separation from Aslan. The remaining members of the band continued as Aslan for some time (with a new lead singer, Eamon Doyle) before the band eventually split. Dignam went solo with guitarist Conor Goff, forming [[Dignam &amp; Goff]].

However, on 11 July 1993 Aslan reformed, for what was supposed to be a "once off gig" in [[Finglas]]. With a reignited spark and new material, Aslan continued to become one of Ireland's most successful and hard-working bands.&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt; Their studio albums include "Feel No Shame", "Goodbye Charlie Moonhead", "Here Comes Lucy Jones" and "Waiting for the Madness To End". They have had two "best of" albums: ''Shame About Lucy Moonhead'' and the triple album ''The Platinum Collection''. They have also had a best-selling live album ''Made In Dublin'' and an official bootleg album (available at gigs) called ''Aslan Live At The Olympia'' which features appearances from [[Jerry Fish and the Mudbug Club|Jerry Fish]], Relish and [[Damien Rice]].

==Influences==
Dignam lists [[Tom Waits]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[David Bowie]], [[Marc Bolan|T-Rex]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Phil Lynott]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[John Lennon]] as his musical influences. He has also been listed as influencing groups like [[Damien Dempsey]], [[Jerry Fish and the Mudbug Club|Jerry Fish]], [[Damien Rice]], George Murphy, [[Rob Smith (Irish musician)|Rob Smith]], [[Alabama 3]], and more.

==Personal life==
Dignam has been married for more than 20 years to his wife Kathryn, and has a daughter, Kiera, who is also a singer. He has two grandsons, Cian &amp; Jake and a granddaughter, Ava.

==Health==
Dignam turned to heroin in the 1980s, and his involvement with the drug caused conflicts which led to his eventual departure from Aslan.

He entered multiple drug treatment programs, including a stint in a rehab program in a Buddhist monastery, [[Wat Tham Krabok]], in [[Thailand]] in 2004. This was featured in the documentary ''Heroin: Facing The Dragon''.&lt;ref name="RTE"&gt;Dignam, Christy. "Interview with [[Pat Kenny]]".  ''The Late, Late Show''.  [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTĔ Television]], Ireland. 12 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dignam recounted his story of drug addiction in his autobiography, ''This is Christy Dignam'', co-written by journalist Neil Fetherstonhaugh and published by Merlin Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Cancer diagnosis===
Dignam was initially admitted to hospital with a suspected chest infection; this progressed to [[pneumonia]]. After numerous tests were carried out in March 2013, he was diagnosed with [[amyloidosis]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2013/0313/aslan.html|title=Aslan star Christy diagnosed with cancer|work=RTÉ Ten|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to consciousness Dignam spoke of having had a near-death experience that prompted doctors to inject him with two shots of adrenaline. Dignam said, "There was a blockage in my arm where the adrenaline was going in so they had to slit the side of my neck, straight into the jugular and right down into my heart. I felt like I had died for a minute or so, nothing seemed to matter, then suddenly the adrenaline restarted my heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Sweeney|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/singer-christy-dignam-speaks-of-cancer-battle-29172088.html|title=Singer Christy Dignam speaks of cancer battle|newspaper=Evening Herald|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent [[chemotherapy]] for the condition, and as of September 2017, continues to receive chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/theres-no-point-in-cancelling-anything-christy-dignam-says-the-show-must-go-on-despite-incurable-blood-cancer-36115550.html|title='There's no point in cancelling anything,' Christy Dignam says the show must go on despite incurable blood cancer|author=Allison Bray|publisher=Irish Independent|date=9 September 2017|accessdate=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crawford Hallock Greenewalt''' (August 16, 1902 – September 28, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemical engineer]] who served as president of the [[DuPont Company]] from 1948 to 1962 and as board chairman from 1962 to 1967.

==Life and career==

Greenewalt was born in [[Cummington, Massachusetts]]. In 1922 he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he joined [[Theta Chi]] Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rattle of Theta Chi'', Summer 1954, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a Life Member of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Organization and administration|MIT Corporation]] in 1951, and emeritus in 1977.

Greenewalt and his wife Margaretta (née [[Du Pont family|Du Pont]]) had two sons, [[Crawford Hallock Greenewalt, Jr.|Crawford "Greenie" Greenewalt Jr.]] (1937-2012) and David Greenewalt, and daughter, Nancy L. Frederick. The younger Crawford was a professor of classical archaeology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] who was among the leaders of the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis. David died in 2003.

While at DuPont, Greenewalt was a key figure in their development of [[nylon]] and their [[nuclear power]] program. He was awarded the [[Lavoisier Medal#Dupont|Lavoisier Medal for Technical Achievement]] by the DuPont Company in 1991.

His widely varied interests included [[ornithology]] and [[high-speed photography]] via his friend [[Harold Eugene Edgerton|Harold E. "Doc" Edgerton]]. Greenewalt published a book of 70 high-speed photographs of [[hummingbirds]] in 1960. In 1968 he published ''Bird Song: Acoustics and Physiology''. He also served as president of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

He died in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] one day after having a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="techtalk1993"&gt;Staff report (September 29, 1993) [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1993/greenewalt-0929.html Crawford Greenewalt of DuPont Dies.] MIT Tech Talk (Volume 38, Number 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenewalt is the subject of the film ''The Uncommon Man: Crawford H. Greenewalt'', produced by the [[Atomic Heritage Foundation]].

'''Doctor Mabuse''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Norbert Jacques]] in the novel ''Dr. Mabuse der Spieler'' and made famous by the three movies director [[Fritz Lang]] made about the character; see ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]''.  Although the character was designed deliberately to mimic villains such as Dr. [[Fu Manchu]], Doctor Nikola, [[Fantômas]], or [[Svengali]], the latter of which was a direct inspiration, Jacques' goals were commercial success and to make political comments, in much the same way that the [[silent film|silent movie]] ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) had done just a few years previously.

== Description ==
Dr. Mabuse is a master of disguise and [[telepathic]] [[hypnosis]] known to employ body [[transference]], most often through [[demonic possession]] but sometimes utilizing object [[technologies]] such as [[television]] or [[phonograph]] machines, to build a "[[society]] of [[crime]]". Mabuse rarely commits his crimes in person, instead operating primarily through a network of agents enacting his schemes. Mabuse's agents range from career criminals working for him, to innocents [[blackmail]]ed or hypnotized into cooperation, to dupes [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] so successfully that they do not realize that they are doing exactly what Mabuse planned for them to do.

Mabuse's identity often changes; one "Dr. Mabuse" may be defeated and sent to an asylum, jail or the grave, only for a new "Dr. Mabuse" to later appear, as depicted in ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse''.  The replacement invariably has the same methods, the same powers of hypnosis and the same criminal [[genius]]. There are even suggestions in some instalments of the series, that the "real" Mabuse is some sort of [[Spiritual being|spirit]] that [[Spiritual possession|possesses]] a series of hosts.

== History ==
He first appeared in the 1921 [[novel]] ''Dr. Mabuse der Spieler'' ("Dr. Mabuse The Gambler") by [[Norbert Jacques]]. The novel benefitted from unprecedented publicity and quickly became a best-seller. Lang, already an accomplished director, worked with his wife [[Thea von Harbou]] on a revision of the novel to bring it to the screen, where it also became a great success. The film ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler|Dr. Mabuse der Spieler]]'' (1922), with a playing time of more than four hours, was released in two sections: ''The Great Gambler: An Image of the Time'' and ''Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age.''

After the great successes of the novel and the movie, it was almost a decade before anything more was done with the character.  Jacques had been working on a sequel to the novel, named ''Mabuse's Colony'', in which Mabuse has died and a group of his devotees are starting an island colony, based on the principles described by Mabuse's [[manifesto]]. However, the novel was unfinished. After conversations with Lang and von Harbou, Jacques agreed to discontinue the novel and the sequel instead became the 1933 movie ''[[The Testament of Dr. Mabuse|Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse]]'', in which the Mabuse of 1920 (still played by [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]]) is an inmate in an [[psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]] but has for some time been obsessively writing meticulous plans for crime and [[terrorism]]—plans that are being performed by a gang of criminals outside the asylum, who receive their orders from a person who has identified himself to them only as Dr. Mabuse.

[[File:Metehanzade orhangazi.jpg|thumb|100px|The husband of Eftandise, [[Orhan]]]]
'''Eftandise Hatun''' was the wife of Sultan [[Orhan of the Ottoman Empire]]. She is also known as '''Eftendize'''/'''Aftandisa''' or simply as '''Efendi'''.

==Life==
Efendi, identified as "Eftendize" in the record of a land grant Orhan made to her as his wife, may have been Orhan’s cousin, the daughter of [[Osman I|Osman]]’s brother [[Ertuğrul|Gündüz]].&lt;ref name="leslie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie P. Peirce|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=106–107|isbn=978-0-195-08677-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, this [[List of coupled cousins|first cousin-marriage]] may have functioned to seal Gündüz’s loyalty to Osman.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; Kepecioğlu states, perhaps on the basis of the land record he cites, that Eftendize was the daughter of Akbaşlu Mahmud Alp, but does not posit any relation between Orhan and his wife.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; 

In the endowment deed published by Uzunçarşılı ("Gazi Orhan Bey Vakfiyesi"), Efendi is listed as the daughter of Akbaşlu.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; This was the name, or probably ''lakab'' (nickname), of Orhan’s uncle, and it is on the basis that Uzunçarşılı concludes that Efendi was Orhan's cousin;&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; further possible evidence is that [[Süleyman Pasha (son of Orhan)|Suleiman’s daughter Efendi]], probably named after her mother, had a son named Gündüz, who was probably named after this ancestor.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; Uzunçarşılı is not aware that Efendi/Eftendize was Orhan’s wife.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt;

The '''ethnography of Argentina''' makes this country, along with other areas of relatively modern settlement like [[Demography of Canada|Canada]], [[Demography of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Demography of Australia|Australia]] or [[Demography of New Zealand|New Zealand]], a ''crisol de razas'' (race crucible), or a [[melting pot]] of different peoples. In fact, [[immigration to Argentina]] was so strong that it eventually became the country with the second highest number of immigrants, with 6.6 million, second only to the United States with 27 million, and ahead of such other immigratory receptors such as Canada, Brazil and Australia.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 June 2007|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 June 2007|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor+and+Immigration+in+LA-2005.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 August 2011|title=Wayback Machine|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the [[independence of Argentina]], the newborn country had a large territory but was thinly populated, and its ethnic composition was largely the same from the colonial era that had lasted from 16th to early 19th centuries. In the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive due to newly established Constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and due to issues in the [[Old World]] such as wars, poverty, hunger, social unrest and pursuit for opportunities or a better life in the [[New World]]. This immigration was mostly from Europe but also from the [[Arab world]], Russia and Japan.

Thus, most Argentines are descendants of these 19th and 20th century immigrants, with about 97% of the population being of [[European ethnic groups|European]] or partial European descent and [[mestizo]]. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Argentina.html|title=Argentina|first=Ben|last=Cahoon|website=www.worldstatesmen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ar.html#People |title=Argentina (People) |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arab Argentine|Arab]] descent is also significant (mostly of [[Syrian people|Syrian]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] origin) and the [[Jewish Argentine|Jewish]] population is the biggest in all Latin America (7th in the world). [[Mestizo]] population in [[Argentina]], unlike in other Latin American countries, is very low, as is the [[Afro-Argentine|Black]] population after being decimated by diseases and wars in the 19th century, though since the 1990s a new wave of Black immigration has been arriving. [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|Native Argentines]] on the other hand have significant populations in the country's North-West ([[Quechua people|Quechua]], [[Diaguita]], [[Kolla people|Kolla]], [[Aymara people|Aymara]]); in the North-East ([[Guaraní people|Guaraní]], [[Mocoví people|Mocoví]], [[Toba people|Toba]], [[Wichí]]); and in the [[Patagonia]] or South ([[Mapuche]], [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]]). [[Asian-Argentine|Asian]] peoples have increasing minorities in some [[Buenos Aires]] neighborhoods and are expanding to other large Argentine cities. Through the centuries people from neighboring countries like [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Peru]] have also immigrated to [[Argentina]] and established important communities.

===Arrival of the European immigrants===

{{See also|Immigration in Argentina}}
The number and composition of the population was stable until 1853, when the national government, after passing a [[Argentine Constitution of 1853|constitution]], started a campaign to attract European immigration to populate the country. This state policy lasted several decades. At first the number of immigrants was modest compared to other countries such as the United States (though the number of immigrants was steadily increasing as they moved to the rural areas to settle and to found ''colonias'' like those of Italian, German, Swiss, or French origin), but in the 1870s, due to the economic crisis in Europe, it started to increase, reaching an extremely high rate between 1890 and 1930. Unofficial records show that, during the 1860s, 160,000 immigrants arrived in Argentina, while in the 1880s the net number increased to 841,000, almost doubling the population of the country in that decade.

Between 1857 and 1950, 6,611,000 European immigrants arrived in Argentina, making it the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, only second to the United States with 27 million, and ahead of such other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay and permanently changing the ethnography of Argentina.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;

Immigrants arrived through the port of [[Buenos Aires]] and many stayed in the capital or within [[Buenos Aires Province]] and this still happens today. In 1895, immigrants accounted for 52% of the population in the capital, and 31% in the province of Buenos Aires (some provinces of the [[littoral]], such as [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], had about 40%, and the [[Patagonia]]n provinces had about 50%).

Waves of immigrants from European countries arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over 30 percent of the country's population was born overseas by 1914, and half of the population in Buenos Aires and [[Rosario]] was foreign-born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://alhim.revues.org/document432.html|title=Dinámica migratoria: coyuntura y estructura en la Argentina de fines del XX|first1=Guillermo Angel|last1=Velázquez|first2=Sebastián Gómez|last2=Lende|date=3 November 2004|journal=Amérique Latine Histoire et Mémoire.

''Argentina: 1516–1982.'' University of California Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hotel de Inmigrantes]], built in 1906 to accommodate the 100,000 to 200,000 yearly arrivals at the Port of Buenos Aires, was made a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|National Historic Monument]].

===Italians===
{{Main|Italian Argentines}}

Italian immigration to Argentina began in the 19th century, just after Argentina won its independence from Spain. 
Argentine culture has significant connections to Italian culture, in terms of language, customs and traditions.&lt;ref name="oni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/olimpi98/BajarondelosBarcos/frames.htm|title=O.N.I.-Department of Education of Argentina|website=Oni.escuelas.edu.ar|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italians became firmly established throughout Argentina, with the greatest concentrations in the city of [[Buenos Aires]],  [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Santa Fe Province]], [[Entre Ríos Province]], [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba Province]], [[Tucumán Province]], [[La Pampa Province]], and the nearby country of [[Uruguay]].

There are many reasons for the Italian immigration to Argentina: Italy was enduring economic problems caused mainly by the [[Italian unification|unification of the Italian states into one nation]]. The country was impoverished, unemployment was rampant, certain areas were overpopulated, and Italy was subject to significant political turmoil. Italians saw in Argentina a chance to build for themselves a brand new life.

The [[Italian people|Italian]] population in Argentina is the second largest in the world, by numbers, outside of Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/25/elmundo/i-04201.htm|title=Varios argentinos, en carrera por una banca en el Parlamento italiano|website=Clarin.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 25 million people. Italians form a majority of the population of Argentina and neighbouring [[Uruguay]] as up to two-third have some Italian background; among the Latin American countries, only Brazil has more people of Italian descent (28 million, approximately 15 percent of Brazil's total population).

===Germans===
{{disputed section|date=April 2014}}
{{see also|German Argentine}}
[[File:Multitud Crespo.jpg|thumb|300px|German Argentines from [[Crespo, Entre Ríos]] ([[Volga Germans|Volga German]] descendants)]]
German immigration to Argentina occurred during five main time periods: pre–1870, 1870–1914, 1918–1933, 1933–1940 and post–1945.

Argentina and Germany have long had close ties to each other. A flourishing trade developed between them as early as the German Unification, and Germany had a privileged position in the Argentine economy. Later, Argentina maintained a strong economic relationship with both Germany and Great Britain and supported them with supplies during World War I.

There are around 50,000 German descendants living in Buenos Aires. After the United States and Brazil, Argentina is among the nations with the largest number of German descendants in the world, together with Australia, Canada, South Africa and France. They arrived in the 19th century and then before and after World War II. Their arrival continued over an extended period, from the middle to end of the 19th century, until 1960 of the 20th century. Germans, Swiss, Belgian, Luxembourg and French people founded the Colony of Esperanza, establishing the first agricultural colony and then founding others.

Germans are one of the largest ethnic groups of Argentina and have had one of the biggest impacts in the Argentine culture. The influence of their culture has also impacted Argentinian cuisine; this trend is especially apparent in the field of desserts. The pastries known as facturas are Germanic in origin: croissants, known as medialunas ("half-moons", from German "Halbmond"), are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and lard-based. Also German in origin are the "Berliner" known as bolas de Fraile ("friar's balls"), and the rolls called piononos.

The facturas were re-christened with local names given the difficult phonology of German, and usually Argentinized by the addition of a dulce de leche filling. That was also the case with the "Kreppel", called torta fritas in Argentina, which were introduced by German immigrants, and similarly with the "Achtzig Schlag" cake, translated as torta ochenta golpes. In addition, dishes like chucrut (sauerkraut) and many different kinds of sausage like bratwurst have made it into mainstream Argentine cuisine.

===French===
[[File:Villanougues chapel tucuman.JPG|thumb|250px|A chapel in Villa Nogués.]]
{{see also|French Argentine}}
French immigration has left a significant mark on Argentina, with a notable influence on the [[arts]], [[culture]], [[science]] and society of the country. Many emblematic buildings in cities like [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]], and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] were built following French [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] styles, such as the [[Argentine National Congress]], the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]], or the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] building. In particular, [[landscape architect]] [[Carlos Thays]], in his position as 1891 Director of Parks and Walkways, is largely responsible for planting thousands of trees, creating the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]] and giving the city many of its parks and plazas that are sometimes compared to similar designs in Paris.

While Argentines of French descent make up a substantial percent of the Argentine population, they are less visible than other similarly-sized ethnic groups. This is due to the high degree of assimilation and the lack of substantial French colonies throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canalacademie.com/Les-merveilleux-francophiles,1009.html |title=Canal Académie: Les merveilleux francophiles argentins  |quote=Il faut savoir qu’en 2006, 17% d'Argentins ont un ancêtre venu de France. Près de 6 millions d'Argentins ont donc des origines françaises. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spaniards===
{{see also|Spanish Argentine}}
Argentine elites diminished the [[Culture of Spain|Spanish culture]] from their culture in the newly independent country and created [[Culture of Argentina|Argentine culture]].

Between 1857 and 1940 more than 2 million Spanish people emigrated to Argentina, mostly from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] in northern Spain, [[Catalonia]] in northeast Spain, and also from [[Andalusia]] in southern Spain.

===Scandinavians===
Scandinavians arrived in Argentina around 1909. The first ones settled in the northeastern area and founded a city called Villa Svea (now called Oberá). It was composed of Swedes, Norwegians and Finns. Russians, Germans, English and Danish joined them before and after World War I and spread throughout the country.

===Austrians===
Austrians settled throughout the country in the late 19th century.

===Swiss===
{{see also|Swiss Argentine}}
Approximately 44,000 Swiss emigrated to Argentina until 1940, and settled mainly in the provinces of Córdoba and Santa Fe and, to a lesser extent, in Buenos Aires.

===British===
[[File:BelgranoRlapampa.JPG|thumb|right|200px|English-style houses on a residential street in Belgrano R.]]
Around 100,000 British immigrants arrived between 1857 and 1940. The British community founded solid institutions like the British Hospital in Buenos Aires, the ''Herald'' newspaper, prestigious bilingual schools and clubs as the Lawn Tennis Club and Hurlingham Club. British immigrants had a strong impact on the taste of Argentine sports through the development of football, polo, hockey, and rugby, among others.

Today, there are over 350,000 Argentinians with ancestry from the [[British Isles]].{{Clarify|reason = Ireland is in the British Isles and below the article says, 500,000 to 1 million Argentines have Irish ancestry.|date=February 2016}}

===Armenians===
{{see also|Armenian Argentine}}
The Armenians came in different time periods. The first wave was in the late 19th century, as a result of the [[Adana massacres]] and such targeted at Armenians in the region of [[Cilicia]]. The second (and largest) wave was from the 1910s to the 1930s, originated solely by the [[Armenian Genocide]]. [[Armenophobia]] rose again in Turkey in the mid-20th century, and created the final migration of Armenians to the world – some of them arrived in Argentina and formed a separate third wave. The last wave was a result of the fall of the Soviet Union.

There are around 100,000 Armenians in Argentina, most of them in the Palermo neighborhood, [[Buenos Aires]].

===Bulgarians===
Bulgarian immigration in Argentina began intensively in the 1920s and had a second boom period between 1937 and 1938. Most of them were farmers from the northern regions of Bulgaria. Most settled in the province of Chaco.

===Czechs===
The Czechs were also part of the great immigration of the early 20th century. Most of their descendants live in the provinces of Chaco and Mendoza, in the country.

===Irish===
{{see also|Irish Argentine}}
The Irish emigrated to Argentina in the 19th century, between 1830 and 1875. They extended throughout the country, especially in the provinces of Santa Fe, Entre Rios and Córdoba. The modern Irish-Argentine community is estimated at 500,000-1,000,000.{{Clarify|reason = Contradicts figure for British Isles given above.|date=February 2016}} Argentina is the home of the fifth largest Irish community in the world.&lt;ref name="westernpeople.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story/?trs=mhgbauojey |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218213833/http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story/?trs=mhgbauojey |archivedate=2007-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuanians===
The Lithuanians arrived mostly after the First World War, between 1925 and 1930, and settled mainly in Buenos Aires, Berisso and Rosario.

===Luxembourgers===
From 1888 to 1890, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was literally overwhelmed by a transatlantic migration wave, the so-called "Argentinienfieber" - an expression which could be translated into English by "the Argentine fever symptom". In less than two years, more than one thousand Luxembourgers - representing 0.5 per cent of the entire population - decided to emigrate to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdmh.lu/resources/pdf/_base_3/9787472203634.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107170201/http://cdmh.lu/resources/pdf/_base_3/9787472203634.pdf |archive-date=2017-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch===
The first organized immigration from the Netherlands occurred in 1889, when immigrants came from the area of Friesland. A second immigration took place around 1924. Most of them settled in Mar del Plata, Bahía Blanca, Comodoro Rivadavia, and Chubut.

===Polish===
Organized Polish immigration began in 1897 and had a decisive influence in the Argentine population. Between the two world wars (1918–1939) large numbers of Poles emigrated. They mostly settled in Llavallol, San Justo, Valentín Alsina, San Martin, and Quilmes. Between 1946 and 1950 around one hundred thousand Poles settled in the country.

===Russians===
There is a significant number of Russians in Argentina. Most reside in Buenos Aires and northeastern areas. The majority of them arrived between 1880 and 1921. Another small wave arrived in the country in early 1990.

===Ukrainians===
[[File:Ukrainianobera2.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Ukrainian Argentines on parade in [[Misiones Province]].]]
{{see also|Ukrainian Argentine}}
Ukrainian regular immigration to Argentina began in the 19th century. The first Ukrainian settlement in the country was in 1897. Subsequently, groups of immigrants settled in Buenos Aires, Misiones, Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Mendoza, Río Negro, and Entre Ríos. Although the Argentine census does not provide data on ethnic origins, estimates of the Ukrainian population range from 305,000 to 500,000 people (the latter figure making Ukrainians up to 1% of the total Argentine population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucrania.com/article_read.asp?id=69|title=Article
|accessdate=2007-08-05|work=Ucrania.com|language=Spanish |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050207175738/http://ucrania.com/article_read.asp?id=69|archivedate=2005-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welsh===
The Welsh settlement in Argentina – known in Welsh as "[[Y Wladfa]]" – began in 1865 and occurred mainly along the coast of Chubut Province in the far southern region of Patagonia. In the 19th and early 20th century the Argentine government encouraged the immigration of Europeans to populate the country outside the Buenos Aires region; between 1856 and 1875 no fewer than 34 settlements of immigrants of various nationalities were established between Santa Fe and Entre Ríos. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe by 44 Welsh people who left Chubut, and another group settled at Coronel Suárez in southern Buenos Aires Province. In the early 21st century, around 50,000 Patagonians are of Welsh descent. The Welsh-Argentine community is centered around Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin. By Chubut's own estimate, the number of Welsh speakers is about 25,000.

===Jewish===
The overwhelming majority of [[Argentine Jew|Argentina's Jewish community]] derives from immigrants of Northern, Central, and Eastern European origin ([[Ashkenazi Jews]]). Argentina's [[Jewish]] population is, by far, the largest in all of Latin America and is the fifth largest in the world. [[Buenos Aires]] itself is said to have over 100,000 practicing Jews, making it one of the largest Jewish urban centers in the world (see also [[History of the Jews in Argentina]]).

===Arabs and Levantines===
There are 1,300,000–3,500,000 Argentines whose ancestry traces back to any of various waves of immigrants, largely of [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|levantine]] cultural and linguistic heritage and/or [[Identity (social science)|identity]].

Most Levantine Argentines are from either Lebanese or Syrian background, originating mainly from what is now [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. There are people from other Arabic speaking countries in lesser numbers. Most are [[Christians]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] ([[Maronite]]) Churches. The first Levantines settled in Argentina in the 19th century, and most who came during this time period were Sirio-Lebanese. From 1891 to 1920, 367,348 people of Levantines heritage immigrated into Argentina.&lt;ref name="oni"/&gt; When they were first processed in the ports of [[Argentina]], they were classified as Turks because modern-day [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] were then occupied by the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]].

=== Amerindians ===
[[File:Macri con Félix Diaz.jpg|thumb|Native rights activist [[Félix Díaz (cacique)|Félix Díaz]] meets President [[Mauricio Macri]]]]
There are [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|Amerindian]] groups like the [[Toba people|Toba]]s, [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, [[Guarani people|Guaraní]]es and [[Mapuche]]s, among others, who still maintain their cultural roots, but are under continuous pressure for religious and idiomatic integration.

The local natives who speak [[Quechua language|Quechua]] adopted that language either after they were conquered by the [[Inca Empire]] (that reached Tucumán) or by the teachings of the Spanish religious missionaries who came from [[Peru]] to today's [[Santiago del Estero Province]]; the language is quickly losing importance. The Survey on Indigenous Populations, published by the National Institute for Statistics and Census, gives a total of 600,329 people who see themselves as descending from or belonging to an indigenous people, representing 1.5% of Argentina's population.&lt;ref name=iwgia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwgia.org/regions/latin-america/argentina |title=Indigenous Peoples in Argentina |work=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent study of 246 individuals, up to 30% of this population could have varying degrees of Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2009.00556.x | volume=74 | title=Inferring Continental Ancestry of Argentineans from Autosomal, Y-Chromosomal and Mitochondrial DNA | journal=Annals of Human Genetics | pages=65–76 | last1 = Corach | first1 = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africans===
{{main|Afro-Argentines}}
The black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and [[Mulatto]] people), to 1% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from [[Cape Verde]]).

[[Afro-Argentine]]s were up to a third of the population during [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata|colonial times]], most of them slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The [[Asamblea del Año XIII|1813 Assembly]] [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished slavery]] and led to the [[Freedom of Wombs]] Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. During the [[Argentine War of Independence|wars of independence]] (1810–21) and the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] (1865–70), the male cohort within this ethnic group was reduced when thousands of black citizens were forcefully recruited and used as front-line soldiers.

===Asians===
{{main|Asian-Argentines}}
The first [[Asian-Argentines]] were of Japanese descent, arriving in the 1900s. For most of the 20th century they were the only Asians in Argentina. Japanese immigrants were primarily from the island of [[Okinawa]]; the majority of [[dry cleaning]] establishments in Buenos Aires were, by the mid-20th century, Japanese businesses. During the 1970s the main Asian influx was from China, and during the 1990s from [[South Korea]] and [[Laos]]. Unlike most immigrants who arrived earlier in the century, they tended to remain in close social circles and not mix with other local ethnicities. This excluded the Japanese who were the first to arrive and therefore the first to produce a native generation of mixed race Japanese-Argentines, thus integrating more so than the other Asian groups.

The Japanese-Argentine population assimilated well into Argentine society, and nearly 78% of the fourth generation of Japanese-Argentines ([[Yonsei (fourth-generation Nikkei)|Yonsei]]) are of mixed European and Japanese descent, mostly intermixed with immigrants from Italy and Spain, and in lesser number from the United Kingdom, France (mainly Occitania), Germany and Switzerland. The use of Japanese language has declined in Argentina and the Japanese-Argentine citizens speak the nation's national language, Spanish, although a minority of them only speak Japanese when living with a Japanese-born relative at home, but when they are living with Argentine-born relatives they only speak Spanish.

==Immigration from neighbouring countries==
Among the most numerous immigrants from neighbouring countries are [[Paraguayans]] (the biggest foreign community), [[Bolivia]]ns, [[Peruvians]], and in lesser number [[Ecuadorians]] and [[Brazilians]].
There have been reports of discrimination to these groups, as well as exploitation; [[Policía Bonaerense|Buenos Aires Police]] have released Bolivian citizens working in textile factories, some run by [[South Korea]]n immigrants.

[[Uruguayans]] represent a special case; many have crossed the [[Río de la Plata]] to live in Argentina, mainly in [[Buenos Aires]], searching for opportunities in the bigger country. Given their cultural resemblances with the [[porteño]]s, they are rarely discriminated against.

===Television===
(Alphabetical by series)
* In ''[[Babylon 5]]'' the Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari refers to his three unloved wives as "Famine", "Pestilence" and "Death", which is ironic as apparently such labelling leaves the title of "War" to himself.

* In the ''[[Charmed]]'' episode "Apocalypse Not", the horsemen are depicted as well-dressed demons who run the Apocalypse like a business, and have to try to bring it about by a certain time or they will be vanquished by [[The Source (Charmed)|the Source of all Evil]]. Although the sisters temporarily trap War in a dimensional portal, they are forced to work with the other three Horsemen when [[Prue Halliwell]] is trapped in the rift as well, but the sisters' willingness to leave Prue in the portal to stop the Horsemen by keeping War trapped prompts the higher powers to release Prue as their willingness to sacrifice their sister for the world suggests that the Apocalypse will not succeed. Interesting to note, Conquest was replaced by Strife, instead of the usual proxy of Pestilence.
* ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', an American [[late night television|late night]] [[news satire]] television program, features a recurring segment called "[[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report#Four Horsemen of the A-Pop-calypse|Four Horsemen of the A-Pop-calypse]]".

* In ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', the headless horseman is revealed to be one of the Four Horsemen, [[Death (personification)|Death]], summoned back to life by a mysterious coven practicing black magic in Sleepy Hollow; Ichabod Crane is the man responsible for cutting off his head when the horseman served in the British army during the war for independence while Crane fought for the patriots, the two being summoned back to life at the same time due to their blood mingling after Crane and the Horseman killed each other. The horseman seeks his head in order to regain his full power, summon the other three horsemen and begin the apocalypse, his current powers limited to being indestructible apart from exposure to sunlight. The Headless Horseman's identity is later revealed to be Abraham Van Brunt, the former fiancé of Crane's wife Katrina, who was killed by the Hessians during an aborted ambush. The Horseman of Pestilence later appeared as the entity responsible for the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony by infecting them with a fatal disease that could not be cured by any other means apart from the colony hiding in an area concealed from the rest of the world. In the first-season finale, the Horseman of War was revealed to be Henry Parish, AKA Jeremy Crane, Crane's resurrected son and the Sin-Eater who helped Crane escape his connection to the Horseman, angry at how his parents' actions led him to be buried alive for centuries due to his mother's interrupted attempt to save his life. As of the end of the second season, Henry turned against Moloch and was killed when he attempted to take the power of an ancient coven of witches, while Abraham was last shown consenting to attempts to restore his humanity so long as he was not kept prisoner, but Pestilence has not been seen since his debut, and the identity of the fourth Horseman is unknown; however, the demon Moloch has stated that there have been Horsemen before the current wave, suggesting that replacements for Henry and Abraham could have been summoned. Abraham was trapped within [[Pandora's Box]] by new villain Pandora at the start of the third season, but was released at the conclusion of the series by Crane to fight Pandora, reasoning that he was not an Apocalypse-level threat now that Moloch was dead, departing once Pandora had been defeated with his skull once more in his possession. Despite this, he returned without his head in the fourth season, initially attempting to kill the [[President of the United States]] to claim her head as a substitute for his own, but is briefly trapped before being released by new series antagonist Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss goes on to try and assemble a new collection of Horsemen to aid his campaign, but although he recruits the Headless Horseman and imbues two others with the power of Famine and Pestilence, the team are able to disrupt Dreyfuss's plan to make Diana the Horseman of War with the aid of a future version of Diana's daughter Molly. As a result, Crane temporarily became War instead, giving the team time to disrupt War's hold on his spirit, Crane channeling War long enough to defeat an undead army before relinquishing the power. While Henry Parish/Jeremy Crane is later reborn to act as War again, Ichabod convinces him to withdraw as he is still basically acting as Dreyfuss's servant despite his desire for freedom, creating a crucial weakness in Dreyfuss's plan that allows the team to defeat him.
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]", the Simpson family sleep through a church sermon and wake up to the apocalypse, where the Four Horsemen are shown riding on a red cloud through the sky.
** In the episode "[[Bart Gets an Elephant]]", when Stampy the elephant walks through the Flanders' yard, Ned Flanders wakes up and gasps, "It's the four elephants of the apocalypse!"  Maude immediately corrects him, "That's horsemen, Ned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F15.html |title=1F15 Bart Gets an Elephant| accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Squidbillies]]'' season 3 episode "Armageddon It On!", the Cuyler clan briefly meets Horseman of Pestilence (voiced by [[Riley Martin]]). Despite being one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse the Cuylers are not fazed by his presences (at first they think he is part of the US Air Force). He shows his power by releasing a plague of "''scorpions with human faces''" and turns water into blood, however to his astonishment and disgust the squids eat the scorpions and drink the blood. Early and Granny are also unimpressed by him and question why he is even one of the Four Horsemen as he doesn't seem to measure up to the other 3 Horsemen (War, Famine, and Death). Insulted the Horsemen leaves but warns to prepare for the end of days.
* An episode of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', "The First Horseman", references the Horseman Pestilence as a deadly disease, created by a Prior of the Ori, is spread across the face of the Earth.
* In ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', the Four Horsemen are referenced in the [[Supernatural (season 4)|fourth-season]] episode "[[Supernatural (season 4)#ep75|Death Takes A Holiday]]" by the demon Alistair before he goes to kill two [[Death (personification)|reapers]] in an effort to break a seal that will lead to releasing [[Lucifer]] from Hell. Alistair claims that the [[scythe]] he is carrying was borrowed from an old friend who didn't "really ride a pale horse" but who does "have three amigos" who are "jonesing for the [[Apocalypse]]". After the raising of Lucifer at the end of the fourth season, the Horsemen are unleashed onto the world. Each takes the form of an male with an appropriately coloured car and a ring that imbues them their power. However, these rings are also the only apparent weakness of War, Famine and Pestilence, as removing their rings weakens them considerably, although Death is unaffected by the removal of his ring (Also, Death is only following Lucifer's agenda due to a spell binding him to Lucifer, although the other three Horsemen appear to be willing servants of Lucifer). In "Hammer of the Gods", the final message of the archangel [[Gabriel]] reveals that the Horsemens' rings have the power to recapture Lucifer by re-opening his Cage when they are put together and a particular spell is chanted.
** In the [[Supernatural (season 5)|fifth-season]] episode "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep84|Good God, Y'All!]]", War, portrayed by [[Titus Welliver]], makes an appearance. He drives a cherry red [[Ford Mustang]] and uses the ring on his right ring finger to make people hallucinate and kill each other by provoking conflict; in the episode, he divides a town by causing two groups to believe that the other side has been possessed by demons, but his influence is ended when Sam and Dean manage to cut off his ring.
** In the episode "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep96|My Bloody Valentine]]", Famine, portrayed by [[James Otis (actor)|James Otis]], appeared as a sick, wheelchair bound old man and causes suicides in a town by making people consume/perform what they hunger for until their death; examples include a couple hungering for love literally eating each other, a man on a diet gorging himself on [[Twinkie]]s, a former alcoholic drinking himself to death, and even the protagonist's angelic ally [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] is attacked through his vessel's hunger for red meat. Arriving with an entourage of demons in a black SUV, Famine would feast on souls until he was strong enough to spread on his own. He was defeated when [[Dean Winchester]] proved immune to his powers- albeit because Dean was spiritually dead after the difficulties he had experienced during the Apocalypse- and [[Sam Winchester]]'s old demonic powers were awakened when Famine restored his addiction to demon blood, allowing Sam to use his demonic powers to attack Famine by attacking the demons he had just consumed.
** Pestilence, portrayed by [[Matt Frewer]] appears at the end of "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep101|Hammer Of The Gods]]". He walks into a service station and spreads disease by spreading sickly, green slime everywhere and bringing flies into the place. He is then shown driving away in a dirty Pinto whilst flies flood the car; his rampage is shown in the next episode, "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep102|The Devil You Know]]", causing regional outbreaks of swine flu across the nation. He actively appeared in "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep103|Two Minutes to Midnight]]", shown capable to infect humans with a plethora of diseases, also being a pivotal part of Lucifer's apocalypse; his pandemic of swine flu allowed the distribution of the Croatoan virus under the guise of vaccines. He was working in a nursing home, crafting hybrid diseases that caused instant death. Castiel was ultimately responsible for destroying him when he proved partly immune to Pestilence's powers despite his weakened condition.
** The Horsemen Death is summoned to Earth by Lucifer via a ritual in the episode "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep92|Abandon All Hope...]]", albeit unseen. He is then mentioned in "[[Supernatural (season 5)#ep97|Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]", though again not seen, where he raises fifteen dead who return to their families only to turn rabid after a certain time. In "Two Minutes to Midnight", Death, now portrayed by [[Julian Richings]], is shown walking along the street with a cane; he bumps into a man, who after making a pithy remark, soon falls over dead. Death drives a pale 1959 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] Seville. Death explains to Dean that he is unwillingly bound to Lucifer, and is not particularly interested in the apocalypse. Death provides his ring, extracting a promise that Dean will do anything to stop Lucifer. This version of Death claims to be as old as, if not older than, God, as neither of them can remember who came first. An eternal being, Death reappears after the apocalypse, helping Dean recover Sam's soul- still trapped in Lucifer's Cage even after his body was rescued- helping the Winchesters restore Castiel to normal after he was driven mad by the souls he acquired from Purgatory by providing them with the means to perform a ritual to separate the Purgatory souls from Castiel, and coming to talk to Sam when he faced death after failing to complete the trials to seal Hell. Death was killed by Dean in the tenth-season finale when he was preparing to kill Dean to free him from the [[Mark of Cain]]- Dean using Death's scythe to slay him- later Sam met another Reaper and after a subsequently conversation with that Reaper revealing that a new Death will be formed and resurrections will no longer be permitted. This reaper, Billie (Lisa Berry), is killed by Castiel in "First Blood" while she's preparing to permanently reap one of the Winchesters. A subsequent episode, "Advanced Thanatology", reveals that Billie has been promoted under the rule that the first reaper to be killed after Death dies becomes the new Death.
* In the final episode of ''[[Tru Calling]]'', "[[Tru Calling#ep26|T'was the Night Before Christmas...Again]]", Tru calls her foil character Jack the fourth horseman of the apocalypse, as he is frequently referenced as "death".
* ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' episode "[[Arrow on the Doorpost#Production|Arrow on the Doorpost]]" was originally titled "Pale Horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Daily Blam!|date=12 March 2013|url=http://www.dailyblam.com/news/2013/03/11/tv-review-the-walking-dead-season-three-episode-13-arrow-on-the-doorpost|title=TV Review: ''THE WALKING DEAD'' Season Three Episode 13, 'Arrow on The Doorpost' |author= Keven Skinner}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the final season of ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] captured and changed Mystique, Storm, Professor Xavier, and Magneto into his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], giving them the names War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death, each of them containing abilities that their given name implies.
* In ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', [[The Young Ones (TV series)#Series 1|season 1]], episode 5 "[[Interesting (The Young Ones)|Interesting]]", which first aired in the UK in 1982, [[Rick Mayall]] and [[Nigel Planer]] are preparing the house for a party when a born-again Christian preacher, played by [[Dawn French]] pushes her way inside. As she warns the guys to behold Armageddon and the four horsemen of the apocalypse the scene cuts to a surreal comedy sketch featuring the Four Horsemen on a hillside.

===Video games===
(Alphabetical by title)
* In ''[[Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War]]'', there is a mission called The Four Horsemen.
* In ''[[Afterlife (computer game)|Afterlife]]'', the Four Horsemen are depicted as the Four Surfers of the Apocalypso, which are summoned if a player stays in extreme debt for too long a period.  The Four Surfers appear riding a wave of fire and destruction and destroy the player's afterlife, thus ending the game.
* In ''[[Apocalypse (video game)|Apocalypse]]'', Trey Kincaid (the protagonist, played by [[Bruce Willis]]) must battle The Reverend, who has unleashed The Four Horsemen who were called Death, Plague, War and Beast, who are the minor boss fights.
* In ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'', the horsemen appear as bosses throughout the game.
* In ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', the four primary antagonists are collectively referred to as "the Four Horsemen". One of them on the group photograph remains unidentified, but is implied to be already dead (he's crossed out like the others will be). In the sequel, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]'', the main antagonist, Vladimir Makarov, bears a heavy likeliness to the unidentified horseman from the first game. Considering both the exploits of Makarov and that the ''Modern Warfare'' series was planned as a trilogy, it is very likely that he is the Second Horseman 'War'.
* In ''[[Champions: Return to Arms]]'', the Four Horsemen can be battled in a bonus stage.
* In ''[[City of Heroes]]'', players must defeat the four Riders in the second mission of The Lady Grey Task Force. These Riders are said to be among the alien Rikti race's most fearsome warriors and have the names Rider: War, Rider: Famine, Rider: Pestilence, and Rider: Death. In this high level (45-50) task force, a team of both heroes and villains can work together to defeat these enemies as they appear repeatedly throughout the mission. The mission culminates in a battle against all four Riders at once and allows players to continue onward in their drive to save the world from total war and invasion by the alien forces of the Rikti.
* In ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'', after the protagonist commits suicide he finds himself in the Otherworld and must locate physical manifestations of the Four Horsemen before proceeding through the level and return to the living; only Death (three people upside-down on a cross) and War (a massive, grotesque cannon) are necessary to complete this section.
* In ''[[Darksiders]]'', the player takes on the role of War, one of the four legendary Horsemen of the apocalypse. The game begins with War starting the apocalypse. However, it turns out that is not supposed to occur as the seven seals were not broken. As a result, War is stripped of his powers and returns to Earth 100 years later to find out who is responsible for initiating the apocalypse and destroying the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. The other three horsemen are only mentioned in dialogue and are only seen arriving from far away at the game's end. The game's manual lists their names as "Death", "Strife" and "Fury". The sequel, ''[[Darksiders II]]'', features Death in the spotlight, trying to redeem his brother, while the [[Darksiders III|third game]] will follow Fury.
* In ''[[Destiny (video game)]]'', one of the exotic weapons in the game is called "The 4th Horseman".
* In ''Fall from Heaven'', the most popular modification for [[Civilization 4]], as the armaggedon counter increases, four horsemen (Stephanos the conqueror, Bubos the warbringer, Yersinia the plague-bringer and Ars Moriendi, death itself) appear, terrorizing the human civilizations.
* In ''[[Fallout Shelter]]'', one of the Overseer's Office tasks is a quest series called "The Horseman of the Post-Apocalypse", where the player investigates reports about the return of the horsemen.
* In ''[[Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel]]'', players can randomly stumble across the four horsemen while wandering the world map (The encounter being named "Four Horsemen of the Post-Apocalypse" in reference to the nuclear war). They are sitting around a campfire, and make comments about the apocalypse, which has already occurred. Each horseman is in the "almost dead" health range, indicating that they have very low health compared to their maximum health. However, if a player attempts to heal any of the horseman, it becomes obvious that they each have ridiculous amounts of health, and that "almost dead" is still extremely high. Upon exiting the area, the player's party leader is switched for the squad member with the lowest charisma, thanks to the chaotic nature of the horsemen.
* In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]],'' the final boss uses an attack called "Pale Horse."
* In ''[[Final Fight: Streetwise]]'', a psychotic priest named Father Bella created a powerful strength-enhancing drug called "glow",  who hopes to use the drug to bring about the apocalypse, thus Bella created his own Four Horsemen consist of Weasel as War, Dino "Blades" as Famine, Pestilence created by Dr. Chang, and the protagonist of the original Final Fight game Cody as Death who is also Kyle's older brother. Originally the role of Death was to Devin "The Stiff" Aronac but his transformation was incomplete due his defeat by Kyle as he had the letters "DE" to spell out Death.  
* In ''[[Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn]]'', the once-evil kingdom of Daein holds four generals of utmost skill and power in battle who are referred to as the "Four Riders"—a reference to the Four Horsemen.

Each of the episodes featuring the Horsemen had a unique historical cultural setting in which they took place: Medieval Europe for Famine, Mesoamerica for Death, Ancient Egypt for Pestilence, and Greco-Rome for War. In the story, the Horsemen are said to be the generals of Eidolon, who is the final boss of the game.
* "[[Ice Station Santa]]", the first of the 5 episodes of [[Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space]] for [[Xbox 360]]/[[Wii]]/[[Personal Computer|PC]], will require you to collect four horsemen action figures for a puzzle
* "[[League of Legends]]", one of the playable characters, Yorick, used to have his abilities named after the four horsemen: Omen of War, Omen of Pestilence, Omen of Famine, and Omen of Death.
* In ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'', a boss battle takes place where four assassins calling themselves the Four Horsemen attack Solid Snake in an elevator.

They are known as "The Four Horses of the Apocalypse."
* ''[[RuneScape]]'' refers to the four horsemen in the "Stronghold of Security" area, except the names War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death are applied to Dungeon Levels as opposed to actual characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5887">'''Frederic King''' (1853 &amp;ndash; 20 May 1933) was a [[baritone]] best known for his performances in the works composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]] for the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festivals]] of 1880 and 1886.  Later, he taught singing for 42 years at the [[Royal College of Music]].

==Early life and concert career==
Born in [[Lichfield]], the son of Thomas and Mary King, Frederic King was baptised on 13 January 1853 at St Michael's church in Lichfield. He worked in an [[Auction|auction house]] before joining the concert agents Messrs Harrison. He made his professional debut in a ballad concert at [[St James's Hall]] in 1878 and launched a successful career as a platform singer in [[baritone]] roles. He married Eva Hume (born 1863) in London in 1882, and they had two children, Mary Eva Oakley King (1883–1955) and Ernest Archibald Frederic King (1888–1973).&lt;ref&gt;[http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/60506390/person/30060227005 Marriage of Frederic King and Eva Hume in 1882 - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt;

King created the role of Callias, the Priest of [[Apollo]], in the first performance of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[oratorio]] ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' at the triennial [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festivals]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concertprogrammes.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/4890 Leeds Musical Festival Concert Programmes (1858–89)], Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He sang the role of [[Mephistopheles]] in the English premiere of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'' at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Straits/&gt; In 1886, at Leeds, he sang the role of [[Lucifer]] in the first performance of Sullivan's [[cantata]] ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concertprogrammes.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/4891 Leeds Musical Festival Concert Programmes (1886, 1901, 1907)], Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing King's performance in the latter work, [[Herman Klein]], in ''Musical Notes'', called him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...a talented and conscientious artist, who invested his music with all the dramatic significance and sardonic humour of which it was susceptible. Truth to tell, there is not much diabolical in Longfellow's fiend, and it would seem as though Sir Arthur Sullivan had sought on occasion to atone for his comparative mildness by applying a background of orchestration worthy in its sonority of Berlioz or Wagner. Whether Satan could make himself heard in Pandemonium may be an open question, but undoubtedly there are moments in ''The Golden Legend'' when Lucifer's human representative, be his voice ever so stentorian, is bound to be inaudible. All that artistic singing could do to lend the character its proper prominence was done by Mr. King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/Musical_Notes_1000042273/93 Klein, Herman]. ''Musical Notes'' (1887) Reprint. London: Forgotten Books (2013), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later years==
On retiring from the concert platform King taught singing at the [[Royal College of Music]] for 42 years, from 1889 to 1931. Among his students were [[Norman Allin]], [[Miriam Licette]], [[Robert Radford]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/hooey/radford-bio.htm Robert Radford], Music Web International website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/artists/robert-radford/ Robert Radford biography], [[MTV]] website, accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Brazell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-BRAZ-DAV-1875.html David Brazell], [[Welsh Biography Online]], accessed 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Samuell]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rgYZqFWbe0oC&amp;pg=PA275 Williams, Gordon ''British Theatre in the Great War: A Revaluation''], Continuum (2005) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Heyner]]. After his retirement from the Royal Academy of Music he continued to give lessons privately, the last being just before he was taken ill a week before his death.&lt;ref name=Straits/&gt;

King died in May 1933 aged 80 at his home in [[Hampstead]] after a short illness.&lt;ref name=Straits&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19330606-1.2.128.aspx 'Mr F.

==Early life==
Shotwell was born in Evanston, Illinois as the middle of three daughters to a brain surgeon and an artist and raised in [[Libertyville, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/07/business/la-fi-himi-spacex-20130609|title=How I Made It: SpaceX exec Gwynne Shotwell|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=7 June 2013|author=Hennigan, William J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received, with honors, a [[Bachelor of Science]] and a [[Master of Science]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]] and [[Applied Mathematics]] from [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name=lat20130607&gt;

==Career==
Shotwell originally planned to work in the [[automotive industry]] and was enrolled in [[Chrysler Corporation]]'s [[management training]] program but desired more a hands-on engineering role&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strube|first1=Frank|title=It all Started with a Suit: The Story Behind Shotwell’s Rise to SpaceX - Via Satellite -|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/publications/2014/04/21/it-all-started-with-a-suit-the-story-behind-shotwells-rise-to-spacex/|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=Via Satellite|date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not remain in that industry.&lt;ref name=lat20130607/&gt;

In 1988, she began work at the [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]] research center of [[The Aerospace Corporation]], and did technical work on military space [[research and development]] contracts. During a ten-year tenure she worked in [[thermal analysis]] while "writing dozens of papers on a variety of subjects including conceptual small spacecraft design, infrared signature target modeling, space shuttle integration and reentry vehicle operational risks".&lt;ref name=lat20130607/&gt;

Wanting to "build, and put spacecraft together", in 1998 she left the [http://www.aerospace.org/ Aerospace Corp]. to become "director of the space systems division at [http://smad.com/ Microcosm Inc], a low-cost rocket builder in El Segundo".&lt;ref name=lat20130607/&gt; There, she served on the executive committee and was responsible for business development.

In 2002 Shotwell joined [[SpaceX]], a private, commercial, space exploration company founded by [[Elon Musk]] in the same year, as vice president of business development, also being given a seat on the SpaceX board of directors. She was its eleventh employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Gwynne Shotwell {{!}} Closing Plenary {{!}} SkollWF 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBoHAChEcfY|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company builds the [[Falcon (rocket family)|Falcon vehicle family]] which has launched more than 50 times representing about $5 billion in revenue. Shotwell is now President and COO of SpaceX, responsible for day-to-day operations and managing all customer and strategic relations to support company growth.&lt;ref name="SpaceX AsiaSat8 press release"&gt;SpaceX AsiaSat8 press release&lt;/ref&gt;

Famed for its innovation and disruption of an entire industry, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft in December 2010. It also has a multibillion-dollar contract with [[NASA]] to deliver astronauts and science instruments to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX is also working on a next-generation transportation system to take people to Mars in the near future.

Shotwell participates in a variety of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] related programs, including the Frank J. Redd Student Scholarship Competition.  Under her leadership the committee raised more than $350,000 in scholarships in 6 years.&lt;ref name="SpaceX AsiaSat8 press release"/&gt;

==Public outreach==
Shotwell gave a TEDx Talk at TEDxChapmanU in June 2013 on the importance of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]].&lt;ref name=TEDxChampanUGwynneShotwell&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering America: Gwynne Shotwell at TEDxChapmanU |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THQPNDNulVc|website=Youtube|publisher=TEDx Talks|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks regularly to business audiences&lt;!-- at 07:35 in the source video --&gt; and gave a talk for the "Captains of Industry" series at the [[Atlantic Council|Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security]] in June 2014 on private entrepreneurial accomplishments in advancing spaceflight technology.&lt;ref name=AtlanticCouncil20140604&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYocHwhfFDc |title=Discussion with Gwynne Shotwell, President and COO, SpaceX |publisher=Atlantic Council |first=Gwynne |last=Shotwell |time=22:35–26:20 |date=June 4, 2014 |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |quote=''This [reusable launch vehicle technology], all this innovation is being done by SpaceX alone, no one is paying us to do it.

This is the kind of thing that entrepreneurial investment and new entrants/innovators can do for an industry:  fund their own improvements, both in the quality of their programs and the quality of their hardware, and the speed and cadence of their operations.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2018 [[TED (conference)|TED conference]], Shotwell was interviewed by [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] about the future plans of SpaceX.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TED|title=SpaceX's plan to fly you across the globe in 30 minutes {{!}} Gwynne Shotwell|date=2018-05-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dar8P3r7GYA&amp;ab_channel=TED|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ourso, Sr.|publisher=findagrave|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was from 1964 to 1968 and from 1972 until his death in office, a popular, colorful [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] sheriff of [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish]], located near the capital city of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in [[South Louisiana]]. He is thus far the youngest person elected sheriff in Louisiana.

==Background==

Ourso was the youngest of eleven children born to a [[Cajun]] couple, Rudolph and Ida Ourso of [[Plaquemine, Louisiana|Plaquemine]], [[Louisiana]], the Iberville [[county seat|parish seat]]. He was a [[boxer]] at [[Plaquemine Senior High School]], as were his friends and later political allies, [[Louisiana House of Representatives|state representative]] and then [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Bobby Freeman (politician)|Robert "Bobby" Freeman]], school superintendent Sam Distefano, and [[District Attorney]] Sam Cashio. After high school graduation, Ourso served in the [[United States Army]] from 1952 to 1954, including fifteen months in combat in the [[Korean War]]. All seven of his brothers engaged in military service, a point which he emphasized in his political races.&lt;ref name=postsouth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postsouth.com/article/20100708/NEWS/307089958#ixzz2gsMqMmVv|title=Diedre Cruse, Sheriff Jessel Ourso named to Louisiana Justice Hall of Fame, July 28, 2010|publisher=postsouth.com|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ourso was sometimes called "The Black Stallion", the name of the family trucking company.&lt;ref name=mourso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibervilleparish.com/department_services/office_of_the_president/ |title=J. Mitchell Ourso, Jr. |publisher=ibervilleparish.com |accessdate=October 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043422/http://ibervilleparish.com/department_services/office_of_the_president/ |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hallfame/&gt; Ourso and his wife, the former Eula Mae Leblanc  (1933-1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdmf.info/by_number/pages/059900.html|title=Social Security Death Master List|publisher=ssdmf.info|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; had six children, Jessel M. Ourso, Jr. (born 1953), Blane Michael Ourso (born 1955),&lt;ref&gt;Coincidentally, Sheriff Charles A. Griffon, Jr., had a grandson named "Blain Michael" ([[Moon Griffon]]), and Sheriff Jessel Ourso's second son is named "Blane Michael".&lt;/ref&gt; Vesta Ourso Falcon, Jessica A. Ourso (born 1958), Lisa Jo Ourso (born 1959), and Shannon Paul Ourso (born 1964).&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt;

==Political life==

Ourso worked for the Baton Rouge municipal police department and the [[Louisiana State Police]] before he was elected Iberville Parish sheriff at the age of thirty-one.&lt;ref name=hallfame&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepineywoods.com/HallFameMar09.htm|title=James Ronald Skains, Political "Hall" honors eight, 2009|publisher=''The Piney Woods Journal''|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He unseated the 16-year incumbent, Charles A. Griffon, Jr., of Plaquemine, the paternal grandfather of the statewide [[radio]] [[talk show]] host, [[Moon Griffon]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] in northeastern Louisiana. Ourso claimed that he had won the Democratic [[primary election]] held on December 7, 1963, because he led by a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]]. A third candidate who had withdrawn from the race still received enough scattering of votes to prevent an Ourso majority. Louisiana [[Attorney General of Louisiana|Attorney General]] [[Jack P. F. Gremillion]] ruled that the votes for the withdrawn candidate still counted for purposes of determining if a candidate had a primary majority. Louisiana State District Judge G. R. Kearney ruled that the third candidate's votes would still be counted and that the [[runoff election]] between Ouro and Griffon must proceed on January 11, 1964, along with the gubernatorial contest between the successful [[John McKeithen]] and former [[Mayor of New Orleans|New Orleans Mayor]] [[DeLesseps Story Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lake Charles American Press'', December 19, 1963, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As sheriff, Ourso established the Iberville Parish "Junior Deputy" and prison work-release programs. He organized a sheriff's flotilla to cover swamplands and waterways. He introduced the psychological stress evaluator in the investigation of crimes. He established the first [[ambulance]] service in Iberville Parish and was the first Iberville Parish sheriff to use a [[helicopter]]. He built a firing range for deputies and opened it to the public. Ourso established sheriff's sub-stations with deputies on duty around the clock. He constructed a new $2 million jail, completed in 1977, the year before his death.&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt;

Despite his accomplishments, Ourso is also remembered for many controversies. The Louisiana Legislative Auditor accused him of failure to account for funds received from construction and engineering firms as payment of guard and security services that the sheriff's department had provided to the companies. Then state Attorney General Gremillion charged Ourso with ninety-six allegations of wrongdoing. Governor McKeithen suspended Ourso from office and refused his signature to the commission for Ourso to take office for his second term in the summer of 1968. From 1968 to 1971, Ourso fought federal charges of [[extortion]] and thirty-three state criminal allegations&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt; brought forth by Attorney General Jack Gremillion, including [[bribery]], theft, extortion, and [[malfeasance]].&lt;ref&gt;"Still Awaiting Sentence: Gremillion Says U.S. Was Persecuting Him," ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', October 28, 1971, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Ourso was either acquitted or benefited from [[hung jury|hung juries]] in all of these cases.&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

Ouro was elected sheriff again in 1971 with the slogan that [[U.S. Senator]] [[Barry M. Goldwater]] of [[Arizona]] had employed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 U.S. presidential]] election: "In Your Heart, You Know He's Right." While continuing as sheriff, Ourso in 1972 was elected to the [[nonpartisan]] position of delegate to the 1973 Louisiana Constitutional Convention.&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt; Others elected to the convention were future Governor [[Buddy Roemer]] and subsequent [[Louisiana Secretary of State]] [[James H. "Jim" Brown]].

On November 1, 1975, at the age of forty-three, Ourso defeated five challengers to win his last abbreviated term as sheriff in the first-ever [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt;

==Legacy==

Known for his public speaking, Ourso was described by Gary J. Hebert, the late publisher of the ''Post/South'' newspaper in Plaquemine, as "unequaled in color, startling in analogies, disarmingly devious in approach, and at times, just downright funny to the point of tears."&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt;

Ourso died in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], at the age of forty-six. According to the former ''Iberville South'',&lt;ref&gt;The ''Iberville South'' and the ''Plaquemine Post/South'' merged in 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; four thousand mourners visited the funeral home where Ourso's body lay in state, two thousand came to St. John the Evangelist [[Catholic Church]] for the funeral mass, hundreds of others lined the route of the funeral procession, and eight hundred witnessed the burial at Grace Memorial Park in Plaquemine.&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt; Ourso was succeeded by his chief criminal deputy, Freddie H. Pitre (1929-2002), the sheriff from 1978 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pitretrail/myline/paternal/ccpitre.htm |title=Notes for Freddie Pitre |publisher=homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=October 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012074525/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pitretrail/myline/paternal/ccpitre.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ourso's older son, Jessel Mitchell Ourso, Jr., known as Mitch Ourso, is the first and still serving President of Iberville Parish, having been initially elected to a two-year term in 1997.&lt;ref name=mourso/&gt; Mitch Ourso said that his mother had asked all of her children to avoid politics, and he did so until a year after her death when he "still rode my dad's political coattails into office as parish president. He was one popular politician in Iberville Parish."&lt;ref name=hallfame/&gt;

In 2009, Ourso was inducted [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]]. Only four other sheriffs have been so designated, [[Cat Doucet]], [[Charles Fuselier]], [[Leonard R. "Pop" Hataway]], and [[Harry Lee (sheriff)|Harry Lee]].&lt;ref name=hallfame/&gt; In 2010, he was inducted into the Louisiana Justice Hall of Fame by the Louisiana State Penitentiary Museum Foundation.&lt;ref name=postsouth/&gt;

During the [[American Revolution|War for Independence]], as a member of the [[militia]] from [[Tryon County, North Carolina|Tryon County]], Hardin fought the [[Cherokee]] allies of Britain along the western frontier and was a signatory of the [[Tryon Resolves]]. Later in the war, having taken his family over the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]]&lt;ref&gt;County Formation Ani-Maps&lt;/ref&gt; for safety against the advance of the [[Red coat (British army)|Red Coat]]s out of [[South Carolina]], Hardin joined the [[Overmountain Men]]. He saw action at the [[Battle of Ramsour's Mill]] and the decisive [[Battle of Kings Mountain]]. Following the peace with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], Hardin was a co-founder and second [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] for the [[State of Franklin]]; and an Assemblyman in the [[Southwest Territory]] before its statehood as [[Tennessee]].

==Early and family life==
Joseph Hardin was born the spring of 1734 in [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico Co.]], [[Virginia Colony]] in an area several years later to be encompassed by the fledgling town of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond at the Falls]] (now Richmond), Virginia Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia County Formation Ani-Maps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "McClintock"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shelton | first = Alma Louise [McClintock] | title = The McClintock Memorial | isbn = 0914330829 | publisher = Pioneer Publishing; Fresno, CA | date = July 11, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evolution of the Virginia Colony, a 1610-1630 Timeline"&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardin was the second son, and fourth child, of Benjamin Hardin II and Margaret Hooper.&lt;ref name="Cochran"/&gt;  He was older brother to Captain John Hardin (1736–1802) (noted as the hero who turned the tide of battle for the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] at the [[Battle of Ramsour's Mill]]&lt;ref name = "MyRev"&gt;{{cite web | title = My Revolutionary War | url = http://www.revolutionarywar101.com/battles/800620-ramsours-mill/ | accessdate = April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|"Southern Campaign"]] of the Revolutionary War)&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite book | first = Leon Claire | last = Metz | title =  John Wesley Hardin: Dark Angel of Texas | isbn = 978-0-8061-2995-2 | url = https://www.amazon.com/John-Wesley-Hardin-Angel-Texas/dp/0806129956 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press; Norman, Oklahoma | date = Mar 1998 | accessdate = 2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln County History&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarah Hardin, wife to [[Frederick Hambright|Lt. Col. Frederick Hambright]].

Hardin married Jane Gibson (1742–1817) on July 8, 1762 in Virginia. They moved to the '[[Salisbury District, North Carolina|Salisbury District]]' of the North Carolina Colony, settling in the newly formed Tryon County, where he became [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1772.&lt;ref name="Cochran"/&gt;

Hardin's children were: Rebecca; twins Joseph Jr. and John; Jane Ann; James W.; Benjamin I; Robert I; Elender; Mary Easter; Margaret; Amos; Benjamin II; Gibson; and Robert II.  "Ben-two" and "Robert-two", as they were called, were both named after older brothers who had been lost in battle with Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Cochran"/&gt;

Hardin was a great-grandfather of Texas outlaw, [[John Wesley Hardin]].&lt;ref name="Metz"/&gt;

==Civil service==
Hardin served several stints as a local Justice of the Peace: first in Tryon County, NC (April 1772 – 1778); then [[Washington County, Tennessee|Washington Co., NC]] ([[East Tennessee|Tennessee East District]]) (1783); and finally [[Greene County, Tennessee|Greene Co.]] (1796).   He served as an [[Legislator|Assemblyman]] ([[North Carolina House of Representatives|Representative]]) for Tryon Co., NC (1774–1779); for Washington County ([[Washington District, North Carolina]]) (1782) and, Greene Co., Tennessee East District, NC (1788). Hardin became a signer of the Tryon Resolves in September 1775.

During the period of 1784-1785, Hardin, [[John Sevier]], and several others were instrumental in organizing the extra-legal [[State of Franklin]]. He was elected its second [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] in June 1785.  A few years after the failure of Franklin, he served as a representative for the First Territorial Assembly of the [[Southwest Territory]] (also known as the Territory South of the Ohio River)&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Southwest Territory; An Act for the Enumeration of the Inhabitants of the Territory of the United States of America South of the River Ohio"; July 11, 1795&lt;/ref&gt; held at [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] in the summer of 1794.   Later that same year, Hardin became a trustee of the newly chartered [[Tusculum College|Greeneville (later Tusculum) College]].&lt;ref name="Cochran"/&gt;  He was elevated to Speaker of the House in the territorial assembly in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.tn.gov/sos/bluebook/11-12/TS3_PastGovAndOff.pdf Tennessee Blue Book]'' (2012), p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardin's first documented military service shows his appointment as the first [[Major (United States)|major]] of the 2nd North Carolina [[Minute Men]] (from the [[Salisbury District, North Carolina|Salisbury District]]) in 1775.&lt;ref name="Carolana"&gt;[http://www.carolana.com/NC/Revolution/nc_patriot_military_colonels.html ''Joseph Harden''&amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;];Carolana; accessed Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, he appears in the rolls as a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the Griffith Rutherford's Light Horse Rangers. Hardin took part in [[Rutherford Light Horse expedition|Rutherford's Cherokee Expedition]] into the Washington District late the following year, under Captain [[William Moore (soldier)|William Moore]].&lt;ref name = "ashe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashe | first = Samuel A'Court | title = History of North Carolina, Volume I, From 1584 to 1783 | series = Moore's Expedition | isbn = 0-87152-059-1 | url = | publisher = Greensboro, N. C.; C. L. Van Noppen | year = 1908–25}} Pg. 553&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1777, Hardin carried a captain's commission in [[Francis Locke Sr.|Locke]]'s Battalion (part of [[Allen Jones (delegate)|General Allen Jones']] Brigade) seeing action against Britain and its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies.

It was during this time that Hardin moved his family to the western settlements for safe keeping. As a major in the North Carolina militia, he raised a battalion of volunteers in [[Wilkes County, North Carolina|Wilkes County]] in early 1779.&lt;ref name="Carolana"/&gt;  As an officer in this Overmountain militia, he fought in the [[Battle of Ramseur's Mill]], between the Tories (Loyalists to the Crown) and the Whigs (American Patriots) on June 20, 1780 and later that year at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], on Oct 7.&lt;ref name = "MyRev" /&gt;

After the cessation of the ground war with Britain (1783), Hardin, then living in the newly established [[Greene County, Tennessee|Greene County]], was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and appointed Commandant of the North Carolina Militia for "The Western Counties" (old Washington District)&lt;ref name="Carolana"/&gt; due to the continuing hostilities with the [[Chickamauga Indian]]s.

===Land grants===
As was the custom of the time, he was awarded land grants totaling {{convert|8400|acre|km2}} for service to his country.&lt;ref name = "Land Warrants"&gt;{{cite book | last = North Carolina State | first = | title = Land Warrants of North Carolina State, North Carolina Grants and North Carolina Military Grants, 1788-1903 | series = | work = Tennessee State History Library; Nashville, TN | date = April 5, 1784}}; no. 317-  {{convert|400|acre|km2}} ("withdrawn"), 318-  {{convert|600|acre|km2}}, 445- {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, 670- {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, 924- {{convert|200|acre|km2}}, 1619- {{convert|3000|acre|km2}}, 2118- {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, 2119- {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} and 2129- {{convert|500|acre|km2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1786, several thousand acres of this land was set aside for Col.

===The Hardin Expedition===
[[File:Joseph Hardin Courthouse Plaque Savannah TN.JPG|thumb|The dedication plaque for the Savannah, Hardin Co., TN courthouse which is dedicated to Col. Joseph Hardin]]
Two parties of settlers (totaling 26) struck out of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] in late spring of 1816 bound for the general area which would eventually become [[Savannah, Tennessee]]. The first party came by boat down the [[Tennessee River]], landing in May at ''"the easteward curve of the Tennessee"'' at [[Cerro Gordo, Tennessee|Cerro Gordo]].  The second, and larger, party had travelled overland and suffered from many delays.  Upon the arrival of the second group, the parties finally rejoined at Johnson Creek, near present-day [[Savannah, Tennessee]]. It was now July, and the pioneers set about the laying down of the first permanent settlement by non-Native Americans in the area.

This second party was led by Joseph Hardin Jr., son of Col. Joseph Hardin,&lt;ref name = "Brazelton" /&gt; who had, before his death, accumulated several land grants to the area as rewards for his [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] service. Joseph Jr. was accompanied on the trip by his brother, James Hardin (known as the founder of the settlement of [[Hardinville, Tennessee|Hardinville]];  a failed endeavor that would be created in 1817 on nearby Hardin's Creek). Both men executed land grants&lt;ref name = "Land Warrants2"&gt;{{cite book | last = North Carolina State | first = | title = Land Warrants of North Carolina State, North Carolina Grants and North Carolina Military Grants, 1788-1903 | series = | work = Tennessee State History Library; Nashville, TN | date =  May 10, 1784}}; entry No. 2128; {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the area.  They had fought alongside their father in the war and had been likewise rewarded with their own land patents, and had inherited some of their father's remaining unclaimed grants.&lt;ref name = "Land Warrants" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Goodspeed" /&gt; About this same time, other settlers from the initial expedition established a community further down river at [[Saltillo, Tennessee|Saltillo]].

Other relatives of Col. Joseph's were to eventually settle in the area, including sons: Gibson, Ben II and Robert II, and daughter, Margaret (wife of Ninian Steele), all having arrived there by 1818.&lt;ref name = "Brazelton" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Goodspeed" /&gt;

The county was named [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] for Joseph Hardin Sr.&lt;ref name = "TennGen"&gt;{{cite web | title = My Tennessee Genealogy | url =  http://www.genealogyinc.com/tennessee/hardin-county/ | accessdate = April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1819, at the first meeting of the county assembly which took place at the home of his son, James Hardin.  Today, the courthouse in the county seat of Savannah is dedicated to him.&lt;ref name ="Goodspeed" /&gt;

'''João Maria D’Agostini''', or '''Giovanni Maria de Agostini''' (1801 – 17 April 1869), was a lay monk of Italian origin who travelled widely in South and North America preaching and healing with herbal remedies.
He drew large crowds who thought he was a holy man and could work miracles, although the authorities often viewed him with suspicion.
In Brazil his devotees have conflated his identity with two other [[João Maria (monk)|monks named João Maria]].
Thousands people each year visit a cave in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Brazil, where he once lived.

==Early years (1801–43)==

Giovanni de Agostini was born into a noble family in 1801 in [[Sizzano]], Piedmont, Italy.
His mother died in 1819, and he made a pilgrimage to Rome, and then to France and Spain.
He tried to become a monk, but was unable to accept the secluded life of the monastery.
He decided to become an evangelist in America, and arrived in [[Caracas]], Venezuela, in June 1838.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}
He travelled in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and finally Brazil.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}

==Brazil (1843–52)==

Agostini lived in Brazil from 1843 to 1852 under the name of João Maria.
He visited the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]] (then called Desterro) and [[Porto Alegre]].
In each place he obtained authorization from the bishop and president of the province to preach the gospel, before leaving for the interior to conduct his missionary work.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}
He dressed in the habit of a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friar]], wore sandals and carried religious objects such as a bible, medals of Our Lady and a staff.
He knew the Gospel well, had a good understanding of theology and was fluent in French and Latin.
He gave apocalyptic sermons in which he condemned luxury and avarice, warned of the day of judgement and the torments of hell, and spoke of the possibilities of salvation.
Like other Capuchins he established ''cruzeiros'' or sacred ways where the faithful could make penitential processions to reduce their debt to God.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}

Agostini made rosaries and wooden crucifixes which he sold for cash or kind to support his mission.
He made medicines from herbs, roots, leaves and water from special sources.
He gained a reputation as a saint who could perform miracles, and drew large crowds.
During his stay in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] between 1846 and 1848 he was visited by crowds of patients and others curious to see him, including some who came from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}
João Maria was not a revolutionary, but tried to improve the condition of the peasants.{{sfn|Feldman|Hata|1989|p=257}}
He organized processions, built chapels, blessed cattle and baptized children.
He cared for the sick, and his herbal teas became famous.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}

[[File:A gruta de João Maria, local de fé em meio a natureza.jpg|thumb|The monk's cave in [[Monge State Park]] near [[Lapa, Paraná]] ]]
There are records from 1844 of João Maria going from [[Pará]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he became famous as a healer and counselor.
He moved to [[Sorocaba]], São Paulo, and continued to practice medicine and give advice.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}
João Maria left the city of [[São Paulo]] and disappeared for a while before showing up in [[Rio Grande do Sul]].{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}
Thousands of people came to him at Cerro Campestre, in [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul]], drawn by word of the miraculous power of his waters.
The authorities of Rio Grande do Sul analyzed the water and found it was potable but no different from any other water.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
He then continued through Santa Catarina and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], where he lived in a cave near [[Lapa, Paraná|Lapa]] in 1847.
There he performed marriages, baptisms, healings and gave blessings to the local people.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}

In 1848 João Maria was deported to Santa Catarina, then to Rio de Janeiro, where he was lost from sight for a while.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
He met Father Joaquim Gomes de Oliveira e Paiva, deputy provincial of Santa Catarina, in February 1849 on Arvoredo Island.
The father spoke highly of him, and perhaps as a result the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] gave him an audience and offered him gifts and favors which, as a mendicant, he could not use.
The emperor's favor may have protected him when charges were later laid against him of charlatanism, illegal medicine, false promises of cure and religious imposture.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}

==Later career (1853–1869)==

In 1852 Agostini moved to Monte Palma in Paraguay, now called ''El Cerro del Monje'' and now in the [[Misiones Province]] of Argentina.
The next year he was in [[Buenos Aires]], then crossed the Andes to Chile, where he lived from 1854 to 1856.
He was in Bolivia in 1857, Peru in 1858, Mexico in 1859, Cuba in 1860 and Canada in 1861.
Often he drew large crowds, and often the activities of this foreign religious leader roused the suspicions of the authorities.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}

Agostini reached the United States in 1861, and walked for almost {{convert|1000|km}} to [[New Mexico]].
In 1867 he moved to a cave near the village of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], although the residents warned him that the Indians were dangerous. He lived there for two years, sometimes coming down to the village to preach, treat the sick and catechize children.
In April 1869 the villagers did not see his fire, went up to his cave and found him dead. He had been murdered by some person who was never found.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}} He died on 17 April 1869 at the age of 69.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}} João Maria's tomb may still be seen in New Mexico.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}

==Legacy==

João Maria D’Agostini inspired others who became mendicants in Brazil in the following decades, and was the first of the three "monks" named João Maria in southern Brazil.{{sfn|Karsburg|2012}}
Some widely distributed photographs with the legend "Jõao Maria de Agostinho Propheta" are in fact pictures of the later monk, [[João Maria de Jesus]].{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=46}}
There are people today who think that João Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles.
There are many places in the center and east of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and Santa Catarina, the south of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and the north of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the "João Marias" would have passed.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}

The [[Monge State Park]] was created in [[Lapa, Paraná|Lapa]] in 1960.
The main attraction is the monk's cave, a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful. It also includes a source of water that it considered to be miraculous.{{sfn|Lapa: Parque Estadual do Monge ... Paraná Turismo}}

'''Lily Elsie''' (born '''Elsie Hodder'''; 8 April 1886 – 16 December 1962) was an English actress and singer during the [[Edwardian]] era. She was best known for her starring role in the London premiere of [[Franz Lehár]]'s [[operetta]] ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.

Beginning as a child star in the 1890s, Elsie built her reputation in several successful [[Edwardian musical comedies]] before her great success in ''The Merry Widow'', opening in 1907. Afterwards, she starred in several more successful operettas and musicals, including ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911). Admired for her beauty and charm on stage, Elsie became one of the most photographed women of Edwardian times.

==Life and career==
Elsie was born in [[Armley]], [[West Yorkshire]]. Her mother, Charlotte Elizabeth Hodder (1864–1922), was a dressmaker who operated a lodging-house. She married William Thomas Cotton, a theatre worker, in 1891, and Elsie became '''Elsie Cotton'''. The family lived in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://www.lily-elsie.com/ Lily Elsie biography page] at Miss Lily Elsie website&lt;/ref&gt; Elsie was also the niece of Wilfred Cotton, who married actress [[Ada Reeve]].&lt;ref name=SB&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/ "Lily Elsie"], StageBeauty.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child star===
A precocious child star, Elsie appeared in [[music hall]] and variety entertainments as a child impersonator known as "Little Elsie". Nevertheless, she was reportedly painfully shy, even as an adult. By 1895–96, she appeared in concerts and [[pantomime]]s in theatres in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]. In 1896, she played the role of Princess Mirza in ''The Arabian Nights'' at the Queen's Theatre in [[Manchester]]. Then, at Christmas 1896–97, at the age of ten, she appeared in the title role of ''Little Red Riding Hood'' at the same theatre for six weeks and then on tour for six additional weeks.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; Her first London appearance was at Christmas 1898 in ''King Klondike'' at Sara Lane's Britannia Theatre as Aerielle, the Spirit of the Air. Elsie then toured the provinces, travelling as far as [[Bristol]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] for a full year in ''McKenna's Flirtation'', a farce by American E. Selden, in 1900.&lt;ref name=GSE&gt;Edwards, G. Spencer. ''[[Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News]]'', 28 May 1904, pp. 474–75&lt;/ref&gt; She then played in Christmas pantomimes, including ''Dick Whittington'' (1901), ''The Forty Thieves'' (1902), and ''Blue Beard'' (1903) and toured in [[Edwardian musical comedies]], including ''The Silver Slipper'' by [[Owen Hall]], with music by [[Leslie Stuart]] (1901–02), and ''[[Three Little Maids]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name=GSE/&gt; From about 1900, she adopted the stage name "Lily Elsie".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33014, "Elsie, Lily (1886?–1962)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/33014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsie then joined [[George Edwardes]]' company at [[Daly's Theatre]] in London as a chorus girl. In 1903, she took over the role of Princess Soo-Soo in the hit musical ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' and then starred in the flop, ''Madame Sherry'', by Hugo Felix, at the [[Apollo Theatre]]. She next played the roles of Gwenny Holden in ''[[Lady Madcap]]'', Lady Patricia Vereker in ''[[The Cingalee]]'' in 1904, Madame du Tertre in ''[[The Little Michus]]'' in 1905, and Lady Agnes Congress in ''The Little Cherub'' (during which, she was fired by Edwardes for giggling, but soon rehired), Humming Bird in ''See See'' and Lally in ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], all in 1906. From 1900 to 1906, she appeared in 14 shows.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Merry Widow and peak years===
[[Image:LilyElsie-1911-a.jpg|thumb|left|Elsie in ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'']]
Elsie's biggest success came in creating the title role in the English-language version of ''The Merry Widow'' in the London production. Edwardes took Elsie to see the original German version (''Die Lustige Witwe'') in Berlin. Elsie was at first reluctant to take on the demanding part, thinking her voice too light for the role, but Edwardes persuaded her to accept.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 18 December 1962, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Edwardes brought her to see the famous designer, [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon|Lucile]], for a style coaching. Lucile later wrote, "I realised that here was a girl who had both beauty and intelligence but who had never learnt how to make the best of herself. So shy and diffident was she in those days that a less astute producer than George Edwardes would in all probability have passed her over and left her in the chorus."&lt;ref name=Lucy&gt;[http://www.lily-elsie.com/lucile.htm Excerpts from ''Discretions and Indiscretions''], by Lucy Duff-Gordon, Jarrolds (1932) at Lily-Elsie.com&lt;/ref&gt; The production, with English lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]], opened in June 1907 and ran for 778 performances at Daly's Theatre. Elsie created the role at Daly's and toured with it beginning in August 1908. The show was an enormous success for its creators and made Elsie a major star.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; One critic at the opening night praised "the youthfulness, the dainty charm and grace, the prettiness and the exquisite dancing with which Miss Elsie invests the part.... I share the opinion of most of the first-nighters, who considered it could not have been in better hands, and could not have been better handled.... The night was a genuine triumph for Miss Elsie, and she well deserved all the calls she received."&lt;ref&gt;''The Pelican'', 12 June 1907, p. 6a, reprinted in Culme, John. [http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/ "Press Clippings for the week ending Saturday, 29 June 2002"], FootlightNotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucile designed the costumes for Elsie in ''The Merry Widow'' (including the plumed hats that became an extraordinary fad) and thereafter used Elsie to promote her fashions, designing her personal clothes and costumes for several of her other shows. Lucile wrote, "That season was a very brilliant one, perhaps the most brilliant of the series which brought the social life of pre-war London to its peak. And just when it was at its zenith a new play was launched with a new actress, who set the whole town raving over her beauty...."&lt;ref name=Lucy/&gt; Elsie's image was in great demand by advertisers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lily-elsie.com/ads-01.htm Advertisements featuring Elsie]&lt;/ref&gt; and on postcards, and she received unsolicited gifts of great value from many male admirers (and even bequests).&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; Lucile commented, "She was absolutely indifferent to most [men] for she once told me she disliked the male character and considered that men only behaved tolerably to a woman who treated them coldly".&lt;ref name=Lucy/&gt; Nevertheless, Elsie became one of the most frequently photographed beauties of the Edwardian era. According to the ''Atlanta Constitution'' newspaper in America, writing in 1915:

[[Image:elsiemerrywidow.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[The Merry Widow]], Act 3, London, 1907]]
{{quote|''"Perhaps her face is nearer to that of the [[Venus de Milo]] in profile than to any other famed beauty. There are no angles to be found about her any place.... If she came to America, she would undoubtedly be called the most beautiful woman in America. Nature never made a more brilliant success in the beauty business than she did with Lily Elsie. It was mostly from the nobility that her suitors came. Everyone agrees that Lily Elsie has the most kissable mouth in all England... she possesses the Cupid's bow outline with the ends curving upward delicately, all ready for smiles.... Strangely enough, the women of the land were among her most devoted admirers."''&lt;ref&gt;"Lily Elsie Recalls her Renunciation", ''Atlanta Constitution'', 21 November 1915&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After ''The Merry Widow'', Elsie appeared in another 16 shows, including in the very successful English-language versions of ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' in 1909; as Franzi in the British premiere of ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' in 1911; and as Angèle in ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'', also in 1911, garnering continuous praise. One critic wrote that "it gave great pleasure merely to see her walk across the stage."&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

Elsie left the cast of ''The Count of Luxembourg'' to marry 6' 3" Major John Ian Bullough (1885–1936), the son of a wealthy textile manufacturer, but the marriage was reported to be mostly unhappy. In addition, Elsie often suffered from ill health, including anaemia, among other ailments, and had several operations during her years onstage. The gossip column in ''The Pelican'' called her "the occasional actress".&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; Bullough wanted his wife to retire from the stage. The publicity shy and exhausted Elsie was happy to leave the stage for the next several years, except for charity performances to benefit the war effort. She returned in the title role of Louis Parker's comedy play ''Malvourneen'' with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], as Lady Catherine Lazenby in ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]'' in 1916 and in the title role in ''Pamela'' written by [[Arthur Wimperis]], with songs by [[Frederic Norton]] (1917; with [[Owen Nares]]).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; ''The Tatler'' wrote of her performance in ''Malvourneen'', "Everyone should see Miss Lily Elsie in this play, for it shows us that her comedy is as good as her musical comedy, which is saying a great deal."&lt;ref&gt;''The Tatler, 3 November 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1920, Elsie moved with her husband to the [[Gloucestershire]] village of [[Redmarley D'Abitot]]. She spent ten years away from the stage this time, enjoying social events and fox hunting. She returned to performing, first touring and then appearing at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in London in 1927 as Eileen Mayne in ''The Blue Train'', the English language adaptation of [[Robert Stolz]]'s German musical comedy ''Mädi''. Her last show before retiring was [[Ivor Novello]]'s successful ''The Truth Game'' back at Daly's Theatre in 1928–1929.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

Finally, in 1930, Elsie's unhappy marriage ended in divorce as her health deteriorated further and she became subject to fits of ill temper. She became a hypochondriac and spent much time in nursing homes and Swiss sanatoria. She was diagnosed as having serious psychological ailments and underwent brain surgery that reportedly resulted in an improvement in her health. Her last years were spent at St. Andrew's Hospital in London.

Elsie died at St. Andrew's Hospital (demolished in 1973), [[Cricklewood]], London, aged 76, and was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16061">The '''[[Nobel Prize]]''' is an annual, international prize first awarded in 1901 for achievements in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace]]. An associated prize in [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics]] has been awarded since 1969.&lt;ref name=Britannica1&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056008 "Nobel Prize]" (2007), in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', accessed 14 November 2007, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'': {{quote|An additional award, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Bank of Sweden and was first awarded in 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prizes have been awarded to over 800 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/ |title=All Nobel Laureates |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asians have been the recipients of all six award categories: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economics. The first Asian recipient, [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was awarded the Literature Prize in 1913. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to Asian in a single year was in 2014, when five Asians became laureates. The most recent, a Japanese scientist [[Tasuku Honjo]] and Nadia Murad [[Nadia Murad]] were awarded his prizes in 2018.

To date, there have been seventy-one Asian winners of the Nobel Prize, including twenty-seven [[List of Japanese Nobel laureates|Japanese]], twelve [[List of Israeli Nobel laureates|Israeli]], and ten [[List of Chinese Nobel laureates|Chinese]] (not including non-Chinese Laureates born in China).

'''Michael Christopher Woodford''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born {{birth date|1960|6|12|df=y}}) is a British businessman who was formerly president and COO (April 2011) and CEO (October 2011) of [[Olympus Corporation]], a Japan-based manufacturer of [[optics]] and reprography products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.olympus-global.com/en/corc/ir/annualreport/2011/pdf/08.pdf |title=Board of Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers |date=29 June 2011 |publisher=Olympus Corporation |accessdate =9 February 2012 |archivedate = 9 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65KQB0fwF?url=http://www.olympus-global.com/en/corc/ir/annualreport/2011/pdf/08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining Olympus in 1981 and rising to manage its European operations, Woodford was the first non-Japanese person to be appointed as the company's CEO in October 2011,&lt;ref name=kikukawa-quits&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympus chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa quits amid scandal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15458505|accessdate=18 November 2011|publisher=BBC News |date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; having "exceeded expectations" as president and chief operating officer for the previous six months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympus-global.com/en/info/2011b/if111001corpe.jsp {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6OorIhhIa?url=http://www.olympus-global.com/en/info/2011b/if111001corpe.jsp# |date=14 April 2014 }} : ''"The company press release stated that since April 2011's appointment as president/COO, "the Board have been extremely pleased with the progress made under Mr Woodford's leadership in this role, which has exceeded the expectations at the time of his appointment"."''&lt;/ref&gt; Within two months, he became a central figure in exposing the [[Olympus scandal]], having been removed from his position after serving two weeks, when he persisted in questioning fees in excess of $US1 billion that Olympus had paid to obscure companies, which appear to have been used to hide old losses and appeared to have [[organised crime]] connections. The scandal rocked Japanese [[corporate governance]], led to the resignation of the entire Olympus board and several arrests of senior executives, including the previous CEO and chairman, and the company's former [[auditor]] and bankers among others, and made Woodford one of the most highly placed executives to turn [[whistleblower]].&lt;ref name=Curwen&gt;{{cite news|last=Curwen|first=Lesley|title=Former Olympus boss Woodford blows whistle on company|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/15742048|accessdate=15 November 2011|publisher=BBC News |date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 [[Olympus scandal|the scandal]] he exposed had developed into one of the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing [[accounting scandals|financial scandals]] in the history of corporate Japan.&lt;ref name=wsj20111107&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111107-719199.html "Olympus President: Will Do Utmost To Avoid Delisting"] (subscription).

Following a settlement for defamation and wrongful dismissal by Olympus, Woodford now consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, [[whistleblower]] laws and [[road safety]]. He also undertakes philanthropy, and has stated he has given several millions of pounds to charities.&lt;ref name="japantodayinterview" /&gt; In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal,&lt;ref name="book info on Penguin Books site"&gt;[https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/187603/exposure/9780241963616.html book info on Penguin Books site.]&lt;/ref&gt; and a film was also underway.&lt;ref name="japantodayinterview" /&gt;

==Biography==
Woodford was born in Staffordshire, but moved to Liverpool with his mother when he was seven after his parents divorced.&lt;ref name="independent-threats"/&gt; Woodford attended the [[King David High School, Liverpool]] in Liverpool.&lt;ref name="independent-threats"/&gt;

According to the Olympus website, Woodford, a graduate of [[Millbank College of Commerce]], joined KeyMed, a UK medical-equipment unit of Olympus, in 1981.

In 2008 he became executive managing director of Olympus Europa Holding GmbH. Woodford had originally flown to Tokyo to submit his resignation after Olympus purchased Gyrus, a move that would have normally been under Woodford's direct authority but instead had been arranged directly by [[Tsuyoshi Kikukawa]], the then-chairman, president, and CEO of Olympus. Kikukawa instead made Woodford head of all of Olympus's Europe operations and gave him a seat on the board of directors.

In February 2011, due to substantial growth in the European businesses, Woodford was promoted to company president, while Kikukawa stayed on as chairman and CEO. It was reported that Woodford clashed with Kikukawa after outside media sources began investigating some of Olympus's questionable acquisitions, which eventually compelled Kikukawa to give up his title as CEO.&lt;ref name=redeem&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/business/michael-woodford-would-like-a-chance-to-redeem-olympus.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Michael Woodford would like a chance to redeem Olympus| date=26 October 2011| newspaper = The New York Times| first=Hiroko| last=Tabuchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-26/olympus-chairman-kikukawa-quits-after-fees-dispute-takayama-is-president.html |title=Olympus Chairman Kikukawa Quits After Takeover Allegations Hammer Shares |author= Mariko Yasu |date= 27 October 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65KP5vwSh?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-26/olympus-chairman-kikukawa-quits-after-fees-dispute-takayama-is-president.html |archivedate= 9 February 2012 |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2011 Woodford was appointed chief executive officer of Olympus Corporation, after 30 years of working for the group, while Kikukawa remained as chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Chris (17 October 2011).

As the top executive officer in the company, Woodford would have been responsible for selecting his management team.&lt;ref name=redeem/&gt; At the time of Woodford's appointment, he was regarded as an unlikely choice. [[Reuters]] reports there were rumours that he only got the job because he would be "easy to control"; some Japanese observers saw Woodford, who speaks no Japanese, as the chairman Kikukawa's new pet. An article in ''[[FACTA (magazine)|FACTA]]'' underlined the sceptics' views, saying "The fact that the company picked a bottom-ranking foreign executive director with virtually no significant responsibilities from amongst a total pool of 25 potential candidates, including the vice-president who was responsible for medical instruments&amp;nbsp;... set tongues a-wagging."&lt;ref name=reuters20111101ridley&gt;Ridley, Kirstin; Smith, Alexander (1 November 2011).

Upon becoming CEO, Woodford discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been transferred from Olympus to advisers and companies located in places such as the [[Cayman Islands]]. After attempting to seek answers as to why the questionable transactions took place, he was dismissed from his position as President and CEO on 14 October 2011, although he retained his seat on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63S5XbxL4?url=http://www.olympus-global.com/en/info/2011b/if111014corpe.html "Olympus Corporation Resolved Dismissal of President Michael C.

Fearing for his safety after his dismissal, Woodford immediately left Japan and flew to England. After arrival in London he offered to speak to investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jonathan|title=Former Olympus chief Michael Woodford 'not safe in Japan'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/electronics/8865751/Former-Olympus-chief-Michael-Woodford-not-safe-in-Japan.html|accessdate=18 November 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He returned to Tokyo on 23 November &lt;!--(Japan time)--&gt;and later met with investigators and, under police escort, Olympus personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jonathan|title=Olympus whistleblower Michael Woodford meets Japanese authorities|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/electronics/8914049/Olympus-whistleblower-Michael-Woodford-meets-Japanese-authorities.html|accessdate=25 November 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2011, Woodford resigned from the Olympus board but said that he had an "alternative plan" to manage the company by staging a proxy fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympus whistleblower Michael Woodford quits board|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/olympus-whistleblower-michael-woodford-quits-board/articleshow/10940823.cms|date=1 December 2011 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it has been reported that Woodford was rejected by Olympus's institutional investors because they were "uncomfortable with the Englishman's combative style and also his plans to recapitalise the company through private equity or a rights issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/10/us-olympus-suit-idUSTRE80900H20120110 |title=Olympus sues execs over scandal, shares surge |date=10 January 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=13 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 2012, on failing to secure support from Japanese institutional shareholders, Woodford announced that he would abandon his proxy fight to take control of the Olympus board. Instead, his lawyers had initiated legal proceedings in London seeking unspecified damages for dismissal from his four-year contract. Woodford said that the 12-week public scandal had taken an enormous emotional toll on him and his family: "I’m not superman. I can’t change opinion in Japan in such a profound way. That has to come from within."&lt;ref name=FT20120106soble&gt;{{cite news|last=Soble |first=Jonathan |author2= Lucas, Louise |date=6 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64U2UyiOi?url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/26972fe4-37f5-11e1-a5e0-00144feabdc0.html |title=Woodford abandons bid to lead Olympus |work=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/26972fe4-37f5-11e1-a5e0-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate= 6 January 2012 |accessdate=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Woodford was awarded £10 million in an [[out-of-court settlement]] with Olympus over his dismissal.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

== After Olympus==

Since 2012, Woodford consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, [[whistleblower]] laws and [[road safety]].&lt;ref name="japantodayinterview" /&gt; In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal,&lt;ref name="book info on Penguin Books site"/&gt; and a film was also underway.&lt;ref name="japantodayinterview" /&gt;

Woodford stated in 2014 his concerns that far from learning from the scandal, Japan's response was to become even more secretive and unsupportive of change in areas highlighted by the scandal.&lt;ref name="japantodayinterview" /&gt;

[[File:Og's Bed (crop).jpg|thumb|Og’s bed (engraving circa 1770 by Johann Balthasar Probst)]]
'''Og''' ({{lang-he-n|עוֹג}}, ''‘Ōḡ'' {{IPA|ʕoːɡ}}; {{lang-ar|عوج}}, ''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;ûĝ'' {{IPAc-ar|3|uu|j}}) according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], was an [[Amorite]] king of [[Bashan]] who, along with his army, was slain by [[Moses]] and his men at the battle of [[Edrei]]. In Arabic literature he is referred to as [[‘Uj ibn Anaq]] (‘Ûj ibn ‘Anâq عوج بن عنق).

Og is introduced in the [[Book of Numbers]]. Like his neighbor [[Sihon]] of [[Heshbon]], whom Moses had previously conquered at the battle of [[Jahaz]], he was an [[Amorite]] king, the ruler of [[Bashan]], which contained sixty walled cities and many unwalled towns, with his capital at Ashtaroth (probably modern ''Tell Ashareh'', where there still exists a 70-foot mound).

The [[Book of Numbers]], Chapter 21, and [[Deuteronomy]], Chapter 3, continues:
:::"Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei." Moses speaks: "The LORD said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon ... So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors." ... "At that time we took all his cities, there was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan ... destroying every city, men, women, and children ... But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves."

Og's destruction is told in Psalms 135:11 and 136:20 as one of many great victories for the nation of Israel, and the [[Book of Amos]] 2:9 may refer to Og as "the Amorite" whose height was like the height of the [[Cedrus|cedars]] and whose strength was like that of the oaks.

Og's existence and true identity is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://remnantofgiants.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/the-origin-of-the-giant-king-og-of-bashan/|title=The Origin of the Giant King Og of Bashan|date=2012-10-04|work=Remnant of Giants|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Og and the Rephaim==
[[File:Gilgal Refa'im - Rujm el-Hiri.JPG|thumb|upright|Some see [[Rujm el-Hiri]], dating from the third Millennium BC in the [[Golan Heights]], as a source for legends about "a remnant of the giants" for Og.&lt;ref name="Yuval Ne'eman"&gt;[http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/judaism/jewish_astro.html From Og's Circle to the Wise Observatory], [[Yuval Ne'eman]], [[Tel Aviv University]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In Deut. 3:11 and later in the book of Numbers and Joshua, Og is called the last of the [[Rephaim]]. Rephaim is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for [[Giant (mythology)|giants]]. Deut. 3:11 declares that his "bedstead" (translated in some texts as "sarcophagus") of iron is "nine [[cubits]] in length and four cubits in width", which is 13.5&amp;nbsp;ft by 6&amp;nbsp;ft according to the standard cubit of a man. It goes on to say that at the royal city of [[Rabbah]] of the [[Ammon]]ites, his giant bedstead could still be seen as a novelty at the time the narrative was written. If the giant king's bedstead was built in proportion to his size as most beds are, he may have been between 9 and 13 feet in height. However, later [[Rabbinic tradition]] has it, that the length of his bedstead was measured with the cubits of Og himself.  

It is noteworthy that the region north of the [[Zarqa River#Biblical Jabbok|river Jabbok]], or [[Bashan]], "the land of Rephaim", contains hundreds of megalithic stone tombs ([[dolmen]]) dating from the 5th to 3rd millennia BC. In 1918, [[Gustav Dalman]] discovered in the neighborhood of Amman, Jordan (Amman is built on the ancient city of Rabbah of Ammon) a noteworthy dolmen which matched the approximate dimensions of Og's bed as described in the Bible. Such ancient rock burials are seldom seen west of the Jordan river, and the only other concentration of these megaliths are to be found in the hills of Judah in the vicinity of Hebron, where the giant sons of [[Anak]] were said to have lived (Numbers 13:33).&lt;ref&gt;Werner Keller ''Bible As a History'' 1995, p. 153 {{ISBN|1566198011}}, {{ISBN|9781566198011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Og in non-Biblical inscriptions ==
[[File:Pantagruel02.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] for the Fourth Book in the [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel and Gargantua]] series by [[François Rabelais]] published in ''Œuvres de Rabelais'' (Paris: Garnier Freres, 1873), vol. 2, Book IV, ch. XXVII, opposite page 87, [[Gustave Doré]], 1873]]
A reference to "Og" appears in a Phoenician inscription from Byblos (Byblos 13) published in 1974 by Wolfgang Rölling in "Eine neue phoenizische Inschrift aus Byblos," (Neue Ephemeris für Semitische Epigraphik, vol 2, 1-15 and plate 1). It appears in a damaged 7-line funerary inscription that Rölling dates to around 500 BC, and appears to say that if someone disturbs the bones of the occupant, "the mighty Og will avenge me."

A possible connection to Og and the Rephaim kings of Bashan can also be made with the much older Canaanite Ugaritic text KTU 1.108 from the 13th century B.C., which uses the term "king" in association with the root /rp/ or "Rapah" (the Rephaim of the Bible) and geographic place names that probably correspond to the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei in the Bible, and with which king Og is expressly said to have ruled from (Deuteronomy 1:4; Joshua 9:10; 12:4; 13:12, 31). The clay tablet from Ugarit KTU 1.108&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyatt|first=N.|title=Religious texts from Ugarit - 2nd Edition|year=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=0-8264-6048-8|pages=395–396|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m85MB7RkgEIC&amp;pg=PA395&amp;dq=rapiu+king+of+eternity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mJpWUZ_6CcK3iwK8wYGwCw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reads in whole, "May Rapiu, King of Eternity, drink [w]ine, yea, may he drink, the powerful and noble [god], the god enthroned in Ashtarat, the god who rules in Edrei, whom men hymn and honour with music on the lyre and the flute, on drum and cymbals, with castanets of ivory, among the goodly companions of Kothar. And may Anat the power&lt;ful&gt; drink, the mistress of kingship, the mistress of dominion, the mistress of the high heavens, [the mistre]ss of the earth."

==In the Talmud==
The Jewish Talmud embellishes the story, stating that Og was so large that he sought the destruction of the Israelites by uprooting a mountain so large, that it would have crushed the entire Israelite encampment. The Lord caused a swarm of ants to dig away the center of the mountain, which was resting on Og's head. The mountain then fell onto Og's shoulders. As Og attempted to lift the mountain off himself, the Lord caused Og's teeth to lengthen outward, becoming embedded into the mountain that was now surrounding his head. Moses, fulfilling the LORD's injunction not to fear him, seized a stick of ten cubits length, and jumped a similar vertical distance, succeeding in striking Og in the ankle. Og fell down and died upon hitting the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: Berachot 54b&lt;/ref&gt;
Many great rabbis notably [[Shlomo ibn Aderet]] have explained this story in an allegorical manner.

==In Islam==
[[File:Muhammad ibn Muhammad Shakir Ruzmah-'i Nathani - The Demon 'Uj ibn 'Unuq Carries a Mountain with which to Kill Moses and His Men - Walters W659143B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|The Demon 'Uj ibn 'Unuq Carries a Mountain with which to Kill Moses and His Men]]
''''Uj ibn Anaq''' ('Ûj ibn 'Anâq) is a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] in [[Islamic mythology]] although not mentioned in the [[Quran]]. The origins of this character lay in [[Jewish folklore]] and the [[Old Testament]], e.g. king Og. He takes his [[matronymic]] from his mother [[ʿAnāq (daughter of Adam)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Numbers|13:33}}&lt;/ref&gt; who begat him after an incestuous affair.

Famous and much-painted episodes include his fight with the Prophet Moses (''[[Moses in Islam|Musa]]''), and his fishing and frying of whales, while he stands just about knee-deep in the ocean.

=="Ogias the Giant"==
The 2nd-century BC [[apocryphal]] book "[[Ogias the Giant]]" or "The [[Book of Giants]]" depicts the adventures of a giant named Ogias who fought a great dragon, and who was supposedly either identical with the Biblical Og or was Og's father.

The book enjoyed considerable currency for several centuries, especially due to having been taken up by the [[Manichaean]] religion.

== Hurtaly ==
In ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]'', [[Rabelais]] lists [[Hurtaly]] (a version of Og) as one of Pantagruel's ancestors.  He describes Hurtaly as sitting astride the Ark, saving it from [[shipwreck]] by guiding it with his feet as the grateful Noah and his family feed him through the chimney.

[[File:Pauline, Lady Trevelyan01.jpg|thumb|Pauline Jermyn, Lady Trevelyan, circa 1835 by an unknown painter. Oil on metal. National Trust]]
'''Pauline, Lady Trevelyan''' (''née'' Paulina Jermyn;&lt;ref name=Trevelyan&gt;Trevelyan, Raleigh (1978); ''A Pre-Raphaelite Circle'', p.7; Chatto &amp; Windus, London; 1st edition. {{ISBN|0-7011-1885-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 January 1816, [[Hawkedon]]{{spaced ndash}}13 May 1866, [[Neuchâtel]]) was an English painter, noted for single-handedly making [[Wallington Hall]] in [[Northumberland]] a centre of High Victorian cultural life, and for enchanting by her intellect and art [[John Ruskin]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Christina Georgina Rossetti]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Everett Millais]], and other members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. She was married in May 1835 to Sir [[Walter Calverley Trevelyan]], 6th [[Trevelyan baronets|Baronet]].

==Background==
Paulina (known as Pauline) Jermyn was the eldest child of George Bitton Jermyn (1789–1857), of Hawkedon Parsonage, who, to ensure the Jermyn surname survived, added it as her second Christian name. Her mother was of Huguenot descendancy.&lt;ref name=Trevelyan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Jermyn, George Bitton|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage between artist Pauline Jermyn, the penniless daughter of a clergyman and the rich, teetotal, vegetarian Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan was an unlikely, but not surprisingly successful arrangement—their common interest in geology and art ensured their compatibility and the childless marriage allowed them to channel their creativity to other ends. [[William Bell Scott]] said of her,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a true woman, but without vanity, and very likely without the passion of love."&lt;ref name="Trevelyan2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trevelyan|first=Laura|title=A very British family: the Trevelyans and their world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyaD4SLE45sC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=2006-10-31|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-946-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Artistic and other interests==
Shortly before proposing to Pauline, Walter had made his future wife a gift of a box of fossils. Walter had been described as "an intellectual of a dry professional order". He was the owner of Wallington estate from 1846 until his death. Besides being a distinguished geologist, he had a great interest in botany and was an authority on farming methods, winning awards for his cattle. His strict views on alcohol led to the dumping of his father’s wine collection into a nearby lake. Pauline had met him in 1833 at a [[Cambridge]] conference of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. She had been schooled in Greek, French, Latin, German, and Italian, and her interests were science, literature and the fine arts. She wrote pieces for the [[Edinburgh Review]] and [[The Scotsman]]. On her first visit to her husband's family at Wallington, she was inspired by [[Richard Grainger]] and [[John Dobson (architect)|John Dobson]]'s redevelopment of nearby [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Walter may have been a respected scientist, but he was eclipsed by Pauline who had become the focal point for an enormous array of poets, painters and writers. It was during this period that the Central Hall evolved. In earlier days the house was surrounded by an unattractive courtyard, until Ruskin suggested that it be roofed, so that in 1855 this was done under his and [[John Dobson (architect)|John Dobson]]'s supervision. Ruskin, of whom Pauline was a great admirer and confidante,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brownwell (2013) ''Marriage of Inconvenience''&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have designed the first floor balustrade. William Bell Scott, then an art teacher in Newcastle, with help from Pauline, Ruskin and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], painted panels in the Hall showing figures and scenes from the history of Northumberland in Pre-Raphaelite style. Pauline was one of the earliest northern English patrons of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (his first having been another northern woman, [[Ellen Heaton]], daughter of a Leeds bookseller, in 1855).&lt;ref&gt;Nic Peeters in ''PRS Review'', Vol XXIII , number 1, Spring 2015 at p 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==John and Effie Ruskin==
Pauline had also been very friendly with Ruskin's wife [[Effie Gray|Effie]], but took Ruskin's side when their marriage was annulled in 1854 and subsequently shunned Effie's attempts to maintain contact with her. The previous summer the Ruskins had spent a protracted artistic holiday in the [[Scottish Highlands]] with the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Millais and his brother William. En route to Scotland the party stayed with the Trevelyans at Wallington. Pauline noticed that Ruskin and Effie (whose unconsummated marriage was under great strain) spent most of their time apart, but also seems to have been put out by Effie's flirtatious behaviour with John Millais and their lengthy absences together from the house.&lt;ref&gt;Brownwell, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, she was complimentary about Effie's appearance at an evening party at which she wore flowers in her hair, a [[Bohemian style#Pre-Raphaelites|stylistic trait]] that subsequently irritated Ruskin, came to the disapproving notice of [[Florence Nightingale]],&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais''&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired a painting by Millais ("Effie with [[Foxglove]]s in her Hair", 1853), whom Effie married in 1855.

==Burial==
Pauline was buried at [[Neuchâtel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E3Dnr_Gxm9QC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22Pauline+Jermyn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1IvuF5p-4K&amp;sig=fl-Zka6n3r442FyYLvIB21W6C24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UUQuSuCSGNPRjAero8GGCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 John Ruskin:A Life in Pictures - James S.

'''''The exploits of Quick and Flupke''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Quick et Flupke, gamins de Bruxelles'''}}) is a comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Hergé]]. Serialised weekly from January 1930 to 1940 in {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingtième]]}}, the children's supplement of conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]}} ("''The Twentieth Century''"), the series ran alongside Hergé's better known ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.

It revolves around the lives of two misbehaving boys, Quick and Flupke, who live in Brussels, and the conflict that they get into with a local policeman.

In 1983, the series provided the basis for an animated television adaptation.

== History ==

===Background===
[[Abbé]] [[Norbert Wallez]] appointed Hergé editor of a children's supplement for the Thursday issues of {{lang|fr|Le Vingtième Siècle}}, titled {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingtième]]}} ("''The Little Twentieth''").{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=24–25|2a1=Peeters|2y=1989|2pp=31–32}} Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=38}} For this new venture, Hergé illustrated ''L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet'' (''The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet''), a comic strip authored by one of the paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig.{{sfnm|Peeters|2012|1p=32|Assouline|2009|2p=16|Farr|2001|3p=12}} Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium – such as the systematic use of speech bubbles – found in such American comics as [[George McManus]]' ''[[Bringing up Father]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and [[Rudolph Dirks]]'s ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'', copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter [[Léon Degrelle]], stationed there to report on the [[Cristero War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=17|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=18|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=18}}

Hergé developed a character named [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his [[fox terrier]], [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] – "Milou" in the original French – basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=12|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=34|4a1=Thompson|4y=1991|4p=25|5a1=Assouline|5y=2009|5p=19}}  Although Hergé wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the [[Soviet Union]], acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', began serialisation in ''Le Petit Vingtième'' on 10&amp;nbsp;January 1929, and ran until 8&amp;nbsp;May 1930.{{sfnm|Peeters|2012|1pp=34–37|Assouline|2009|2pp=22–23}} Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=39–41}}  The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants, Eugène Van Nyverseel and Paul "Jam" Jamin.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|pp=32–34}}{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=42–43}}

===Publication===
According to one of Hergé's later recollections, he had returned to work following a holiday to find that the staff had publicly announced that he would be producing a new series, as a joke on his expense. Obliged to the commitment, he had to develop a new strip with only a few days notice.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} In devising a scenario, he was influenced by the French film ''Les Deux gosses'' ("The two kids"), released the previous year, as well as by his own childhood in Brussels.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} Other cinematic influences included the films of [[Charlie Chaplin]], upon whom the policemen are based.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=24}}

[[File:Quick et Flupke in Petit Vingtieme.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Quick &amp; Flupke'' on the cover on an edition of {{lang|fr|Le Petit Vingtième}}.&lt;BR&gt;The shaky drawing style is explained to be the result of an earthquake.]]
The strip first appeared in {{lang|fr|Le Petit Vingtième}} on 23 January 1930, at the time starring Quick without Flupke.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} Quick appeared on the cover of that issue, stating "Hello, friends. Don't you know me? I'm Quick, a kid from Brussels, and beginning today I'll be here every Thursday to tell you what happened to me during the week."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} Hergé borrowed the name "Quipke" from one of his friends.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=23}} Three weeks later he added the second boy as a sidekick, naming him "Suske".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} He would soon be renamed "Flupke" ("Little Philip" in [[Flemish]]).{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=23}} ''Quick et Flupke'' would be published in {{lang|fr|Le Petit Vingtième}} every Thursday for the next six years.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=23}} Hergé devoted little time to the series, typically only starting work on each strip on the morning of the day that the page were being typset, proceeding to rush to finish them within one or two hours.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=24}} Jamin thought that Hergé had greater difficulty with ''Quick and Flupke'' than with ''The Adventures of Tintin'', because of the need for a completely new idea each week.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}}

Hergé used the strip as a vehicle for jokes not considered appropriate for ''The Adventures of Tintin''.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} In particular he made repeated allusions to the fact that the strip was a cartoon; in one example, Flupke walks onto the ceiling, flies around, and then throws Quick's detached head into the air, before waking up to proclaim "Thank goodness it wasn't real! Hergé isn't still making us act like cartoons!"{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=45}} Hergé inserted himself into the strip on numerous occasions; in "The Kidnapping of Hergé", Quick and Flupke kidnap Hergé from his office, and force him to sign a statement proclaiming "I, the undersigned, Hergé, declare that, contrary to how I make it seem every week, the parties of Quick and Flupke are good, smart, obedient, etc., etc."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=45}}

Throughout the series, Hergé would give characters names that illustrated a play on words, such as the veterinarian M. Moraurat (''mort aux rats'', "death to rats"), and the two boxers Sam Suffy (''ça me suffit'', "It's good enough for me") and Mac Aronni ("[[macaroni]]").{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=24}} He also included references to present events, in one instance lampooning [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=148}} In another, the boys listen to a radio program filled with nationalistic proclamations from Hitler, Mussolini, [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[Édouard Herriot]], a Bolshevik, and a Japanese, after which they run away to listen to an organ grinder.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=49}}

In late 1935, the editors of ''Cœurs Vaillants'' ("Valiant Hearts"), a Catholic newspaper who published ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in France, requested that Hergé create a series about protagonists with a family. Hergé agreed, creating the ''[[Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' series, but soon found himself overworked in writing and drawing three comics at once. ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' were subsequently put on the back burner.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=86–87}}

For New Year 1938, Hergé designed a special cover for ''Le Petit Vingtième'' in which the characters of ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' were featured alongside those from ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and ''Jo, Zette and Jocko''.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=19}}
Hergé eventually abandoned the series in order to spend more time on ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', his more famous comic series.

===Colouration and re-publication===
After Hergé's death, the books were coloured by the [[Studios Hergé]] and re-issued by the publishing house [[Casterman]] in 12 volumes, between 1985 and 1991.

==Critical analysis==

Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline asserted that the strip was "completely opposite in spirit" to Hergé's preceding ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'', due to the fact that it was "utterly lacking in ambiguity or cynicism."{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=23}} He thought it unfair that they had been eclipsed by the fame of ''The Adventures of Tintin'', because they have a "lightness of touch, a charm, a tenderness and poetry" that are absent from the rest of Hergé's work.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=24}} Considering them to be an updated version of the German author [[Wilhelm Busch]]'s characters [[Max and Moritz]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=24}}

Another of Hergé's biographers, [[Benoît Peeters]], thought that ''Quick and Flupke'' worked as a "perfect counterpoint" to ''The Adventures of Tintin'', contrasting two-strip jokes with long stories, familiarity with exoticism, and the boys' fight against order with Tintin's fight to impose it.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=44}} He also thought it noteworthy that in the series, family bonds are "reduced to their simplest expression", with parental figures rarely appearing and the protagonists this growing up "more or less alone, protecting them as best they can against a monotonous adult world".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=88}}
Tintinologist Phillipe Goddin believed that the series expressed Hergé's "affection for his Brussels roots."{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=70}}

==List of volumes==

==Cameos in ''The Adventures of Tintin''==
Quick &amp; Flupke made short appearances in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' books:

*They are among the crowd seeing Tintin off in the first panel of ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', in both the 1931 and 1946 editions.
*In ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', Quick and Flupke can be seen running towards the docks as the expedition is about to set off.
*''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'' features a pair of boys who play a trick on [[Captain Haddock]]. They are made to look very similar to Quick and Flupke though the resemblance is minor given that the event takes place in [[La Rochelle]] in France and not an inland city in Belgium.
*Quick &amp; Flupke also appear on the back cover of some book editions of the ''Adventures of Tintin'': they are about to fire a [[slingshot]] at Captain Haddock and/or his bottle of [[whisky]].

==English translations==
The English version of ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' was produced in the early-1990s, and consisted of only two books, published by [[Mammoth Publishing]]. The books were translated by [[Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper]] and [[Michael Turner (translator)|Michael Turner]], who had previously translated ''The Adventures of Tintin''.  The text in the English volumes is not lettered in the same way as other Hergé books in English. The two English volumes are direct translations of strips in the French volumes ''Jeux Interdits'' and ''Tout va Bien''. The English edition comics are all coloured, and named ''Double Trouble'' and ''Two of a Kind''. Under Full Sail and Fasten Your Seatbelts were also published by Egmont.

In January 2008 [[Euro Books India]] (a subsidiary of [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]]) released English translations of all the 11 titles that were originally written by Hergé. The first two books were given different titles in the India release by Euro Books: Double Trouble was called Forbidden Games and Two of a Kind was renamed Everything's Fine.

Egmont planned to gradually release the English translations in the UK. Two of them (#4, Under Full Sail and #12, Fasten Your seat Belts), translated by David Radzinowicz, were released in 2009. As of late 2011, no more had been released.

==Television series==
In the 1980s the books were made into a [[television series]], the creation of which was supervised by Studios Hergé.  It was recently re-issued on Multi-regional [[DVD]] in France under 3 titles - '''Coups de Bluff'', ''Tout va Bien'' and ''Jeux Interdits''.

Februar im Alter von 77 Jahren in Stuttgart. 14 Jahre (1981-1995) war er als Leiter der Evangelischen Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen (EZW) tätig und stand mit Kompetenz und Glaubwürdigkeit prägend an der Spitze dieser Einrichtung der Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland (EKD) }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a German [[theology|theologian]] and long-term leader of the [[Evangelische Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen]] (''EZW''). The EZW (literally: Protestant Centre for Questions on World Views) is a subdivision of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]]. Located in Berlin, it professes  to function as a centralized research, documentation and information center on [[new religious movement]]s. Hummel is also the author of many books about [[new religious movement]]s.

Hummel studied [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant]] theology &lt;!-- in? --&gt; and received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1963 for the thesis "Die Auseinandersetzung zwischen Kirche und Judentum im Matthäusevangelium" (literally The dialog between church and Judaism in the [[gospel of Matthew]]). Subsequently, he worked as a [[pastor]] in [[Schleswig Holstein]]. From 1966 until 1972 he led the [[Lutheranism|Lutheranian]] theological college in [[Orissa, India]]. Back in Germany he received a request to research Indian guru movements at the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]]. He received the right to lecture with his work "Indische Mission und neue Frömmigkeit im Westen. Religiöse Bewegungen in westlichen Kulturen“, (literally: Indian mission and new piety in the West: religious movements in western cultures) that was published by the Kohlhammer group.

From 1981 until 1994 he was director of the EZW. In his work he disagreed with the concept and explanatory model of ''Jugendreligion'' (literally [[youth religion]]) for new religious communities, as it was popularized by among others the German author [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Haack]] (1935–1991). In the beginning he fully rejected the controversial use of the German word "[[:de:sekte|sekte]]" (that is translated sometimes with "[[cult]]" but also as "[[sect]]" in English), but in his later works he recognized the justification of the concept in differentiated use.

He asserted that some of the groups monitored by the EZW had developed both in the society as well as in interfaith dialogue in a positive way, i.e. that they had decreased their original potential for conflict. This assertion was both respected and rejected. It would be especially applicable for the [[Jehovah's witnesses]], the [[Unification Church]], and [[ISKCON]]/Hare Krishnas. In spite of this, the Unification Church is still very critical about his assessment of the church.

'''Sarah Ratley (nee Gorelick)''' (born October 30, 1931) is an [[United States|American]] pilot and one of the [[Mercury 13]] female [[Astronaut|astronauts]] group. 

== Biography ==
Born on October 30, 1931 in [[Kansas]], Gorelick learned to fly in 1949 and raced in the [[Powder Puff Derby (1947)|Powder Puff Derby]] and toured with the [[Ninety-Nines]]. She graduated from the [[University of Denver]] with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, minoring in physics, chemistry and aeronautics, then worked as an engineer at [[AT&amp;T]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/g/gorelick.html |publisher=Astronautix |title=Gorelick, Sarah Lee nee Ratley |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/support/wall-of-honor/sarah-lee-gorelick-ratley|title=Sarah Lee Gorelick Ratley|publisher=National Air and Space Museum|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a tour of Europe she heard about a space research program, which produced the [[Mercury 13]] and was invited to take part upon her return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CBC|title=The Mercury 13: The women who trained for space flight until NASA shut them down |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-388-trump-s-mob-ties-new-brunswick-flood-muterkelly-p-k-subban-s-dad-mercury-13-and-more-1.4646381/the-mercury-13-the-women-who-trained-for-space-flight-until-nasa-shut-them-down-1.4646407|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She underwent invasive testing, including freezing the inner ear with ice water to induce vertigo. She said of the experience, "The tests didn’t bother me at all…. When you are young you can take anything. My mind was made up: I was going to pass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://magazine.du.edu/alumni/a-woman-with-wings/ |title=A woman with wings |accessdate=15 June 2018|date=1 September 2007 |author=Nicole Branan |publisher=University of Denver Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mercury 13, Gorelick became an accountant with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and in 2007 received an honorary Doctorate of Science from the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="nasm" /&gt;

'''Scott Shaw''' (born September 23, 1958)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/395482 Scott Shaw Biography and Filmography at the British Film Institute]''&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author, actor, composer, martial artist, and filmmaker.&lt;ref name="poemhunter.com"&gt;[http://poemhunter.com/scott-shaw/biography/ Scott Shaw Biography] at PoetryHunter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw Biography|url=http://moosin.com/author/shaw/|work=Scott Shaw Authors at Moosin|accessdate=26 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817093430/http://moosin.com/author/shaw/|archivedate=August 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shaw was born in [[Hollywood]], California. He spent his early years in [[South Central Los Angeles]] and then returned to Hollywood for his adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood High School Notable Graduates|url=http://www.hollywoodhighschool.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=63766&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=108329|work=Hollywood High School|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved with the [[martial arts]] and eastern [[mysticism]] at an early age.

==Career==
Shaw has had a career in both the arts and the sciences. He first became noticed as an author when his poetry and [[literary fiction]] began to be published in literary journals in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="poemhunter.com"/&gt; Beginning in the mid-1980s Shaw's writings also began to be published on the subjects of [[anthropology]] and the [[social science]]s. Though his writings have span many genres, Shaw is most well known as an author on the subject of the martial arts. This is due to the voluminous amount of written work he has composed on the subject. Over three hundred of his articles on the martial arts have been published and he is the author of several books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/a/OL219802A?m=view&amp;v=4 Scott Shaw Biography and Books-in-Print at Open Library.org]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation for Shaw's writings on the martial arts began when he was six years old. This is the point when he began his study of the Korean martial art of [[Hapkido]].&lt;ref name=CMArts&gt;[http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/halloffame/scottshaw.htm Scott Shaw Biography] at ''Complete Martial Arts Hall of Fame''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw studied and taught Hapkido and [[Taekwondo]] until in 1987 he was the first American to be awarded the 7th Degree [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]] in [[Moo Duk Kwan Taekwondo]]. In 1988 he earned the rank of 7th Degree Black Belt in [[Kumdo]].&lt;ref name=CMArts /&gt; In 1996 he was the first non-Korean to be promoted to the rank of 7th Degree Black Belt by [[The Korea Hapkido Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw Biography|url=http://www.tuttlepublishing.com/books-by-country/hapkido|work=Tuttle Publishing|accessdate=26 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806045526/http://www.tuttlepublishing.com/books-by-country/hapkido|archivedate=August 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw at Simon and Schuster|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Scott-Shaw/460359466|work=Simon and Schuster|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to this he had been certified a Hapkido 7th Degree Black Belt in Hapkido Moo Hak Kwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hapkido Family Tree|url=http://www.sinmoohapkido.be/Hapkido%20Family%20Tree.htm|work=Sin MooHapkido|accessdate=26 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102023/http://www.sinmoohapkido.be/Hapkido%20Family%20Tree.htm|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Kung Fu'', October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time he has been promoted to 8th Degree Black Belt in both Hapkido and Taekwondo.&lt;ref name="martialinfo.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.martialinfo.com/martial-art-instructors/profile.asp?martial-arts-id=4354 | title = Scott Shaw's Martial Arts Biography |website= MartialInfo.com| accessdate = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= John Corcoran and Emil Farkas| title=The Martial Arts Encyclopedia | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4783-5178-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw has also written numerous articles and several books on [[Zen Buddhism]], [[Yoga]], [[Eastern Religion]] and [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]]. His books have been translated into several languages. These writings are based in the fact that from his youth forward Shaw has been involved with eastern philosophy. He was a direct disciple of [[Swami Satchidananda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Satchidananda|url=http://www.gurusfeet.com/guru/swami-satchidananda|work=Guru's Feet.com|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Satchidananda|url=http://www.writespirit.net/authors/swami-satchidananda/|work=Write Spirit|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottshaw.com/satchidananda.html Scott Shaw with Swami Satchidananda] at ScottShaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he studied with such teachers as [[Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan]] and [[Thich Thien-An]].

By the age of eighteen he was a certified instructor of [[Hatha Yoga]] and [[Raja Yoga]].&lt;ref name="martialinfo.com"/&gt; At this point in his life he traveled to India where he was initiated into various [[Buddhist]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sufi]] sects and became [[Sannyasa]]. Shaw is also a [[Frater Rosae Crucis]] of the [[Rosicrucian Order]]. He is known to frequently travel in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, documenting Asian culture in words and on film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw Biography|url=https://it-ebooks24.com/author/scott-shaw|work=IT eBooks|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zen filmmaking==
In association to his writings, Shaw is also an active actor and filmmaker.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{IMDb name|0002396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw Biography|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/87/Scott-Shaw.html|work=Film Reference|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 he developed a new style of filmmaking that he titled Zen Filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zen Filmmaking|url=http://www.zenfilmmaking.mynetworksolutions.com/|work=Zen Filmmaking|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw Trivia|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002396/bio?ref_=nm_ql_1#trivia|work=Internet Movie Database|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of filmmaking is defined by the fact that no [[screenplay]] is used in the creation of a film. ''"In Zen filmmaking the spontaneous creative energy of the filmmaker is the only defining factor. This allows for a spiritually pure source of immediate inspiration to be the only guide in the filmmaking process."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Shaw|url=http://www.tv.com/people/scott-shaw/|work=T.V.com|accessdate= 26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extensively defined this style of filmmaking in his 2008 book ''Zen Filmmaking''.

In India, [[security detail]]s are provided to some high-risk individuals by the police and local government. Depending on the threat perception to the person, the category is divided into four tiers: Z+ (highest level), Z, Y and X. Individuals under this security blanket include the President, Vice-President, Prime-Minister, Supreme Court and High Court Judges, Service Chiefs of Indian Armed Forces, Governors of State, Chief Ministers and Cabinet Ministers.&lt;ref name=HT1&gt;{{cite news|title=What is X, Y and Z security category?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/What-is-X-Y-and-Z-security-category/Article1-228435.aspx|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=7 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427100009/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/What-is-X-Y-and-Z-security-category/Article1-228435.aspx|archivedate=27 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Special Protection Group|SPG]]''' category – ''Strength of security detail is Classified'' (only provided to the current and former [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Ministers of India]] and their immediate family members.)
* '''Z+''' category has a security cover of 55 personnel [Including 10+ SPG Commando] + [Police Personnel] 
* '''Z''' category has a security cover of 22 personnel  [Including 4 or 5 NSG Commando] + [Police Personnel]
* '''Y''' category has a security cover of 11 personnel  [Including 1 or 2 Commando] + [Police Personnel]
* '''X''' category has a security cover of 2 personnel [No Commando, Only Armed Police Personnel]

The Z+ level of security is provided by [[National Security Guard]] commandos. They are armed with [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] submachine guns and modern communication equipment, and each member of the team is adept in martial arts and unarmed combat skills. Currently 17 VIPs are provided with such protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naxal threat: Raman Singh gets 'Z+' NSG cover|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Naxal-threat-Raman-Singh-gets-Z-NSG-cover/Article1-1066372.aspx|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=26 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527213529/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Naxal-threat-Raman-Singh-gets-Z-NSG-cover/Article1-1066372.aspx|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 'Z' category entails security cover by the Delhi police or the ITBP or CRPF personnel and one escort car. The 'Y' category encompasses two personal security officers (PSOs) and the 'X' category, one PSO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/india/What-is-X-Y-and-Z-security-category/Article1-228435.aspx |title=''What is X, Y and Z security category?'' |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621081813/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/What-is-X-Y-and-Z-security-category/Article1-228435.aspx |archivedate=2012-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPG ([[Special Protection Group]]), NSG ([[National Security Guards]]), ITBP ([[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]]) and CRPF ([[Central Reserve Police Force]]) are the agencies responsible for providing securities to [[VVIP]]s, [[VIP]]s, politicians, high-profile celebrities and sportspersons. The NSG is used extensively to guard VIPs and VVIPs, especially those in the Z+ category. Many NSG personnel are seconded to the Special Protection Group (SPG) which guards the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Bv6xLDStKhw1TH1YNoazoI/Understanding-VIP-security-in-India.html|title=Understanding VIP security in India|last=Doval|first=Nikita|work=Mint|date=9 June 2015|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In some cases being placed in a category is viewed as a status symbol by politicians, and many use their clout to secure a Z+ security cover. This is criticized often by media as a waste of taxpayer's money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_my-security-is-z-what-s-yours_1276930|title=My security is Z+, what’s yours?|last=|first=|date=2009-07-25|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Home Minister [[P. Chidambaram]] phased out the use of the NSG for VIP protection in all but the most serious cases. Nevertheless, controversies arose as many politicians remained under Z+ cover while many bureaucrats were moved down to Y.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=}}

In 2014 as a part of Z security, 25 personnel of the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab Police]] were put in attendance for the security of [[Ashutosh (spiritual leader)|Ashutosh Maharaj, a spiritual leader who has been declared clinically dead]] by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For Z security personnel, this dead saint is `alive`|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/for-z-security-personnel-this-dead-saint-is-alive/1017252|accessdate=6 July 2017|work=Patrika Group|date=11 July 2014|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714012127/http://www.patrika.com/news/for-z-security-personnel-this-dead-saint-is-alive/1017252|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==

'''The Michaels''' is a public name&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Steven, "Michael Stark and Michael Leshner," ''Time'', Canadian Edition, December 29, 2003/January 5, 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; used to refer to the couple '''Michael Stark''' and '''Michael Leshner'''.  They were the men who in 2003 entered into the first legal [[same-sex marriage in Canada]], and were consequently named the [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year (Time)|Canadian Newsmakers of the Year]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

==Background==
Leshner is a lawyer and a Jew, while Stark is a Catholic&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and a manager involved in [[graphic design]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Tyler, "Gay couple hope to get married today ; Pair is waiting for appeal court's decision in Charter case Judge set to perform ceremony if Ottawa loses ruling," ''[[Toronto Star]]'', June 10, 2003, pg. A.04.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leshner was born on April 8, 1948, in [[Niagara Falls, New York]].  He then lived in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]] and went to [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (St. Catharines)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]]. Feeling isolated in small-town Ontario as a homosexual, he went for post-secondary education to the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Poei, "Gay couple celebrating first wedding anniversary," ''Standard'', St. Catharines, Ontario: June 10, 2004, pg. A.3.Fro.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Leshner, who worked for the Ontario government, made news when he successfully argued before the [[Ontario Human Rights Tribunal]] that the provincial government should allow survivor pensions for gay people.&lt;ref&gt;"Ontario won't appeal gay rights ruling; Group says there's no political will to end discrimination in provincial laws". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 29, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; He then told the media he believed that private companies should also allow such pensions for homosexuals, or they could be subject to the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]].  Leshner also said, "I'm rather hard on the gay and lesbian community in part because I think there's too much emphasis on why you should feel sorry for yourself. Social change will happen as quickly as you're willing to move it. If it doesn't happen, don't blame [Prime Minister Brian] [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]]."&lt;ref&gt;Staff, "Gay rights ruling affects companies, lawyer says," ''Kitchener- Waterloo Record'', Kitchener, Ontario: November 5, 1992, p. B.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 decision led the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] government of [[Bob Rae]] to introduce the [[Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act]] (Bill 167) in 1994, although the bill failed on second reading amid controversy.

==Marriage==
When Leshner heard of colleagues' plans to try to legalize same-sex civil marriage, he persuaded Stark to get married so the two could start the case.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Leshner considered himself to have been in a [[common law marriage]] with Stark for 22 years.&lt;ref name="Leshner"&gt;Michael Leshner, "Why gays find Harper scary," ''[[Toronto Star]]'', June 10, 2004, pg. A.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the ruling by a lower Ontario court, Leshner proposed to Stark in front of reporters.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Abbate, "Lovers now at liberty to pop big question," ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 13, 2002, pg. A.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The marriage then occurred after the decision ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] deciding homosexuals should be allowed to marry.  The Michaels afterwards became well known in their city [[Toronto]], and appeared in the 2003 [[gay pride parade]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two even made international news.&lt;ref&gt;"Ontario: Gay couple top newsmaker," ''Examiner'', Barrie, Ontario: December 22, 2003, pg. A.8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Boddum, a Canadian artist profiled in the ''[[National Post]]'' for his work based on dogs, made a portrait called "Schmikey the Schnauzer" for Leshner and Stark as a wedding present.  The ''National Post'' said this was "Boddum's most famous commission to date."&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Atkinson, "Picture-perfect Pop Art Pups: Retail Therapy: Give your dog his day with a custom portrait," ''[[National Post]]'', December 20, 2003, pg. TO.07.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' selected the couple as Newsmakers of the Year as an emblem of "the year that Canada rethought what was taboo," referring to other events such as the loosening of marijuana laws.  Leshner replied that "I really feel like we're Canada's new [[Mary Pickford]]... we are Canada's sweethearts... What better human rights story to send around the world that says Canada loves the Michaels, and for the rest of the world to wonder, what on earth is going on in Canada?"&lt;ref&gt;CBC.ca, "[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/12/21/newsmakers031221.html Gay couple Time's Canadian newsmaker for 2003]," December 21, 2003, URL accessed 20 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some Canadians have been critical of Leshner and Stark, and wrote to newspapers calling them a "sick aberration," while other Canadians did defend them.  One paper called this an "apt reflection of public [[opinion poll]]s" indicating Canadians were divided on whether same-sex marriage should be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;"Marriage revolutionized in 2003," ''Star-Phoenix'', Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: December 26, 2003, pg. D.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', in choosing the "Nation Builders of the year," did not select Leshner and Stark.  However, they did select the judges involved in the case, namely Chief Justice [[Roy McMurtry]], Eileen Gillese and James MacPherson.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Anderssen, "Doing Canada justice," ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', December 13, 2003, pg. F.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afterwards==
In 2003, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie, Ontario|Bishop Jean-Louis Plouffe]] argued that future-Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]] would not be truly Catholic if his government recognized same-sex marriage.  At around the same time, [[Frederick Henry (bishop)|Bishop Fred Henry]] said then-Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] may go to hell for recognizing such marriages.  Leshner responded to these arguments, which he called "religious intolerance," by saying "I think the bishop has eaten too much mad cow... The Charter of Rights trumps the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Lunman and Campbell Clark, "Top bishop challenges Martin on same-sex," ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 1, 2003, pg. A.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Leshner wrote a column in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' speaking out against [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]]. Leshner expressed fear that Harper would use the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to overrule gay rights in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  Leshner said that "I am beginning to feel like a Jew in Germany in the early 1930s."&lt;ref name="Leshner"/&gt;

Also in 2004, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] listed Leshner and Stark among the intervenors in the case ''[[Re Same-Sex Marriage]]'', which found that the federal government could establish same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reference re Same-Sex Marriage]]'', [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the decision, the press noted Leshner and Stark took part in celebrations. Leshner publicly commented in reference to [[Premier of Alberta|Alberta Premier]] [[Ralph Klein]], who Leshner perceived as having been defeated by the ruling, "Ralph, I'm 56-years-old and I can now say: 'Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-na-na.'"&lt;ref&gt;James Cowan, "Tories 'whomped,' gay advocate says," ''[[National Post]]'', Don Mills, Ontario: December 10, 2004, pg. A.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trijntje Cornelisdochter Keever''' (April 10 or 16, 1616 – July 22, 1633), nicknamed '''De Groote Meid''' (in English, ''The Big Girl''), is alleged to be the tallest female person in recorded history, standing 9 Amsterdam feet&lt;ref&gt;''Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot Bevordering der Geneeskunst, Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde''. vol. 99, March 26, 1955, p. 964. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=bnIGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=trijntje+keever&amp;dq=trijntje+keever fragment via Google Books, digitized Nov 26, 2008 at the University of California])&lt;/ref&gt; or {{convert|2.54|m|ftin}}&lt;ref&gt;Nederlands Algemeen Rijksarchief, Verslagen omtrent 's rijks oude Archieven, vol.11, 1890, p.153, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pOIBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=Trijntje+Cornelis+Keever&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false fragment via Google Books, digitized May 4, 2007 at the New York Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; tall at the time of her death at age seventeen.

Trijntje Keever was the daughter of Cornelis Keever and Anna Pouwels. Cornelis was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Sea_captain#Skipper|skipper]] and Anna was his maid; he married her on May 24, 1605. Trijntje was born on April 10 or 16, 1616 in [[Edam, Netherlands|Edam]].

Trijntje’s parents took her to carnivals to earn some money by letting people see her. Trijntje first received public attention when she was nine years old and had reached the height of {{convert|2|m|ftin}}. A royal company consisting of the [[Bohemia]]n king [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], his wife [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]] and the princess [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], living in [[The Hague]] at the time, visited her, curious about the “nine-year-old girl taller than every man in Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/TrijntjeKeever |last=Kloek |first=Els |authorlink=Els Kloek |title=Trijntje Keever |agency= Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland | language=Dutch |publisher=Inghist.nl |date= |accessdate= 2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trijntje died of [[cancer]] at the age of 17 in Ter Veen. She was buried on 7 July 1633 in Edam, her town of birth. Her epitaph is said to have read, “Trijntje Crelis groote meidt oudt 17 jaer”, or, in English: “Trijntje Crelis, big girl, 17 years of age”. In the townhall of Edam is a lifesize painting by an unknown artist portraying Trijntje in civilian clothes with a belt holding at her right a keyring and at her left a pincushion and a sheath with a knife, fork, and spoon. The caption with the painting suggests she was portrayed more beautiful than she really was and that she probably suffered from [[acromegaly]].

Her original shoes are also on display. If there were a size for the shoes, they would be European size 54 (36&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref&gt;shoe size {{cvt|36|cm}} according to museum where the shoes are on display&lt;/ref&gt; or {{convert|36|cm|disp=out|abbr=off}} long).

If her height was correct, she would be the tallest woman ever, overtaking [[Zeng Jinlian]], and be the fourth-tallest person ever, behind [[Robert Wadlow]], [[John Rogan]] and [[John F. Carroll]]. She was the tallest person (alleged) ever until [[John Rogan]].

{{Ulysses Grant sidebar}}
After the Civil War, '''[[Ulysses S. Grant]]''' spent four years as head of the United States Army in peacetime.  With his defeat of [[Robert E. Lee]] and the Confederacy, Grant was the most popular man in the country. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended Grant turned his attention to the Plains in the American West where there was numerous conflicts between white settlers, railroads, and Native Americans that resulted in wars between the Natives and the U.S. military. While the attempted [[Fenian raids|Fenian invasion of Canada]] and [[French intervention in Mexico]] took some of his time, Grant's biggest focus was on [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] of the defeated Southern states.  Grant found himself caught between President [[Andrew Johnson]], who wanted leniency to the South and a continuation of the social structure there, and the [[Radical Republican]]s in Congress, who wanted harsher punishment to rebel leaders and more government assistance to the freed slaves.  Grant preserved his popularity and authority throughout the crisis that culminated in [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Johnson's impeachment]].  In 1868, the Republicans nominated Grant for president, and he won easily over his Democratic challenger.

==Celebrations and honors==
[[File:USGrantHomeGalena.jpg|thumb|left|The post-Civil War [[Ulysses S. Grant Home|home]] of Ulysses S. Grant, in [[Galena, Illinois]].]]
In May 1865, the [[Union League of Philadelphia]] purchased the Grants a house in that city, but Grant's work was in Washington. He attempted to commute for a time and return on the weekends, but he and Julia decided to move to Washington.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=419}}  They secured a place in Georgetown Heights, while Grant instructed [[Elihu Washburne]] that, politically, his legal residence remained in [[Galena, Illinois]].{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=232–233}} In the spring of 1865, Grant made an appearance at [[Cooper Union]] in New York; the ''New York Times'' described the reception for the war hero: "...the enhanced and bewildered multitude trembled with extraordinary delight."{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=234}} Further travels that summer, with repeated enthusiastic receptions, took the Grants to Albany and back to Galena and throughout Illinois and Ohio.  On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of [[General of the Army of the United States]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=434n}}

Grant was the most popular man in the country.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=369–397}}  When Johnson was at loggerheads with the Congress over Reconstruction, he took his case to the people with his infamous "swing around the circle" throughout the country and he sought to capitalize on Grant's popularity by having Grant travel with him.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=369–397}}  Grant, wishing to appear loyal, agreed to accompany Johnson; however he confided in his wife that he thought Johnson's speeches were a "national disgrace". Grant continued his efforts to appear loyal while not alienating Republican legislators essential to his future.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=242–251}} At the same time, Johnson also suspected Grant to be a potential candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868 presidential election]], and decided to replace Secretary of War Stanton with Grant or Sherman. Grant discussed the matter with Sherman and initially convinced him to avoid the politically troubled president.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=242–251}}

Johnson sent Grant on a fact-finding tour of the South after which he filed a report recommending continuation of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] but opposed use of black troops in garrisons which were still needed in the South for protection of both races. He also warned of threats by disaffected poor people, black and white, and recommended that local decision making be entrusted only to "thinking men", by which he was thought to have meant, men of property. In this respect, Grant's initial Reconstruction policy aligned with Johnson's policy of pardoning established southern leaders and restoring them to their positions of power. He joined Johnson in arguing that Congress should allow congressional representatives from the South to be seated.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=238–241}}

==Mexico and Canada==
[[File:Benito Pablo Juárez García.png|thumb|Grant supported Mexican president [[Benito Juárez]] and hoped to see the French expelled from Mexico.]]
Grant, as commanding general, immediately had to contend with [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Mexico]] and the French army which had taken over Mexico under the authority of [[Napoleon III]]. Most Americans felt this to be a violation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]].  Johnson told Grant to put military pressure on the French to leave Mexico by sending 50,000 troops to the Texas border under Sheridan. Grant told Sheridan to do whatever it took to get Maximilian to abdicate and the French Army to leave Mexico. Sheridan sent [[Benito Juárez]], the ousted leader of Mexico, 60,000 US rifles to aid in an effort to defeat Maximilian. By 1866, the French Army completely withdrew from Mexico; Maximilian was executed by Juárez in 1867.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=415}}  In a cabinet meeting, Johnson suggested Grant be assigned to the Mexican frontier as a way of removing him from the political mainstream. Grant immediately recognized the nature of this proposal, and refused.  As a compromise Grant sent Sherman (now promoted to Lieutenant General) in his place.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=257}}

After the Civil War, thousands of [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish veterans]] joined the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] with the intention of invading and holding Canada hostage in exchange for Irish independence.  In June 1866, Johnson sent Grant to Buffalo, New York, to assess the situation. He ordered the Canada–US border closed to prevent Fenian soldiers from crossing over at [[Fort Erie]] and that more weapons be confiscated. In June 1866, the United States Army arrested 700 Fenian troops at Buffalo and the Fenians gave up on their attempt to invade Canada.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=508–513}}

==Indian Wars==
Grant, as commanding general, inherited the "Indian Wars" in the western frontiers, especially the Plains, as the United States continued westward expansion. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended in 1865, Grant turned his attention to the neglected American western frontier. One of these Plains wars, known as [[Red Cloud's War]], starting in July 1866, was led by Sioux Chief [[Red Cloud]]. To end hostilities, Grant ordered forts on the Powder River to be abandoned and for General [[William T. Sherman]] to make a peace treaty with the [[Sioux]]. As a result, Red Cloud signed the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty]] in 1868 successfully negotiated by Sherman. {{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=414-415}}

==Grant, Johnson, and Reconstruction==
{{main|Reconstruction Era of the United States}}

In November 1865, Johnson sent Grant on a fact-finding mission to the South. Grant recommended continuation of a reformed [[Freedmen's Bureau]], which Johnson opposed, but advised against the use of black troops in garrisons, which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1p=390|Smith|2001|2p=420|McFeely|1981|3pp=238–241}} Grant did not believe the people of the South were ready for self-rule, and that both whites and blacks in the South required protection by the federal government. Concerned four years of war led to a diminished respect for civil authorities, Grant concluded the Army should continue their presence to maintain order.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=390}} He also warned of threats by disaffected poor people, black and white, and recommended that local decision-making be entrusted only to "thinking men of the South" (i.e., white men of property).{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=238, 240}} In this respect, Grant's opinion on Reconstruction aligned with Johnson's policy of restoring former Confederates to their positions of power, arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to take their seats.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=240–241|Smith|2001|2pp=420–421}} Grant believed that former Confederates should be reenlisted into the U.S. military.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=382–383}} He personally intervened on behalf of Lee, who had been [[Indictment|indicted]] for [[Treason laws in the United States|treason]] along with other Confederate generals, keeping Lee safe from prosecution, saving the nation from opening up old war wounds.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=417–418|White|2016|2pp=417–418}} In January 1866, Grant authorized the removal of cases against Union officers, to federal courts and the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].{{sfn|Simon|2002|pp=243–244}} On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of [[General of the Army of the United States]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=434n}}

In the elections of 1866, an intraparty fight arose in Maryland, when the mayor of Baltimore, a Radical, appointed Radical police commissioners who would be responsible for managing voter registration. Maryland's governor, a partisan of Johnson, requested that federal troops intervene, which Grant initially considered inappropriate. To provide some manner of response, Grant met as a civilian with the opposing party heads and, with use of the army an implicit threat, was able to facilitate a settlement.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=254–256}}

Grant's service as Union General, caused him to join the Republican Party, and forced him to consider [[African Americans]] as both humans and soldiers.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=243}} Johnson, a robust Democrat, sided with white supremacists and openly held racist views, believing blacks were inferior and that the country and government were for "white men".{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=532, 550}} Johnson favored a lenient approach to Reconstruction, calling for an immediate return of the former Confederate states into the Union without any guarantee of [[African American]] civil rights.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=397–398}}  The [[Radical Republican]]-controlled Congress opposed the idea and refused to admit Congressmen from the former Confederate states.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=392, 396}} Congress, over Johnson's vetoes, renewed the Freedmen's Bureau and passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. With Johnson at war with Congress, Grant and Johnson found themselves in a quiet conflict over Reconstruction enforcement, while Grant as a soldier was determined to remain loyal to his Commander In Chief.{{sfn|Simon|2002|pp=243–244}} Needing Grant's popularity, Johnson took Grant on his "[[Swing Around the Circle]]" tour, speaking out against Congressional Reconstruction.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1p=396|Simon|2002|2p=244}} Enthusiastic cheering for Grant interrupting Johnson's speeches caused the relationship between Johnson and Grant to cool.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=435–436}} Grant believed that Johnson was purposefully agitating conservative opinion to defy Congressional Reconstruction, privately calling Johnson's speeches a "national disgrace".{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=397–398}} Concerned that Johnson's differences with Congress would cause renewed insurrection, Grant ordered Southern arsenals to ship arms north to prevent their capture by Southern state governments.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=398–399}} Having returned to Washington, Johnson attempted to send Grant on a mission to Mexico, but Grant refused to go, believing the President did not have authority to send him on a diplomatic mission.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=244}}

On March 2, 1867, overriding Johnson's veto, making unprecedented use of the power of the military, Congress passed the first of three [[Reconstruction Acts]], which divided the southern states into five military districts. Transitional state governments in each district were to be led by military governors, to ensure that [[African Americans]]' newly granted constitutional and congressional rights were protected.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=432–433|Simon|2002|2p=244}} Grant, who was to select the general to govern each district, preferred the will of Congress through the enforcement of congressional Reconstruction, but at the outset opposed the use of the military.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=259–261}} Nevertheless, Grant adapted and by complying with the Acts and instructing his subordinates to do likewise, he further alienated Johnson. For example, Grant authorized Sheridan to remove public officials in Louisiana who were against congressional Reconstruction. Sheridan's aggressive methods to register freedmen met with Johnson's disapproval, and the President sought his removal. Grant perceptively stayed the middle course, and recommended a rebuke but not a dismissal.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=259–261|Smith|2001|2pp=436–439}} Protecting Grant, Congress passed the Command of the Army Act, attached to an army appropriation bill, preventing his removal or relocation, and forcing Johnson to pass orders through Grant, the general in chief.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1p=438|Simon|2002|2p=244}} Republicans gained majorities in all 11 states, and African Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=421, 432–433|Chernow|2017|2pp=686–687}} Grant hoped that Reconstruction Acts would help pacify the South.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=434–435}}  The Army conducted new elections for constitutional conventions in the ex-Confederate states. They registered blacks to vote and in many places prevented from voting white men who had supported the Confederacy, as set out in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|disenfranchisement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]].{{sfnm|1a1=Perman|1y=1973|1pp=272–274|2a1=Rogers|2a2=Atkins|2y=2010|2pp=241–244|3a1=Edgar|3y=1998|3pp=385–388}} Throughout the Reconstruction period, more than 1,500 [[List of African-American officeholders during the Reconstruction|African Americans were elected to political office]], while Grant and the military protected their rights initially by overturning the black codes in 1867.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=421, 433}} Congressional Reconstruction finally ended with the [[Compromise of 1877]] and the complete withdrawal of military troops from the southern states.

[[Image:Senate-Johnson-Impeachment-Trials.jpg|thumb|Drawing of group of men in the Senate chamber arranged around the dais|The trial of Andrew Johnson before the Senate]]

Johnson and Grants differing civilian and military backgrounds would cause a collision course over policy.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=243}} On August 12, 1867, during a Senate recess, President Johnson suspended Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], a Lincoln appointee who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction.{{sfnm|Cullum|1891|1p=172|White|2016|2pp=447–448, 453}} Grant, himself, respected Stanton and sided with him on Reconstruction while both shared a dismay for Johnson.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=593}} To keep Grant under control as a potential political rival, Johnson asked him to take the post. Grant recommended against the move, in light of the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], which required Senate approval for cabinet removals. Johnson believed the Act did not apply to officers appointed by the previous president and forced the issue by making Grant an interim appointee on the same day.{{sfn|Cullum|1891|p=172}} Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily, and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=262–264|White|2016|2pp=447–448}}

On January 10, 1868, the Senate Committee on Military Affairs voted to recommend reinstatement of Stanton to office.{{sfn|White|2016|p=453}} The following day, Grant consulted with his staff and rereading the Tenure of Office Act, he learned that if he kept the office he would be subject to a $10,000 fine and a five-year prison term.{{sfn|White|2016|p=453}} Grant hurried to the White House and told Johnson he was not going to break federal law.{{sfn|White|2016|p=453}} Johnson told Grant he would pay the fine and go to prison in Grant's place, but Grant found Johnson's answer preposterous.{{sfn|White|2016|p=453}} On Monday, January 13, the Senate voted to reinstate Stanton to office 35 to 6.{{sfn|White|2016|p=454}} The following morning, Grant locked up his War Department office and gave the key to Assistant Adjutant General [[Edward D. Townsend]].{{sfnm|Cullum|1891|1p=172|White|2016|2p=454}} One hour later, when Stanton arrived at the War Department office, Townsend gave Stanton the key, witnessed by welcoming onlookers.{{sfn|White|2016|p=454}}

This incurred Johnson's wrath; at a cabinet meeting immediately afterward, Johnson accused Grant of breaking his promise to remain Secretary of War. Grant disputed that he had ever made such a promise although cabinet members later testified he had done so. Newspapers friendly to Johnson published a series of articles to discredit Grant over returning the War Department to Stanton, stating that Grant had been deceptive in the matter. This public insult infuriated Grant, and he defended himself in an angry letter to Johnson, after which the two men were confirmed foes. When Grant's statement became public, it increased his popularity among Radical Republicans and he emerged from the controversy unscathed.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=448–451}} Although Grant favored Johnson's impeachment, he took no active role in the [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment proceedings]], which were fueled in part by Johnson's removal of Stanton. Johnson barely survived, and none of the other Republican leaders directly involved benefited politically in their unsuccessful attempt to remove the president.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=275}}

==1868 presidential campaign==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1868}}

Grant's curt response to Johnson in the Stanton matter increased his popularity with the Radical Republicans. [[John Weiss Forney]], editor of the ''Washington Daily Chronicle'', who had paved the way for previous presidential nominations, took up the effort for Grant's nomination, by first inquiring with Brig. Gen. [[John Aaron Rawlins]], a Grant confidant, about Grant's interest in the presidency. Rawlins responded that while Grant was a loyal member of the Republican Party, he would be unable to serve as president for financial reasons, since he would lose his lifetime military pension upon ascendancy to the White House, and the presidency did not provide any such income benefit. By becoming President under current terms, Grant would at best leave the office at age 56 with no income, assuming he served two terms. Rawlins hoped Forney could facilitate a legislative change to solve the problem. The ultimate answer was that this could not be changed.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=264–265}} Forney forged ahead with an editorial reviewing Grant's record with the recommendation for his nomination; Grant personally approved the writing before publication. By reviewing the article, though limited to the accuracy of his record, Grant implicitly opened the door for the nomination despite the precarious financial prospects in his future.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=266–267}}

The Republicans chose Grant as their presidential candidate on the first ballot at the [[1868 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago; he faced no significant opposition. The Republicans kept the name "[[National Union Party (United States)|Union]]" on their ticket as had been done earlier at their 1864 convention.{{sfn|Schlesinger|1973|p=1287}} Grant received all 650 votes from delegates, with no other candidate being nominated, and upon the announcement was welcomed with a "frenzied enthusiasm".{{sfn|White|2016|p=458}} In his letter of acceptance, Grant concluded with "Let us have peace", which became his campaign slogan.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=264–267}} For vice president, the delegates nominated House Speaker [[Schuyler Colfax]]. In June, Grant traveled to St. Louis, having gained possession of his father-in-law's plantation, and an additional 280 acres of Dent land, he had twelve slave cabins demolished, to banish the vestiges of slavery.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=618}} As was common practice at the time, Grant remained at [[Ulysses S. Grant Home|home in Galena]] during the campaign, and left most of the active campaigning and speaking on his behalf to his campaign manager [[William E. Chandler]] and others.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=284}}

The Democrats nominated former New York Governor [[Horatio Seymour]]. Their campaign focused mainly on ending Reconstruction and returning control of the South to the white planter class, which alienated many [[War Democrats]] in the North.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=468–469}} The Democrats attacked Republicans' support of African American rights while deriding Grant, calling him captain of the "Black Marines".{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=278, 283}} Democratic orators over and over proclaimed Grant was a drunkard. Grant himself did not take to the stump, allowing Republican spokesmen to identify him with patriotism and with grief for Lincoln's martyrdom.{{sfn|Snodgrass|2015|p=231}}

Grant's 1862 [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|General Order No. 11]] and antisemitism became an issue during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1868|presidential campaign]]. In a letter, published after the election, Grant sought to unequivocally distance himself from General Order No. 11. Grant repudiated his order, saying "I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit." {{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=459–460}} {{efn|As President, Grant would atone for 1862's expulsion of the Jews. Historian [[Jonathan Sarna]] argues that Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history, meeting with them often and appointing them to high office. He was the first president to condemn atrocities against Jews in Europe, thus putting human rights on the American diplomatic agenda.{{sfn|Sarna|2012a|pp=xi, 88–90, 101–103}}}} As was expected at the time, Grant returned to [[Ulysses S. Grant Home|his home]] state{{efn|Residents of Galena gave Grant the home in 1865 as thanks for his war service.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;[http://www.granthome.com/grant_home.htm Grant Home], Galena State Historic Sites. Retrieved February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After his presidential term ended in 1877, Grant visited the home occasionally. Maintenance of the home as a memorial to Grant started in 1904 and continues today.&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=211&amp;ResourceType=Building Ulysses S.

Retrieved February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and left the active campaigning to his campaign manager, [[William E. Chandler]], and others.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=282–284|White|2016|2p=463}} The Republican campaign focused on continuing Reconstruction and restoring the public credit.{{sfn|Foner|2014|pp=340, 344}} 

Grant won the election by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, at the age of 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was a triumph of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=461}} When he assumed the presidency, Grant had never before held elected office and, at the age of 46, was the youngest person yet elected president. Grant was the first president to be elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=284}} Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence against African American voters.{{sfn|Foner|2014|pp=243–244}}
